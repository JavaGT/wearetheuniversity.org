being the vice chancellor<br>here at the University of Otago and I am<br>delighted to welcome each and every one<br>of you to this inaugural professorial<br>lecture for professor John Reynolds as<br>usual when I look out on the audience I<br>see both staff and students from the<br>University of Otago and I also see<br>members of the Dunedin public who very<br>rightly used these inaugural<br>professorial lectures as a way of<br>continuing their own lifelong learning<br>opportunities I'd also like to extend a<br>particularly warm welcome to the members<br>of John's family who have been here or<br>who have come here this evening to share<br>in this celebration I'd like to<br>acknowledge his wife Jane his sons<br>Daniel and Fraser his daughter Eva his<br>mother and father-in-law Rosemarie and<br>Maurice his sister and brother-in-law<br>Irene and Kevin who have flown in from<br>Wellington a number of other family<br>members and friends have also journeyed<br>to be here<br>Lloyd and shaumyan Peter and Ann from<br>Christchurch and Adrienne and Chris from<br>Gor on behalf of the University of Otago<br>I wouldn't very pleased to welcome all<br>of you to this event and I'm sure that<br>your presence here this evening will<br>make the evening even more special for<br>John now those of you who attend these<br>IPL's regularly will know that achieving<br>the rank of Professor is not an easy<br>task the university sets extremely high<br>expectations for candidates for this<br>position<br>and those who are successfully promoted<br>must have demonstrated excellence in<br>teaching in research and in service to<br>the university and the wider community<br>professor Reynolds certainly has<br>demonstrated excellence in all three of<br>these categories john is undeniably an<br>outstanding and highly respected teacher<br>much of his motivation to be a good<br>teacher has come from his own<br>experiences a little while ago<br>as a medical student his desire to<br>become the kind of teacher that inspired<br>him while he was studying has been<br>richly rewarded with the National<br>Teaching Award John also has an<br>international reputation for research<br>he's a recognized authority on synaptic<br>transmission and neural plasticity and<br>his papers are often published in highly<br>ranking journals including Nature the<br>Journal of Neuroscience and the Journal<br>of physiology now in addition to all of<br>this John also has a service record that<br>is second to none over the years he has<br>served on a number of high-level service<br>roles here at Otago and most recently he<br>has accepted the challenge of being the<br>director of Health Sciences first year<br>where he has spent the most of this year<br>helping us work our way through some<br>extremely important changes to our<br>curriculum now this has not been an easy<br>task<br>but it's been an extremely important and<br>fruitful one I personally have really<br>enjoyed working with John and I have<br>come to value not only his very high IQ<br>but also his very high EQ as well so<br>John on behalf of the University of<br>Otago I would like to warmly<br>congratulate you on your well earned<br>promotion to the rank a professor and<br>before we invite professor Reynolds to<br>give his inaugural professorial lecture<br>I will first call on professor Vernon<br>ward who is the Dean of the school of<br>biomedical sciences who will tell us<br>just a little bit more about John's<br>academic FACA Poppa<br>noreda 10 okoto 10 okoto tenet<br>Katara Thank You Vice Chancellor tena<br>koutou katoa me new ETA Kyoto welcome<br>everybody it's great to see everybody<br>here what a great turnout of anatomist<br>and neuroscientists and all sorts<br>sitting out there staring at me I have<br>the pleasure of introducing professor<br>Reynolds to you this evening and it is<br>very much a privilege that I get to do<br>this and it is a pleasure because I get<br>to look at people's backgrounds and I<br>get to see some of what they've done and<br>I get to present that to you<br>I hope always that it makes them<br>slightly nervous that I'm doing this it<br>may ingest you to know that for the<br>first 10 years of his working life John<br>was an electronics technician he made it<br>very clear that's not an electrician<br>it's an electronics technician and<br>you'll see some of that this evening<br>he gained at NC indeed seee and<br>electronics along the way and then there<br>was in his record of where he worked<br>there's this gap of about five or six<br>years which the Vice Chancellor has<br>alluded to already because he suddenly<br>appeared with an MB CHB from otago in<br>1994 and was a resident medical officer<br>and fire a he then headed off down a<br>research path before getting a PhD<br>there's not that many that have gone<br>through that particular path and I think<br>he speaker and graduated on that it's<br>not an easy one<br>so he's ended up with both a medical<br>degree and a PhD and separate students<br>he became a senior lecturer here in 2005<br>an associate professor in 2011 and a<br>professor in 2017 so what are some of<br>the hallmarks of John's career that have<br>allowed that progression to happen well<br>if you look at the last 10 years he's<br>brought in over 12 million dollars worth<br>of external research income and he's<br>been a principal investigator on funding<br>from<br>mbae the brain research new zealand<br>center of research excellence the<br>neurological foundation health research<br>council marsden fund it's been a rather<br>for discovery fellow and he's on many<br>other grants that he hasn't been the PAI<br>on he's won multiple early career<br>research awards he's published 56<br>refereed journal articles and has<br>already mentioned nature and age<br>communications during our neuroscience<br>trends and neuroscience and all the<br>places that we'd like to see ourselves<br>published in is already mentioned he's<br>an excellent<br>teacher I'm sort of skating them out<br>here because there's a chance that the<br>person who awarded them is or presented<br>them with his national Teaching Award<br>okay Aurora's here I can't quite see it<br>that was in 2008 and in case you're not<br>aware we are we're because my son's just<br>mentioned it to you but that director of<br>health science first year is a major<br>leadership role that he's taking on in<br>university it's not easy it's a<br>challenging role and it's case you went<br>to where it's a point six FTE so that's<br>more than half time doing that job he's<br>an excellent commitment to science<br>leadership he's been a member of the<br>otago ozone group a member of the<br>directors Directorate of the New Zealand<br>Brain Research Centre of research<br>excellence he's on the science<br>management group that put together the<br>successful national science challenge<br>for the aging well proposal and he's the<br>incoming president of the International<br>basal ganglia Society a lot of<br>leadership there and he wouldn't have a<br>teaching award unless he could<br>communicate and some of the things that<br>he's done in the last few years he's<br>recently interviewed by Nigel later for<br>some episodes of the curious mind the<br>ODT New Zealand Herald radio New Zealand<br>Scientific American Channel nine ABC<br>radio science and I'm sure the absolute<br>highlight of his communication career<br>was being interviewed by Paul Henry on<br>TV three so as a very broad set of<br>contributions across that academic<br>spectrum that we expect of our<br>professors and John has shown that<br>immensely so you've heard enough for me<br>you get to hear the pleasure of<br>Professor Reynolds and as an oral<br>professorial lecture you can see the<br>total behind you teaching an old brain<br>new tricks what you're going to see from<br>John today is pathway through medicine<br>to neuroscience to translational<br>neuroscience what is going to present<br>you is that pathway of that basic<br>fundamental understanding of brain<br>reinforcement and he's going to follow<br>that through to how you develop<br>treatments for Parkinson's disease and<br>how an accidental discoveries made along<br>the way is starting to be used to apply<br>to people with stroke so I now invite<br>professor Reynolds to present as an oral<br>prophecy of lecture thank you<br>let me take this along each receive<br>antenna Cotto Couture koti

later so i seen here<br>absolutely honored to receive this<br>recognition from my work at university<br>of otago over the last 20 years it<br>sounds like a long time before I really<br>get into the theme of the talk which is<br>teaching an old brain new tricks as<br>you'll see up there I want to start off<br>with some things in case I run out of<br>time at the end and I think them to do<br>it<br>firstly I want to acknowledge really my<br>wonderful sister Irene and brother and<br>will Kevin who are here travel from<br>Wellington and always come when it is<br>something for me it's very special<br>Peter name have come from Christchurch I<br>also want to acknowledge my extended<br>family on Smith's side who are here<br>especially my mother-in-law and friend<br>rosemary and who husband Morris I think<br>of mr. few people at every wonder there<br>so most importantly I'm really<br>incredibly indebted to these wonderful<br>people who refused to let all the work<br>and the crazy working hours get in the<br>way of the laughter heartfelt thanks to<br>my wonderful wife Jane and my amazing<br>children some of whom are no longer<br>children there it is good Daniel Fraser<br>and Eva finally thank you to you all for<br>coming here tonight and for helping me<br>celebrate this on a key order so I've<br>been asked to first talk a little bit<br>about my life journey and how it all<br>brought me to this point so here goes<br>so I was born in Hastings in Hawke's Bay<br>in 1963 so you can quickly do the maths<br>you'll get a wicket out Here I am with<br>my<br>my brother Clive and my mother Connie<br>and I was a little runt at the stage and<br>I think I took off to carretoni for a<br>few weeks after this<br>fast-forward a few years later and this<br>is my brother and I with my mum and dad<br>and when you see my brother and I for<br>some reason he's always standing on my<br>left hand side so if you see two wooly<br>people who Nix you he's always on your<br>right and I'm on the left but anyway so<br>my father Bob worked for the Power Board<br>and Hastings as a control operator and a<br>fetter and tuna and I really believed<br>that it was his input they definitely<br>spawned my interest in working with my<br>hands especially on electronics projects<br>my mother unfortunately became disabled<br>not so long after this photo was taken I<br>think that was probably a source of<br>quite some unhappiness and our family<br>subsequent to their time in hindsight it<br>may well also have been one of my<br>drivers to really gravitate towards the<br>healthcare profession enough of the said<br>things that sort of think of the things<br>that were good back then and I really<br>think anyone from Hawke's Bay here yeah<br>I guess the you gotta know they're two<br>very you have to have a coffee and<br>talked about that but really it's the<br>summers that Seahawks buy apart for me<br>to Ross I'm sorry to say it's lovely<br>here but so I spent a lot of summers so<br>here's me with my wooly hair as my<br>brother and his my cousins and you can<br>see a little bit like that - that's<br>actually Irene's son yeah and we spend a<br>lot of time fishing by the river there<br>and just hanging out and swimming in<br>that River than our Aurora which is<br>really my River I think but I actually<br>I've also indicated here in arrow and<br>that really isn't the spot there we're<br>where we had the best fishing that was<br>actually the spot that I lost one of my<br>nine lives so very short story here so I<br>was out there one day with my friend<br>Reese and his dad's car and he decided<br>to gun it along that that Bank has 17<br>year olds team to do and of course when<br>unfortunately what happened is he caused<br>some damage to the rear suspension of<br>his dad's classic Zephyr oops now<br>luckily there were other friends there<br>with cars there that day and although I<br>offered to go home with them and really<br>share the blame he said no you stay come<br>home with them and I think that was<br>probably a good thing to have done<br>because<br>must have been diamond damage to the<br>steering his car failed to negotiate a<br>bend on the way home and rolled down the<br>bank he was okay where I was sitting<br>the roof was flat so I may not have been<br>here talking to you if they did happen<br>so one of my nine lives down anyway<br>other than that I sort of remember the<br>summers and the bay very fondly so here<br>I am as of my will be here here so you'd<br>always wear your shorts and bare feet<br>there and off and nature here grow<br>wild and summer days back then are often<br>furnished with great degrees of pain<br>because I think we'd never hear the<br>sunblock I think we use number three<br>which we thought was you know pretty<br>it's a pretty wimpy and I think was like<br>water really but anyway so a year or two<br>after that picture up there was taken my<br>mother unfortunately passed away and<br>left the three of us to carry on through<br>life so as to how I got here in<br>career-wise even has to have a quotation<br>I'm not very big on quotations but I<br>found this one from American poet<br>novelist Don Williams jr. who wrote the<br>road of life twists and turns and no two<br>directions are ever the same yet our<br>lessons come from the journey not the<br>destination<br>I think that's absolutely what's<br>happened with me so the end of school I<br>wanted to go to Canterbury study<br>electronics that was what I wrote down<br>on my little form in the seventh film<br>and however I was advised that I<br>wouldn't be able to enter the<br>engineering intermediate because I<br>hadn't done chemistry I was told this by<br>the person who two years before had told<br>me to drop chemistry and do languages I<br>could still see the beads of sweat in<br>his face but anyway now I came from a<br>family really that we had no idea about<br>about going to school from University<br>University from school so we didn't<br>really know that it actually was very<br>possible the wonderful chemistry<br>department we have and in Christchurch<br>all around the country that you could<br>actually get up to a stage to get there<br>so effect I decided not to go down that<br>pathway and although I did she actually<br>managed to pick up chemistry nine years<br>later when I mean to me this medical<br>school but anyway so I decided excuse<br>the mustache three<br>but I would leave school instead it was<br>big in the 80s we all hidden started and<br>I study leave school and study<br>electronics and the industry because I<br>thought there would be a way that I<br>could eventually go into engineering<br>later turned out really the right<br>decision for me<br>Here I am on my 21st actually at work in<br>Palmerston North Hospital I think went<br>from there to become a technical manager<br>for a medical company in Wellington<br>where I was designing and servicing<br>medical equipment so I think that way<br>got me exposed to patients and medical<br>consultants of my work made some<br>fantastic friends very close friends and<br>the medical where nursing care<br>professions and started to get convinced<br>that maybe I could possibly go down and<br>do medicine so I gave up the working<br>life from the company car and came down<br>here Dunedin to do my medical<br>intermediates here's the medical class<br>you weren't really better see me in all<br>that so I've got an arrow there you can<br>see me over there and if you look very<br>carefully you might spot something else<br>that's rather interesting over this side<br>it's no three you see it's three very<br>important people over the left-hand side<br>there and then fast forward five years<br>later and we get to our graduating class<br>and there's me and the middle mother to<br>use the laser pointer but I'll do the<br>others there and if you look way over<br>the other side one of those nurses<br>graduated to get a straitjacket so here<br>we go and one of those nuns I graduated<br>against make it so I don't know if<br>that's a natural transition but that's<br>what happened so if I went to practice<br>medicine and fanger day and believe it<br>or not and all of the times I was there<br>that's the only photograph I had of me<br>being a doctor and it actually was me in<br>a quieter moment of which there were<br>very few helping out my nursing<br>colleagues now I noticed quite poignant<br>ly at the back that someone had written<br>something very nice fear one of the<br>nursing staff had done so that was quite<br>wonder what didn't know that so nice to<br>stop in the world will make a new set of<br>you yet which is kind of nice<br>now I remember quite sobering ly much of<br>that time and fun around the mid 90s is<br>an extremely busy extremely stressful<br>time<br>doctors doctoring was back then when we<br>as junior doctors were often left in<br>very unsafe circumstances that we should<br>never have been put on afraid that was<br>my exposure to<br>medicine really because I went into a<br>small Hospital so it was nice to read<br>that at least one group of people the<br>nurses did appreciate what I did when I<br>was there anyway so I spent two and a<br>half years in practice there and I chose<br>to be in the rehabilitation unit because<br>I really enjoyed working with people on<br>a journey to come back from a<br>neurological disorder or just just just<br>general things that can happen to us<br>when we get older and to get back on<br>their feet and I really valued that I<br>found a very positive and fascinating<br>area of medicine and but I'm also<br>fascinated by actually frustratingly how<br>little that modern medicine can actually<br>do for these people so the gains were<br>made from the market disciplinary work<br>of the physiotherapist the occupational<br>therapists the speech language<br>therapists social workers nursing staff<br>working with the people and their<br>families to be really you know I suppose<br>to be a little controversial the doctors<br>are really there to juggle the<br>medications and manage any side effects<br>or complications so so with the lack of<br>ongoing treatment options once the<br>person really has left the hospital when<br>the available community really akia one<br>could say that their bid was made and<br>they were forced to line it in terms of<br>coping with the extent of their<br>disability so really to be able to<br>improve the recovery of the brain in<br>these situations the realization for me<br>at those times we was that there's a<br>paucity of effective drugs that we have<br>that are able to cost this amazing<br>barrier that stops bad things getting<br>from the blood into the brain or the<br>blood-brain barrier it's wonderful<br>protecting us but it's bad for getting<br>things through for treating our brain<br>and also we understand very little and<br>we still need to understand a relatively<br>little about how the brain circuits<br>reorganize after injury so those are the<br>challenges that drove and stimulated my<br>science journey so after finishing up at<br>Fang today I can see one of the<br>gentlemen and their foes up the back<br>beer I came down to neden I got<br>convinced by a certain gentleman mr.<br>Brian Harland that I could come into a<br>couple years of research to a thing<br>called a PhD which I knew nothing about<br>being a medical okay it sounds right but<br>it's a long time and I was very lucky to<br>be supervised by these two gentlemen<br>Professor Brian Harlan for Physiology<br>and professor chief we can see is now a<br>knock<br>I'd actually discovered an interest in<br>neuroscience from a summer student ship<br>that I did with Brian and my medical<br>degree and I highly recommend to<br>students if you want to think about it<br>go do a summer students show up and see<br>if you like it I'm also extremely<br>indebted to the neurological foundation<br>in New Zealand who took a chance on a<br>doctor didn't know much about science<br>and gave me a chance to do a PhD so<br>thankfully get forward over many many<br>hours sitting in front of a rig and I<br>got a PhD and along the way I added<br>these two lovely children Daniel and<br>Fraser and who are the linking boys and<br>the audience that you might see later on<br>now this here is soon my first wife who<br>many of you will remember he sadly<br>passed away well before his time<br>so I'm indebted to her for her support<br>over those newly years so what was the<br>PhD about and how does it lead me to<br>what I'm researching now Daniel I'm<br>sorry I'm going to embarrass you this is<br>my son Daniel right now and this is<br>truly a photograph taken about two<br>months before I actually started it<br>showed up in Brian's lab and started<br>doing some work I didn't have anything I<br>do about this but this is really<br>exemplifies the whole sort of idea of<br>the dopamine system and learning so he's<br>about four months old he was<br>experiencing his first Christmas he was<br>lucky enough to get given by sir and I<br>this helium-filled thought the Christmas<br>balloon you learn what's one of those<br>don't name and he was fascinated by look<br>at his fascination so of course su and I<br>placed them in his Jolly Jumper and tied<br>the balloon to the jumper right in any<br>of you have had young babies than your<br>lives we'll know that babies do emit<br>these sort of random kind of movements<br>if you sit there and we were sort of<br>tune out back a little bit and we tuned<br>back and suddenly he's holding this<br>balloon like this and then he let it go<br>oh that's funny<br>and then he'd do it again and what we<br>would notice is that the time in between<br>those episodes of emigrating it got<br>shorter and shorter and shorter what<br>Daniel was brain was doing his basal<br>ganglia was doing was stamping out those<br>wasteful movements that do nothing and<br>stamping him the one thing<br>wanted to do which was to grab that<br>balloon that really was reward related<br>learning on online for us to see<br>so goal-directed learning if you like<br>January 1997 thank you to Daniel<br>Reynolds oh yes so he was demonstrating<br>to us two processes motivation you've<br>got a goal you're motivated to get it<br>you will direct your actions towards<br>there until you get it<br>it's called goal directed learning and<br>it's well known that both motivation and<br>goal directed learning both are<br>processes that use this neurochemical<br>called dopamine<br>so dopamine it's more than a pleasure<br>chemical it's manufactured in areas here<br>at the base of the brain and it's passed<br>on to areas in the front that are<br>involved in motivation and this area<br>here the basal ganglia for learning but<br>what we tend to think about on the<br>public is that dopamine's the heavy<br>chemical all right but actually is a<br>happy chemical if I gave you shot of<br>dopamine now you can be very happy with<br>me maybe occasionally you are getting a<br>shot of dopamine or something comes to<br>you but it actually is a lot more than<br>that because dopamine the happiness can<br>go away even though you're getting<br>dopamine around and happens in drug<br>addiction<br>so really here's a little bit of the<br>science behind this thing first of all<br>there's a system there in the front of<br>the brain from IRRI called the VTA where<br>the dopamine cells live that that really<br>helps you learn the value of a stimulus<br>because you don't know it's to minister<br>thing in the environment I don't know if<br>that signs good when I first see it<br>because it means something important<br>that might mean get the heck out of here<br>in a hurry so you need to actually<br>understand what stimuli really mean in<br>terms of the actions that they drive and<br>and for this for for Daniel<br>it was bright floaty things are cool go<br>get it tiger<br>right that was what that motivational<br>thing was doing I was throwing dopamine<br>to his frontal areas and he just had to<br>work out what they had to do to go and<br>grab that there's another as many areas<br>of dopamine dopamine cells love but this<br>particular one we were on mostly knows<br>about us a substantial Niagra which<br>projects forward into the striatum here<br>and that's really learning what do I<br>need to do to get that student<br>so the first thing is it's a stimulus<br>it's a balloon it's cool I got to go and<br>get it the second thing is what thing do<br>I have to do to get it successfully and<br>that's what the dopamine so system is<br>trying to solve all the time and I so<br>grab his in this case it was grabbed a<br>string the right way we get how to grab<br>it so that I can have that thing sitting<br>up close to me I stopped talking about<br>you know diamond now together obviously<br>the systems and the brain are much more<br>complex so I'd like you to learn this if<br>your mind and will ask you some<br>questions about it later that's just to<br>show you how incredibly complex the<br>system is okay and lots of neuro<br>chemicals in there I'm not gonna do that<br>I'm gonna give you I found actually on a<br>popular blog actually a very simple<br>system to understand it so well done<br>this person for understanding it and<br>really if you think about it is this<br>sort of flowchart here we have an intent<br>to do a behavior all right that's the<br>thing that drives us to do goal to reach<br>it it could be come to work to win some<br>money okay doing managed or don't you<br>see we rich<br>and then and then you emit a behavior<br>you emit a behavior towards their goal<br>if you get it right you get a big<br>dopamine pulse and what that dopamine<br>pulse does is it does it makes you feel<br>good I'm proud of myself I've got the<br>balloon and you want to repeat it<br>actually the circuit goes round and<br>round and round because after a while<br>you get better and better at it you<br>successfully do the behavior you get<br>some dopamine released you want to do it<br>again and it goes around but actually<br>after a while you lose the pleasure side<br>of things and it becomes a habit which<br>is fine can you imagine if all of the<br>time you had to think about what you had<br>to do to end something you had to<br>constantly think I got to get out of the<br>chair right so I think I'd do it this<br>way right okay that's right and that's<br>fine people with Parkinson's their habit<br>systems are impaired and they are<br>constantly in this goal-directed mode so<br>you can imagine with people with<br>Parkinson's how tiring this can be<br>because you're constantly in this<br>goal-directed mode and another analogy<br>really or another thought application is<br>in drug addiction where this suddenly<br>you still get your dopamine released on<br>the brain because the drugs will drive<br>the dopamine releases the way it works<br>but actually you lose the feeling would<br>and it<br>becomes the absolute need to take drugs<br>it becomes just as something that<br>becomes your total motivation is to do<br>everything you can to take drugs and<br>it's not as for a pleasurable experience<br>so that process there of getting some<br>dopamine and doing the thing again we<br>call reinforcement and you know about<br>positive reinforcement set to the dog<br>the dog set something you give them both<br>the food the timing is obviously<br>inherently important if you give them<br>the food and then say set what do they<br>do negative reinforcement is really<br>actually trying to is learning to do<br>something to stop a stimulus from<br>happening so it could be learning too<br>that if you don't go and do your study<br>frozen Rennels that your father will<br>emit a behavior where he tells you that<br>you need to get in there and do it so<br>you do your study right and then that's<br>actually it becomes a negative<br>reinforcer because you believe what you<br>need to do to stop the terrible thing of<br>the father yelling at you so my PhD<br>really was a very simple thing haha what<br>happens in the brain during<br>reinforcement so it really influences<br>the formation of movement memories in<br>this area which I've caught that we<br>talked about called the striatum this is<br>an MRI taken this way and if you were to<br>put a a slice down here and go Corona Li<br>for your Natomas that are here and look<br>on to a slice here which actually came<br>from the anatomy museum you can see<br>these structures that we're talking<br>about the cerebral cortex is this<br>wonderful area around the outside where<br>we learn to love to think to reason have<br>memory enjoy music everything that we<br>can do as higher mammals is really in<br>our cortex but we have this area here<br>which is also in the crocodile which is<br>an area which is an area really that's<br>focused on trying to learn what you need<br>to do to achieve things and that's the<br>striatum and the dopamine cells live<br>down on the mat brain and they release<br>their dopamine into this area so my task<br>was to have a look in here and have a<br>look and see what happens at the<br>cellular level so if we take a little<br>spot here and we blow it up<br>then you'll see one of these neurons<br>that became my friends over many many<br>nights and some of my students since<br>they're - because you have to sit there<br>and try and record from these things<br>inside these cells for many hours and<br>record what happens on their activity as<br>it's called a spiny neuron because<br>there's all these little tiny things<br>called spines and bid it over at about<br>10,000 to 100,000 of these if you blow<br>one of those up you can see one of these<br>spines and this spine is an area where<br>that the cortex projects on to these<br>cells right that's weird a synapse is<br>loved so if you were to do it<br>diagrammatically that's a synapse<br>between the neuron and the cortex and<br>the spiny neuron right there and what I<br>would do is I would test it so an optic<br>function I would test how strong these<br>synapses are by putting an electrode in<br>here and then trying to measure the<br>strength of that synapse and what we<br>know very well is that memories are<br>stored through changes in the strength<br>of those synapses and that's known<br>throughout the brain this occurs the<br>rules are different of different brain<br>areas Australia and it's got dopamine<br>which adds another layer but so what to<br>measure this we've put an electrode and<br>here we'd be recording inside the cell<br>electrode here turn on this with a bit<br>of a little current and you see this<br>response that occurs here all right I'll<br>do that again you see a sort of a<br>response that you can record on a<br>machine and we would do that over and<br>over again I would do that over and over<br>again and then what I would do is apply<br>a certain heading of stimulation<br>behavior so maybe a burst of stimulation<br>and then go back and repeat it again and<br>what they will do is it will modulate<br>the strength of those sinuses up or down<br>or may do nothing depending on where we<br>are now that's a classical paradigm<br>where one measures what we call synaptic<br>plasticity the ability the synapse is in<br>the brain to change their strength after<br>a certain pattern of activity it turns<br>out that it's not like the hippocampus<br>Suze hippocampus people it's quite<br>different because dopamine makes things<br>even an added layer of difficulty so it<br>changes the memory forming process so in<br>fact dopamine can make with the same<br>pattern in activity can make the<br>synapses stronger or it can make them<br>weaker depending on which way you hold<br>your head so my job was to try and work<br>out to a degree in a whole and a whole<br>living brain what the rules were the<br>plasticity<br>so how does dopamine decide the<br>direction of change when it's simply<br>there and it's going to change the<br>activity of the input and the output so<br>and it's summarized about 15 years of<br>work Brian maybe three easy steps to<br>understand how dopamine works the<br>reinforcement I've called it the hell<br>what in wind principle right first of<br>all how to dopamine cell signal and an<br>important event this is work and Brian's<br>lab where where Brian's people could<br>record from individual dopamine cells<br>and animals that can move around and you<br>can watch them moving around and you see<br>when they get engaged in various<br>activities things that might be good for<br>them for example and cut a long story<br>very short they far along like a bad<br>clock these cells but every so often<br>there are these bursts these fast rapid<br>fire and bursts that we know when you<br>record the release of dopamine causes<br>great big super added pulse of dopamine<br>and those bursts really when you look at<br>that what's happening to the animal at<br>the time most bursts fire they don't<br>even sells five bits in response to<br>important events might of course if you<br>eat a jump you'd have a nice big boost<br>of dopamine right then I did it over and<br>over again every five seconds apart from<br>being really annoying your dopamine<br>sells out after a while with just a bit<br>you actually say well that's not really<br>important I have to wait till something<br>important happens after that<br>so stimuli that are important in the<br>environment will cause dopamine cells to<br>fire bursts so then with jiff we wanted<br>to know what do those boosts do to the<br>synapses and the way we did this was<br>actually apply the boost back to the<br>animal and swatched their behavior<br>effectively and animals will happily<br>self administer these boosts for as long<br>as you want to let them do it because<br>it's very rewarding so we knew the<br>characteristics of that but what I was<br>trying to do was to record the strength<br>the synapses in the brain while those<br>boosts were arriving and again to cut a<br>long story short<br>dopamine bear strength and movement<br>related finances in Australia and we<br>found sort of that you know dopamine<br>Bears will come along and you'd make the<br>synapses stronger which would tend to<br>make you want to do the behavior to<br>arrive to keep the bursts to occur again<br>there's really what we found out but we<br>had no idea of the timing then and<br>actually fast forward actually only to<br>even this year with published<br>so I'm still being interested in it and<br>I have a wonderful had a wonderful PhD<br>student how dr. Simon Fischer who did<br>all these recordings and I take my head<br>off with people in my lab that sit there<br>for many hours doing these recordings<br>because you have to have a lot of<br>stamina and he really worked out with my<br>collaborators here including cliff<br>Abraham from Otago we really worked out<br>the timing of how this all has to be<br>here's the circuit again so so Simon<br>worked out the timing of how then the<br>neuron from the cortex when it has to<br>fire when the cell in Australia and has<br>to fire and that when those two go<br>together there is this thing which is<br>called an activity trace or an<br>eligibility trace if you like it really<br>says oh I've had something important<br>headsman it's made me fire now I've got<br>some time and I'm waiting for this thing<br>to result in a reward and if the reward<br>doesn't come in their time then it's not<br>that important to me and don't reinforce<br>it so what we found was if this case<br>there's no outcome those strengths<br>ensign Epps's will be weakened but when<br>he applied a dopamine pulse within two<br>seconds of that of their input coming<br>then that's it to us strengthen the<br>synapses so it really is like a timing<br>circuit saying what something Goods<br>happened if it results in something in a<br>dopamine pulse then I must have caused<br>there to hit them so I moved there I<br>grabbed this I got this that means that<br>I have caused it and you need to<br>reinforce that and that that was<br>published so sheer telling us that<br>dopamine selects which limits us to<br>strengthen by targeting those that are<br>active within a critical timing period<br>so that's all good<br>I can't get away from this desire this<br>love of thinking about doing things that<br>could help people with neurological<br>disorders and really we tried to look<br>beyond this to the implications for the<br>aging brain and Parkinson's disease now<br>Parkinson's disease is a disorder and an<br>age-related disorder where these<br>dopamine cells for really in reason<br>we're not too sure about they died off<br>and they died off quicker than neurons<br>might be lost and those of us sitting<br>here without Parkinson's disease if you<br>take a slice through the brain stem and<br>look here this is not stained these are<br>sort of understand that this is that<br>what the normal<br>but brain looks like and because of this<br>neuro melanin you see the dopamine cells<br>here without staining whereas in<br>Parkinson's they've gone away and so<br>they've died away and when someone has<br>more than 70% loss of those neurons they<br>start showing their signs and symptoms<br>of Parkinson's now what happens as we<br>replace that that dopamine is lost by a<br>drug called l-dopa levodopa because you<br>can't give someone dopamine it doesn't<br>get in the brain blood-brain barrier<br>again right fit to makes them very sick<br>of anything so the drug l-dopa was a<br>wonder drug that came out of the fifties<br>and sixties<br>you've seen awakenings you'll know that<br>that Oliver Sacks was using this to<br>awaken people get so l-dopa gets in the<br>brain gets turned into dopamine only<br>surviving nerve terminals now I've told<br>you they're dying off so there's it so<br>when you first get Parkinson's you've<br>got 20 30 percent left you've got room<br>and reserve for dope for dopamine to be<br>created and but what happens as the<br>deterioration goes on these dopamine<br>cells are dying off l-dopa has a real<br>trouble trying to give you a nice stable<br>dopamine signal and in fact what happens<br>is you get these like long slow<br>fluctuations and dopamine levels from<br>l-dopa in the brain this happens over<br>hours and hours you know take the pill<br>of four or five times a day<br>and I was told a medical school that<br>what happens is you get side effects<br>from this to something the struggle<br>after four or five years hello from<br>medical school as a colleague of mine<br>has recognized four or five years that<br>was a dopamine post and just recognition<br>you know what now just lost myself<br>maggot so this I was told to make us<br>well this is why you get these terrible<br>side effects that a cure and here is<br>Michael J Fox exhibiting this one called<br>disc kinase yes now sense had surgery so<br>isn't that such a major problem but you<br>can see that he has this there's this<br>abnormal movements that he cannot<br>control it's a bit like the baby getting<br>the movements back the random movements<br>they come back and we think it's because<br>now we think it's because<br>dopamine's actually been too high for<br>too long over the day and it's<br>reinforcing movements that aren't useful<br>for you that's what we think is<br>going on because the reason we think<br>that is actually when you look at how<br>dopamine cells act as fire normally as<br>Brian's work shows that really those<br>bursts that occur are only a matter of<br>seconds all right so they're only going<br>for a matter of seconds and we have this<br>great big fluctuation that goes on for<br>hours so our our aim as a team our to<br>but show the team in a second was to<br>really see if we could emulate there's<br>natural changes in dopamine and I'm the<br>very short sickens times go and you<br>can't do that with a pill obviously but<br>here's part of the team of teams changed<br>many times as people come and go but<br>this is a really important project that<br>in be of funding and the thing that's<br>important about it is it includes some<br>very clever people who are chemists and<br>I particularly want to acknowledge my<br>colleague being 10 partner-in-crime I<br>could say a number of others that are<br>here too so we have chemists biologists<br>we have people from Otago innovation<br>limited limited we have research and<br>enterprise office and we have people an<br>industry we're all working together that<br>are try and and see if we can emulate<br>this this this problem really to try and<br>replace dopamine in a normal way how<br>might we do it well we try to limit the<br>timing of the burst scene and natural<br>reinforcement and what we're doing is<br>you can imagine this is this is a<br>biological package called a lip as I'm a<br>little tiny thing about 200 nanometers<br>across and the clever chemists can<br>package and they're certain chemicals<br>and what we've done what they've done<br>has made them sensitive to a remote<br>trigger that we can apply a trigger<br>diagrammatically along the timing that<br>you see in these natural bursts and that<br>we will use that to deform the liposome<br>and release the neurochemical so the<br>brain sees the chemical coming under<br>certain timing that looks natural that<br>is the aim and the control signal that<br>we use here are the lipid zones the<br>control signals we use as ultrasound and<br>what these guys have done is put a gold<br>nanoparticle attached to the Lipper zone<br>we affectionately call it the bling is<br>over<br>you always liked that name grunting body<br>seemed to like it once to veneer and go<br>down a particle and here's a picture of<br>one that Shawn over there took under the<br>e/m you can see those little hollow gold<br>nanoparticles the ultrasound deforms if<br>you like changes this gold nanoparticle<br>relations and a different relationship<br>to the leper zone and releases the neuro<br>chemicals and we've done proof of<br>concept that shows that we can actually<br>measure over a second a second timescale<br>and this is Justine and Brian have done<br>and the lab have actually measured the<br>changes in in in dopamine like agonist<br>and the drug over secant so we can do it<br>now we're working forward to really<br>translated into a model that could go<br>into humans right and that's maybe what<br>it might look like looking slightly<br>better than that one day but I think<br>ideally it would be a little transducer<br>that sits underneath the scalp doesn't<br>go inside the skull because it becomes<br>more invasive and somebody would take<br>you have an intravenous dose of these<br>Lipper's ohms that will float around for<br>a few days and this thing will turn on<br>when we need it to heat them that's<br>where we're going so our aim really is<br>to restore a normal brain plasticity and<br>the aged Parkinson's brain to reverse<br>these loon side effects that have<br>occurred and restore normal movement<br>meaning that's what we'd really like to<br>do if we could get people who have got<br>these dyskinesias and reversible for<br>them because there's nothing can be done<br>now if we can actually reverse it by<br>normalizing their dopamine cells firing<br>I don't mean release firing and give<br>them good / 0 through P to stamp out<br>those movements just like Daniel in to<br>grab the balloon then we could really<br>make a difference in people's lives so<br>this is something we ask every day are<br>we ever too old to learn and we took<br>early too old to learn we used to think<br>that we just lost loads and loads of<br>cells as we got older and older we do<br>those cells as we get older but there<br>are things that you can do to slow this<br>process down and with it becoming very<br>popular to talk about this now and I'm<br>gonna give you some quick thoughts about<br>brain aging actually normal brain aging<br>is not my experience wonderful brain<br>research in Zeeland<br>seem to have research nixon's across the<br>country we're loads of people to put in<br>their brains together to try and come up<br>with the solution for this but as we age<br>we do know from a neuro psychology<br>literature that our ability to acquire<br>new information and apply luned<br>information gets not so good as we get<br>older we all know that we could tell<br>that without mean telling you showing<br>you a graph you can see here a graph at<br>speed of processing working and<br>long-term memory and reasoning to us<br>deteriorate but interestingly enough<br>people will say ah I can't Ramona's not<br>as good it is actually knowledge in fact<br>if anything gets better doesn't it which<br>is kind of interesting so your your idea<br>about your intelligence and your idea<br>about the world really does stay in fact<br>still gets better with age so it's<br>obviously a real focus that we need to<br>slow down this cognitive aging and the<br>outside of society is sort of saying<br>this that we can delay Alzheimer's<br>disease onset by five years that will<br>reduce the incidence in the world by 50%<br>that's a phenomenal aim as well a lots<br>of people are aiming to do now really in<br>terms of normal cognitive aging if you<br>like or aging that's called fitting our<br>cognitive abilities we need to build up<br>a reserve as we age this has become very<br>popular thought cognitive reserve to<br>provide a pool of resources that we can<br>draw on now it turns out that the think<br>sort of things you might want to do if<br>you've come along thinking I'll give you<br>some information really it's not hard to<br>work it out but the sort of thing that<br>you're doing right now is the kind of<br>thing you need to do stay engaged with<br>people stay engaged with education<br>literacy come along and do things and<br>get yourself engaged and with people<br>there are there are programs like senior<br>chef and say go that are run by Age<br>Concern<br>that people can get evolved and involved<br>in and know other people and that's the<br>kind of thing that even as you're age<br>will build up your cognitive reserve so<br>you've got more capacity there to fight<br>this decline that goes on but there<br>really is evidence for the older brain<br>has considerable plasticity we say we<br>can't learn so well but there is real<br>evidence that we've got considerable<br>plasticity for example as you age when<br>you do put someone on a scanner and get<br>into a cognitive task so you get<br>activation across both sides of the<br>brain now what is that is that<br>abnormals that compensation i don't know<br>but the factors that areas are brain<br>that weren't involved in the task before<br>now are so there must be passively<br>capability in the brain and the area we<br>really find this isn't stroke if you<br>know someone who's had a stroke and most<br>of us will that you can recover an<br>incredible function you can lose your<br>speech with a stroke and we have a<br>almost normal speech two years later was<br>really good therapy it is very possible<br>that brain is capable of doing it matter<br>whole how old we are so you don't lose<br>the ability to learn it just takes more<br>work less exercise good diet sleep when<br>I look at my wife cuz she on my live<br>because they'll all know that's not a<br>thing I subscribe to very well but<br>anyway we don't expect you to do things<br>like this but you do have the<br>capabilities of doing it if you stay<br>engaged they have been enhancing place<br>to severe in the brain a bit about you<br>know wonder when there are drugs that<br>you can take all the tools that you can<br>take that will enhance your cognitive<br>abilities but I think the upshot is and<br>I should really look at the<br>neuropsychologist here is that you've<br>got to look at the studies very<br>carefully and if you hear about them and<br>you see them in the popular press take<br>your study along to a neuropsychologist<br>see the experts and get them to<br>evaluator because usually you'll find<br>the science is not good the control has<br>not got a good control group the<br>endpoints have not been appropriately<br>decided the the timescale is not enough<br>there are very few of these I think<br>they're very convincing but I think<br>their arm<br>science is getting done better and<br>better so the sort of things that I want<br>to talk about in terms really briefly at<br>the end here about enhancing plasticity<br>in the brain there's a neuromodulation<br>now this the reason I bring this up is<br>that there are things that you can get<br>done as a normal person if you like such<br>as transcranial magnetic stimulation if<br>you know it seemed to the way they use<br>these big coils they put out on the<br>outside of your head and they blast in<br>the way do these amazing things to your<br>brain and then measure your function<br>after the other one that's becoming a<br>little bit scary actually is<br>transcranial direct stimulation if you<br>go along to get current stimulus you go<br>on to the chemist you can buy one of<br>these units for a couple of hundred<br>dollars set it on the front and the back<br>of your brain and turn on the 9-volt<br>battery and run a current through your<br>brain<br>you can do this if you wish but can I<br>just tell you as a cellular neuroscience<br>that we'd have no idea what it does<br>sorry cognitive neuroscience anything<br>you know can argue with us and there are<br>lots there are studies that will give<br>you really good promise this is gonna<br>enhance your ability one of my PA which<br>is Bhd student Nedley presented last<br>year a wonderful paper because Natalie<br>loves mathematics and she thought she<br>did so what they've done is they've<br>taken people who are not good at<br>mathematics and those were very good at<br>mathematics and they've gotten to do<br>tDCS and TDC has actually made the weak<br>mathematicians better that it made the<br>good mathematicians list I love that<br>study it was brilliant ok so just be a<br>bit aware that we don't know what it<br>does it doesn't mean you shouldn't do a<br>therapy you don't know it does a lot of<br>clinicians will tell us here there are<br>drugs that we use that we really don't<br>know exactly the mechanism but they seem<br>to have worked some of the discoveries<br>that have been made but I'm gonna blast<br>my brain I'd like to know what it does<br>and then of course there is this deep<br>brain stimulation which is used for<br>Parkinson's disease it's not really a<br>place to sitting in Hansel but it's<br>designed to turn off areas of the brain<br>it will explain tactically for certain<br>people with Parkinson's but the one I<br>want to focus on is this extra dural<br>stimulation you have an implanted<br>stimulator that doesn't penetrate the<br>Juris on the outside but under the skull<br>and what they're how that could be used<br>to enhance function not necessarily in<br>normal people that's not the sort of<br>thing there's somebody's encouraging me<br>to dance ok right there's an ISIL<br>interlude it's not sort of thing you<br>would do as a not as though as a normal<br> hatch or cognitive function but<br>I want to show you how we've come to<br>start using this really and the first<br>thing is that we've done quite a lot of<br>work with transcranial magnetic<br>stimulation I don't know if John's in<br>the audience but John Schemmel my<br>colleague here has got us under TMS here<br>unfortunately sadly is leaving us in the<br>next few weeks which is very sad and<br>here's the risk there's a remainders of<br>people in my lab and some collaborators<br>we've tried to work out what does this<br>big magnetic field do inside the brain<br>of the synapses we're not there yet it's<br>very hard but what people will tell you<br>is that if you apply<br>certain kind of repetitive beer<br>stimulation and intermittent bursts are<br>your best and then you stop them in the<br>first or a continuous where you blast it<br>you can do opposite things you can make<br>brain brain excitability higher with<br>itvs or lower with CT PS there's a lot<br>of literature come out saying how<br>reliable and how good this is but then<br>you get the honest literature where they<br>take a series of 50 people and they run<br>them all through this and they give the<br>same paradigm which is supposed to make<br>things good<br>if you look here is the strength here up<br>and down here is the time and here is<br>what happens to a different individual<br>participants and if you like the average<br>there it does absolutely zilch oh<br>nothing okay now I think there is hope<br>for this if we can understand it there<br>is hope for using this kind of thing but<br>we need to understand how under what<br>circumstances to apply it and there's<br>some good work being done around the<br>country looking at what factors might be<br>predictors for a release of it but at<br>the moment the jury's out work we did<br>with with John actually we could find<br>that ITB stood increased things slightly<br>but we're talking about this line about<br>here it's not very much better than Sham<br>and now Natalie in my lab here has been<br>really trying to work what's happening<br>at the synaptic level and actually if<br>you look at her data what it really<br>shows that anything's that synapses get<br>weaker considerably weaker with their<br>ITBS when we're always told that<br>excitability would get better jury's out<br>we're still looking into it but what<br>about neuromodulation after stroke and<br>if you think about a brain here where<br>somebody has a stroke and what happens<br>is that normally you're before we have a<br>stroke in a normal brain one side of the<br>of the brain tends to counterbalance the<br>excitation on the other side through<br>inhibitory connections between the two<br>of them so we all know that this side of<br>the brain controls that must give up to<br>predominantly so you can see that here<br>drawn by those crossed but also one side<br>of the brain<br>Teamster tonically inhibit the other so<br>things certain a nice balance of of<br>mutual and abyssion so when you want to<br>move you have to relieve and leave the<br>inhibition to enable you to do it very<br>simplified way of looking at<br>but in a stroke this does get a little<br>bit vamped up in the wrong way because<br>you lose this ability to record no you<br>move your muscle as you know but you<br>also lose this inhibition and the<br>inhibition means that the side on the<br>other side becomes hyper excitable<br>because it's being the least inhibited<br>when it becomes hyper excitable what it<br>does is it tends to over and about those<br>areas around the brain that you really<br>want to take over the loss function<br>alright so rehabilitations weird to do<br>this hot variant theory thing to find<br>areas of the brain that will take over<br>loss function but if it's being told to<br>shut up all the time it's making it much<br>harder for it so increase in aggression<br>hampers stroke recovery so this has lead<br>onto it to some research that wasn't<br>done in my lab with these wonderful<br>people here particularly Martin Origen<br>Alyssa and Nora who did their PhDs with<br>me and in my colleague list of my<br>colleagues some of them are here where<br>we looked at using implanted electrical<br>stimulation to improve stroke recovery<br>we use implanted because we could use<br>the low intensity that we thought would<br>be more focal there wouldn't be a<br>general activation of all of the cells<br>I think TMS doesn't work because it just<br>activates all the exciter Chenal<br>inhibitory together and basically the<br>overall result is very little so by<br>putting an electrode actually on the<br>surface there and using low intensity<br>and using this peer stimulation<br>Melissa Barry in my lab actually<br>absolutely accidentally found this<br>finding one night and told me the next<br>day that she could actually remove the<br>sin efficient so I'll show you that<br>again<br>she gave a burst stimulation and this<br>inhibition went down what will cure that<br>she could record from the cells and Wow<br>that's really interesting and I think<br>it's what we've done is we've actually<br>tuned down the synapses the the<br>inhibitory synapses from this side to<br>that side if you want to know the truth<br>very hard to know exactly the mechanism<br>Laura and Jason and others have taken us<br>further on and actually looked at what<br>happens to rats when we have these have<br>the stimulation and and we find that<br>rats that have had a stroke this is<br>percentage recovery this and<br>hopelessness and this intermittent<br>thetaba stimulation gives them great<br>recovery and what's very important for<br>the next slide<br>is that look at their variability it<br>gets much less when you use this<br>particular kind of of stimulation<br>because the ones that were the worst of<br>function got so much better and that's<br>really important to think of for the<br>next thing because there isn't a lot for<br>people who are pretty severely affected<br>with stroke most Mike wonderful<br>colleague up in the corner my colleagues<br>actually Lee Hale and in professor dick<br>de Ridder so we wanted to apply this we<br>wanted to translate this and it just so<br>happened that I was very lucky to have a<br>conversation with Professor Duke de<br>Ridder<br>in Perth saying wouldn't it be great to<br>do best in Malaysian at that stage he's<br>the only one in the world that had the<br>ability to get stimulation companies to<br>do their stimulation the only one and<br>guess what he came to Dunedin I'm sorry<br>to reveal you but it's very important so<br>he's brought the ability to do boo<br>stimulation with these IP Jesus<br>implantable pulse generators to Dunedin<br>were the only ones in the world who can<br>do it yet for this application so we<br>wanted to try this we thought we'd give<br>it a go and we got some money from the<br>national science challenge myself John<br>share Molly how Nick cut filled here as<br>well and Duke and so what we've done and<br>we've run a feasibility and safety trial<br>we've already done two people so far<br>we've got results on one and what we're<br>doing is actually putting an electrode<br>on the top of the juror on the opposite<br>side to a stroke with someone who's<br>affected in their upper limb function<br>and the program that we do is that we<br>assist them at baseline at six weeks 12<br>and 24 for their upper limb function or<br>everyone who gets on the trials we've<br>had controls as well three controls<br>everyone gets rehabilitation which is<br>kind of cool because some of these<br>people have been to three years out<br>they've they've had their rehab and<br>they're kind of stuck with whatever<br>level of function they have so to have a<br>chance of intensive rehab that's it's<br>not for the squeamish because it's every<br>day for 12 weeks is welcomed by lots so<br>they do their rehabilitation we assist<br>them and then we assist them again<br>12 weeks after that programs finished<br>the people who are implanted we either<br>give them immediate start so they've got<br>the stimulator earn we're either start<br>that off immediately and combined with<br>rehab or we wait for six weeks and start<br>they don't know which group they're in<br>neither does the therapist assessing<br>them so the one participant we've had so<br>far we've got all the results for<br>was in the delayed start this is a<br>genome I was 58 years old and he had a<br>stroke here which if you know anything<br>about his MRIs you can see these white<br>areas he had a stroke around his<br>internal capsule basal ganglia so he was<br>impede with his upper limb function and<br>in fact he was much more impede than the<br>controls that we had and what we did is<br>assists him here in a system here he<br>didn't know he wasn't the stimulator<br>wasn't on if it he thought it was but<br>actually with him rehab did nothing<br>which was really quite surprising to us<br>because the controls did quite well and<br>we think it's because he was so so<br>impaired doesn't matter what these<br>things are the indices here of the<br>ability to activate muscles and here<br>really the the functional capabilities<br>but the important thing as this is a<br>scale up to 66 up here and he had a<br>number of 25 and after six weeks with<br>that with rehab he made no gains at all<br>but that's we turn the stimulator on we<br>carried on every day he came to the same<br>old thing what we would do is we'd<br>pretend the tennis team ever on for the<br>first six weeks and then we did it and<br>this is what he did now I've shown this<br>internationally I've shown this to rehab<br>specialists in a UT and everybody gates<br>that knows about the stuff and says this<br>can't be an accident<br>so something miraculous had happened to<br>this gentleman he's a very interesting<br>guy because he quite often would he<br>would wouldn't say to you I feel much<br>better but if it you knew he was feeling<br>better overall and then we turn it off<br>then we bring him back 12 weeks later an<br>effective loss function because he had<br>no sooner later on the fact is that it's<br>sitting in there it couldn't be turned<br>on it we had an approval to go he'd and<br>do it but it did still mean that he<br>could actually had a grip strength no<br>grip strength at all here 10 kilograms<br>after the start of it and he could still<br>grab eight kilograms after so we'd made<br>a functional difference if you can move<br>your hand and pick up a glass when you<br>couldn't before it's a huge game so<br>we're very pleased we have another<br>person going through the therapy now<br>said his surgery last week and things<br>are looking good<br>what have you got to look forward to a<br>nice wonderful neuromodulation<br>portable TMS you don't need our operated<br>a knows what they're doing you can buy<br>one of these and you still can do this<br>actually they actually started do some<br>clinical trials and yours<br>oh this on migraine and it does seem to<br>be in effect but you've got to carry<br>this giant coil around and go ah but it<br>does apparently if you've got<br>intractable migraines people that you<br>usually have you will know that it's<br>worthwhile to do it but very expensive<br>ultrasound I've talked about ultrasound<br>how we're going to put it on invasively<br>that people are trying to actually<br>activate instead of our lipid zone or<br>system brain cells directly with<br>ultrasound I say we have to be careful<br>about this and do very careful trials<br>cause you can fry your brain with it<br>this is an exciting area believe me we<br>will have some human advancement of us<br>in the next 10 years I believe for a<br>release we can nowadays do this with<br>with experimental animals that you put a<br>virus in there which carries a construct<br>that will go into specific types of<br>brain cells so one type of brain cell<br>and make them Express light-sensitive<br>proteins and you do is you put a fiber<br>in there that drives light those cells<br>will all activate with exactly whatever<br>you tell those cells to do just one cell<br>type so this can be done now and I<br>believe that the pathway is becoming<br>open for it to be done in humans and if<br>it makes a difference but<br>neuromodulation you bill do someone to<br>move then we need to look at it<br>carefully intelligent and planted<br>stimulation we can do this now with<br>epilepsy where you actually can record<br>from a part of the brain with the same<br>little stimulus that's on the top there<br>and when it detects the seizures coming<br>it'll turn on the stimulator<br>automatically and stop the person from<br>from having a seizure that can be done<br>now actually and I think it will become<br>more prominent and then there's all<br>crazy things like photo neuro I was at<br>neuro photobiomodulation which can be<br>people are thinking about if a cognitive<br>function that's kind of a fairly<br>exaggerated picture but we could be<br>looking at it seems like this in the<br>future but I'm going to maintain that we<br>need the cellular research to understand<br>the effects of the full range of<br>parameters of these because I wasn't got<br>this parameter space that's so wide and<br>possible we don't know where to start<br>so we need to be able to break it down<br>with some good research before we can<br>really get predictable benefit and I<br>think you'll see that my journey really<br>has been quite a happy marriage with<br>electronics neuroscience the medicine<br>all come together even though I was a<br>funny pathway to get there so I'm just<br>finishing with some thanks<br>now and I don't want to thank everybody<br>I can't thank everybody I'd be thinking<br>a whole lot of you here probably but I<br>just want to know him some specific or<br>show some specific people these are the<br>engine-room team these are the PhD<br>students the other people that you know<br>I've got 12 they're six women and six<br>mean so why haven't we got 50/50<br>representation and senior academic<br>positions of don't stop there<br>but anyway wonderful people that get you<br>up in the morning all of them have been<br>fantastic great junior to work with some<br>of them are said well I will go to the<br>lab and certainly for 15 hours trying to<br>record from a cell knowing that I'm<br>going to get one of these every three<br>weeks you know so they're pretty<br>incredible people and this is my lab in<br>general you can see we have fun I think<br>we'll of you'll spot yourself in there<br>some way if you can see some of you had<br>to be Photoshop done but they're they're<br>like over here but uh I've got good at<br>Photoshop but they they thank you all so<br>much<br>we've been fantastic and I really want<br>to acknowledge and one or two I'm sure<br>missing out here but really particularly<br>otago collaborators mentors friends ever<br>a nanny and this photo gallery or at<br>least two of those and some of them<br>along the way of become three so I think<br>you all very very much<br>and finally some really important people<br>the support staff of their departments<br>of anatomy and physiology I started my<br>life in the physiology Department and I<br>still see them all to say hi<br>surgical Sciences have become friends<br>we've worked hard with the work we've<br>done with Duke Health Sciences Division<br>office and my new friends with my new<br>job it's another story for another day<br>tygo medical school and the school of<br>biomedical sciences for support funding<br>agencies lots of them along the way<br>lots of lots of grants written though of<br>course that you don't get successful<br>research centers and very and last but<br>not least the students because the other<br>well Kira tato Kuro Jon it was that was<br>epically good typically good and I think<br>I could reflect on your scientific<br>achievements and the research that<br>you've presented and the translational<br>differences that you making with your<br>research but and I also hope that you<br>don't mean reward system is now kicking<br>into action in a very positive way<br>yeah I'm sure through sort of sitting<br>there too but your reward based centers<br>should be kicking into overdrive because<br>that was fantastic and I think you've<br>got the acknowledgement from the crowd<br>which is probably you could come up and<br>do it again now couldn't you but we<br>won't form a habit of that I I did I've<br>reinforced it and I've taken some notes<br>I mean my job is to thank you and I<br>think the applause is much of what I<br>wanted to say which is that was<br>wonderful but I want to focus actually<br>on something that's really important<br>because this is actually very special to<br>me because not only are you a member of<br>our department but you're also very good<br>friend and colleague and so it's kind of<br>nice to be able to acknowledge your<br>achievement over a journey that we've<br>shared for years now and one of the<br>things that distinguishes John from<br>pretty much most academics that I know<br>it's not that he is a superb into liquid<br>she is a great friend a great colleague<br>but his passion and John cares okay he<br>cares every level he cares about the<br>service to the University kids about<br>supporting the students and his research<br>laboratory cares about delivering a<br>great lecture to you and to me he cares<br>about giving that similar performance to<br>every undergraduate class that he gives<br>and that I think is as a mark of great<br>distinction so your professorship is<br>incredibly well deserved I know the work<br>that's gone into that but I hypothesize<br>to you though it's a byproduct of your<br>keyring and then it would have happened<br>anyway and now the trick is I think to<br>take the<br>step in your journey because<br>professorship is a fantastic achievement<br>but it's not what you set out to do I<br>would hazard a guess that what you've<br>set out to do is to change people's<br>lives by finding ways to remodel the<br>brain after injury and you know I<br>encourage you to continue to find that<br>dopamine reward based habit of finding<br>ways to take your research into a domain<br>that will change people's lives and I<br>know that that is a journey that you<br>will take because you've shared with us<br>how personal that is and I ignored it<br>anyway I could go on and have a<br>reputation for doing so but I shall cut<br>myself short and just ask you to join<br>with me and in up here and accept this<br>gift on behalf of the University which<br>will enable you to remember this<br>momentous occasion and also something<br>which will enable you to increase your<br>not your aging brains potential to to<br>remodel<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
