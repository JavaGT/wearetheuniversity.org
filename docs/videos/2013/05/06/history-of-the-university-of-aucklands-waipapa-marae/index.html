in the late 1960s<br>when our Vice Chancellor of the time<br>that was callin Maidan was over in the<br>United States and saw the disturbances<br>that were happening on the campuses<br>there because of the marginalization and<br>disenfranchisement of Native American fr<br>American and Hispanic communities<br>he realized immediately that he would<br>need to do something very quickly about<br>the marginalization of Marty so he came<br>back and asked several other professors<br>here at the time what should this<br>university do to better serve Marty<br>students and this was one of the things<br>that they recommended the Millea was<br>really a place where Maori would feel<br>safe on the university where there<br>wouldn't feel marginalized where they'd<br>feel that they were valued and that our<br>culture was valued but it was also a<br>physical statement of the fact that<br>Maori do actually exist in this country<br>and player variant important and<br>fundamental role the vice-chancellor<br>himself actually fought very very hard<br>to get this but he was stymied by<br>bureaucrats and Wellington the Ministry<br>whoever it was who was dealing with it<br>did not want to know what he was able to<br>get was the academic unit here that we<br>call D whote that's where the Maori<br>Studies department actually is housed so<br>what happened was this used to be a<br>carpark and where the meeting house is<br>now used to be the rugby shed there have<br>been a whole lot of money from parking<br>fees down here that had never ever been<br>spent and so the staff of the university<br>gave their parking fund so that we could<br>build this far a newie here<br>there was no brief has sat at the time<br>if the idea was there there was to be<br>two functions former I have teaching<br>space and the traditional my cultural<br>aspect of my own and the funny what it<br>claimed ivan was marvelous he knew that<br>he knew nothing about marty architecture<br>Bethenny I should meet Pino carefully he<br>may took Ivan on a tour of the East<br>Coast to introduce them to East Coast<br>meeting houses we went round with him<br>for three days presenting various<br>tomorrow and it was really quite an<br>educational experience me if you look at<br>the shape of the house and the the<br>psyche on the walls they're very very<br>short the walls but you've got a very<br>tall building in there and that is a<br>very traditional shape of a building the<br>architecture follows that sort of shape<br>the actual building of it was done under<br>the guidance of a whole lot of very<br>senior elders from throughout the north<br>what were most exciting things about<br>this that the cabins are all done<br>on-site<br>took a pic was done here a master carver<br>was Parker Dicky Harrison from the East<br>Coast from now cheap load the way that<br>pokey Harrison conceived this particular<br>for enemy was that it would contain all<br>the major figures within the Maori<br>knowledge system what the house does is<br>it depicts the oneness of the world that<br>we live in and the inside of that house<br>is a metaphor for the entire world<br>it's on one side you have a sequence of<br>for Cairo Dachau or moldy wood carvings<br>which show ancestors who lead migratory<br>walker or canoes to New Zealand and some<br>of those ancestors to include Pacifica<br>and sisters and<br>European ancestors on the other side of<br>the house we see a series of ancestors<br>who are founding ancestors so people who<br>are really important for founding a<br>tribal districts and in between you see<br>a number of very important ancestors and<br>very special parts of the house for<br>example the main columns that hold up<br>the supporting posts and particularly at<br>the back of the house to which represent<br>the cosmological ancestors the ancestors<br>that were part of Maori creation the<br>house is named after pan Anu Yara me who<br>is the principal deity for Mari<br>he is the one that is usually associated<br>with having care of the forests the<br>birds but he's also the deity that is<br>responsible for knowledge this house<br>actually depicts the physical form of<br>tanenuiarangi so the court who do the<br>the the carving at the top of the house<br>that is his head the may here are the<br>arms outside in those arms there are to<br>welcome everybody<br>the ridgepole on the top is his backbone<br>inside you will see that there are a<br>whole lot of we call in the ribs anyway<br>and you'll see on one side with the cool<br>fire fire they're blue and color<br>representing the sea and on the other<br>side they're green and color<br>representing the land so the whole house<br>represents a a physical landscape an<br>ancestral landscape the cosmological<br>lens landscape in a creative lens day so<br>if you go into that meeting house you<br>will actually see a history tradition<br>and the culture of Maori entirely<br>it is used practically every day of the<br>week including the weekends our classes<br>are taught here particularly those<br>involving the language and those<br>involving the traditions where we need<br>to use the house many of our students<br>have weddings in here and that's lovely<br>our university couple HUD groups<br>practice down here all the time for me<br>the most important meeting we that we<br>have on this model is our graduation<br>where the far know the extent of<br>families of the students come here and<br>celebrate the achievement I can pass it<br>quite often I like walking around the<br>place two aspects practice one is that<br>it works and relates well to the site<br>and I think this does I know this is<br>that like working in the spaces they've<br>got it's an amazing house it would be<br>one of the best in the country for<br>depicting Maori 'dom as a whole as we<br>continue to move towards more student<br>focused learning technologies and<br>presentation styles places like this<br>become important because we can use it<br>to almost demonstrate or be a visual a<br>cultural and conceptual resource for<br>explaining different sorts of knowledge<br>systems apart from just Western students<br>and staff of this university have<br>priority for the use of this model but<br>it must always be used as a my it is not<br>just a building that can be used for<br>whatever purpose it is I'm alone and we</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
