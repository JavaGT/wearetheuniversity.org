For more than 50 years the lab has been a place where marine science students and scientists are able to research in an undisturbed environment.<br> <br>Meet some of our young scientists at the Leigh Marine Lab, learn about their exciting research and its impact on the health of our oceans, and the success of our marine industries.<br> <br>If you would like to support the work of our young scientists at the Leigh Marine Laboratory please donate now: http://www.marine.auckland.ac.nz/donate</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically

scientists and<br>students<br>based at the university of auckland's<br>lee marine laboratory<br>established more than 50 years ago the<br>lab looks out over one of the world's<br>first ever marine reserves cape rodney<br>to okakari point or goat island<br>it's here that students and scientists<br>are able to research<br>in an undisturbed environment the place<br>in which both the natural world<br>and the scientists work are protected<br>from human interference<br>hi i'm dr jenny stanley my research<br>based up at lee is on the spiny rock<br>lobsters<br>i want to establish if changes in reef<br>habitats<br>from kelp forest to urchin barren<br>affects the lava settlement<br>survival and subsequent size of spiny<br>lobster populations<br>did you know the number of lobsters here<br>at the lee marine reserve<br>has increased 11 times the average<br>weight of lobster<br>has almost doubled in the last 28 years<br>and that baby lobster<br>are enticed acetyl by the underwater<br>sound created by kelp forests<br>hi i'm david zadzoro i'm italiano and i<br>love a good kiwi mussel<br>what i don't like is these little<br>barnacles which attach themselves to the<br>green shell muscle<br>making them harder to process and<br>reducing their commercial value<br>i'm trying to find out why they attach<br>themselves to the muscles<br>and how we can stop the spread so we can<br>improve the returns from the important<br>muscle farming activity<br>that takes place in the hauraki gulf<br>with the product exporting around the<br>world<br>including to my home country italia and<br>i'm dr anja slipper and my research<br>looks into the movements of snapper one<br>of new zealand's most iconic fish<br>species<br>are there young leaving the marine<br>reserve helping to repopulate other<br>parts of the hierarchy gulf<br>how far do they travel and where do they<br>settle<br>can marine protected areas enhance<br>surrounding fisheries<br>what positive actions can we take to<br>help restore snapper numbers in the<br>haraki golf<br>we've got many people to thank for the<br>generous donations that we've had over<br>recent years to support the research of<br>our young scientists<br>the work that they've just described to<br>you the support has also opened up<br>our research to schools and to the<br>public through our new discovery centre<br>based at lee<br>and the support has allowed us to bring<br>new leadership into the program such as<br>andrew jeff's<br>we're extremely proud of what our<br>current and previous students have<br>achieved<br>we have scientists from this program<br>based all around the world<br>they're involved in groundbreaking<br>research making a real contribution<br>whether through conservation managing<br>the environment<br>or through developing the sustainable<br>production from our seas<br>it's such a unique environment here at<br>lee with only a short boat trip away<br>from my study sites i'm able to catch<br>lobsters and bring them back to the lab<br>for testing<br>i can't think of a better place to do my<br>research<br>next door to the lab the university has<br>created a brand new discovery centre<br>for the first time opening up the<br>laboratory's work and expertise<br>to the many thousands of people who<br>visit scott island each year<br>the centre's not trying to be an<br>underwater world we want to point people<br>to the real marine reserve on our<br>doorstep<br>this is more than a community asset<br>members of the community can go but what<br>is more important is the<br>future of new zealand what this can do<br>for our country<br>and the development of the extensive<br>marine assets that we have<br>hi i'm jessica feikit and i'm a masters<br>student here at lee<br>and as well as my own research into<br>controlling the new zealand peak lab<br>which is a parasite in farm muscles<br>we're also trying to create an online<br>resource for school teachers so they can<br>feel confident teaching students about<br>the marine environment<br>auckland university is committed to<br>marine science as we expect it to become<br>an increasing focus for new zealanders<br>in the years to come<br>the project is at a stage now that it<br>needs another four million<br>dollars to be pumped into it and any<br>donation large or small<br>to assist that goal i think would be<br>very very<br>worthy as money well spent we really<br>need that four million dollars to<br>complete the 11 million<br>target we've set ourselves to accelerate<br>the science behind the oceans as a<br>source of wealth<br>and a stunning playground for all to<br>treasure and enjoy<br>your support can make a real difference<br>so come and see us<br>see what we are doing see what's<br>happening above and below the water<br>to learn about our precious marine<br>environment and find out how we can<br>preserve it for future generations<br>so there's always plenty more fish in<br>the sea but if you can't come and visit<br>us<br>you can help us by donating to support<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
