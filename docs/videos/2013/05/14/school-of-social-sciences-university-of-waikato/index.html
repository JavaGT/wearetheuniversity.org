Our degrees will equip students to survive and even to thrive in our future world.<br><br>The School of Social Sciences at the University of Waikato in New Zealand is large and diverse in its offerings. Not all of our subjects are conventionally classified as 'social sciences'. Convention be blowed! Our combination of subjects has the potential to make the School more truly interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary than any other comparable grouping in New Zealand.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i think what the social sciences offers<br>for students is a way of<br>actually understanding in more depth the<br>relationship between people and society<br>politics we can think about all these<br>spheres of life and it comes back to<br>what people do so it brings a systematic<br>approach to thinking about<br>humans and the society in which we live<br>why are the social sciences so relevant<br>today<br>is is a very good question and i would<br>say that's because<br>we live in a time of profound and very<br>rapid change<br>social scientists are very interested in<br>making a positive difference in the<br>world so in order to make a positive<br>difference in order to<br>bring about a more socially just world<br>it's really important to actually<br>understand that relationship that people<br>have with society people are interesting<br>and they they do cool things and they<br>and they do wonderful things and they do<br>interesting things and so it's all that<br>sort of engagement that i think<br>is why social sciences is important<br>social sciences help us to understand<br>how these things impact on people people<br>as individuals and people collectively<br>whanau<br>old people young people straight queer<br>whatever it is we think about humans and<br>their relationship to the environment it<br>teaches you<br>great skills researching skills reading<br>skills writing skills all those skills<br>that are needed when you go out and and<br>forge a career and now graduates have<br>careers and<br>planning and government<br>and human resources and<br>administration and media we need people<br>who understand<br>how change affects society at large<br>and<br>how we can respond to that change<br>so as long as there are human beings<br>there's a need for people who are<br>trained in the social sciences and when<br>you're doing a social science degree<br>here at wakato you'll realize how<br>friendly the staff are and how much we<br>want to make your experience<br>a unique and very fulfilling experience<br>myself and my colleagues we have open<br>door policies we encourage you to<br>contact us when you have a problem or an<br>issue you want to talk through<br>assignments or the course workload<br>whatever it is we're very happy to help</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
