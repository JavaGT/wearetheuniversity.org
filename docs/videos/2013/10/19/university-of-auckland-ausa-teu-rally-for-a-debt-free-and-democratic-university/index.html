TEU and AUSA bring speakers together to discuss two issues:<br><br>1. The lack of serious Government investment in the tertiary sector; and<br>2. The disturbing centralized style of management and the attack on student democracy and academic freedom at this university.<br><br>Speakers include: David Cunliffe / Jacinda Ardern / Cris Shaw / Vernon Tava / John Minto / Nigel Haworth / Jane Kelsey / Campbell Jones</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>and i'm joined by uh fantastic uh<br>auckland central mp jacinda ardern great<br>you know there's two views of the world<br>when it comes to tertiary education in<br>universities one is that you are<br>commodities the other is that you are<br>people<br>one is that this is an expense the other<br>is that it's an investment<br>one is that you get only what you can<br>afford and the other is you get what you<br>deserve<br>because access to education should be a<br>the labour party believes tertiary<br>education should be accessible and it<br>should be accessible right through to<br>post-graduate without having your<br>bursary and your allowances and your<br>we don't agree with the government<br>cutting student and staff representation<br>of university councils you've got to ask<br>why are they doing this what is wrong<br>with having the voice of the customer of<br>the students around the table making the<br>decisions<br>it's crazy it's ideological<br>it's a leftover from the 1990s and we<br>here at auckland university they've<br>pushed your fees to the maximum every<br>year and government funding hasn't kept<br>up<br>without blowing the budget that we<br>haven't yet written and we need to get<br>elected first can i just say to you we<br>believe tertiary education is an<br>investment we want to fund it better and<br>we want to make sure you get a better<br>because education should be based on<br>this is a university where you've had<br>voluntary student union membership and<br>that's been controversial up and down<br>the country<br>we want to go back to the idea that<br>students can decide for themselves<br>whether they have it as compulsory or<br>not we want to repeal nationals law in<br>just because we got the stage and<br>because jacinda's a far better speaker<br>than me i'm going to give her the mic<br>for a second i just say thanks very much<br>it's great to see you as students being<br>active and fighting for your future and<br>we invite you to join with us to fight<br>for a better future for all new<br>zealanders next year because we've got<br>an election we've got to win for all of<br>you and all of them out there kia ora<br>thanks david i'm going to be really<br>really brief because i get the privilege<br>of coming up to this campus and<br>seeing your phases time and time again<br>because you know as we always say<br>universities are<br>public's conscience you are our voice<br>you're the ones that try and keep the<br>government honest<br>but you're not just battling things like<br>the government's decision on the gcsb<br>bill you know you're not just battling<br>against every retrograde step that<br>they've made in this country you're now<br>just battling to survive and how can we<br>ensure that we keep the voice of our<br>conscience<br>in new zealand alive when you guys are<br>doing all you can just to continue to<br>put food on the table and to be able to<br>afford to live in auckland<br>what are we doing to your voice when you<br>get into that kind of situation that's<br>why i'm glad today that you guys are<br>united that it's staff and its students<br>that you're coming together and saying<br>that despite all that you're going<br>through out there currently you're<br>united to try and make sure that this<br>campus your place<br>remains democratic despite the<br>government doing everything it can to<br>rest the control of your university out<br>of your hands and to give it to people<br>who have less interest in your education<br>than you do keep fighting stay angry<br>through every day until the election<br>because we need you to change this<br>government and give new zealand back to<br>thank you martin<br>yeah my name is chris shaw i'm a<br>lecturer in the anthropology department<br>i'm also<br>the tu academic rep for the branch the<br>auckland branch and i'm here really to<br>give my support to the ausa<br>and to all the students and their<br>parents who are<br>fed up with witnessing year-on-year<br>increases the ratcheting up of fees to<br>compensate for year-on-year government<br>under investment and under funding of<br>our sector our universities coming in<br>this morning this afternoon i had a real<br>sense of deja vu i remember october 2011<br>where many of us were here again<br>protesting at a very similar<br>event and again last year in 2012 when<br>universities again raise their fees by<br>the maximum they're allowed to which is<br>courses above the level of inflation<br>on each of those occasions students<br>reacted<br>by protesting sometimes by occupying the<br>council chambers on each of those<br>occasions the students were ignored<br>so little seems to have changed except<br>for<br>the burden of student debt is now even<br>larger as somebody said 13 billion<br>dollars<br>and the average student is saddled<br>whether when they finish their degree<br>somewhere between 15 and 21 000<br>of course the other change is that the<br>university has decided that students and<br>the public will be locked out of the<br>council meeting when it meets yet again<br>to agree to raising student fees<br>this morning i spoke with one of our<br>students who's just finished his honours<br>degree<br>he told me that his debt was now 40 000.<br>he said the figure was so big that he<br>felt it was almost meaningless just a<br>string of numbers<br>and he wondered how many years no how<br>many decades it was going to take him<br>to pay that sum back and it made me<br>think<br>what a terrible way to start your<br>professional life<br>saddled with debt<br>you know welcome to a life of poverty<br>how you can afford a mortgage for your<br>house with that sum of money<br>stephen joyce and his friends as we have<br>already heard they got their education<br>for free but now having climbed up the<br>ladder to their glittering careers and<br>successes they're kicking it away for<br>those of you who want to follow<br>so this government is doing a disservice<br>to our economy to our students and to<br>our country<br>how is debt supposed to benefit new<br>zealand all it does is give a strong<br>incentive for our qualified graduates to<br>go overseas to find jobs<br>new zealand universities seem to become<br>factories to produce cheap qualified<br>labor to furnish the australian market<br>how does that make sense<br>you'd think that the government would<br>have learned from the global financial<br>crisis of 2008<br>that was caused by the accumulated small<br>debt of thousands of people<br>thanks to their mortgages their subprime<br>mortgages<br>what it led to was the meltdown of the<br>entire banking system and yet for some<br>reason our political leaders or those in<br>government at least they can't seem to<br>make the connection<br>between they don't see the link between<br>debt and economic instability they think<br>that debt is actually good<br>you know it binds students to the<br>country it teaches them the value of<br>their degree it makes them more<br>calculating more<br>market savvy in the subjects they choose<br>so that they'll be more likely to pick a<br>useful degree like engineering science<br>or technology or medicine<br>i think they are wrong on all counts<br>our society needs much more than just<br>scientists engineers and technicians<br>valuable though they are we also need<br>people who are educated in ways that<br>enable them to challenge policy makers<br>like the ones that we have at the moment<br>we need to think of higher education as<br>education for citizenship but not in<br>this model this model according to our<br>government they see debt as the first<br>act of true citizenship<br>debt does not bind students to this<br>country it drives them overseas<br>and they often don't come back<br>why would you<br>and then to cap it all a fortnight ago<br>our government recently introduced the<br>bill to crack down on student defaulters<br>our revenue minister todd mcclay wants<br>to introduce laws so the expat kiwis who<br>default on their loans can be arrested<br>at the border i kid you not<br>i like the title of this rally publicly<br>funded but privately run why because for<br>me it highlights a very key feature of<br>neo-liberal governments everywhere using<br>the state to transfer public resources<br>to the private sector they want to break<br>up our public sector in order to allow<br>private investors to capture some of<br>these lucrative rent there's a name for<br>this strategy sometimes it goes under<br>the moniker of acid stripping<br>and we've already seen this with the<br>privatization of mighty river power<br>meridian energy in tamu<br>it's the same strategy that underpinned<br>the private public partnerships the<br>famous ppps which this government wants<br>to encourage for the building of schools<br>the running of hospitals and prison<br>services<br>advocates of these schemes claim that<br>they deliver efficiency and transparency<br>and good governance in reality all they<br>do is<br>socialize risks and privatize profits<br>this national government seemed<br>hell-bent on returning new zealand to<br>the failed liberal neoliberal strategies<br>that we saw in the 1990s they didn't<br>work then they're not going to work now<br>and this is also what we see happening<br>to higher education the government's<br>abandoned the idea of higher education<br>as a public good it's recast education<br>as a private personal investment in your<br>own individual career<br>and it's trying to reinvent universities<br>as commercial enterprises whose main<br>purpose is to service industry and<br>commerce<br>what we need is a properly funded<br>publicly owned publicly governed and<br>publicly funded system of higher<br>education if we want our graduates to<br>stay in new zealand and contribute to<br>our economy and society let's stop<br>saddling them with stupid debt and<br>driving them offshore<br>and to those who make the argument know<br>that we can't afford it i say yes we can<br>it's just that we choose to spend it on<br>the wrong priorities like 225 million<br>that government has just committed to<br>keeping solid energy in business in<br>order to privatize it at a later date or<br>the 85 million it gave to warner<br>brothers as a sweetener to the hollywood<br>studio to stay in here while rewriting<br>our labor laws or the 30 million bay<br>light it gave to rio tinto to keep their<br>smelter at cy point<br>or the 300 million that auckland<br>university is borrowing in order to<br>embark on the most ambitious building<br>scheme we've ever seen all the 1.7<br>billion raised in the privatization of<br>mighty river power<br>finally let's not forget that this<br>government also borrowed two million<br>dollars in 2010 to fund its tax cutting<br>program<br>so my message is simple we need to get<br>our priorities straight and let's start<br>investing properly in higher education<br>the university is precious<br>it is a taunga it is where we come to<br>develop our critical faculties<br>to play with ideas and to experiment and<br>to learn<br>any hope we have of moving our society<br>into an equitable<br>fair<br>sustainable<br>society begins at the university<br>the university is in the i think<br>beautiful words of the education act the<br>critic and conscience of society<br>the university is therefore not<br>a market commodity it is not the source<br>point for the job market it is not where<br>we come merely to acquire vocational<br>skills<br>and the green party honours that special<br>the green party contends that higher<br>education should be made accessible to<br>all on the basis of capacity<br>so that nobody should be barred<br>because they can't afford to go to<br>university<br>lifelong learning should be available to<br>all new zealanders recently we've seen<br>the government cut student allowances<br>not only to postgraduate students i was<br>one of the fortunate<br>last<br>generation of students in fact my was<br>the last year when i studied a masters<br>of law at this university finishing at<br>the end of 2010 who was actually able to<br>draw<br>a postgraduate allowance while finishing<br>that degree and i have to say it would<br>have been very difficult if not<br>impossible for me to be able to do it or<br>i would have had to have stretched my<br>time out<br>part-time and i have little doubt that<br>it would have definitely affected the<br>ability to really explore the ideas in<br>that degree and commit the time that it<br>needed<br>education should be seen not only as the<br>accurate club mean acquisition of job<br>skills it is not purely a vocational<br>institution<br>education should not be included in free<br>trade agreements such as the general<br>agreement on trade and services or the<br>tppa it is being advanced<br>we will work with other political<br>parties<br>to ensure that education isn't subject<br>to triadial cycles and political<br>fashions and used as a football it is<br>far too important for that we need to<br>work together and to diminish<br>competition between universities and<br>foster and encourage cooperation between<br>them because we're all fighting for a<br>common cause and hoping to achieve a<br>common thing<br>the green party would eliminate<br>gradually student loans<br>and would go further to move towards a<br>universal<br>student living costs benefit<br>universal<br>i've lost count of the number of times<br>i've been told usually by people who are<br>old enough to have had their education<br>100 subsidised by the state that this is<br>fiscal irresponsibility that this is<br>lunacy how can we ever pay for this and<br>i take great pleasure in pointing out<br>that we do have a universal<br>unmeans-tested benefit<br>in new zealand that goes to everybody<br>age over 65 it's called new zealand<br>super<br>you can be a multi-millionaire and you<br>can still collect new zealand super and<br>many very very wealthy people do so it<br>doesn't seem talk about<br>intergenerational injustice huh it<br>doesn't seem so crazy does it when you<br>consider that that instead of crushing<br>us<br>the future of this society the people<br>who will act and feed into the critic<br>and conscience of society it doesn't<br>seem so crazy then does it<br>to offer not a free ride but the<br>meaningful support<br>that students and scholars and the<br>academics the all-important and<br>long-suffering academics deserve<br>now i'd like to share with you something<br>from my own personal experience in fact<br>from my graduation in 2011<br>where as a member of the teu working as<br>a tutor at the same time i was a member<br>of the tertiary education unions<br>i believe it was the action committee<br>was the name of the group<br>and this was at the time when very very<br>hard-fought negotiations were going on<br>with the vice chancellor and the<br>academic staff of the university<br>a distinctly unconsulted and difficult<br>what we decided to do or one of the<br>things we decided to do as an action was<br>at the graduation<br>where or make for the students rosettes<br>you know those little best in show<br>badges that that politicians wear at<br>election time little rosettes<br>i love mine i have a great collection<br>now and i know you do too<br>now we made a yellow one<br>and it said<br>staff and students unite to defend the<br>university<br>personally i can't think of a more<br>polite and moderate form of protest than<br>wearing a badge with a pretty ribbon on<br>it but this was too much for the<br>university to countenance i was told<br>before graduating with a master of laws<br>degree with honours<br>winning the prize for my year with a<br>master's thesis i was told that despite<br>all that i was not able to cross the<br>stage that night wearing that badge<br>fortunately i had a pocket full of these<br>badges because i was one of the lefty<br>troublemakers handing them out<br>so i surrendered it the first time after<br>being told that i wouldn't be allowed to<br>leave the collection area where we're<br>all shepherded together before we're<br>sent up to our seats<br>pinned it on once inside the theater<br>and saw one of the administrative staff<br>in the clock tower who were given robes<br>and sort of police powers for the day<br>and an earpiece come up and stand next<br>to me and i heard her say oh he's put<br>the fence back on<br>in the intermission<br>the music break i went out to the having<br>enjoyed some of the um the beverages at<br>the tent in advance i had the need to um<br>visit the restroom in the music break<br>and there was nobody else out there<br>when i came back to re-enter the theater<br>there were four of these black robed<br>guards standing outside the door telling<br>me that i would not be allowed back in<br>to graduate with a degree i have earned<br>and paid for with interest<br>unless i took off that<br>badge i was physically restrained from<br>walking back into the theater<br>so i surrendered the badge because i had<br>a couple more in my pocket<br>was finally reduced to having to pin it<br>inside the trencher cap and hold it up<br>it was worse than high school it really<br>was<br>now i was confronted by a black robed<br>earpiece wearing uh guard<br>outside and told that oh look that's<br>totally unacceptable what you've done<br>it's it's you're making a mockery of the<br>dignity of the process and you may be<br>disciplined for this and i said well<br>quite frankly i think you should be<br>ashamed of yourselves and to be honest i<br>think you've acted like a bunch of<br>fascists and she said to me well i<br>which i thought was a very frank<br>admission<br>enough i never heard from them again i<br>can only imagine what the senior manager<br>might have said the next day when they<br>were told that they wanted to discipline<br>someone who just graduated for wearing a<br>badge with a pretty ribbon on it<br>i tell that story not only because it's<br>quite bizarre<br>but because it is emblematic of the<br>change that we are seeing the cultural<br>shift that we're beginning to see in a<br>university<br>a corporate structure that cannot<br>countenance cannot deal with the most<br>polite and moderate form of dissent<br>from one of its graduates<br>you're not allowed to wear a badge at<br>your own party<br>if the corporate administration of the<br>university does not agree with it<br>is that<br>a place for free thought and expression<br>is that the critic and conscience of<br>society<br>i suggest it's not<br>work with the teu<br>take action it's fantastic to see so<br>many people here today<br>remember when you vote please vote in<br>local body elections for goodness sake<br>the turnout to poland but when you vote<br>in the national elections next year<br>read the policies the green party has<br>all of its policies up on the website<br>unlike many political parties all of the<br>policies are available they're<br>progressive they're interesting<br>look at labor's policies look at new<br>zealand first policies shop around<br>inform yourself exercise the critical<br>faculties that you've come here to hone<br>and to learn<br>uh kyoto koto i'm here<br>to greetings everybody and it's great to<br>see this marvelous crowd here<br>several years ago i was elected as the<br>council of trade unions representative<br>to sit on the auckland university<br>council<br>but i was never able to take up that<br>position<br>because the university council refused<br>to have me on the council<br>and so what i'm saying to you is the<br>university council is not a democratic<br>organization<br>and over the years it's become even less<br>democratic and stephen joyce's decision<br>today to say no we're not going to have<br>staff or student reps on the council<br>just underlines the fact we should never<br>underestimate the hatred which so many<br>people in big business have for<br>democracy they hate it because it gets<br>now as you've heard from a couple of<br>other speakers the last 30 years there's<br>been this big battle going on in<br>education on the one hand you've got<br>education as a basic human right where<br>everybody deserves the same high quality<br>no matter what your background is no<br>matter whether your family can afford to<br>pay for it<br>and on the other side you've got<br>education as a commodity in the<br>marketplace<br>where the quality of what you get will<br>depend on your ability to pay<br>and stuart mccutcheon and the university<br>council are very much in that second and<br>that second have that second<br>view they are here to promote the idea<br>of education as a commodity where the<br>quality you get depends on your ability<br>shame on stupid catching and shame on<br>and as a result of that that vision that<br>auckland university council has and the<br>and the business elites that run this<br>country have<br>we've seen increasing student fees well<br>beyond the rate of inflation<br>we've had cuts to full-time academic<br>positions and an increase in short-term<br>contracts we've had huge increases in<br>salaries for the senior managers running<br>this university people like bloody<br>mccutchen<br>hear massive increase in salaries while<br>the yet while the people who do the<br>actual work the cleaners the security<br>guards the securities the the academic<br>staff have had cuts or their pay rate<br>suppressed<br>and we've had the university of the<br>university role as the critic and<br>conscience of society seriously<br>downgraded and i reckon that everyone on<br>that university council would despise<br>that role of the university<br>they do not believe the university<br>should be the critic and conscience of<br>society<br>and the same thing outside the<br>university we've had governments pouring<br>money into ptes<br>who more often than not they specialize<br>in these really expensive low-quality<br>courses where students end up with a<br>useless qualification a massive student<br>we've had the so-called on job training<br>that occurs out in the out of the<br>private sector where people are trained<br>in a very narrow range of skills their<br>skills that are needed for that<br>particular employer so the skills<br>they're learning are not transferable to<br>other jobs as they used to be in other<br>training regimes when we used to have a<br>proper apprenticeship system for example<br>so education is changing from producing<br>critically conscious students<br>who can take an active informed part in<br>our democracy to education to provide<br>the basic needs for employers to run<br>their businesses and make more profits<br>off the rest of us shame on that vision<br>of education<br>so who runs the university well<br>it's certainly not a democracy and you<br>have to say it's the closest that we've<br>got to a big business dictatorship<br>there is no control of students over<br>their own money<br>and there is no say there will be no say<br>whatever<br>by the academic staff and how the<br>institutions run<br>so two things that manu wants to bring<br>to this debate we bought it at the last<br>election we're bringing it to the<br>election next year<br>we<br>believe in free<br>from preschool through to adult and<br>community education<br>and don't you dare let anybody tell you<br>we can't do it because my generation did<br>it and where that money's gone now we've<br>had last year the 150 wealthiest new<br>zealanders got an increase in wealth of<br>3.5 billion dollars it was unearned<br>wealth it was untaxed wealth that's<br>where our money's going and we've got to<br>the last excuse me the last thing i want<br>to say because it's really pertinent to<br>this debate is that mana is determined<br>to bring civics education into our<br>schools<br>because<br>because our kids<br>our kids need to learn about democracy<br>they need to learn how society runs they<br>need to learn how how how they can<br>influence the outcome of elections and<br>the outcome of policy they can learn<br>about a participatory democracy rather<br>than this misinformed consent that we're<br>so what i'm saying to you all today is<br>as somebody earlier said keep your anger<br>alive<br>because we've got big changes to make<br>kirakoto<br>sensible management<br>approaches the staff and the students of<br>an organization that's underfunded like<br>we are and works with them a sensible<br>management here would talk to the ausa<br>which will talk to the teu would talk to<br>the psa and find a way of working<br>through underfunding and find a way of<br>working jointly to increase that funding<br>unfortunately our management doesn't<br>take that view<br>it takes a quite different one a view<br>based on corporate driven managerialism<br>permitted by the university of the<br>university by the reforms of the 1990s<br>so we now have as i understand the<br>highest paid civil servant in the land<br>acting as our ceo vice chancellor<br>we have a council that acts more like<br>the board of directors than the body<br>with charged with the guardianship of<br>the university and is likely to be more<br>so if mr joyce's reforms go through<br>and we've also got kpis key performance<br>indicators sprouting out of every<br>orifice of this institution as we model<br>ourselves upon the corporate world that<br>we so wish to aim<br>this explains why my union the tu has<br>been in constant legal conflict with<br>this university for the last decade<br>it doesn't have to be like this we have<br>examples like otago in the past where<br>bitter cooperation existed but under the<br>regime here we end up in the employment<br>court more often than you and i have hot<br>dinners it's not an acceptable way of<br>going forward<br>i want to talk about an example of that<br>rampant managerialism that affects you<br>as students never mind making my life<br>easier<br>that's what's called a lovely sexy term<br>the faculty administration review<br>or far<br>which is for me an example of that<br>rampant management managerialism that<br>has<br>real impact on students and staff alike<br>now far is a restructuring of faculty<br>administration<br>it was presented in honeyed words<br>originally it was presented as a<br>wonderful thing in fact it was presented<br>as something that this the professional<br>staff wanted<br>they thought they weren't being given<br>the career prospects the development<br>opportunities that they wanted that they<br>were being held back so this beneficent<br>university said we will do something<br>we'll restructure you so that your<br>careers will be so much better<br>it is in fact of course not nothing of<br>that order at all it's a cost saving<br>restructuring<br>probably trying to save about 10 million<br>on the professional staff budget you<br>divide 10 million by about 550 000 you<br>begin to get a sense of the job losses<br>that may be implicit<br>in this restructuring maybe up to 200<br>faculty and ministers this staff<br>being removed now you may say<br>hey maybe that will reduce our fees<br>some chat<br>some chance what it will do is have a<br>whole set of real impacts across staff<br>and students which have to be clearly<br>understood<br>these cuts matter<br>not just because it's treating important<br>staff badly because they have<br>these cuts have a real impact on the<br>um great that you have stuck around um<br>one of the things about coming at the<br>end of such a long list is that everyone<br>has said everything i was going to say<br>universities<br>are centuries and centuries old wananga<br>are centuries and centuries old<br>when i was a student in the 70s along<br>with some of the others here<br>universities were public zones that were<br>about the national good and we had a<br>sense of obligation<br>not just to our generation and the next<br>generation but the generations of the<br>centuries to come<br>they cannot be allowed in a period of 30<br>years to have destroyed that legacy<br>so that we not only have universities<br>that are of the era of neoliberalism but<br>cannot transcend the era of<br>neoliberalism that is our challenge and<br>we need to work out<br>how to do it<br>let me tell you<br>some good news stories about some<br>victories we had<br>in<br>1989 when i'd been teaching here for<br>about 10 years was the first time the<br>labor government the rogenomics<br>government launched the big assault on<br>the universities<br>that was when they proposed introducing<br>fees and it's when they proposed the<br>first round of attempts to privatize the<br>universities<br>we won<br>labor backed off the fees<br>we got not only them to back off what<br>they were going to do to the governance<br>of the universities but we got put into<br>the education act our role as critic and<br>conscience of society and the obligation<br>to protect the academic freedom of the<br>staff and the students<br>in the 1990s when the gnats came in<br>and they said they wouldn't have student<br>fees as a national theme but they would<br>allow the universities to set their own<br>the battles moved into our universities<br>and lockwood smith who was minister of<br>tertiary education at the time had to<br>crawl out the window to escape the<br>students<br>we have battled after battle of staff<br>and students and community united<br>to try to defeat the fees and the fact<br>that they did not escalate beyond where<br>they did<br>was because of that action<br>in the later 1990s when i was national<br>president of the university union<br>we worked with the students<br>we worked with the councils of the<br>universities and with the vice<br>chancellors committees to defeat exactly<br>the kind of governance proposals that<br>stephen joyce is proposing now in 1997<br>and 1998 the green papers and white<br>papers that said exactly the same thing<br>should happen to the university's<br>councils we're defeated we're united<br>together<br>and they could not proceed<br>we did it<br>in the 2000s<br>we again joined forces within all of our<br>universities<br>not only dealing with the challenges of<br>how we reconstructed student unions<br>but also how we reconstructed workable<br>governance arrangements<br>from the time when i was a member of the<br>university council when we had a<br>collective decision making where the<br>views of academics and students were<br>respected<br>we have moved to a situation of a board<br>of directors where they believe that it<br>is better to have distance from us<br>um<br>i'm i'm currently uh academic<br>representative for the tu and the uh<br>annual negotiations with the employer<br>i thought i might let you know where<br>we're up to to fill you in and and give<br>you a sense of what it is that we're up<br>against<br>the tu asked the employer that all<br>teaching and research staff be treated<br>as academics<br>the employer rejected this claim on the<br>basis that it would not give them as<br>much leverage as they wish to have over<br>academics<br>we invited the employer to offer us a<br>pay increase or even to offer us no pay<br>increase the employer told us that they<br>will not negotiate on pay<br>we asked the employer for a living wage<br>that would pay everyone who works in<br>this university enough so that they can<br>feed and raise their children the<br>employer responded by telling us that<br>this was a philosophical and political<br>discussion and therefore outside the<br>we think that the living wage is a<br>practical matter about how we feed our<br>children how we raise our families not a<br>not an abstract issue it is material and<br>concrete and something that our support<br>staff our professional staff experience<br>and confront every day<br>also to pay all of our permanent<br>professional staff a living wage would<br>cost less than one percent of the new<br>capital expenditure that this<br>administration is spending on<br>we're at a point then<br>and we've consulted with members widely<br>last week we're at a point at which our<br>annual negotiations are about to break<br>down and we may well be led into<br>industrial action<br>how do we how do we get in this kind of<br>situation<br>the employer claims that there simply<br>isn't enough money to fund quality<br>higher education<br>the vc has described the fall in our<br>rankings from 83rd to 94th in the world<br>as alarming but he explains that there's<br>nothing he can do to stop the ship from<br>sinking<br>he says that he is handcuffed and there<br>is nothing that he can do<br>the reason that we have a problem is<br>that new zealand has the lowest per<br>capita per student the lowest per<br>student funding in the oecd<br>it's hardly surprising then that the<br>vice chancellor has a problem and we<br>admit that the vice chancellor is in a<br>very difficult situation<br>there are three possible solutions that<br>can be done that can be taken to deal<br>with the funding shortfall<br>the first would be to increase student<br>fees<br>this would of course this would of<br>course<br>increase inequality of access to higher<br>education it would further<br>instrumentalize the student relationship<br>with educators and it would guide degree<br>choice towards those courses which are<br>most individual rather than societal<br>benefits<br>we should recognize as well that new<br>zealand already has the seventh highest<br>fees in the oecd<br>secondly we could increase external<br>funding through research grants<br>something that would further<br>instrumentalize research and cause all<br>manner of problems with impartiality of<br>course this leads us then to the third<br>possibility which is government funding<br>turning to government fund government<br>funding from this institution has been<br>systematically staffed for the last<br>quarter of a century we're working we're<br>living with educating and dilapidated<br>buildings<br>we have falling rankings and our lecture<br>halls are overflowing<br>if new zealand's going to have an<br>educated population and prospects for a<br>sustainable future<br>this can only come by making choices in<br>which we begin to invest again in higher<br>education<br>as a country then we've got some very<br>difficult choices to make<br>and moreover the vice chancellor has<br>some very difficult choices to make as<br>well<br>because his hands may in fact not be as<br>tied as it seems<br>the pressure that he has put on the<br>government or that he has started to put<br>on the government over funding has been<br>timid or dare i say sheepish at the very<br>least<br>if he had the confidence and the courage<br>that he take displays with us in our<br>negotiations when confronting the<br>government then we may be in a very<br>different situation<br>we propose as the tu to support the vice<br>chancellor we want to work with the vice<br>chancellor and we do not want industrial<br>conflict if the vice chancellor however<br>is unwilling to take the handcuffs off<br>then me we may well have to take them</p></main><footer
