font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I chose I wanted to study law largely<br>out of family tradition I had a father<br>who is still a lawyer now retired lawyer<br>brother who had gone through work and<br>law school I knew a lot about what their<br>experiences there and it sounded like an<br>interesting thing to do they had clearly<br>both had a good time there and I knew a<br>lot of people going and everything I'd<br>heard had been very positive I came into<br>law school expect me I'd go into legal<br>practice and that's what happened as it<br>happened when I left law school I<br>decided I wanted to go overseas and I<br>spent the first 18 months practicing law<br>and tel-aviv then I came back and joined<br>Russell McVeigh and then I did a couple<br>of different our postgraduate years one<br>at Cambridge University and one at New<br>York University in dispersed with a<br>couple of extra years at rustling face<br>so I certainly came in expecting that<br>legal practice would be a big part of my<br>future there's no doubt that when you're<br>practicing law the academic training<br>that you've had at law school is<br>critical you understand legal concepts<br>you've still a lot of a case law still<br>fresh in your mind you've learned a<br>little bit how to think as a lawyer I'm<br>thinking back to that TV show or film<br>the Paper Chase when you're taught to<br>think like a lawyer and that's very much<br>what I remember from the Law School<br>you've got a lot of content but also<br>just a lot of mind training in terms of<br>how to think about legal concepts and<br>analyze legal concepts obviously the job<br>I'm doing now is not specifically a<br>legal job but the legal training is<br>important at a couple of levels number<br>one as a CEO you're dealing with legal<br>concepts you're dealing with contracts<br>you're dealing with litigation all those<br>sorts of things so that little bit of<br>law you had can be a dangerous thing<br>that's actually quite useful but there's<br>also this way of thinking that law has<br>taught you about analyzing issues<br>analyzing risk which in business is<br>extremely important and I also go back<br>to what I learned as the fundamentals of<br>Company Law about why companies are here<br>the importance of obligations to a wide<br>variety of stakeholders and are often<br>drawn to those basic concepts of<br>corporate law and why companies exist in<br>my day to day work my experience with<br>the law faculty was outstanding I've<br>some of the people are still here and<br>all the obviously some of them aren't<br>after that long a period of<br>I found many of the professor's to be<br>passionate understood their field very<br>well but also had a love of teaching and<br>I recall from law school it was a<br>combination of a really good academic<br>insight but also a love of teaching and<br>I think of classes I had with a number<br>of professors Julie MEXT and Peter Watts<br>are on Petterson people who really<br>enjoyed this subject but were also legal<br>academics of stature and that really<br>shone through I look back on my time at<br>Law School with very fond memories I had<br>a great time studying law I had a great<br>time as a student I'm still in contact<br>with a number of friends who have<br>remained very close friends since we<br>started becoming friends at law school<br>and I look back on the faculty in my<br>time at law school with a uniformly<br>positive view and feel very happy and<br>privileged to have been given that<br>quality of education and had a good time<br>while doing it what I'll say about law<br>is that in the way it trains your mind<br>and the concepts that exposes you to it<br>really prepares you for a wide variety<br>of options in your career outside the<br>practice of law and so to the extent<br>that people are saying I might enjoy<br>learning law but I'm not sure I'm going<br>to practice it that is by no means a<br>barrier to studying law I think law as a<br>general academic training is extremely<br>valuable</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
