Science<br>and engineerings biological sciences<br>Department with me I've got Dr Carrie<br>barer from psychology and the rest of<br>our participants are from again from<br>science and engineering Dr grahe<br>Saunders Dr Joe Lane associate professor<br>Marilyn Manley Harris and Dr Michael<br>mitello now<br>the university set this session up<br>specifically to talk around the science<br>of fluoride and of fluoridation and to<br>some extent too about um yeah the issues<br>underlying people's uh perceptions of<br>fluide if we end up if we get to<br>specific questions about that um we're<br>not here to provide personal opinion uh<br>nor are we actually here to answer or to<br>provide our own personal opinions on the<br>ethics we really want to focus at this<br>point on the science uh if people uh<br>wish to make uh quotes from particular<br>sources then we'd really like the actual<br>Source provided for us please because we<br>would like to check those sources out<br>and I'm going to do my best to come<br>through with a range of questions that<br>people have put in on Twitter and on<br>Facebook uh just to make sure that we're<br>not um you know just taking one person's<br>questions all the way through but making<br>it as broad as<br>possible okay now I should also make the<br>point that um I'm not going to uh read<br>out any questions that might contain<br>personal attacks it's not what we're<br>here for<br>either okay now we've got one question<br>here to start off with that's referring<br>to the the York Review the 2000 York<br>review of fluoride studies it concluded<br>a reduction and decay of 15% in<br>fluoridated areas which translates to on<br>average about a quarter of a filling in<br>a 12year old is that enough to justify<br>treating water for everybody who should<br>we throw this one to Milyn would you<br>like to start off can you can you repeat<br>the question for me please the questions<br>about the York review it was published<br>in 2000 of all fluide studies concluded<br>a reduction in decay of 15% in<br>fluoridated areas which translates to a<br>quarter of a filling in a 12year old is<br>that enough to justify water treatment<br>with fluoride where did the analogy for<br>a quarter of a filling in a 12year old<br>come from I think this is probably made<br>by a questioner rather than the review<br>without having the review open in front<br>of me um<br>because hang on I'd have to do some<br>figurs for that I mean a quarter of a<br>15% reduction is a quarter of a filling<br>that implies rather a lot of fillings in<br>a 12 year old if you think about it<br>there what five 15s in uh so there were<br>that would be uh three or four fillings<br>for a 12 year old old normally okay um I<br>I'd have to go back and have a look at<br>the review for that 15% ruction I mean<br>usually what they do is is say it do it<br>by um Decay missing or fill<br>teeth I'm not I'm not quite I'd have to<br>look at the York Review to get that<br>analogy to answer it okay well maybe we<br>can come back to that one unless one of<br>the others would like to pick it up<br>um I'll try and I'll try and download<br>the York Review and have a look okay<br>well we might we'll go to that one then<br>come we'll come back to that Marilyn<br>thank you okay there's a question here<br>which I'm going to um pass on to you Gro<br>it's forwarded from Dr Lori Brit from<br>Kong if Florida is perfectly safe as<br>stated by Dr Jonathan Broadbent and<br>others why does the American Dental<br>Association recommend the use of<br>unfluoridated water when making up<br>infant bottle form<br>gra I'll get you to answer that one I I<br>wouldn't know uh why they're advising<br>that I suspect uh they're ering on the<br>the side of of<br>caution uh with regard that now it may<br>be that there are areas of the USA that<br>are naturally high in<br>fluoride over<br>1.5 parts per million fluide um if<br>you're making up infant formula<br>with high levels of FL that may uh cause<br>uh some problems um so I suspect they're<br>they're ering on the the side of caution<br>for those people living in those<br>naturally High areas but I mean without<br>knowing the reasons behind their<br>thinking presume they go to report where<br>they gave the reason I couldn't answer<br>that question okay I do notice that the<br>CDC that's the Centers for Disease<br>Control in the United States do say you<br>can use fluoridated water for preparing<br>formula however if the child is<br>exclusively consuming infant formula<br>reconstituted with fluoridated water<br>there may be an increased chance of mild<br>dental fosis and they advis that if that<br>is a chance and parents could use low<br>fluoride bottle water some of the<br>time I I guess there's no guarantee that<br>bottle water is going to be low fluoride<br>either I mean no true water I'm familiar<br>with comes from the volcanic Springs and<br>so on and I suspect the levels of<br>fluoride in the bottle water May should<br>be higher than in uh fluoridated tap<br>water so you think bottled water's<br>probably got it in as well here in New<br>Zealand because of our water sources it<br>depends where it from yeah<br>okay okay there is a related question<br>here uh what is the safe value of<br>fluoride ingestion for an individual and<br>does this vary with body weight Michael<br>Michael I'm sorry you seem to have<br>dropped a<br>sound yeah I think I mean I can't answer<br>that one but I mean I think I think one<br>PPM uh actually hang on here's here's<br>some figures here um the US Institute of<br>medicine has established Dietary<br>Reference intakes with fluoride um from<br>01 milligram per day for infants age 6<br>months or less to 4 milligrams per day<br>for men age 19 years and up and the<br>tolerable upper intake level is .1<br>milligram per kilogram per day for<br>infants and children through the age of<br>8 years and 10 milligrams per day<br>thereafter so these are things I'm<br>reading off a source so it does vary due<br>to body weight and children would<br>taken than an<br>ad yes that's<br>right I think it's important to remember<br>that<br>sorry chide fluide is also excreted from<br>the body so it's not bio<br>accumulated so it's the concentration<br>that's<br>important<br>um rather than necessarily the the total<br>dose poisoning single Rel high level<br>when it comes to doses over a long<br>okay so sorry gra your<br>sound saying<br>that the the amount of<br>FL with according to but the other to be<br>the and the values will differ greatly<br>amongst the world's regions like in<br>China they have a high in some of China<br>the level of fluoride is quite High<br>naturally so it will depend on where you<br>are<br>large sorry<br>yeah here's a related question then um<br>I'm not quite sure which of the chemists<br>throw it to um the veterinary<br>Association I should put me back on for<br>a minute the veterinary Association<br>expresses concern about fluoride<br>buildups in soil as a result of<br>long-term fertilizer application given<br>that less than 1% of water is consumed<br>and the other 99% released into the<br>environment is the cons be contributed<br>to toxic<br>one I think it's certainly possible but<br>the other thing to keep in mind is that<br>also you know application of super<br>phosphate to soils is causing massive<br>problems with cadmium uh in our region<br>particular in the wter region so I'm not<br>convinced that fluoride is going to be<br>the first of the elements that we're<br>going to saturate into the soils the<br>other thing to think is that fluoride as<br>an annion is going to be very mobile<br>it's going to move through so the more<br>it rains just going to that out of the<br>soil anyway metals like cadmium and<br>arenic which do end up on our soils from<br>fertilizer application much more<br>immobilized and do get stuck in the top<br>sort of 30 cmers of soil so I suspect<br>other problems rather than in terms of<br>um excess fertilizer<br>application Jo I'm just going to<br>summarize that because I don't know<br>about the others but the sound was a bit<br>funny there um your feeling is the<br>contribution from pated water to any<br>fluoride build up is going to be minimal<br>compared to the amount coming through<br>and that because the chloride anion is<br>extremely mobile it is not likely to<br>hang around in the top soil for terribly<br>long is that a fa summary oh that's<br>correct thanks Joe uh and the other<br>thing is that fluoride has a great<br>mobile and at that point precipitates<br>out as as the mineral flu bar so there<br>is a sort of natural limit to how much<br>fluide<br>can be be around us if if we're talking<br>a volcano looking at other luide mineral<br>and so theide concentration<br>can but for us it would be the calcium<br>that's hi Alis Allison you there y turn<br>you yeah okay okay what the yor review<br>found on Dental<br>cares was that the difference in the<br>number of children found to be cares<br>free in fluoridated and non fluoridated<br>areas range from minus5 to 64% with a<br>median of<br>14.6% so that is not the it's I guess<br>it's the number of children not the<br>number of fillings the mean difference<br>of changed is in Decay missing or fill<br>teeth was from 0.5 to 4.4 teeth with a<br>median of two and A4<br>teeth um and that's all I can find about<br>it but the thing about the York Review<br>was that in<br>1997 it concluded that most of the data<br>either for and against was not<br>particular but of course we've had<br>resarch yeah thanks Marilyn um here's a<br>question just relating to the chemical<br>nature of fluoride I guess and the<br>mineral fluide talk about fluide on its<br>own as an iron it's an iron you can't if<br>it forms part of the compound then it's<br>then it like for example as bra was<br>saying FL like calcium fluoride for<br>instance then it would be classed as a<br>mineral you you would class it as a<br>mineral when it forms a compound with<br>exactly but it's not a term that we<br>okay so the the iron is always going to<br>be compound with or dissolved in water<br>yeah that's right it's if it's dissolved<br>okay<br>okay question here about the minister<br>which I don't have for hand to hand um<br>we can one of us perhaps can call them<br>up from behind the scenes and having<br>flipped through this page there there's<br>two or three questions related to<br>this it says our regular Ministry of<br>Health Data on 9 90,000 school children<br>and the World Health Organization data<br>show no difference between floridated<br>and unfluoridated communities does this<br>not prove that water flation has minimal<br>or no effect on tooth<br>decay now I'm not sure if any of you<br>have seen theoh or is this another<br>question You' like to come back<br>to um do we have a date for the Ministry<br>of Health da uh no we don't just the<br>words our regular Ministry of Health<br>Data are they talking about the New<br>the New Zealand Ministry of Health Data<br>it's a newal<br>commentator I don't think that's correct<br>I think there have been some studies<br>done that show um a considerable<br>distance um with lifetime exposure to<br>fluide okay can we Sorry Alison can we<br>just stop for a second um I think it's<br>fairly clear it's Mike Michael's<br>speakers are feeding back if he could<br>please turn his mute his microphone<br>there quite a few there's quite a few<br>comments on the Facebook page about can<br>we please deal with the audio because I<br>can't really tell<br>what you've got very clear clear audio<br>from for us Micha thinking back and<br>interrupting everything else I've put I<br>had my speakers on 100% for the mix yeah<br>that would be great but if you can turn<br>your mic off unless you're talking yeah<br>and that'll solve the<br>Michael can I pick it up on that<br>question I just flicked to the Ministry<br>of Health Works website and and um they<br>list some reports here um a study which<br>analyzed<br>8,375 5 year olds and<br>7,158 12 year olds from Canterbury and<br>Wellington um even after taking most<br>things into account Mar and Pacific<br>children had worse oral health than<br>other children analysis showed that<br>water fluoridation had a significant<br>effect on improving oral health and that<br>this Improvement was greater for groups<br>with poorer or oral health CH as Maring<br>Pacific children and children attending<br>low desile School overall Decay rates<br>were 30% lower among 5-year-old CH<br>children receiving fluoridated water and<br>40% lower among 12 year olds okay can<br>you give us the reference for that<br>Marilyn yes water fluoridation and<br>dental car is in five and 12 year old<br>children from Canterbury and Wellington<br>New Zealand Dental Journal uh authors<br>are Le and Dennison<br>and the publication<br>date uh 2004 okay so it's a fairly<br>recent one then yeah from from memory<br>with some of the who data the reason<br>that would show no difference between<br>floridated and un floridated was because<br>it hasn't always been collected in that<br>format but certainly what you've just um<br>read out from the uh publication<br>suggests that there is quite a<br>difference between floridated and<br>unfluoridated in terms of children's<br>okay um here's a question about the uh<br>the ld50 the lethal dose 50 um the<br>concentration which would kill 50% of<br>the the test animals rats or mice or<br>people um the question is what is the<br>salt pass it on Marland you you you you<br>can't get that because you can't have<br>fluoride iron on its own okay I I guess<br>sodium is fairly innocuous so we could<br>take the ld50 of sodium<br>fluoride which is 52 milligrams per<br>kilogram of body W mass and is that what<br>what um organism is said is that just a<br>general<br>State that's for the rat that's for the<br>rat sodium hexif fluosilicate is 125<br>milligrams per<br>kilogram so it's it's it's a<br>administered as sodium hexif<br>fluosilicate but that will be because<br>its solubility is less so it's not so<br>readily absorbed so you've got to it's<br>not just a question of how much it's how<br>well you absorb it as<br>well so that that's why the big<br>difference between sodium fluoride and<br>sodium hex fluosilicate if you'd like it<br>placed in perspective Allison the ld50<br>for caffeine for rats is 192 migrs per<br>kilogram so caffeine is is only slightly<br>less toxic than<br>fluide I think I'm going off coffee even<br>more<br>yeah okay<br>um okay here's a question I think this<br>is something that you touched on a<br>little bit the other day in your evening<br>session um Graham is it possible to be<br>allergenic or allergic or hyper<br>sensitive to fluoride if so how should<br>those individuals avoid contact with<br>fluoridated<br>water from what I've read um and I I<br>um my information mainly from a review<br>by Paul Harrison in the Journal of<br>Florine chemistry<br>2005 volume 126 1448 which reviews<br>literature on this um the the evidence<br>um an Aller allergic or hyp sensitive<br>sensitive reaction is um is<br>non-existent um they don't the studies<br>that have been done do not support<br>claims that fide is<br>allergenic um these studies would have<br>looked at the antibody response rather<br>than just rashes and things like that<br>but uh some people claim to have<br>observed when they touch fluoridated<br>water and so on um so these would<br>actually look at antibodies and the<br>body's immune response and so these were<br>were much better indicators of any<br>allergic response than um a a symptom<br>that could be caused by other factors so<br>these These are are real data rather<br>than anecdote or just a a minimal study<br>okay so they've basically looked at<br>antibody levels in the bloodstream for<br>people who um have reported an allergic<br>response and if there is no significant<br>antibody tighter than that was being<br>taken as evidence that the response was<br>probably not to fluide um well it wasn't<br>looking at individual uh humans it was<br>mainly looking at rats as far as I'm<br>concerned um as far as I'm aware but um<br>there had been a number of reports um<br>I'll try one on here yeah the the NRC um<br>published a report in 1993 on this uh<br>there's another paper by um chacom in<br>Community Dental Health<br>1996 uh and then there's a national<br>health and medical research council at<br>CRA in 1991 so those are the um reports<br>that I I have access to at the moment<br>but they all concluded that there was no<br>allergenic reaction to the flodine<br>itself okay thanks<br>gr um here's another one and this is<br>something that I know you mentioned but<br>we might throw it over to Michael or Joe<br>or Marilyn to give you a chance with the<br>the<br>um it's relating to the involvement of<br>fluoride and bio<br>appetites the question says considering<br>the natural involvement of fluoride and<br>bio appetites and the fact that it is<br>ubiquitous in the environment could the<br>panel clarify the question of whether<br>fluoride is beneficial or essential I<br>ask because some reviews describe<br>fluoride as an essential nutrient While<br>others call it an essential microelement<br>because of the role it plays in bones<br>and teeth Michael do you want to put<br>your microphone on for a minute and kick<br>off sound yeah the microphone's on yeah<br>well I mean I mean the the benefit of it<br>is that in teeth obviously the compound<br>that comprises teeth is hydroxy epetite<br>which has got a formula of ca10<br>p462 and that O2 which is hydroxy groups<br>is what gets attacked by acid and the<br>the theory is is that this is meant the<br>fluoride is meant to replace those and<br>produce a compound called flu appetite<br>which is very insoluble and is more<br>resistant to attack and um I think it's<br>been shown that uh that even if it is<br>ingested it's it has a it has got a very<br>small um Improvement for for bone<br>strength but um but I mean that that's<br>the that's the general view about the<br>beneficial the benefits of it anyway<br>yeah anyone<br>um I think the decision about whether<br>something is considered to be an<br>essential element or nutrient or whether<br>it's a medication a lot of these<br>decisions end up being made by Michael<br>can you turn your microphone down please<br>um I think these decisions often get<br>made by courts uh and not necessarily by<br>scientists so just because uh a certain<br>decision's been made in a particular<br>country doesn't necessarily mean that<br>that's the best descriptive for a word I<br>think this idea that fluoride is a<br>medication that's commonly used<br>as a decision from a high court in in<br>Holland um and why we're necessarily<br>considering something to be a medication<br>or not a medication based on the<br>decision of one uh foreign country I'm<br>I'm not quite sure that um and and with<br>regard specifically to whether it's a<br>essential element or or nutrient uh it<br>it depends on whether you think having<br>strong healthy teeth is an essential<br>component of of a healthy lifestyle uh<br>if if you think it's not if you're happy<br>to Havey te fall out and and rot Etc<br>then you'd heavily put it in the<br>category of of not being essential um<br>but if you you know you want to be able<br>to live a long life that allows you to<br>eat food the whole time um then then<br>maybe You' make the consideration that<br>it is an essential element or<br>nutrient thanks Joe do anyone want to<br>add to that onean I think um it would be<br>very hard to prove one way or the other<br>because fluide is ubiquitous uh it's in<br>seawater to 1.2 parts per million um<br>it's it's hard to avoid it so every<br>creature will have uh grown up and<br>involved in an environment containing<br>fluoride um whether that is actually<br>necessary uh I mean one could for<br>perhaps think that since fluo flu<br>appetite is<br>more less soluble than hydroxy appetite<br>that when bones are first formed they're<br>seeded on flu appetite um one could make<br>an argument that it's essential if that<br>mechanism applies so I think it it's<br>going to be very hard to prove one way<br>or the other whether it's essential or<br>not um its benefit comes from<br>fluorapatite being much more resistant<br>to to acid than hydroxy appetite in<br>terms of the teeth um it also has uh<br>perhaps more controversial benefit uh in<br>in terms of bone health in that it uh<br>slows down um loss of<br>calcium in older age so it can be used<br>or has been used as a treatment for<br>osteoporosis um but I I I think that is<br>a much higher doses of fluide and and<br>problems can arise because of that uh<br>some patients have developed Dental<br>sorry not Dental uh skeletal fosis as a<br>result of treatment for<br>osteoporosis um but uh conclude with I<br>think it's going to be very hard to<br>prove one way or the other whether it's<br>an essential element or not it it could<br>quite it quite possibly could be<br>um but it benefits certainly from a<br>scientific point of view<br>chemical<br>incontrovertible oh great<br>Michael microphone Michael okay yes um<br>you need to do you'd need to design very<br>uh careful experiments to specifically<br>exclude fluoride from the diet before<br>you could you know categorically prove<br>whether it was not whether it was or<br>wasn't a an essential element and I<br>think they've done that for things like<br>Silicon they were trying to prove that<br>it's it's you know whether it was<br>essential for the diet but you'd have to<br>do very you know very excruciatingly<br>careful experiments to do that so at<br>this stage I don't know whether anyone's<br>done that yet thanks I think there are<br>many substances which people regard as<br>essential which haven't actually been<br>essential it's hopefully we'll give a a<br>question or a reasonably solid answer<br>then<br>um here's another one that I'm going to<br>throw over to Joe first um can you give<br>a rational and sensible explanation as<br>to why different fluoride compounds have<br>significantly different levels of<br>toxicity yet you claim they all revert<br>to exactly the same fluoride ion and are<br>all directly equivalent all different<br>fluoride compounds should have exactly<br>the same ld50 the fact that they very<br>different seems a little paradoxical<br>Joe um yeah so that's a that's a good<br>question um there are two parts to that<br>one is to think whether a molecule<br>contains the an atom of Florine okay so<br>um and whether that when you take that<br>compound it's likely to dissociate to<br>produce fluoride the the Anon um just to<br>deal with the first part of the question<br>so um the the concept or or idea that a<br>molecule is necessarily<br>sorry um that a molecule is necessarily<br>good or bad for you based on it because<br>it contains certain elements there one<br>you've got to be very careful with<br>um you could make an argument that say<br>something like siren which is a an<br>unnown nasty compound that's often used<br>to explain or commented about uh in the<br>fact that it contains a FL a Florine<br>atom um you could say that that's nasty<br>and it contains Florine and it's evil<br>and bad Etc but it also includes carbon<br>um and if you're going to make that sort<br>of connection you'd then say well okay<br>okay siren I know is bad for me it<br>contains Florine and it contains carbon<br>therefore every molecule that other<br>molecule that contains carbon and I'm<br>not going to try and consume or or I'm<br>going to try and avoid um which is kind<br>of a little bit of a silly statement and<br>the fact that you know humans are made<br>up quite large proportion of us are made<br>of carbon and things like glucose<br>anything we might want to eat has carbon<br>in it as well so we need to be careful<br>distinguishing about whether the product<br>of breakdown is going to be fluoride or<br>not okay so that's I think that's the<br>first part of it um if we're considering<br>um um compounds that are salts these are<br>things that will when we put them into<br>water dissociate to form fluoride um<br>then I think we can start to make some<br>more uh similar comparisons um but we<br>need to First be certain that they're<br>totally dissociating and then of course<br>the other metal that is involved uh in<br>the salt is going to be important okay<br>so uh if you have sodium chloride or<br>calcium fluoride um calcium and fluide<br>sorry calcium and sodium themselves have<br>different ld50 values as well so um<br>whether something's going to be toxic is<br>going to depend not just on the fluoride<br>that's going to be in the compound that<br>you're consuming uh or the associated<br>product but also on the other um the<br>other metals that are can be contained<br>as<br>well Graham perhaps you've got something<br>more to<br>say yeah uh there there are two factors<br>that are very important in ld50 that uh<br>Joe hasn't covered yet one is the<br>solubility of the compound compounds<br>that are insoluble or or only slightly<br>soluble have much higher<br>ld50s than compounds that are are<br>soluble for example cadmium sulfide is<br>uh much less toxic than cadmium oxide<br>and that's all to do they both got<br>cadmium and it's the cadmium that's the<br>giving rise to the toxicity but cadmium<br>sulfide is much less Sol than cadmium<br>oxide and that's the reason there the<br>second thing is that the the masses of<br>the compounds are different ld50 is<br>based on the mass of a compound required<br>uh it's not based on the number of atoms<br>or ions um of of a toxin that are<br>required so comparing in sodium fluoride<br>you say um cium fluoride is very<br>different because cesium is very heavy<br>so cium fluoride has a much higher Mass<br>uh than sodium fluoride so we would<br>expect the ld50 for cesium fluoride to<br>be lot higher than that of sodium fluide<br>so there's two factors in there I don't<br>think things ld50s are are directly<br>comparable uh they're a useful guide for<br>indicating the toxicity or the acute<br>toxicity of a compound but we can't make<br>comparison<br>between okay anybody else with some<br>that no okay well we'll go to a another<br>question in the list then um this is one<br>that I<br>think might be best dressed to carry<br>because we're talking about um perap<br>some of the more psych not psychological<br>but yeah aspects of how people think<br>about issues sorry up the camera um the<br>questions about critical thinking how<br>can we encourage more critical thought<br>when it comes to sources of information<br>most of the evidence I've seen used by<br>the anti fluoride supporters is either<br>misrepresented or not applicable to the<br>situation how can science make its own<br>research more accessible and and easier<br>to understand and probably as someone<br>from outside the faculty you might be<br>able to give us a bit of a a comment<br>I mean I think there are again there's<br>sort of two aspects to that one is how<br>can scientists communicate their<br>information clearly and in the in places<br>that people read um and that's something<br>you know that science writers and<br>Science Education people are working and<br>I'm sure that people are working on<br>trying to communicate that in in a<br>variety of different venues but you know<br>the thing that I guess the thing that<br>interests me is um is how we can how<br>people who have very different positions<br>for probably a variety of different<br>reasons can communicate about this kind<br>do communicate about this kind of really<br>controversial issue because that's what<br>struck me about the issue is that how<br>how polarized people get and therefore<br>and the more polarized they are the less<br>they actually can hear and think<br>critically about their own other people<br>that are on their side and also the<br>people that are on the other side and so<br>I mean my I<br>think that probably the thing that's<br>most likely be helpful is for people to<br>talk and people to talk not just to the<br>people who agree with them but to talk<br>openly with people who disagree with<br>them and try to understand what it is<br>that they're trying to say um now that's<br>a big ask because it's it's difficult to<br>talk with somebody who and especially in<br>this kind of a I think in this<br>particular topic where this diff the<br>sides are so um sometimes so so hostile<br>really to each other that it's hard to<br>to not feel dismissed if you are on one<br>side or the other I think both it comes<br>from both sides so I don't know that's<br>my interest is how can we actually have<br>some dialogue between people who don't<br>agree and see if they can understand<br>what because there are there a variety<br>of different you know pieces to the<br>puzzle to the question some of them are<br>scientific and some of them are are more<br>social<br>ethical and political really um sort of<br>how do people share those views without<br>just sort of yelling at each<br>other guys do you want to add to that do<br>you have some comment to make<br>too I I I a point that I made fairly<br>early on in correspondence to the<br>newspaper was that if people want to<br>make statements about science they<br>really need to supply where the<br>information has come from because<br>otherwise you can make any statement<br>without backing it up if you supply<br>where the information come from then<br>people will be able to look it up El and<br>make their own<br>judgment but at the same time I don't we<br>shouldn't confuse science and<br>ethics um what what I feel about whether<br>water fluoridation should occur is quite<br>separate to how I feel about something<br>which has been scientifically reported<br>in the<br>literature that that it that that's the<br>opinion so<br>I'm guessing we've got quite a bit of<br>work to do on issues like this in terms<br>of getting that dialogue really going<br>yeah I think sorry just to say one thing<br>I think the difficult thing is is how is<br>is that there is so much information out<br>there from all different sides and even<br>as for example me coming to this six<br>months ago thinking well I wonder what<br>you know what is there I assume that<br>there must be some good evidence out<br>there I found it really hard to find you<br>know so I think it's trying to figure<br>out how how one can how does a<br>reasonably intelligent PE person who's<br>not a chemist or a biologist go to this<br>and sort through and think okay well<br>there's these people screaming this and<br>these people screaming this how do I<br>know who do I trust and that's the issue<br>that people have I think that doesn't<br>appear to be an issue that is coming<br>through a bit um looking at the Facebook<br>feed but also in a lot of discussions<br>I've had online that for whatever reason<br>there's a significant amount of distrust<br>um of<br>scientists and a trust more of a trust<br>in what's being said by the group with<br>whom that thinker might associate most<br>closely I don't know what the I you know<br>personally I don't know what the<br>underlying um reason for that is and I<br>certainly don't know how to overcome<br>it yeah I have a couple of comments I've<br>heard um Peter Gman talk on um a totally<br>separate issue uh that's science and and<br>I guess ethics based nothing toide um<br>and it was his opinion that New Zealand<br>Society is particularly immature when it<br>comes to having rational uh discussions<br>about what might be best for us as a<br>nation or us as a people group or or or<br>that to that effect and it's something<br>he's grappled with throughout his tenure<br>as Chief science advisor is how we can<br>have a better more educated discussion<br>uh amongst uh the public uh how we can<br>get scientists to better engage with the<br>public and how we can get the public to<br>be more trusting of s scientists because<br>of course one of the the most dangerous<br>things is you know you hear of some sort<br>of idea something sounds interesting or<br>new the first thing most of us do is<br>jump on the web and do a quick Google<br>search um and unfortunately the top 10<br>hits on Google aren't necessarily going<br>to be the most um reliable uh sources of<br>information U apart from anything you<br>can more or less buy your way up the<br>Google rankings with sufficient money or<br>uh sufficient investment on a good uh<br>website developer who knows about search<br>engine optimization so um we need to be<br>very careful that what's on the top 10<br>you know pages of of of Google isn't<br>necessarily going to be the the highest<br>quality information um I've heard uh<br>actually from from both sides of the<br>fluide argument people saying to do more<br>Google Scholar unless Google um which<br>which I think is interesting and I have<br>heard it from both um both Pro and anti<br>okay we've had a couple come in from<br>from Twitter so I'm going to leave the<br>um the Facebook listing for a moment and<br>bring these two up to it first question<br>says to what extent does using fluoride<br>toothpaste provide protection is it a<br>sufficient replacement for fluoride in<br>one sorry could you repeat that I was<br>trying to read something on screen to<br>what extent using fluoride toothpaste to<br>provide protection is it a sufficient<br>replacement for fluoride in<br>water<br>well difference<br>between water<br>and is that um fluide toothpaste is very<br>much topical it's on the surface now if<br>your teeth are okay that's going to<br>provide a good protection you get some<br>flu appetite incorporated into the<br>surface w of the twoo uh problems come<br>um if you do get Decay because the<br>enamel is is very slow at decaying in<br>acid but the dentine beneath that is<br>much more rapid distribution in acid and<br>so you end up with with a small hole in<br>enamel and then a big sort of Cavern<br>underneath um and that's got no<br>protection if you're using toothpaste<br>the fluoride doesn't get down into the D<br>it's not all the way through the enamel<br>it's water fluid<br>provid protection throughout the tooth<br>there is flu aetate because of the way<br>the tooth develops because of the the<br>blood supply of fluorides to the tooth<br>there's fluoride right the way through<br>so it's slowing down decay in the enamel<br>but not just at the surface all the way<br>through and then there's also some<br>protection for<br>Den um and this occurs even before the<br>teeth have erupted so the SE have fluide<br>in them so if you're um you know a<br>youngster<br>maybe you're not terribly good at<br>cleaning your teeth but kids don't<br>generally like<br>following instructions and so on um the<br>water fluoridation provides from uh<br>protection from the inside whereas uh<br>just toothpaste provides just topical<br>protection just on the on the surface<br>right now so water fluoridation does<br>yeah um I looked up the work of<br>Professor Colin Robinson at leads Dental<br>Institute as a result of a letter that<br>was in today's times and um a lot of his<br>work uh centers around looking at the<br>efficacy of tropically applied<br>fluide and he was um amongst other<br>things pointed out that in areas where<br>plaque is difficult to remove by<br>brushing the even penetration of a<br>thousand parts per million fluoride um<br>was unable to get through the FL so um<br>Bran's comment that systemically applied<br>is better would appear to be supported<br>by that<br>research thanks Maryland that does make<br>a lot of<br>sense um here's a another Twitter<br>question how do New Zealand floridated<br>and non-fluoridated Water Supplies<br>compare I'm presuming in terms of<br>fluoride concentration<br>with a range of natural levels of<br>fluoride and water worldwide now grae I<br>know this is something you did mention<br>in the Tuesday night talks I'm afraid<br>your first up again okay my<br>understanding is that uh fluoridation of<br>water is carried out to up to one per<br>million uh seawater is 1.2 parts per<br>million there are lots of areas of the<br>world that have significantly more than<br>1.5 parts per million these are volcanic<br>areas some in South<br>America China and India in particular uh<br>and those areas U can have um really<br>high levels of fluoride and they cause<br>some really quite horrible health<br>effects there there's no getting away<br>from it fluide at high concentration is<br>quite nasty uh in particular the UNICEF<br>estimate that there are millions of<br>people India and China suffering from<br>skeletal<br>fosis leading to to bad<br>deformities and uh is really really<br>quite a significant problem course<br>removing flua from water is not trivial<br>uh it's important to remember though<br>that these these areas are naturally<br>fluoridated these are significantly<br>higher than what is in what is put into<br>a a water supply um so yeah um some<br>areas um particularly away from volcanic<br>areas we might expect the the the amount<br>of fluoride to be uh very low perhaps<br>less than .1 million areas those near<br>volcanic regions uh we might expect it<br>to be over 20 parts per million and even<br>up to about 50 parts per million so uh<br>the<br>levels we get unnaturally in Zealand<br>are really quite small compared with<br>that so the in other words there's a<br>significant amount of variation in water<br>fluoridation or sorry not water<br>fluoridation concentrations of fluoride<br>globally um some parts of New Zealand it<br>would be quite High because of the<br>volcanic water source of the particular<br>area um but the one reason we fluoridate<br>uh in New Zealand is because the overall<br>the level is lower than than that<br>recognized as providing a<br>benefit that's right the White River<br>has2 CS per ion<br>naturally when water pated here it was<br>brought up to I think 8<br>million so it would just increase the<br>concentration by four<br>times okay thanks gra um Marilyn here's<br>a question coming back to the stats I'm<br>going to read it up to you um Can Dr man<br>Harris please discuss the difference<br>between Canterbury and Orland Hamilton<br>and denen on the Ministry of Health 2001<br>statistics<br>um the question feels that the<br>Wellington Canterbury comparison is<br>invalid can I get back to you I'd have<br>to look that one up you certainly can<br>we'll come back to that one thanks<br>Marilyn um okay here's a question um<br>relating to the possible impact of<br>fluoride on IQ at low levels are there<br>any papers that look at IQ and low<br>levels of fluoride where that levels<br>defined as 7 to one parts per million<br>that is the level of fluoride received<br>in our water<br>supply I don't know if any of you guys<br>not I'm not aware of any uh studies<br>looking at that level of fluide I do<br>know there have been some studies<br>particular in<br>China I uh but those<br>were comparing High fluide concentration<br>low fluide<br>concentration and uh we're talking about<br>5<br>PPM 3.5 PPM that sort of thing is being<br>high I don't know I don't have to hand<br>low Blu ey concentrations there uh I do<br>know that there've been there's been a<br>metanalysis done in the past few years<br>again I don't have that to hand I'll try<br>um here's another one coming from the<br>the Facebook feed SC back I was it's a<br>um relating to is going up and up and up<br>going down and down and down again as<br>well okay this one's about um following<br>on from the the teeth thing again it's<br>relating to fluide please explain how<br>this pharmacolog active substance when<br>ingested supposedly only interferes<br>which is perhaps not quite the right<br>word but with the chemical structure of<br>the teeth when it has access to chemical<br>Twitchy yes so well I mean I mean<br>imagine it's ingested I mean access to<br>every cell in the body I'm not sure but<br>I mean I guess it will harmlessly pass<br>through your stomach wall and go into<br>your bloodstream and uh it may have<br>beneficial influence and and<br>strengthening bone which they've shown<br>be marginal effect but apart from that I<br>can't really answer that question sounds<br>more bical to<br>me come<br>back if I if I can answer that<br>one when when fluide is disolved in<br>water the chloride ion is surrounded by<br>a sphere of water molecules and they're<br>quite tightly held on by the fluoride<br>because fluide ion is very small so for<br>any biological molecule to get to the<br>fluoride it needs to remove all those<br>water molecules and that takes over 500<br>kog per M which is a<br>significant energy loss uh so<br>incorporating fluoride<br>into uh organic molecules is something<br>that that nature finds very very hard<br>indeed there are about 40 plants and<br>some microbes that can make fluo organic<br>molecules from fluoride um but the the<br>mechanisms for<br>incorporating fluoride into organic<br>molecules that exist for chloride and<br>bromide and iodide don't exist for<br>fluide so it's very unlikely that it has<br>uh an effect it's forming organic<br>molecules um the other thing that uh<br>fluide can do is mimic Hydrox side it's<br>about the same size and it has the same<br>as oh minor um and there's a lot of O<br>minus in the body um and of course<br>enzymes are continually interacting with<br>o minus so fluoride can uh inhibit some<br>uh enzymes to a certain extent and and<br>it's certainly in in oral bacteria um<br>but the these are minor uh effects and<br>the the acute toxicity of fluoride comes<br>from uh its affinity for calcium<br>essentially the biology of fluoride is<br>dominated by the Affinity of calcium the<br>reason why it's a toxic at high<br>concentration or high doses is because<br>it takes calcium out the blood it<br>precipitates calcium out the blood we<br>need calcium to Signal between nerves um<br>there are studies that and people use<br>fluide to inhibit and activate certain<br>enzymes it's not actually fluoride in<br>those cases that doing the work it's<br>aluminium fluorides that are doing that<br>now the levels of aluminium fluoride in<br>the body<br>I haven't uh had the chance to to look<br>those up but um people that do the<br>studies usually use uh levels of<br>fluoride that are uh 100 times higher<br>than those that are found in the body um<br>so they're significantly higher to form<br>the the aluminium fluoride also<br>aluminium fluoride in order to form<br>these species we quite a low P so um I I<br>think in in terms of the the enzyme and<br>the biology the organ biology in the<br>body because we're multicell animals<br>because we large uh the effect is is<br>going to be minimal there there is an<br>minimal okay I don't know whether you<br>can<br>haveon A's waving I thought of a comment<br>but I'll make it at the<br>endand okay um I've turned up a study on<br>enamel defects and dental care is in<br>9-year-old children living in<br>fluoridated and nonfluid areas of<br>Oakland uh completed in<br>2009 um and what it found was that the<br>SEC that the children who lived<br>continuously in fluoridated areas were<br>42 times as likely to have dental cheres<br>as children who lived continuously in<br>non fluoridated<br>areas so therefore uh it's greater than<br>50% reduction in Dental car<br>is um now m i I couldn't quite fine you<br>commented about a<br>2001 review or something by the Ministry<br>of<br>Health there's a 2000 review that I've<br>got hold of now it's through one of the<br>commenters on the Facebook page uh<br>fluoridation of Water Supplies and<br>evaluation the epid epidemiological<br>evidence that's the one right okay and<br>they're saying it contradicts what was<br>published in<br>2004 well the process of scien is that<br>it generally advances as time goes by<br>and in fact yeah<br>uh I'm not quite sure what what it is<br>that they want me to talk about is it<br>hip fractures or tooth decay it appears<br>to be tooth uh tooth cares Dental<br>cares right<br>while you have a look I'm going to make<br>the comment that I thought of when when<br>gr was was speaking about um calcium and<br>that the fact that it can be pulled out<br>of your blood it explains to me now why<br>after you've given platelets down at the<br>blood service you drink a um a fizy<br>calcium drink because the uh<br>anticoagulant that's added your blood<br>siphons off the calcium so thank you D<br>so um yeah one of the um commenters on<br>the Facebook page for this Swit everyone<br>listening in would have access to has<br>given a link to that paper uh floration<br>of Water Supplies and evaluation of the<br>recent epidemiological evidence so I've<br>got that I've got that here got that one<br>so I'm guessing sort of one of the<br>responses of our to the question are<br>epidemiological um reviews useful well<br>yes they are because it's the only way<br>we can really look at um pan population<br>effects I'm would say um what they did<br>was commission a review um from ESR um<br>the review looked at all the major um<br>papers that had come in since 1995 for<br>cancer uh they also looked at hip<br>fracture they concluded overall that<br>there was no persuasive evidence of<br>harmful effects from optimal water<br>fluoridation at the level which chaned<br>um was receiving and the evidence has<br>strengthened that there are no serious<br>health risks associated with it they<br>look specifically at hip practice um<br>eight recent studies addressing the<br>question of whether there could be some<br>Association results assuring and<br>strengthen the evidence that there is no<br>increased risk of bone fracture<br>associated with optimal levels of<br>fluoridation of Water Supplies they also<br>looked at cancer uh before studies<br>examining cancer in relation uh to<br>fluoridation published since 1995 no<br>meaningful evidence has been published<br>that there is an association in fact I<br>think Marilyn we looked at a couple last<br>night um from<br>2011 um reinforcing that that finding<br>well the the problem is is that that<br>that the numbers of osteosarcoma cases<br>are so small that um you would have to<br>go somewhere like America where you've<br>got 60 million people who've been<br>drinking fluoridated water for 60 years<br>um to get the kind of data you would<br>want to support that it would be very<br>difficult to do a study like that in New<br>Zealand because of the very low<br>numbers yeah yeah and it's always going<br>to be an issue I think there was a study<br>done um in the states a few years ago<br>now looking at at large amounts of data<br>from major American cities both<br>floridated and unfluoridated that found<br>that once they had um accounted for<br>other variables like ethnicity and<br>social status stuff that there was no<br>made no significant difference between<br>the two states of floration uh I don't<br>have that particular reference to hand<br>but it's one I can pull<br>up um okay here is a question um off the<br>page again<br>to uh look at the the use of Flo is it<br>considered now it is by the panel but I<br>think in this particular case we're not<br>uh the panel's made it clear we're not<br>going for personal opinion here but for<br>um current best practice so is fluide<br>considered to be a drug or medicine when<br>added to water um is anyone aware of the<br>um the current medsafe regulations on<br>that one uh I believe Med safe don't<br>consider it to be a<br>medication they at that what in general<br>or at the concentration in water when<br>it's added to water it's not considered<br>to be<br>medicine it it's it's worth noting that<br>that may differ you know different<br>countries may have different opinions<br>about whether it's consider a medicine<br>or not but my understanding is that Med<br>medicine Alice Allison I just turned up<br>that reference you<br>wanted about Thea and<br>fluide um it's uh it's in the journal<br>2012 uh volume<br>88 and the authors are Michael Levy<br>cler okay and what were the findings of<br>that one I'm just looking at the<br>abstract it it doesn't<br>appear our e ecological analysis<br>suggests that the water fluoridation<br>status in the continent Al us has no<br>influence on osteosarcoma incidence<br>rates during childhood and<br>Adolescence uh they Ed the data from<br>it um we've got one more here I think<br>for carry which is related to the the<br>previous question um every time I hear<br>the ethical argument<br>it gets diverted into claims about<br>science which may be unsupported at<br>times we keep saying fluoridation is an<br>ethical question not a scientific one<br>but informed by the science is it<br>possible to have that ethical debate if<br>sence no I think I mean I think that's<br>the one of the problems is that you have<br>to have you have to work from the same<br>assumptions you could discuss the<br>ethical I think one can discuss the sort<br>of Social and ethical questions but some<br>of the that depends on whether you<br>assume whether you believe that for<br>example fluoride is has a beneficial<br>effect because it changes the answer you<br>know if you don't believe that it has a<br>beneficial effect then that would change<br>the answer in ter if you guys didn't<br>believe it had a beneficial effect I<br>suspect you wouldn't be arguing to do it<br>um so so it is sort of founded first on<br>believe on a c on um having the same<br>um assumptions about what's helpful and<br>and whether there's a a harmful effect<br>so you can't really disentangle them<br>completely it's like a stepwise you have<br>to maybe that's why the discussion is<br>about the science because that's the<br>foundation but um and then if people<br>agree on the science then you can<br>discuss the ethical social political you<br>know individual rights versus Collective<br>um benef health benefits and that sort<br>of thing but the problem is that people<br>are arguing about the about the science<br>science and the fact and this is<br>something Peter gluton said um prior to<br>the tribunal in Hamilton that uh that<br>the science was effectively settled and<br>I think people haven't sort of the word<br>effectively slipped under the radar but<br>I think it's it's also important to<br>bring in Marilyn's um point and address<br>the comment that you made as well the<br>science is actually quite a dynamic<br>process and we do re-evaluate positions<br>all the time in the light of the<br>evidence that comes to hand science ever<br>settled I mean no well no science has<br>ever firmly settled and that's probably<br>one of the reasons that people may find<br>it actually a really frustrating thing<br>to talk about because we don't agree all<br>the time or we change our mind but I<br>think it's really important that and it<br>might be a good time to finish because<br>we're pretty much out of time um that<br>you know if you're doing science<br>properly it isn't a matter of belief<br>it's a matter of looking at all the<br>available evidence weighing it up and<br>coming to a decision in the light of of<br>that evidence as soon as we start<br>bringing belief into it then we're<br>really into a whole another ball game<br>entir um people can I thank you very<br>we've been given a little sign that says<br>we have to stop can I thank you all very<br>much indeed for um coming along and<br>participating I suspect we've probably<br>um not answered everybody's questions uh<br>you know there have been questions here<br>that I haven't been able to bring to<br>your attention um but it's been a really<br>good uh experience to do this with you<br>and um thank you very much indeed for<br>for coming Marilyn I'll see you at</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
