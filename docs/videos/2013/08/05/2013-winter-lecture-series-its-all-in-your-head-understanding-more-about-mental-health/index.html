WORLD fashion co-founder and CEO Denise L'Estrange-Corbet will talk about living with depression and Dr Nicola Starkey from Psychology will talk about her research in understanding the effects of TBI, perhaps caused by car accidents, sports, assaults and falls, on the developing brains of children and young people.  This free public lecture takes place on August 14 at the University of Waikato's Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts. <br><br>The 2013 Winter Lecture Series runs each Wednesday evening throughout August, 6-7pm.

name's Kathy Colborne and I'm an<br>associate professor of History here at<br>the University of w when we think about<br>the history of mental health in New<br>Zealand people often uh refer to large<br>institutions where people were locked<br>away forever never to be released and<br>often by cruel and controlling family<br>members but in fact when we do think<br>about mental health and when we look<br>more closely at the records of families<br>and patients in uh psychiatric hospitals<br>in the past we find a very different<br>story emerging and in the present we<br>need to go much further to understand<br>how our current treatments of mental<br>health and the experiences of those who<br>are suffering from uh problems to do<br>with mental health uh can be understood<br>in the the light of the history of<br>mental health in this country given that<br>around one in five people suffers from a<br>mental health problem in their lifetime<br>that means that we're surrounded by<br>people in our community who have some<br>form of uh health problem in this regard<br>and mental health is now treated in the<br>community rather than inside large<br>institutions so we need to think about<br>ways in which we incorporate those<br>understandings of Community Mental<br>Health Care and also how we see those in<br>the light of of our histories of mental<br>health if you come to the winter lecture<br>series and listen to a number of us<br>talking about mental health you will<br>hear a range of perspectives including<br>uh from me some discussion around how<br>the history of mental health is actually<br>rather different from the the kind of<br>common perception of of the treatment of<br>mental health in the past I will talk<br>quite a lot about how institutions were<br>places where people came and went where<br>families visited and institutions with<br>which families interacted and were quite<br>involved so I think we can expect to<br>have uh quite a different set of ideas<br>emerging from this winter lecture series<br>around mental health I'm Nicholas St<br>here and I'm a senior lecturer in the<br>psychology department we've um recently<br>or actually 34 years ago completed a<br>large scale project looking at the um<br>how common traumatic brain injury is in<br>New Zealand and also what the longer<br>term effects of traumatic brain injury<br>are until we did our research most<br>studies overseas and New Zealand were<br>focus on people who've been admitted to<br>hospital um they tended to focus on<br>people with more severe injuries and we<br>didn't know much about what happened to<br>people who had quite mild injuries the<br>types of things like concussion and<br>bangs on the heads that people get from<br>Falls and fairly minor car crushes so we<br>wanted to know more about the effects of<br>minor head injury and also how frequent<br>it was here I think um probably not only<br>in this country I think worldwide one of<br>the biggest challenges is that traumatic<br>brain injury or head injury is actually<br>unseen so um probably one of the biggest<br>issues is getting people to understand<br>and realize that a brain injury or a<br>concussion can have long-term effects<br>and a person you meet in the street if<br>their speech is slurred it may not be<br>because their drink it could actually be<br>because they'd Had a Brain Injury um I<br>think one of the um one of our study<br>participants actually said said to us<br>that they'd been advised to go back to<br>work with a bandage around their head so<br>that their colleagues would remember<br>that they'd had a brain injury and not<br>assumed that this person was Fit and<br>Well and ready to go back to work I<br>think we need to I think people need to<br>be more aware of the possible<br>consequences of head injury so even a<br>mild head injury can actually cause some<br>quite long-term effects so about 20% of<br>people even after a mild injury suffer<br>quite um can have ongoing symptoms<br>headaches um depression memory loss<br>concentration and fatigue problems and<br>so even after a relatively mild bump on<br>the head there can be ongoing issues and<br>these issues are quite often<br>underrecognized and maybe not linked to<br>um the original injury and I think<br>probably one of the most important<br>things particularly in relation to sport<br>if you get a concussion you need to rest<br>until it's fully resolved because<br>usually a second concussion on top of<br>the first will actually increase<br>symptoms quite dramatically I think in<br>this country well I think um everywhere<br>basically improved um recognition of the<br>effects mild TBI or the effects of<br>traumatic brain injury and head injury<br>generally not only from the person who<br>suffers it but also from the community<br>at large and also um provid better<br>information so that people know what the<br>consequences of brain injury are our<br>research so far has shown that um boys<br>and men are more um at risk of TBI the<br>highest rate of brain injury is actually<br>in those under the age of 34 so someone<br>who has a brain injury can basically<br>live the rest of their lives with<br>ongoing symptoms um I think we also need<br>to be aware that about 30% of brain<br>injuries were actually in children and<br>it used to be thought that children<br>recovered better from brain injuries and<br>adults but more recently it's been shown<br>that um a brain injury during childhood<br>um its effects can be much longer<br>lasting than those in adulthood because<br>it can alter how the brain normally<br>grows and one of the big consequences of<br>brain injury is actually mental illness<br>particularly depression and anxiety and<br>particularly in people who suffered from<br>depression and anxiety prior to their<br>injuries so I think I study and actually<br>most of the research to date shows that<br>um if you had anxiety depression prior<br>to a brain injury or if you know someone<br>who had anxiety depression prior to a<br>brain injury the chances of the brain<br>injury triggering anxiety and depression<br>are really quite high and so targeting<br>the right people for treatment post<br>injury and actually ensuring they get<br>early treatment is actually quite useful<br>hopefully the lecture will be<br>interesting to people from all sorts of<br>different backgrounds um traumatic brain<br>injury and head injury is something that<br>affects everyone and I think most people<br>in New Zealand will know someone who has<br>been concussed at one time or another<br>hopefully I'll tell you a bit about how<br>common it is uh what the causes are and<br>also the consequences and how we can<br>help people with brain injury we look<br>forward to seeing as many of you who can<br>come to our winter lecture series<br>focused on mental health and head<br>injuries at the gallaga uh academy of<br>performing arts at the University of<br>wadoo August the 14th from 6: till 700<br>p.m. and there will be an opportunity<br>for questions so lots of really<br>interesting discussion will emerge<br>please<br>come</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
