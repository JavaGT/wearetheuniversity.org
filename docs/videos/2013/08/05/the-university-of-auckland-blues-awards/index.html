The blue colours of Oxford and Cambridge Universities came to symbolise sporting excellence. The earliest recorded Blue in New Zealand was awarded in 1922 to H.J. Wiley for Athletics. The tradition has been firmly embraced since 1930.<br>While a Blues Award has traditionally been a sporting accolade, there are now three categories of the award at The University of Auckland:<br>- Sports<br>- Arts<br>- Service and Leadership<br><br>Find out more: http://www.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/blues-awards</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>for any student to achieve a great<br>success or to exercise an extraordinary<br>talent<br>and to study at the same time<br>there's no mean feat<br>to make some quite exceptional people<br>the blues award is i mean it is a<br>tradition but i think it's also about<br>recognition for a particular project<br>that's what it's about it's about<br>celebrating student success<br>name blue comes from oxford and<br>cambridge who each year have their<br>annual rome race so the idea of a blue<br>represented the blue which were the<br>colours the cambridge blue and the<br>oxford blue<br>sporting blues were first introduced<br>on this campus in i think about 1922<br>the arts award didn't happen until the<br>and we've sort of been talking<br>for some time about whether you<br>recognise people for leadership and so<br>campus life have come up with the<br>concept of a leadership<br>award i think that's really recognises<br>those people that<br>do something innovative or progress<br>their activity and whether it's within<br>it's within the community but it could<br>be the university community or outside<br>the university<br>i was actually encouraged by staff<br>members in the film department to<br>nominate myself<br>the nomination was for my master's<br>thesis short film called milken honey<br>inspired by my mother's experience<br>during the dawn raid period<br>so i'm the current new zealand senior<br>women's high dump champion um and i'm<br>hoping to get to the commonwealth games<br>next year in glasgow and the olympics in<br>2016. being awarded sportsblue was a<br>fantastic sign of recognition from the<br>university i feel it was great to kind<br>of receive something that maybe set me<br>apart from the rest<br>it gave me confidence and it made me<br>feel as though i was moving in the right<br>direction it's just been kind of like<br>another thing to add to any of my<br>applications or<br>has maybe could give me that<br>self-confidence and belief that i can<br>apply for things with that is a really<br>good sound backing<br>i really enjoyed the ceremony and it was<br>fantastic just to be around a whole<br>bunch of other people that have excelled<br>in their chosen field and just to speak<br>with them and hear about all of their<br>achievements it's really<br>amazing to see<br>the<br>students receiving their awards and i<br>think out of all the recipients they<br>represent the diversity of culture<br>that's seen<br>within the university<br>this is a huge university there is a lot<br>of talent at this university there are<br>many more students that i'm sure that<br>are eligible and should apply people may<br>not be<br>as confident to do things like nominate<br>themselves<br>but i would definitely encourage them to<br>do it we've just got to get out there<br>and embrace some of these opportunities<br>to be recognised which are things like<br>the blues award you've got nothing to<br>lose you may as well put in the<br>application and</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
