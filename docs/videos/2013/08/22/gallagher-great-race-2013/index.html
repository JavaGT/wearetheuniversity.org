Starting at Ann Street with the finish line at the Ferry Bank (Grantham St), the festival sees the two premier University of Waikato crews -- men and women -- challenging two other Universities from across the globe.<br><br>The penultimate race of the festival has the three women's crews racing for the Bryan Gould Cup. The final race is between the three men's crews who race for the coveted Harry Mahon Trophy.<br><br>We caught up with our Mens and Womens teams this week for a quick chat about the upcoming race and the team members involved this year.<br><br>Be sure to catch the action at the Ferry Bank (Grantham St) on September 8, 2013.

We hope to see you there!</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>they won last year pretty much a lot of<br>them same crew so i'm expecting them to<br>i think currently i've got five win<br>three loss so<br>i'm andrew mccowan so i'm the women's<br>head coach i'm ross tom i'm the<br>head coach for the waikato men's crew<br>and this will be my eighth<br>i expect the best element<br>uh four of them are currently at the<br>world champs in various boats couple in<br>the eight<br>and the pier<br>a couple of the girls just got back from<br>under 23 worlds and<br>there's a couple doing under 21 racing<br>as well<br>and we've also got a new zealand juniors<br>representative as well so so even though<br>they're young they'll be very<br>experienced and a lot of them have done<br>the race you know a few times um this<br>year's crew is is pretty exciting um i<br>think of the eight years i've been<br>involved it's it's on paper it's<br>probably the<br>most exciting group we've got<br>uh three athletes returning from the uh<br>the world champs<br>hopefully uh<br>by the time the the race comes on we'll<br>have a couple of world champions out of<br>that that'll be great um we've also got<br>reserve for the for the elite team this<br>year um<br>but the exciting thing is the uh the<br>three um under 23 world champions from<br>the new zealand men's eight<br>they come to us um<br>having won the world champs recently and<br>so a lot of experience in the eight<br>so we've actually got five<br>or six with the reserve of the elite<br>team<br>members of 23s or<br>or the elite team which which certainly<br>uh we've got a lot of experience of the<br>of the great race already um we've got<br>uh tobias where canada has in his third<br>year uh his captain this year we've<br>actually got two past captains still<br>involved in the race which uh which is<br>really good um caleb sheppard the<br>coxswain's had vast experience on the uh<br>on the river with hamilton boys high<br>initially when he was at secondary<br>school<br>he did the girls race a couple of years<br>back and uh<br>excited and chomping at the bit for this<br>year's great race<br>hi i'm ellie smith and i'm part of the<br>waikato great race team for 2013. we're<br>racing on the 8th of september down at<br>the local waco river down grantham<br>street it'd be great if you guys come<br>and have a look down there uh our team's<br>got some really great rollers and this<br>year half of them are actually overseas<br>and i'm in korea the world champs so<br>they can get back to a little bit later<br>but we can't wait them to get back and<br>get stuck into some training<br>i've just been over in austria for under<br>23 world champs and a few of the other<br>girls have just represented new zealand<br>in australia for the under-21s so we've<br>got a great team so we're looking<br>forward to race day<br>cambridge and sydney are the only two<br>crews that have beaten us in the past so<br>they'll both be both strong crews and<br>from what i've heard there's olympians<br>in here and world champions so no doubt<br>it's going to be some fast competition<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
