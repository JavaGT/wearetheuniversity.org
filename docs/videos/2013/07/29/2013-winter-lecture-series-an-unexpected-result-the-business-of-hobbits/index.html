But what exactly are the benefits to the region and how do we continue to capitalise on this? And what did people really think of the movie? <br><br>Join Manager of Matamata PR Association, Sue Whiting; the University of Waikato's Dr Carolyn Michelle who is researching reactions to the Hobbit movie; and Hamilton and Waikato Tourism CEO Kiri Goulter, on how the Hobbit movie is changing lives and making us money.<br><br>Free public lecture, Wednesday 7 August.<br>Time: 6-7pm<br>Venue: Dr John Gallagher Concert Chamber, Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, University of Waikato. Parking in Gate 2B, Knighton Rd.<br>For more information please see http://bit.ly/10VuBQA.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I'm Sue Whiting I'm the manager of the<br>metamata public relations Association<br>which is a little Community organization<br>and predominantly manages them<br>would you say it has been based pretty<br>much on the rural sector very strong<br>Dairy and significant Thoroughbred maybe<br>a visit to the first town Museum and a<br>walk to the wairu falls was about as<br>touristy as it could get over the years<br>but in 1999 of course we were very lucky<br>that Peter Jackson chose the Alexander's<br>Farm 20 minutes away and the whole thing<br>changed from there and it was most<br>remarkable thing from day one away we<br>went the demand was massive the<br>information seemed to became the<br>ticketing agent and from then there was<br>just bus loads going out from there so<br>still the locals still struggled a<br>little bit about what it was all about<br>and I often had people coming and<br>talking to me about how we should<br>promote the town completely oblivious to<br>the to the masses waiting to get on the<br>bus but our growth and this little<br>information center went from about 50<br>visitors a year pretty much 80 percent<br>of<br>um to 2002 it doubled to about<br>2004 we increased to 367<br>000 people through the visitor<br>information center door so it was a<br>dramatic thing it took a little time but<br>it certainly<br>released<br>one first thing that we did was put up<br>the welcome to hobby<br>and that has become one of the most<br>photographed signs and I would suggest<br>we've got a little hobbit hole on the<br>information center with a little grass<br>or basic corner but it worked for us the<br>funny thing was in 2003 The Business<br>Association we we had a little promotion<br>when we painted up all the members<br>Windows to look like little unique<br>Hobbit<br>and they lasted all summer but funnily<br>enough it was the retailers that started<br>scratching them off really quickly you<br>know they were they were over there so<br>there was still that sort of mindset of<br>um you know I love it but um<br>the accommodation providers were having<br>10 percent increase<br>hugely due to visitors from Hampton a<br>new Motel was built another motelated<br>some luxury units all of them the rest<br>of the motels actually changed hands so<br>it was an opportunity people were seeing<br>um and we're here at the information<br>center built an extension a 90 000<br>extension<br>um to the information center because<br>we're becoming a bit crowded in here<br>um and still the people were starting to<br>talk about it there was starting to be<br>um that sort of feel that things needed<br>to change within our tourists are<br>after the Lord of the Rings and and<br>people singing all these people coming<br>to town there was talk for such a long<br>time worldwide about whether the movie<br>would ever be The Hobbit would ever be<br>filmed we started to get a little<br>excited in town here and then finally<br>the news came that they would be<br>building rebuilding the city I guess the<br>key turning point was Ring Scenic tours<br>had always in the past offered open days<br>at this time they opened an open day<br>um I think we put through 1600 locals<br>went out to see it and they could<br>finally understand that there was no<br>more just holes and Hills there was to<br>speak<br>and they really got pain of it but of<br>course the big thing that happened for<br>us was we were getting busier and busier<br>although we were no longer the salt<br>ticketing Angel you could go to the farm<br>there just wasn't enough room in here<br>and we had a vision of creating<br>something that put us in association<br>with the films and finally after being<br>turned down a couple of times we finally<br>got approval and Dan henna who was the<br>Oscar<br>came to us with a design of our<br>beautiful Gatehouse which was built and<br>on 29th of November<br>last year 2012 so that has been a<br>phenomenal success and I think everybody<br>can see what it's all about people stop<br>going by to to take photos of our<br>Gatehouse it certainly has also helped<br>visitation to the movie scene as well so<br>it's been phenomenal I think we've now<br>thank you well I'll be honest it wasn't<br>actually an<br>we've done everything everything<br>particularly with the Gatehouse to stop<br>traffic 10 years ago yes it was<br>unexpected I think I did my predictions<br>on maybe 10 a day going to the set<br>um that was just completely blown out of<br>the water within a couple of months<br>these days it's hundreds of<br>100 Sunny basis but I from our door<br>numbers I can tell you that 1967<br>000 people let's call it two million<br>have come to mathematics purely because<br>um and I guess you look at that and even<br>if even if a million of them just took a<br>photo and drove by of those other half<br>bottled water I mean it adds about 1.75<br>million to our economy petrol you know a<br>few of those brought some petrol you<br>know we're talking about five million<br>dollars so the the economic benefits<br>have just been wonderful<br>there's business confidence we now have<br>more cafes Robert Harris right beside us<br>Subway across the road so they've all<br>given been given confidence their<br>business and I also get a lot of people<br>coming asking me for details for their<br>business plans because they're looking<br>at opening businesses or buying<br>businesses major growth we had a new<br>Motel<br>built straight after they heard that The<br>Hobbit was going to be released<br>um<br>tremendous growth for motels and and a<br>lot of the work that was done was done<br>too much<br>my prediction is that the hobarton movie<br>seat will be the biggest tourist<br>attraction in New Zealand particularly<br>over the next five years the results<br>have been very very good for us in power<br>and they will continue to be and suit<br>them in our Gatehouse Cycles we just<br>invite everybody to come back and visit<br>us and take a photo of Campus so I hope<br>you can come along to the lecture which<br>is on their 7th August<br>we can give a little bit more<br>information about how our small town has<br>experienced this phenomena and certainly<br>answer anybody's question so I hope to</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
