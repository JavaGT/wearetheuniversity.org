Those opposed to deep sea oil drilling say New Zealand is not prepared for the risks involved, which could create widespread economic and environmental problems.<br><br>University of Waikato experts in coastal/ocean science, law, iwi perspective and tourism economics will discuss these issues in a Google hangout.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be

miles off the<br>coast of raglan<br>it's an emotive issue and there are<br>facts and counterfeits flying in all<br>directions<br>today we have scientists legal and<br>economic experts and an academic<br>activist in our hangout to see if we can<br>get some clarity<br>around this deep-sea drilling situation<br>well if professor chris baderzold<br>thought he was coming back to new<br>zealand for the easy life<br>um that plan was soon shattered in<br>october 2011 when the arena ran aground<br>chris holds the inaugural bay of plenty<br>regional council chair and coastal<br>science based in toronto he also heads<br>the coastal marine group in the faculty<br>of science and engineering at the<br>university of waikato<br>he has been closely involved in arena<br>recovery and is still working on aspects<br>of the environmental recovery<br>over in the bay willem de lange<br>is an oceanographer who studies coastal<br>hazards and their management<br>and has also been involved in the arena<br>recovery program<br>he has had several decades experience as<br>an expert witness on coastal issues<br>laying out the evidence from a<br>scientific perspective<br>from law we have professor barry barton<br>his field is energy natural resources<br>and environmental<br>law barry has worked on electricity<br>markets and regulation<br>and energy policy generally he's<br>involved in interdisciplinary research<br>on energy efficiency energy use in<br>households and insulation rental<br>accommodation<br>and most recently he has been carrying<br>out the research for a new legal regime<br>for carbon capture and storage<br>former waikato university lecturer in<br>geography and i think<br>honorary lecturer as from next year is<br>angeline greensell<br>she is the environmental spokesperson<br>for the tai nui hapu of faingaroa raglan<br>co-chairperson of na hapu o te uru<br>that's the west coast customary fishing<br>forum<br>whose rouhey moana extends from port<br>waikato to just south of moko and out<br>200 miles<br>she is currently dealing with the<br>anadayako oil exploration<br>issues concerning the west coast<br>communities and she's formulating<br>submissions against the ttr application<br>for seabed mining of the taranaki coast<br>and<br>i just forgot we do have dan marsh<br>environmental<br>economist and natural resource economist<br>with 30 years experience as a researcher<br>consultant and lecturer<br>in recent years dan has specialized in<br>non-market valuation<br>that allows policy makers to consider<br>both the costs and the benefits of<br>changes in the quality<br>of environmental and natural resources a<br>lot of his work has been in the<br>agricultural sector and in fresh water<br>quality<br>and he was involved in the landmark<br>appeal in the environment court<br>relating to horizon's one general plan<br>so if we start first of all i'd like to<br>start with willem<br>who has been talking quite a lot to<br>various media<br>on the situation out in the water and so<br>william i'm wondering if you can just<br>sort of lay out for us set the scene<br>on what the end what handako is doing<br>off the coast<br>okay well originally the area has been<br>surveyed using acoustic means to see<br>what the structures are below the seabed<br>that gives the various companies an idea<br>of what the<br>layers of sediments are like what their<br>likely ages are and therefore the<br>potential to have hydrocarbons<br>what enandako is doing is now doing test<br>drilling to<br>ground truth the information to actually<br>find out what is there that can then be<br>related to the computer models of<br>of the structures that are there in<br>terms of what that's<br>defined it's most likely to be gas<br>and some levels of condensate and<br>based on what we know from the fields<br>further to the south it's also going to<br>be at low pressure<br>so it's looking to see what's there<br>it's not producing oil or specifically<br>oil drilling as such<br>and in terms of what's happened off the<br>new zealand coast it's not the deepest<br>drilling that's happened in the past<br>what is different this time is it is<br>being done by an oil company and not a<br>why does that make such a difference<br>willem<br>well from the scientific perspective it<br>doesn't at all but it certainly<br>has an emotive um aspect and that<br>something like the three days resolution<br>coming here to investigate climate<br>change by drilling at four and a half<br>thousand meters<br>is viewed somewhat differently to an oil<br>company drilling<br>at a thousand or fifteen hundred meters<br>for potentially<br>i'd like to bring in angeline now um<br>because she can only be with us for a<br>short while<br>in the first instance they said that<br>they weren't consulted so<br>how did you respond when you heard what<br>was going on<br>well we found out through the media that<br>anadarko was coming<br>i think the thing that distracted people<br>was the fact it's called the taranaki<br>basin<br>the romney something or other which of<br>terms we're not familiar with<br>so we found out they were going to be<br>drilling off raglan i immediately<br>contacted<br>both ellen say through petty mundra<br>who's with the<br>ministry for petroleum and minerals and<br>managed to get some contact addresses<br>for people to contact and invite them to<br>regular<br>it was short notice but i think when<br>anything happens out there at sea it's<br>going to be short notice as well<br>so of course they couldn't come and we<br>put out another invite<br>and again it's been turned down they now<br>want something at night<br>in a safe space and who is the<br>facilitator and a whole lot of<br>rules for engagement uh we're still<br>demanding that anadarko talk to us and<br>i'm going to wellington today um<br>i'm going to be trying to get access to<br>information<br>which was not part of the eia they were<br>just blank pages so there's a whole lot<br>of missing information<br>the contingency plan but in terms of<br>maori no we weren't consulted<br>and we demanded me because our name is<br>actually under the rma<br>section 35 we are one of the<br>organizations that is supposed to be<br>consulted on environmental medicine for<br>coast<br>and just bringing you in there barry um<br>can you sort of enlighten us then about<br>the rules around consultation<br>yeah sure uh those are found in the uh<br>crown minerals act uh companies like<br>anadarko have to have an exploration<br>permit under the crown minerals act<br>and the minerals program that covers<br>so there's a definite legal obligation<br>there<br>it was tested last year in the<br>courts uh in relation to ngati peru<br>about the nature of that of that<br>angeline i'm wondering if the drilling<br>goes ahead how did you negotiate<br>to get something out of it for marley<br>we really don't we would just want them<br>out of the country we really don't want<br>anything<br>affecting our coastal to us we have a<br>place that we've had for generations to<br>look after we have a duty of care to<br>look after that space for future<br>generations<br>we see this as a threat that we even<br>though they say it's low risk<br>we've seen what's happened in the<br>mexican gulf when things go horribly<br>wrong<br>this is only the first drill site there<br>are a number of others around the<br>country that they're going to be<br>investigating<br>and we really need to put this under<br>scrutiny the government's<br>processes are totally flawed so for us<br>to get anything out of it we're really<br>not interested<br>in getting anything out of it except<br>perhaps the fact that we've just been to<br>the waitangi tribunal on this particular<br>issue<br>on the exclusive zone on a whole lot of<br>things and it seems to be that it's a<br>waste of time using these processes<br>if in fact this is just going ahead as<br>we're speaking as we're trying to go<br>through processes<br>so we don't expect anything out of this<br>uh oil gas anything else what we're<br>seeing is the ship is going to take the<br>oil take it offshore processes<br>and we'll be buying it back at two<br>dollars a barrel or a little whatever it<br>is<br>have you um consulted with other ewe<br>and is there a sort of a path you can<br>take to<br>you know get what you want out of this<br>well<br>we are actually having meetings and<br>we've got a big one coming up in raglan<br>on the 8th of uh<br>december with the coastal people of the<br>west coast because they have not been<br>consulted there's certain elements<br>within like what they call a mandated<br>authority<br>like waikato or maybe naita who great<br>big organizations that may<br>be uh talked to but in terms of the<br>people affected which are coastal hapu's<br>along the coast and coastal eawy we're<br>out of that loop<br>we seem to be ignored and so um<br>we will be having meetings with them<br>we've actually put out invitations for<br>them to come and live<br>and we'll be actually working out what<br>we're going to do there have been offers<br>of boats to go out there<br>what that does i have no idea but it is<br>our customary fishing space so it looks<br>like people might be starting to think<br>about the suiting rights<br>are you surprised by the support you've<br>received across the country<br>i think that people in this country a<br>lot of them especially the youth i'm<br>really pleased to see young people that<br>are aware when you look at the slogans<br>they're putting out there it's making<br>people think about the issue<br>and this is coming up to our summer<br>people come to beaches in new zealand<br>they go<br>there to have their holidays anything<br>that's going to threaten that<br>is not only going to threaten the beach<br>it's going to threaten the economy the<br>environment the people the culture<br>everything<br>so for us it would be a huge loss if<br>something happened<br>and this is an offshore company who<br>hasn't had the decency to come and talk<br>to tangata fenua<br>going out there using our spaces without<br>consent<br>so we have some issues as unresolved<br>business with anadarko<br>it seems to me that um well the talk<br>that i've heard<br>is that if there were to be god forbid<br>an oil spill<br>it's a long way offshore we can't see it<br>you know um and and the sort of spill<br>would not be like we saw<br>in the gulf do you buy that i don't buy<br>that at all if you talk to the surfers<br>and people who study the swells i think<br>there was greenpeace put out a swell<br>model we haven't yet seen anadarkos i'm<br>really interested in seeing what these<br>looks like<br>it was just a strip down the coast and<br>that was supposed to be sufficient<br>didn't have anything about wind currents<br>anything else that actually<br>highlights for us what is actually going<br>to happen but from what i've seen<br>in oil spills elsewhere it's going to<br>have an impact a huge impact i mean the<br>government's talking about the maui<br>dolphin the new legislation<br>well that's a joke given the fact that<br>the west coast is where the habitat even<br>though this thing is happening offshore<br>the sea is something that is<br>interrelated it's not going to sit out<br>there the migratory species come through<br>the inshore<br>so there's a whole lot of interaction<br>that happens and we will be affected by<br>it<br>now greenpeace have said they're going<br>to court would you<br>work with greenpeace in this instance we<br>are working with greenpeace we are<br>actually working with chasm the<br>kiwis against seabed mining greenpeace<br>anyone who wants to work with us we've<br>had calls from piha that they're willing<br>to work<br>and we will definitely be supporting<br>greenpeace on this issue because i agree<br>with them there are holes in this whole<br>process well thank you angelina i know<br>you have to run now but um we appreciate<br>you<br>appreciate you coming and making the<br>time and giving us this perspective<br>and um we will have some more questions<br>possibly if you're going<br>if people have questions they can email<br>them to us and we can forward them to<br>you if you're happy with that no that's<br>fine thank you i'm sorry that i have to<br>miss this because it looks like it's<br>going to be a really interesting debate<br>can i could you pick it up on google<br>later<br>yes you can great thank you very much<br>everyone okay thanks angeline<br>well just carrying on now barry if we<br>can go back to you<br>um what role does the rma play in all<br>this if at all<br>and the eec act how does that you know<br>work with this<br>the rma works out to the<br>12 mile limit about 22 kilometers out so<br>uh what uh this current drilling program<br>is beyond that now it's covered by the<br>uh the what i'll call the eez<br>environmental effects act<br>um for the exclusive economic zone uh it<br>is relatively recent uh as passed in<br>2012<br>and really in key ways is still coming<br>into force<br>so it's it's the the environmental<br>control is under the eez act and<br>essentially what<br>uh greenpeace and environmental defense<br>society are saying<br>is that it appears that uh the<br>requirements of<br>of that act have not been complied with<br>in relation to<br>a an emergency response plan<br>and do you know if if they have um<br>those things have been addressed in the<br>in in the plan<br>um or do you think this is going to play<br>out in court<br>i can't say for sure what's in the plan<br>we don't know and the whole point<br>the whole question is that they have<br>prepared one uh but it hasn't been<br>um it apparently hasn't been disclosed<br>uh certainly not the public<br>and uh quite likely not to the<br>environmental protection authority<br>that is the regulator so can we trust<br>our regulator to do its work properly<br>and check that the emergency response<br>plan is everything it should be<br>well we don't know um so between<br>uh the uh epa and the um<br>maritime new zealand uh one would look<br>for better really<br>in the way that our regulators work<br>under this<br>we just had a question come in and it<br>might be for you again barry how long<br>does the new zealand government intend<br>to continue to impose law changes<br>relating to matters of national<br>and international importance that are in<br>total conflict with international and<br>national<br>environmental instruments and are those<br>law changes<br>legal if the prescribed legal format was<br>not<br>followed yeah well<br>as i can't speak to the new zealand<br>government um the underlying assumptions<br>that that what we're doing is<br>is in contravention of international law<br>uh a lot of that would be<br>uh pretty much uh uh contestable<br>uh um uh<br>by and large uh what we've seen in the<br>eez act being enacted<br>you're seeing a major piece of<br>legislation which brings us better into<br>compliance<br>uh and in delivering better results<br>in that even a couple of years ago such<br>operations were largely unregulated<br>uh which was appalling actually so yeah<br>we've got a ways to go but we have come<br>assistance<br>thanks barry dan this might be for you<br>there's a question coming<br>is there a tax on carbon for the oil<br>extraction industry to pay<br>forward the damage oil burning slash<br>poisoning does to third parties<br>yeah thanks for that um the short answer<br>is<br>um there isn't uh a tax um<br>but basically you you can you can uh<br>sort of tackle that issue either through<br>what's called emissions trading<br>or through attacks and there's been a<br>big debate about which one is best<br>so i mean going back a few years the<br>labour government in new zealand decided<br>to go for emissions trading<br>and introduce the new zealand emissions<br>trading scheme<br>which in principle would mean that<br>people who burn carbon would be paying<br>for<br>the cost of that or in economics we say<br>they'd be paying for the externality<br>um so that was the idea but um<br>unfortunately for various reasons the<br>market has collapsed the price of units<br>in the new zealand emissions trading<br>scheme is very low<br>so effectively with the current state of<br>the new zealand emission trading scheme<br>people wouldn't they they wouldn't have<br>to pay very much um<br>but i i certainly think that actually uh<br>a tax would be a good idea<br>attacks on carbon to make sure that um<br>that uh the time the people who are um<br>extracting the oil or burning it do do<br>do face that cost which they're imposing<br>on others i'm wondering chris<br>if you've had experience and sort of oil<br>um<br>damage i guess with reina how do you<br>feel about that<br>uh with respect to finding resources to<br>remediate environmental cleanups um<br>with rena i think new zealand's been<br>very fortunate and that the arena owners<br>and the insurers<br>have backed a great deal of the<br>remediation work that's been going on<br>since october 2011 and indeed into the<br>future and they've undertaken<br>to stick to that with respect to<br>cleaning up<br>debris fields and associated<br>contaminants around the reef<br>as well as funding much of the wider<br>clean up activity along with maritime<br>new zealand and um<br>regional council in the bay that's an<br>unusual circumstance<br>um and my understanding is that they did<br>not necessarily have to do that under<br>some of the<br>liability capping rules that are<br>existing in this country and<br>um mary and dan will know more about<br>that<br>so if for instance that particular<br>agency<br>wasn't so honorable um then yes i think<br>we'd be looking at a very different<br>situation<br>uh associated with rena because the<br>contaminants would still be there<br>um staying with you do you think now<br>because of reno new zealand<br>would be better prepared in terms of<br>environmental response<br>um in many areas i think yes because<br>when rena began to lose oil<br>there was immediate public demand for<br>information<br>on the likely effects on new zealand<br>conditions<br>on the environment and in particular on<br>kaimuana species<br>and also questions associated with how<br>long would it take to recover<br>and when we looked uh into the<br>literature for information<br>on that uh it was surprising to find<br>that very little was known<br>um about in that particular case the<br>effects of heavy fuel oil<br>uh on environmental conditions now<br>condensate<br>is different and there has actually been<br>quite a lot of work done in the past<br>associated with the maui development<br>program that was quite revolutionary at<br>the time<br>and that was done in advance of<br>production<br>on the taranaki coast in the early 80s<br>so we had a situation here with reno<br>where there was not much none of high<br>relevance<br>to the environmental conditions that<br>questions were being asked about<br>subsequent to rena and this is through<br>ministry for the environment funding and<br>support through regional council<br>maritime new zealand and others we're<br>now in possession of a great deal of<br>information about the effects of heavy<br>fuel oil<br>and contaminant mixtures in a real life<br>situation so we're<br>much more advanced in our preparedness<br>with respect to knowledge than we<br>william if i can bring you in here if<br>what you know the way the oil dispersed<br>in<br>in the bay of plenty what the situation<br>do you think be<br>similar if there were to be a blowout<br>or um a spill out of raglan<br>okay in terms of dispersing it's mostly<br>driven by<br>the weather system so it depends on the<br>wind at the time<br>um to a lesser degree what the ocean<br>currents are<br>so for the site they've got<br>it is going to depend essentially on the<br>size of the spill<br>um and the amount of time before it's<br>cleaned up now i reviewed the greenpeace<br>funded modeling study that was done in<br>australia<br>they made some assumptions there which<br>were really quite unrealistic for the<br>type of work that anadarko were doing<br>and<br>represents a worst case scenario and if<br>we look at those ones<br>then if we have an extremely large oil<br>spill that goes on for a long period of<br>time then<br>some oil will reach the coast eventually<br>given the sort of weather we have coming<br>predominantly from the west<br>in terms of what's happening there which<br>is really the same as the sort of<br>development that went on with the capuni<br>and maui fields and the work that was<br>done there in the 80s<br>from auckland university there is<br>not really a chance of producing<br>sufficient volumes of material<br>to cause a problem in fact if we look at<br>it realistically from a scientific<br>objective there is a bigger concern<br>in terms of the support vessels and the<br>protest vessels springing a leak and<br>spilling fuel oil like diesel<br>on the water than there is in terms of<br>getting condensate out of the test<br>drilling that they're doing<br>so do you think a lot of people are<br>overreacting<br>um in terms of the environmental<br>consequences<br>from the work that's going on at present<br>now<br>if they go find oil or they find<br>gas and go to production then there are<br>a range of other issues but as i said<br>right at the beginning this is mostly<br>being driven by emotion<br>and not in terms of scientific evidence<br>um chris um i know angeline's gone but<br>if we could talk to you a bit about your<br>experience with working with ewe<br>um over the arena spill<br>um can you sort of say how that has<br>worked<br>because it has worked for you hasn't it<br>um largely<br>yes um it can always improve though and<br>i mean<br>everyone has 20 20 hindsight so there<br>are certainly areas that improvements<br>can be made<br>um particularly the very first uh days<br>if not hours<br>after it was realized that rena had hit<br>hit<br>rocks and was in some difficulty i think<br>um more immediate uh linkage<br>with um customary fisheries uh for the<br>region and<br>through ewe leaders forum uh would have<br>helped but that was engaged quickly once<br>it<br>was realized that uh ewe themselves had<br>a huge amount to offer in terms of<br>the traditional scientific knowledge<br>about<br>their regions sensitivities of habitats<br>and things like that mataranga<br>since over the last few years<br>engagement has been good i think pretty<br>much throughout the region with ewe<br>they've been an integral part of the<br>monitoring program and indeed have<br>designed a lot of that<br>and many ewe nominated students are now<br>doing very well through masters programs<br>in higher education<br>that has been boosted by scholarships<br>generated by arena funding<br>so it's it's been a comprehensive um<br>and continuing engagement through<br>communication process and i think that's<br>worked quite well<br>and also i think the important lesson<br>was transparency<br>right from the word go the real issues<br>the hard facts<br>the bad news was delivered honestly and<br>openly<br>and it could be debated and so i have a<br>feeling in the region<br>a certain amount of trust has been built<br>up once again it can always be<br>improved on so the key issue here is<br>transparency<br>and in my recent times in australia i<br>would suggest<br>where i've seen oil and gas development<br>work<br>for instance on the northwest shelf in<br>the australian region it's worked in<br>instances where there's been<br>full and prior disclosure of intent<br>uh with regionally based and remote<br>okay um dan you might like to answer<br>this<br>um a question that's coming is there a<br>good side<br>to deep sea oil drilling<br>yeah thanks for that um i suppose i<br>might just sort of<br>step step back from from that a little i<br>mean it's easy to understand why<br>people would be against um deep sea oil<br>drilling<br>and i i've certainly got some serious uh<br>concerns myself because we<br>we naturally tend to think of what would<br>happen if there was an oil spill and<br>and the damage to coastal resources<br>which we all value so much<br>um but at the same time you know the the<br>world and new zealand<br>um all countries are highly dependent on<br>oil and gas we we all use it we we all<br>drive cars we all fly in airplanes at<br>least most of us do<br>um it it seems to me that if we're going<br>to use<br>oil and gas then we have to have some<br>sort of rational answer about<br>about where it's going to come from it's<br>it's got to come from somewhere<br>and and i guess my approach in thinking<br>about where it's going to come is not to<br>sort of come up with an absolute and say<br>you know<br>we will not have it but rather to say<br>well out of all the different places<br>where we could um<br>explore for oil and gas where we could<br>um<br>develop those resources in in all those<br>cases we need to weigh up the costs<br>weigh up the benefits weigh up the risks<br>and and then reach a decision that um<br>that communities are happy with<br>and so sort of coming to the coming to<br>the question is there such a<br>a good thing as um you know good uh<br>deep sea oil drilling or exploration<br>i think my answer is that there's<br>probably good and there's bad i mean<br>let's start with the bad we could<br>think of countries where a lot of oil<br>has been<br>exploited where perhaps most of the<br>benefit of that<br>went to a small number of companies or<br>very rich people and perhaps where there<br>were major oil spills and<br>and perhaps nothing but harm for for<br>much of the population one could look at<br>certain<br>african countries perhaps so certainly<br>that can happen<br>on the other hand you could look say to<br>a country like norway<br>which is a very well-off country<br>commonly held to be um<br>to look after its citizens and look<br>after the environment<br>and yet a lot of noise uh wealth is<br>based on north sea oil they got to get a<br>lot of their money from<br>the oil which is extracted from under<br>the north sea and a lot of that has been<br>put away in a fund called the um i've<br>got<br>the exact anyway put away in in a fund<br>which is which is used<br>um to be used to uh to make sure that<br>sort of future generations in norway um<br>get benefits from that oil after it even<br>after it's been used up so i suppose i'd<br>see the<br>the norwegian model as being on the good<br>side so<br>um cutting to the chase as to what what<br>my answer is<br>um if we use oil then uh clearly someone<br>has to produce it the<br>the challenge is you know who's going to<br>produce it where<br>what choices are we going to make what<br>standards are we going to apply<br>how we're going to make sure that<br>the exploration and development that we<br>agree to in new zealand<br>is that development which on balance<br>should benefit the people of new zealand<br>rather than the opposite case which we<br>know can happen where perhaps we don't<br>get the benefit and we just get the<br>environmental damage<br>i'm wondering how we get the benefit<br>like how much do we get and how much<br>does<br>antarcto get how do you allocate<br>resources barry do you know how that<br>works<br>i don't have the full details but the uh<br>the minerals programs<br>under the crown minerals act and<br>identify the the royalties to be paid uh<br>if a will comes into production uh<br>over time quite substantial funds have<br>been have been obtained this way<br>um so there's the royalties under the<br>crown mendel's act and then there is<br>taxation um uh ordinary<br>ordinary taxation so those are the main<br>ways that revenue comes in<br>to the new zealand government from<br>activities of this kind as they go into<br>does anyone else want to comment at this<br>i don't know chris here um<br>i must admit personally i agree with dan<br>if<br>if we are to use oil products<br>um to my mind we have a responsibility<br>to make sure that<br>the sources of it uh from<br>environmentally<br>um sustainable means<br>um done in a in a best practice<br>situation<br>where environmental concerns are taken<br>uh into account and<br>i fear in the past much of that oil<br>supply has come from<br>countries where those environmental<br>checks and balances haven't happened so<br>morally i think in this country we have<br>an obligation to look<br>half oil personally however i would very<br>much rather see<br>great emphasis put on renewable fuels<br>algae for instance for biofuel feedstock<br>and things like that to me<br>uh we want to be embracing some of these<br>new technologies and leading the charge<br>can i can i come in again sure yeah<br>i mean just just sort of you know<br>bringing it back more to a sort of new<br>zealand level you know sort of concrete<br>um benefits um you know we we could look<br>at what happened in<br>in taranaki um you know<br>there's been a a great deal of gas has<br>come from fields off off taranaki<br>i was just having a quick look for some<br>information i i think<br>uh more than um two two billion<br>and um i think it was several several<br>thousand jobs um<br>you know looking back um as far as i<br>know we haven't had major<br>environmental damage in taranaki and i<br>certainly hope that that<br>continues and and we have had some you<br>know some pretty substantial<br>benefits that we could note in terms of<br>the uh<br>you know the the gas that has been uh<br>available to be available to be used and<br>and the fact that we haven't had to uh<br>import that in terms of the uh<br>royalties that the government would have<br>benefited from you know when government<br>gets royalties<br>it can spend that money on on things<br>which are a benefit to all of us like<br>schools or hospitals and it doesn't have<br>to<br>to uh you know to tax our incomes to so<br>much because it's getting the money from<br>from the royalties<br>so you know one can certainly find um<br>benefits<br>um i i agree with with with chris that i<br>that i'd like to see a transition to<br>renewables<br>and indeed you know to to me that that<br>is happening<br>since you know over the last few years<br>oil prices have settled at a much<br>higher level than what they were that<br>has provided the incentive for people to<br>do much more<br>development of renewables because when<br>you compare the cost of renewal<br>development versus some<br>oil and gas you know renewables look<br>better<br>now if on top of that the the government<br>would get its act together and apply<br>um for example a carbon tax which really<br>did make people<br>face the you know the other costs of oil<br>exploration<br>then that would level the playing field<br>even more and<br>you know further encourage the<br>development of renewals and<br>renewables and i i'd certainly be in<br>favor of that<br>what do you think about that barry i'll<br>come in with a<br>a couple of comments uh it is indeed<br>worthwhile to look at an issue like this<br>in terms of our overall use of energy<br>the main point i'd add in is about<br>demand demand management you know<br>renewables is not the<br>you know straight place to go to ask<br>questions about<br>uh how we manage our energy needs<br>so so the demand is is a big issue<br>uh oil and gas exploration and<br>development is an economic activity<br>many types of economic economic activity<br>have adverse effects on the environment<br>our farming our logging and other<br>extractive industries<br>uh have significant effects on the<br>environment uh<br>we need to do the best we can to manage<br>them<br>in some sectors we're doing quite well<br>in others we've got an awfully long way<br>to go<br>in this sector we we have the<br>ez environmental legislation at last<br>it's taken a while to get there<br>we are seeing uh shortcomings i think in<br>this particular instance in the way that<br>it's being<br>uh applied um in that the<br>the uh low probability high impact<br>possibilities of<br>a uh of an uh of a blowout<br>are not being dealt with in a<br>transparent manner uh<br>it's also fairly clear that something's<br>gone wrong in<br>terms of ordinary expectations and legal<br>rules about uh<br>there was consultation carried out but<br>was it adequate were the right people<br>uh spoken to so uh you know we're doing<br>making some progress but judging by<br>where we are in this particular matter<br>uh we've got more to make<br>there is a question that's come in and<br>this probably is direct um<br>you could probably pick it up barry does<br>the epa have the right<br>system slash framework in place to<br>undertake the appropriate assessment<br>and to place the necessary conditions<br>and controls on exploration<br>if consent were to be granted to<br>antarctica<br>do we have enough inspectors to ensure<br>compliance and enforcement<br>inspection and compliance obviously has<br>been dominated by our thinking about<br>health and safety<br>after uh pipe with a coal<br>that has galvanized the government into<br>activity thank goodness in relation to<br>environmental<br>uh and the environmental protection<br>authority as a whole<br>jury is still out there that<br>organization<br>is is taking shape and taking on its new<br>responsibilities<br>in relation to the offshore um uh<br>one would look for uh then to be able to<br>bring in in a knowledgeable way<br>high level expertise uh about the<br>receiving environment about particular<br>effects<br>and and also about the engineering<br>uh required to make sure that uh adverse<br>effects don't take place that's the top<br>of the cliff<br>uh if there is a spill that's the bottom<br>of the cliff if something goes wrong<br>in terms of how the drilling program<br>occurs uh<br>what uh then um<br>it's the engineering there that will<br>make the difference i only hope that the<br>epa people<br>are on to that with the right type of<br>capabilities certainly that sort of<br>knowledge and is available either in new<br>zealand or offshore<br>um what we need is the epa to be to be<br>quick and alert to bring it in<br>uh to judge<br>drilling campaigns and particular<br>projects<br>do you think we're floundering a little<br>bit like we don't quite know what we're<br>doing<br>um well<br>the regulatory system is is somewhat in<br>transition uh<br>here in this particular one that's been<br>in our news the last couple of days<br>uh possibly there is a bit of<br>floundering yeah there are aspects of it<br>as i say that uh are uncomfortable to<br>behold one would expect better<br>um from the regulatory agencies<br>um if if and darker<br>success anadarko is successful and<br>drilling starts<br>does that mean that then you know um<br>work will stop<br>elsewhere or does it carry on um well do<br>you know you know are they are they<br>going to keep<br>working off canterbury and off otago as<br>well<br>um there are a number of different oil<br>prospects which involve a different<br>range of companies<br>and so the mixture for the different<br>areas is not the same<br>but certainly odaco and dhaka has been<br>brought here to do test drilling<br>in several prospects just to as i said<br>it's to to match up the computer models<br>based on acoustic signals<br>with what's actually there so what<br>they're trying to assess is whether<br>there's something there<br>and whether it's going to be economic um<br>to<br>to go further and so the the normal<br>normally several stages so these<br>first the seismic surveys like we're<br>done off east cape<br>not so long go to protests and the next<br>phase is this<br>exploratory drilling um they're<br>essentially wildcat holes<br>there's a reasonably high chance they'll<br>hit nothing at all<br>but they'll still get useful data to to<br>interpret the seismic information<br>from that they then can make an<br>assessment as to whether it's<br>worth coming back with a larger<br>submersible drilling rig<br>and drill um a more<br>systematic set of exploratory holes to<br>look towards going product<br>to production and then there's the<br>production phase if they find enough<br>material so we went through all of this<br>with the taranaki fields um some 50<br>holes down there<br>so it's a long process um we're<br>certainly are nowhere at the production<br>stage and not likely to be for<br>at least a decade if past experience is<br>correct<br>but certainly an endarco's ship is<br>likely to move to<br>other potential prospects around new<br>zealand which is their plan<br>um it's an expensive vessel to operate<br>and so it only comes down here<br>if there's sufficient work to justify it<br>so we'll drill a series of holes<br>that information and then go back to the<br>companies they'll interpret it<br>and then decide what they're going to do<br>next and it's quite possible<br>with some of our other prospects in the<br>past<br>that having drilled it they then are not<br>i was just wondering too um<br>i was kind of curious to know how how um<br>all these companies work<br>so we've set up new zealand-based shell<br>company and adaco taranaki<br>and um i read that they had a share<br>capital of only a hundred thousand<br>dollars and that company is in turn<br>owned by a cayman islands identity<br>and the drilling rig itself is owned by<br>um<br>it's registered in liberia and operates<br>a flag of convenience ship registry<br>with weak regulations is this how it<br>normally happens<br>it's fairly standard uh in international<br>transactions to see<br>entities of this kind being used um<br>what matters from new zealand's point of<br>view<br>is is the main company standing behind<br>the new zealand uh subsidiary that's<br>incorporated<br>and in particular where what we want to<br>know<br>what type of provision has been made to<br>deal with liability<br>uh if something goes wrong so what uh<br>insurance has been obtained<br>uh exactly what does it cover um there<br>is there are<br>procedures under the requirements under<br>the uh<br>the maritime transport act for a<br>certificate of insurance<br>uh it would be nice to know about that<br>uh something goes wrong that's what we<br>will be depending on uh hopefully it<br>will be properly ignored in the way that<br>uh chris is described in relation to<br>rena<br>uh those are key questions and and<br>perhaps more important<br>than the specifics of uh<br>um company uh form<br>oh thank you thank you barry dan just<br>going back you know we were talking<br>about floundering before um you said you<br>might um one of the reasons might be<br>that we're not very good at dealing with<br>risk can you elaborate<br>yeah sure um so yeah it<br>i sort of laid out a framework and and<br>sort of perhaps made it sound easy by<br>saying<br>um we we we need to think about all the<br>different ways we can<br>um get our oil and we must choose the um<br>safest ones and and do it in an<br>environmentally sensible way and we must<br>weigh up the costs and benefits and so<br>forth i mean certainly that's what i<br>would like to do<br>um but but the fact of the matter is<br>it's a very difficult<br>policy issue and and one of the one of<br>the things that<br>that's difficult about it is this issue<br>of risk<br>because on the one hand we are saying<br>that if um<br>we do get some some gas or whatever the<br>the government will get some royalties<br>uh we'll<br>increase our export revenue we'll get<br>some tax money<br>there'll be some employment and so forth<br>and then on the other hand we're saying<br>but there is a certain probability that<br>something might go wrong<br>or indeed actually there's a sort of a<br>range there's perhaps a certain<br>probability that something might go<br>wrong which would be this bad<br>and then there's a certain probability<br>that an even worse thing<br>might go on you know which which would<br>have a a greater cost so<br>what you'll just just sort of give an<br>example suppose you said right the<br>benefit we're going to get from this oil<br>one is is 100 million or whatever<br>and and and then you're saying and but<br>there's a certain<br>low chance that we might have an oil<br>spill<br>which would cause damage of whatever one<br>billion<br>and the the point is that people find it<br>difficult to deal with<br>how how do you think about you know that<br>cost<br>when there's a very low probability but<br>that if it did happen<br>that it's a very high cost um<br>i mean what the way that some people<br>respond is to say<br>um well we we we don't accept any risk<br>at all<br>um sadly that's not really feasible i<br>mean the only way that we can say that<br>we won't have any risk<br>at all from oil exploration is by saying<br>we won't<br>use oil at all um basically whatever<br>endeavor we<br>um are involved in there there will be<br>risk uh you could take the example of um<br>you know earth earthquakes and um and<br>tsunamis in in new zealand<br>when we think about the standards we're<br>going to imply apply and the money we're<br>going to spend<br>you know it's not possible to spend<br>enough so that<br>under so that we will be safe against<br>all possible earthquakes so so the fact<br>is that you know<br>you can't avoid risk you have to decide<br>how you're going to deal with it<br>and i i guess the other point you can<br>make is that it's<br>it's important to really think these<br>things through because sometimes the way<br>that people deal with risk<br>has some unintended effects there was an<br>interesting example<br>in the case of the 911 in<br>in the united states where as a<br>consequence of that<br>they decided to bring in um strengthened<br>um cabin doors on airplanes and air<br>marshals which everyone you know it<br>seemed a really good idea that would<br>reduce<br>the risk of hijacking and yet there was<br>a very careful study that shown that<br>actually<br>the effect of this was to increase loss<br>of life<br>the reason was that the strengthened<br>cabin doors and the air marshals<br>increased the cost of air travel<br>therefore more people traveled by road<br>and actually it's<br>still far riskier to travel by road than<br>it is by plane<br>and so you know this thing which was<br>with the best of intentions to really<br>you know be really careful about air<br>travel actually it's<br>increased risk more people died because<br>they switched to road<br>i mean you'll be going what on earth has<br>this got to do with this case and i<br>admit i can't tell you<br>but it does say you know we we do have<br>to really think things through<br>when we think how we deal with with risk<br>and and will the steps we take<br>actually you know might have some<br>unintended side effects so<br>to sum up yeah you know it is difficult<br>it's not<br>surprising that we're struggling with it<br>you know how do do we take decisions<br>about these very small risks but if it<br>does happen<br>there's a very major consequence<br>thank you dan anyone else like to add<br>anything<br>well just picking up on what dan says<br>and i<br>agree it's a question of risk management<br>and it's complicated because<br>you know they're very low probability<br>things but as a first step we can have<br>disclosure for<br>open public discussion uh of of what the<br>plans are<br>and and that sort of bit of fresh air<br>through it<br>allows us to get a discussion started<br>well if that's the case if no one has<br>anything more to add we might wind up<br>this google hangout<br>so um i'd like to thank professor barry<br>barton<br>chris battersell dr dan marsh<br>dr william delang and angeline who had<br>to leave us early thank you very much<br>for taking part and i think this debate<br>has only just begun<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
