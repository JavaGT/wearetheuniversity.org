up making decisions in your mind<br>have you got a front don't tell me but<br>have you got a front runner each yes oh<br>we're very conf confident over here is<br>is it the person that you came in the<br>car with<br>or is it somebody where are the random<br>people again the people who aren't<br>related to or friends of yeah so how are<br>you feeling keep your hand up if you<br>think you know who your favorite is so<br>far oh okay but you've got an open mind<br>haven't you it's good very good and you<br>can chat about it over a wine at half<br>time which is nice and what what about<br>I'm going to ask this the people who<br>have um come to support a particular<br>them cuz it's a secret ballot in that<br>you don't have to tell them you'd feel<br>bad You' you'd hate yourself but you<br>could do<br>it and no one would ever know except<br>you just a little uncomfortable gleam in<br>your eye so that's good are we ready oh<br>no Jan's still writing you're all set<br>great all right our next we more than<br>halfway through people Graham McKenzie<br>from Hamilton from The Faculty of arts<br>and social sciences the title is you can<br>have the vote but not the land<br>postapartheid South Africa and the<br>Persistence of inequality apartheid era<br>patterns of land ownership persist<br>almost 20 years into the new Democratic<br>South Africa this thesis explains the<br>barriers to achieving change for social<br>social justice in new democracies please<br>McKenzie last year in the small South<br>African town of East London I watched a<br>homeless man drink deeply and thirsty<br>from a roadside gutter this shocking<br>site drove home to me the enduring<br>inequalities in the country almost 20<br>years after the end of apartate and the<br>challenges that this poses to Social and<br>economic change under apartate the black<br>population of South Africa was<br>explicitly blocked from access to<br>economic resources most especially land<br>in 1994 at the end of a pate black South<br>Africans had access to only 13% of South<br>Africa's Farmland while the white<br>87% prior to 1994 The Liberation<br>movements had emphasized the necessity<br>of land redistribution on this basis and<br>the state of goal of the first post<br>aparted government was to transfer 30%<br>of the land by 1999 however the transfer<br>of land has preceded at a snail's pace<br>by last year only some 7% of the land<br>had actually been<br>transferred my thesis asks how can we<br>explain the fact that a government<br>elected with such a strong Mand mate to<br>undertake radical action to create<br>greater economic equality do so little<br>to change apartate economic policy<br>especially in relation to land<br>ownership this question is is uh this<br>question is is relevant because<br>uh uh Land Reform policies can reduce po<br>uh poverty as seen in places like Taiwan<br>and South Korea after the second world<br>war but getting it uh but getting it<br>wrong as in the case of Zimbabwe can<br>bring an entire economy to its knees<br>secondly Wildland ownership in South<br>Africa is a pres unjust it is one of<br>very few African countries with a food<br>surplus and this capacity needs to be<br>protected thirdly and most fundamentally<br>if democracy is to be respected and<br>nurtured in South Africa and around the<br>world it needs to deliver real economic<br>gains to the majority and in South<br>Africa Land Reform is a key way of<br>achieving<br>this I approach this question through<br>lens which emphasizes the way practices<br>IDE s and ideologies are<br>institutionalized or are locked into a<br>political system I use interviews a<br>survey and discourse analysis to<br>understand why post apartate policies<br>have done so little to address poverty<br>and social justice my research has found<br>so far that apartate era discourses<br>continue to set the terms for<br>agricultural policy framing the choices<br>of the South African government as<br>either maintaining food security by<br>leaving things as they are or addressing<br>historical justice but not<br>both my research will contribute towards<br>breaking this false dichotomy and the<br>creation of a new policy which<br>simultaneously creates greater economic<br>equality addresses apartate Injustice<br>and maintains current food production<br>levels and I hope that by doing this I<br>can contribute towards creating a better<br>life for people like the homeless man in<br>Graham McKenzie Alexandra I haven't been<br>checking in with you has everybody stuck<br>disqualified Steven farnworth that was<br>the Civil liability for was your<br>favorite one the one about the oil<br>drilling and whether we're ready for<br>doing that so he was bang<br>on there should be a special prize for<br>hitting the number shouldn't there<br>that'd be great and you're starting to<br>feel the rhythm of what 3 minutes feels<br>like everybody is that quite good do you<br>want to live the whole of your life like<br>that<br>now nothing should ever take longer than<br>3<br>minutes I quite like that that' be quite</p></main><footer
