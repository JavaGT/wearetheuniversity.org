space and<br>for another to<br>observe 1989 Reading university last day<br>of teacher training notice the happy<br>smile the warm<br>glow oh you can't tell which one is me<br>well I was blonde then and slim and<br>wrinkle free and full of passion to be a<br>drama<br>educator okay everyone just going to get<br>you to do just a little warm up shake<br>those arms a little bit shake them out<br>that's good just relax hey guys don't<br>forget school player rehearsals begin<br>tomorrow evening bring your scripts be<br>on time<br>Perry Linda congratulations you've made<br>it to drama<br>school a good school needs so much more<br>than just academic results and you have<br>enhanced our reputation in such a superb<br>way what do you mean you've canell the<br>year n theater trip just because of a<br>talent show it's been on the calendar<br>for over a<br>year okay guys really sorry PR studio is<br>flooded again we're going to have to use<br>a<br>classroom once more unto the breach dear<br>friends once more or close the wall up<br>with our English<br>dead well done Peter you have got an<br>Excellence for demonstrating techniques<br>context I wonder what it would have been<br>like to have been Henry V at the Battle<br>of Ashen cor leading his men into<br>battle no no Peter that's not what this<br>assessment is all about it's about how<br>well you use your voice and body<br>movement and space now do remember to<br>work so I enter the<br>battlefield caught in a no man's land<br>between assessment examination<br>curriculum syllabus Pro process product<br>resources<br>exhausted<br>prostrated<br>depressed you can only count what can be<br>measured grad grindan<br>education the quantification of<br>learning labeling<br>for labeling<br>so I knock at the faculty of Education<br>door may I come in what<br>for well I'd really like to study the<br>battles and barricades of drama and<br>education metaphors drawn from the<br>sometimes specious discourses of over A<br>Century of<br>practice come<br>in<br>qualitative<br>quantitative<br>subjective<br>object<br>epistemology<br>ontology what<br>methodology interviews and<br>questionnaires no that that's not for<br>me all the worlds a stage and all the<br>men and women merely players as you like<br>it William<br>Shakespeare attending the international<br>drama and education symposiums at<br>ockland<br>University I discovered research-based<br>theater and ethnographic<br>performance to discover that data could<br>be generated mediated and disseminated<br>through drama was like a light<br>Illuminating a darken stage<br>performative inquiry the third<br>Paradigm lick Ireland<br>2012 the international drama and<br>education Research<br>Institute Kathleen<br>Gallagher<br>Melancholy it is the loss of<br>ideals and the hyper Judgment of the<br>self drama teachers wither under the<br>weight that's me<br>that's<br>me<br>Melancholy our calls it an Elizabethan<br>emotion more aesthetic than depression<br>aesthetic something pretty and he says<br>people think of tripping lightly through<br>fields of golden<br>daffodils but he says why don't you<br>think of the<br>opposite<br>anesthetic something that numbs that<br>deadens but we need to understand the<br>aesthetic and what makes us feel<br>alive and I am<br>alive sitting at the Royal Shakespeare<br>company in Stratford watching as you<br>like<br>it and I hear Jake W speak to Rosalind<br>of his<br>Melancholy not the Scholar's<br>Melancholy but one of his own making<br>which wraps me in a most humorous<br>sadness Victor Turner<br>says we come to know ourselves through<br>performance Nicholson says our bodies<br>archive our lives<br>performatively and so I<br>create a diadic encounter one in which<br>my participants and I will imagine the<br>creation of a museum of educational<br>drama and applied theater where we will<br>see what lies on the battlefield and<br>over the barricade using maps and<br>metaphor movement monologue symbols and<br>images we will embody our passion and<br>Melancholia in<br>practice John<br>says it must be an interactive space<br>because drama is not static it is alive<br>and visceral evanescent and embodied and<br>he says what shall we fill it with books<br>and artifacts and stuff or will it be<br>about the thing itself plays puppets<br>mind<br>masks but I'd much rather it got back to<br>its roots of being an interactive space<br>of being playful and I see that very<br>carefully cuz I believe we can do some<br>very serious stuff<br>and so the voices of the museum begin to<br>speak<br>typical the first barricade we have is<br>that we don't have an empty space we<br>have a space for tables and<br>chairs but drama needs an empty space in<br>which we can suspend our disbelief in<br>which we can imagine and inquire in<br>which we can play in a space of<br>possibilities<br>Andy plays imaginatively with the props<br>to embody his<br>barricades<br>e we have a certain way of doing things<br>here at this school the school way are<br>we Brian he's wonderful isn't<br>he you've painted the drama Studio black<br>people who know a lot more about educ<br>than you do didn't paint it<br>black Steven<br>buroff in this<br>school that stuff that language is<br>outrageous<br>outrageous hey<br>Andy what you're doing here in this<br>school mate it's really great it's<br>really<br>exciting<br>Jonathan likes to be on on the<br>margins where he can create a safe space<br>artistically politically<br>imaginatively I don't make any claims<br>for the long term I don't make any<br>transformation I heave a sigh of<br>relief how can we claim that drama can<br>transform someone<br>forever and so I become actor director<br>designer and script writer as I<br>transcribe my videos reeing every line<br>aloud and I just to post the stories<br>with my own and like S I look for the<br>golden moments that resonate and I stop<br>thinking like a social scientist and<br>John says we need to trust our<br>emotions trust our<br>intuition<br>2013 I celebrate the scholars<br>Melancholy no longer blonde no longer<br>slim and with a tube of anti- wrinkle<br>cream John says no war is ever won on<br>the battlefield Jonathan says but we<br>need the battles for they are the<br>tensions at the very heart of this<br>Dynamic<br>practice John<br>says make a hole in the<br>barricade crawl</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
