The competition challenges candidates to present a compelling oration on their thesis and its significance in just three minutes in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>i think that's kind of the key to um to<br>doing the speaking in public thing is<br>let me tell you my philosophy of life<br>because the judges look like they're<br>going to write a short novel um<br>because i grew up in as i say live in<br>but we won't go into detail because it<br>makes me cry but um<br>i made this choice when i was about 12.<br>i decided i would read all of the<br>books by new zealand writers in the<br>library<br>one of them was catherine mansfield and<br>i'm a massive fan but the other was um<br>barry crumps a good keen man does<br>anybody else read it yeah it changed my<br>life it's<br>seriously those of you who haven't it's<br>quite deep philosophy really<br>um<br>not but really um and in fact<br>brian cramp is the guy who does nights<br>on uh national radio and he's superb and<br>very um philosophical actually anyway<br>the philosophy in the book is uh and<br>i've lived by it never tell anybody that<br>you don't know how to do something<br>because by the time they worked out that<br>you didn't know how to do it<br>you will have worked out how to do it<br>it's pretty much how i live my life<br>really<br>and see these people maybe thought that<br>they weren't really good at public<br>speaking but it turns out that they<br>really are which is superb our judges<br>are ready all right let's move on to we<br>have our fifth presenter tonight sarah<br>lockwood she's from tauranga the waikato<br>management school here and the title is<br>a match made in crisis a self-organized<br>youth volunteer response to crisis<br>events focusing on the arena oil spill<br>crisis this research aims to better<br>understand the unique organizing and<br>communicating dynamics of gen y<br>volunteers when crises strike would you<br>please give a warm welcome to sarah<br>lockwood<br>the arena grounded on australia brief<br>october 2011<br>tons of heavy oil countless shipping<br>containers dead wildlife all washed onto<br>our shores<br>people were outraged they were angry<br>they were sad<br>but for generation y 16 to 29 year olds<br>they turned out to be motivated<br>enthusiastic and innovative volunteers<br>and they responded in unique ways<br>focusing on the arena my phd aims to<br>better understand why and how gen y<br>volunteers organise and communicate when<br>a crisis strikes<br>often excluded from the traditional<br>volunteer structures their stories are<br>not heard<br>as a gen y volunteer myself during the<br>arena i was in the unique position to<br>understand directly from them<br>what this crisis volunteering meant to<br>them and how the use of technology how<br>their speed and how their social<br>networking impacted on the way that they<br>responded<br>now gen y saw the arena as an<br>opportunity<br>to participate in something that was<br>totally different exciting and fun<br>and they simply couldn't resist to be<br>part of the talk of facebook<br>it became an obsession<br>they treated it like a project they were<br>the students rena was the problem and it<br>was a cool problem to solve because it<br>was unique it was exciting and everyone<br>was watching<br>and so they became creative<br>and they moved away from the structured<br>confines of the official volunteer<br>program like sammy and her friends<br>bottom right<br>they worked tirelessly baking all day<br>and night and then they delivered their<br>homemade goods via army trucks along the<br>beaches to hordes of hungry beach<br>cleaners it was something totally out of<br>the ordinary it was cool and the efforts<br>and rewards were instant and visual<br>which was important to them<br>and more importantly self-organized gen<br>y volunteer efforts by the likes of sami<br>and her friends and others<br>made significant differences to the<br>overall crisis response effort<br>but who cares i mean why is this even<br>important<br>well gen y efforts in christchurch haiti<br>kobe and other crises worldwide have<br>consistently shown that they're more<br>socially connected they're more<br>efficient<br>and they're better communicated than the<br>official crisis response efforts<br>but here's the catch<br>youth volunteers aren't mentioned once<br>in crisis response policy so despite all<br>of this practical evidence policy has<br>actually excluded one of its most useful<br>resources to effective crisis response<br>next year i'll be traveling to the<br>states to work alongside others that<br>witnessed similar gen y responses to the<br>likes of hurricane sandy and katrina<br>we hope that our research will inform<br>local governments how to better utilise<br>gen y volunteers so that community<br>communities can respond better when a<br>crisis strikes<br>i mean after all<br>these are the future change makers of<br>our society<br>we must give them a place in it<br>and that was sarah lockwood it's true<br>isn't it gen y is different<br>hands up where are the gen y's in the<br>room yeah look at you alexandra you're<br>so cute it's true you are you're<br>different like you like things to be<br>quite technical and complicated you know<br>technology is really you embrace it so<br>much more than my generation because you<br>grew up with it i guess i remember my<br>daughter coming over when we had a power<br>cut and saying that she was hungry and i<br>said make a sandwich we keep the bread<br>in the freezer she said mommy i can't<br>make a sandwich<br>without electricity<br>and i said to her<br>it's not really that hard is it<br>but you like it to be complicated<br>alexandra don't you so i told her you<br>can do this you can make the bread house<br>you get two bits of bread and you lean<br>them against each other on the bench do<br>we all know about the bread house<br>and when they're defrosted sufficiently<br>to turn into a sandwich they go let's<br>make a noise for it ring a bell whatever<br>i also told her she really needed it to<br>be high-tech we could put bread on a<br>plate and she could turn it around and<br>go<br>and i'd hold a torch but really all of<br>that's completely unnecessary just<br>wait</p></main><footer
