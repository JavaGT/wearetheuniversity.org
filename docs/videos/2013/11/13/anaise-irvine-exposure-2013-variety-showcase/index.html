Allegories<br>(Faculty of Arts)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hello good evening and welcome<br>as you've just heard i work in the<br>english department<br>so it might seem slightly confusing if i<br>am putting on a lab coat<br>i assure you this is in fact a halloween<br>costume<br>i'm not a scientist stains are not<br>actual about our past<br>the reason i'm putting it on is because<br>i work with the intersections<br>between science and literature so for my<br>phd project<br>i'm looking at how bioengineering is<br>written up i'm looking at how<br>authors write about the bioengineered<br>body<br>the reasons i do that are partly<br>personal fascinating<br>but also because the way we write about<br>science<br>is not just a simple flow from science<br>into fiction<br>it also works the other way around so<br>what's flashing up behind me soon<br>are just a few of the very many<br>headlines that appear in the media<br>that talk about scientific discoveries<br>using fiction as a kind of a shorthand<br>we hear about frankenscience we hear<br>about brave new babies<br>part of the reason i do the work that i<br>do is to be able to unpick<br>the connotations that we load onto<br>science when we talk about new<br>discoveries<br>using fiction as our rhetoric<br>so what i'm going to do tonight is whip<br>you through a quick demonstration<br>of how authors write about bodies that<br>have been bio-engineered or tweaked in<br>some way<br>and in order to do that i need my lovely<br>so we have three animal subjects and one<br>now of course the classic text that<br>talks about bioengineering is<br>frankenstein<br>what happens in the novel is probably<br>quite familiar but we have dr<br>frankenstein<br>who's interested in seeing whether he<br>can reanimate<br>a dead body but he's not using one dead<br>body<br>the way he phrases this is that he<br>collects from the charm of houses so<br>this is repositories of bones<br>he's collecting flesh he's collecting<br>skin<br>and he's assembling bits and pieces<br>then he's putting them back together<br>again but<br>they don't necessarily quite fit in the<br>way they did before because they're all<br>taken from different individuals so<br>everything is just slightly askew<br>and the resulting creature is never<br>accepted as holy human<br>it's always considered monstrous in some<br>way<br>a similar thing happens again in the<br>island of dr moreau<br>dr moreau is another scientist<br>experimenting with ways of reconfiguring<br>the body<br>but this time he's not working<br>exclusively with the human form<br>sometimes he starts with human bits and<br>pieces that again he's deconstructing<br>and taking<br>from different animals as well to create<br>the resulting form is referred to as<br>monsters manufactured<br>so again we had this notion of<br>monstrosity coming through<br>of assembly of bits and pieces morphed<br>looking forward a few more decades alto<br>taxley does something a little bit<br>different in brave new world<br>he again is working with a human form<br>but this time he's working with human<br>characters that aren't<br>born to parents in the way that we might<br>expect<br>in fact they are growing so here they<br>are<br>sitting in a lab and depending on the<br>class that the human is going to belong<br>to the economic function they will hold<br>they might be developed from one embryo<br>or they might be an embryo split into up<br>to ten thousand different pieces<br>so if you are one ten thousandth of an<br>embryo you'll grow into an individual<br>who might do low skill jobs if you've<br>developed from a whole embryo you might<br>do higher skill jobs<br>but at any rate you've developed in a<br>lab-like setting<br>the way they refer to the process of the<br>novel is to call it the principle<br>of mass production at last applied to<br>biology<br>so there's a real model t4 kind of<br>production line<br>connotation going on here the human body<br>is being mass produced for an economic<br>purpose<br>you might have noticed that these are<br>all classic texts they're all written<br>quite a long time before our modern<br>bioengineering field really came about<br>they are all based on real science mary<br>shelley who wrote frankenstein<br>was well-versed with the experiments of<br>luigi galavani<br>who had managed to reanimate frog's<br>leads<br>using a static electric charge<br>when hd wells wrote the island of dr<br>moreau he was working from a context of<br>huge controversy<br>around the liver section around<br>experimenting on live animals<br>and when aldous huxley wrote broad new<br>world<br>there was a german embryologist called<br>han swimmer who'd managed to manipulate<br>embryo cells inside the womb<br>so there was real bioengineering going<br>into this work<br>but it was a kind of rudimentary early<br>form it was<br>cut it open poke around and see what<br>happens kind of bioengineering<br>a very long way from what exists in the<br>field today<br>these days bioengineering tends to be a<br>little bit more<br>applied it's a little bit more about<br>problem solving<br>for instance there is one team that has<br>managed to grow a burger<br>in a lab using stem cells taken from<br>cattle and manipulating them into a<br>ground beef product<br>there's a team in korea that have<br>managed to produce bacteria<br>that excrete a gasoline substitute<br>imagine powering your power with the<br>byproducts of bacteria there's a team in<br>the united kingdom<br>who built a robot that has powered<br>exclusively by brain cells<br>it can actually learn how to avoid<br>and it is now possible to build a<br>trachea<br>that is mold first in glass and then has<br>the stem cells of a patient applied to<br>it<br>so that it can grow into a<br>transplantable trachea<br>so this is all very cutting edge work<br>does the contemporary fiction of<br>bioengineering<br>draw from this kind of work let's take a<br>look<br>uh margaret with oryx and craig features<br>a scientist named craig<br>who wants to optimize the human form so<br>he's not happy with this he thinks we<br>can do that<br>the way he wants to modify humans is to<br>take adaptations from the animal kingdom<br>and apply them so that we're better<br>suited so<br>he starts with human genetic code and he<br>adds bits and pieces he adds<br>genes from jellyfish he adds genes from<br>rabbits<br>he basically switches it all around so<br>that there's a version of human<br>humanity that he thinks is well suited<br>for its environment<br>this might resemble the island of dr<br>moreau style pastiche that we saw just<br>earlier<br>it's a similar kind of building<br>mechanism going on<br>but there is one slight difference craik<br>is not working as a lone scientist<br>moreover stuck on an island if he was<br>deemed a bit mad<br>but craig has a little bit of backing<br>he's based in a corporate compound and<br>he's got<br>corporate money at hand he's got funding<br>the reason he's got backers is because<br>they want to be able to sell designer<br>babies<br>and the work that he's doing could lead<br>on to that<br>this kind of economic imperative a kind<br>of commodification<br>comes through in even more of the<br>contemporary fiction of bioengineering<br>so in cloud atlas by david mitchell<br>we have again a human looking form<br>but it's designed it's engineered for an<br>economic purpose<br>songme451 is the name of the character<br>in the story and her<br>colleagues and she are created whoops<br>are created in a genomics unit so they<br>are<br>again like brave new world developed<br>essentially in vats<br>they're suspended in uterine gel while<br>they grow<br>and they are designed to be great<br>servers at a restaurant that is<br>really similar to mcdonald's in the<br>descriptions<br>so they are engineered so that they<br>don't need very much sleep<br>so that they can work long hours they're<br>engineered to be<br>always smiling so that their customers<br>get great customer service<br>so again we've got a commodification<br>these beings have been created so that<br>they can<br>serve<br>so again he's working with the human<br>form but in the novel<br>humans that are considered undesirable<br>um<br>drug addicts criminals and so forth are<br>cloned<br>so you start with your original and your<br>client<br>the novel opens on the clones children<br>at school<br>they don't know that they're clones at<br>all they just think they're ordinary<br>children<br>but we see them slowly realising that<br>they have been cloned<br>and that their purpose in life is<br>economic<br>they are going to be ripped apart<br>and their parts their organs are going<br>to be<br>sold for transplant they're going to<br>keep<br>donating their organs until they<br>complete or die<br>this economic use of the body is coming<br>through really loud and clear<br>and in fact that's one of the key<br>findings of this research<br>so what's happening to the body in the<br>fiction of bioengineering well<br>it's all in parts it's all stripped<br>asunder<br>it's assembled it's deconstructed it's<br>never considered<br>a cohesive whole unit it's always<br>disassembled<br>it's also very strongly exported so<br>whether it's a corporation in control<br>or a mad scientist there is someone<br>trying to get<br>use out of the bioengineering body it's<br>heavily animalized<br>so it's referred to often as a slab of<br>meat or<br>beastly in some way and crucially<br>it's kept separate from the unmodified<br>human body<br>there's a real biological class system<br>building in this fiction<br>one of the key findings of the research<br>is that the contemporary fiction of<br>bioengineering<br>doesn't actually have much relation to<br>what's going on in the field right now<br>so the texts that we've looked at that<br>are a little bit later<br>relate more to the earlier texts than<br>they do to actual<br>scientific discovery we saw in<br>orecks and craig a strong relation to<br>the island of dr moreau<br>in cloud atlas there's a strong relation<br>to the growing and jazz idea<br>from a brand new world so<br>if the contemporary fiction of<br>bioengineering is not responding to<br>science<br>necessarily and the early fiction of<br>bioengineering was written a long time<br>before we even had a field<br>does that make it responsible then to<br>use these kinds of headlines when we<br>talk about science<br>i'd like to suggest that this sort of<br>rhetoric is really misleading<br>when we use terms like frank and science<br>we're bringing in a whole lot of<br>negative connotations<br>that often have very little to do with<br>the actual scientific discovery that<br>we're talking about<br>this is a form of discourse that is<br>encouraging suspicion<br>it's actively scaremongering and i hope<br>that my research can help to strip away<br>some of those connotations<br>so that we can have a more open dialogue<br>when we talk about science<br>thank you very much for your attention<br>and we should have time for i think one</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
