wish to submit questions about<br>the roast Buster scandals or issues<br>around it you can go to our Facebook<br>roast Busters event page which you can<br>find on wwwf<br>facebook.com University or via Twitter<br>using the<br>hasht hangout okay just to get the ball<br>rolling I wonder if I can ask you<br>Neville is this roast Fuster situation<br>the tip of the iceberg or is it<br>I think it's a a symbol of a symptomatic<br>of a quite<br>widespread issue in terms of how we are<br>raising our young men how we uh<br>encourage them to view young women um I<br>think a quite distorted view of uh of<br>relationships and of sexuality I think<br>what's particularly um different about<br>this is that it'll suddenly become<br>visible uh through social media I think<br>what we have is uh a longstanding<br>problem that we have really as a society<br>failed to<br>address<br>okay Robin I'm wondering if I can ask<br>you then what do you make of this public<br>response to the roast Busters you know<br>that petition that got up really quickly<br>the Facebook responses and even public<br>protest yes there's been an amazing<br>response I think there was sort of<br>something like 64,000 people have signed<br>the online petition and there are um<br>marches arranged in Oakland Wellington<br>Christ I think one here in Hamilton now<br>as well um to find Justice for the for<br>those who've been victimized I think<br>it's it is interesting to think about<br>social media as a as a space and how<br>that in fact has been a space that's<br>incredibly oppressive in the way that<br>these young men have acted but it's also<br>a space of incredible resistance where<br>people have also been able to find a<br>voice to say that they um you know that<br>they they they want to take action<br>against this so it it has been<br>interesting in fact seeing how that that<br>space of social media has played out and<br>how it has very real live effects in<br>things like um public protest<br>marches Brenda I'm wondering um how<br>youve you're coming at it from a legal<br>perspective how you think the police<br>made handled it differently and and you<br>know the issues around getting it at<br>charge and<br>conviction yes I think one of the big<br>questions here is whether or not the<br>police handled it any<br>differently um to to other complaints of<br>sexual violation or sexual assault and<br>what we need to find out is whether or<br>not their response signals a general<br>response uh in these kinds of cases um<br>the the police are right in saying that<br>they they generally can't act unless<br>someone comes forward um and and they<br>have also said that people did come<br>forward but the the reason their reason<br>for not proceeding is because of a lack<br>of evidence in in those cases where<br>complaints were made because sometimes<br>what happens is that for a number of<br>reasons a complainant might make a<br>statement to the police and go so far as<br>to have an evidential interview but then<br>be reluctant for a number of reasons to<br>to um Pro any further and that makes it<br>difficult to to secure a conviction in<br>the case because the police will not<br>prosecute unless there is sufficient<br>evidence for a jury to to make a<br>decision um and and often in a lot of<br>cases too there is no physical evidence<br>so that so the only evidence that there<br>is is the word of these of these<br>complainants which can make it quite<br>hard for a uh a jury to to come to a<br>conclusion when they are essentially<br>weighing up the The credibility of the<br>complainant uh Against The credibility<br>of the of the accused um in the light of<br>all of the discourse that's around um<br>cases of these nature of this<br>nature Debbie um as an educator do you<br>think that the whole system is letting<br>us down does it start at school do you<br>think well we all know that there's you<br>know multiple influences on young people<br>and um school is just one of them<br>however I think that the way social<br>media is playing here I mean none of<br>none of what's happened here is new<br>misogyny has been around forever rape<br>has been around forever gang rape um<br>what's new here is social media aspect<br>of it and the way the message is being<br>shared so I think you know as far as um<br>education goes it's about actually<br>making sure that we are actually<br>implementing the New Zealand curriculum<br>in the way that it was intended which<br>was is around ensuring we have uh<br>respectful attitudes and values around<br>ourselves and around other people and a<br>sense of social justice about what's<br>okay and our rights and<br>responsibilities my concern I think is<br>that um with the way that women are<br>portrayed within media and um<br>particularly within pornography um at<br>the at the moment and the high<br>consumption around pornography and the<br>way women are portrayed in there is that<br>um gender based violence is very<br>normalized in society and so you know<br>schools are just one piece of the<br>picture here around um prevention of the<br>these sorts of aspects of things<br>happening in society yeah leville I see<br>you nodding your head do you want to add<br>to<br>that uh I totally agree with what uh<br>deby is is saying I was kind of struck<br>by a correspondent of the herald who<br>said well the problem is that we've had<br>sex education and it's normalizing um<br>this sexual behavior by young people and<br>we need to do away with sex education I<br>couldn't think of a more wrongheaded<br>kind of approach because at the moment<br>there is a very assertive sex education<br>program running in this country and it's<br>called freely available internet<br>pornography and I call it sexist<br>education the way pornography is<br>educating people and unfortunately that<br>is where people are getting<br>sexist education and because schools are<br>you know perhaps not running as uh<br>comprehensive sexuality education as<br>they could be but I do want to also make<br>a distinction here that rape is about<br>power and control and that is not part<br>of sexuality education that is part of<br>mental health education and so we we I<br>don't want to you know sexuality<br>education and schools is around<br>developing a positive approach to<br>sexuality and so we are talking about<br>very two very different<br>things can I just uh jump in there<br>because you raise a good point about um<br>rape being about power and control and<br>and that leads into the the the notion<br>of how sexual violation as an offense is<br>actually characterized and how that that<br>feeds into the discourse about about um<br>sexual violation because in the Crimes<br>Act sexual offenses are classified as<br>offenses against public morality and<br>religion they're not actually<br>characterized as offenses against the<br>person and so if the legislature has<br>decided that that's how sexual<br>offenses what they are then that kind of<br>explains in a way<br>why why sexual offenses are seen or why<br>violence sexual violence against women<br>is seen as not okay but you know that<br>that's part of the problem it's it's the<br>way in which they're<br>portrayed um and I think that's an issue<br>that we need to look at as<br>well agree I've got a question that's<br>coming online um if it is a rape of a<br>minor sexual Abus say how much evidence<br>do the police need to proceed with that<br>why is this any different if a<br>13-year-old comes forward saying teror<br>is rap what evidence is needed to<br>proceed if it's if it's a um it depends<br>upon the actual charge that's laid<br>because somebody who has um who has sex<br>with a minor may not necessarily be<br>charged with that as an off they may be<br>charged with sexual violation or they<br>may be charged with a with an offense of<br>sex with a minor so it really depends<br>upon what evidence there is that the<br>that um the police decide which what<br>they're going to charge with so<br>obviously consent is not an issue when<br>the child is under a certain age so if<br>it is a child complainant then then the<br>the issue of consent goes out the window<br>and you don't even have to prove that<br>but if it's if sexual violation is<br>charged then you do have to prove that<br>there was um that the woman or the<br>complainant did not consent and you have<br>to prove that the accused um did not<br>believe on reasonable grounds that she<br>was consenting so a lot of it depends<br>upon the nature of the charge that the<br>police decide to lay and they they base<br>that decision on whether or not they<br>think they'll they're likely to get a<br>conviction Neville someone has asked if<br>um they would like to know if these<br>young men would be looked at at being<br>put on the sexual offender register is<br>pedophil that's not really likely is<br>it no it's it's unlikely there needs to<br>be it's quite a high uh test to be on<br>that register you need to be uh<br>convicted um I'm pretty sure you need to<br>be convicted repeatedly um so under the<br>current regime um that's not going to<br>happen and neither would I advocate it I<br>don't think uh that's all that uh<br>helpful um I think the issues are much<br>broader<br>and we need to be looking at um how we<br>Society does it surprise any of you um H<br>how quickly this sort of roast Busters<br>thing took off and and sort of the<br>national response to it that you know we<br>have sort of given a collective gas of<br>sort of we abore it but what what do you<br>per I could jump in here I mean I I<br>think what has to happen now is is it<br>seems to me there's an enormous social<br>and cultural shift that's required and<br>and of course that's not going to happen<br>overnight that's going to take a long<br>time I think one of the the useful<br>things to come out of this awful awful<br>business is that for the first time in a<br>long time people are talking about<br>things like patriarchy again in misogyny<br>some of the harmful effects of<br>pornography I think that these are<br>things that had sort of dropped off the<br>agenda quite a lot uh for many people<br>and now suddenly they are in the public<br>eye and I think maybe if if if out of<br>this there is some kind of heightened<br>awareness that we need a shift towards<br>thinking more about issues around social<br>justice gender justice then and I think<br>that for me is is some you know a<br>positive<br>step I think it needs to be<br>multi-pronged approach I think we need<br>to educate parents around the fact that<br>their young people have access to the<br>internet on their phones they might put<br>Nanny a nit Nanny on their you know home<br>computer but in fact young people are<br>accessing pornography on an everyday<br>basis from a very young age um and also<br>you know the music and the videos<br>they're watching around um you know the<br>normalization of misogynistic practices<br>against women is you know it's very<br>normalized and so we need a um you know<br>we need the law to do their part we need<br>parents um to be supported and and<br>learning how I mean we we actually have<br>a generation gap around you know and old<br>the generation of parents you know we<br>had to work quite hard to get some<br>access to pornography sneak it out from<br>somebody's you know Playboy collection<br>these days you just watch you know<br>Google something and you've got it in<br>front of you whether you want it or not<br>so you know it needs to be<br>comprehensively thought out about how we<br>will address this across all facets of<br>society it's not just um it's not not<br>about censorship it's about actually um<br>creating what Robin and Neville have<br>talked around um social justice and<br>understanding our rights and our<br>responsibilities not just to ourselves<br>but to others as well um and how to keep<br>ourselves safe and to keep our friends<br>safe and the people or actually anybody<br>that we see who is M such situation<br>where there is some cause for<br>concern I I um I think it's also<br>important to have you know there's a lot<br>of talk about how young people keep<br>themselves safe and a lot of focus has<br>been on what girls are wearing these<br>days and their behavior a lot of focus<br>on the behavior of these girls and I'd<br>also like to have a conversation about<br>the behavior of um victimizers um and<br>and ask you know who's having those<br>conversations with them who's talking to<br>these boys about the meaning of consent<br>you know who's who's who's talking to<br>them about um what what's involved in a<br>sexual relationship you know um it's<br>it's it's not okay to just focus on the<br>behavior of these girls and say you need<br>to keep yourself safe you need to you<br>know watch where you're going and what<br>you're doing and what you know how<br>you're dressing without having a<br>conversation as well about needing to<br>ascertain that a woman is actually<br>consent or a girl is consenting before<br>you know you have sexual activity with<br>her yeah remembering that young men are<br>raped as well so you know about you know<br>consent going both ways and about you<br>know discussion around um relationships<br>communication and I think one of the um<br>aspects that hasn't really entered the<br>debate yet uh in particularly in<br>relation to young men is the issue of<br>homophobia<br>because I think one of the things that<br>we see is that young men and boys are<br>growing up in a society in a culture<br>where it's really important to to be<br>macho to be strong to prove that you are<br>a real<br>man um because if you don't show achieve<br>um those masculine<br>credentials then the risk is that um<br>people will see you as slightly gay um<br>or as gay and in the current um Society<br>that's kind of seen as as bad this comes<br>out of um discussions with young men<br>where one of the things they talk about<br>is the need to quote score with young<br>women is a way of proving that they<br>really are tough they really are matcho<br>that they can't possibly be sus in that<br>kind of a way so what's partly driving<br>this uh hyper masculinity this<br>aggressive<br>sexist uh aggressive sexual behavior I<br>believe is um in part a fear of being<br>seen as weak as a feminine as possibly<br>gay so I think one of the things we need<br>to address is<br>homophobia it's very clear for example<br>in my work with domestic abuse of men<br>that they are very homophobic if you<br>talk about um um gay relationships gay<br>men some of them are literally spitting<br>actually it is such a strong reaction<br>you you get from these guys and so what<br>seems to be uh driving for a driving<br>factor for some of these men is the need<br>to prove themselves particularly staunch<br>and in their minds one of the ways of<br>proving that is to denigrate women to<br>push them around to violate them to uh<br>abuse them so I think a very serious<br>part of this discussion needs to focus<br>on homophobia I agree with you nille I<br>think that we need to be having<br>discussions around acceptance of<br>diversity right from um when you know<br>and you know I come from an education<br>background right from the beginning and<br>that's certainly what the New Zealand<br>curriculum promotes is around acceptance<br>of all diversity and and looking at the<br>way that uh stereotype<br>discriminate and uh against people and<br>how who's advantaged by stereotyping<br>people and who's disadvantaged you know<br>those sorts of questions but this also<br>comes back for me we know that in New<br>Zealand we haven't been doing a good job<br>around comprehensive sexuality education<br>all the way through schooling and we<br>need to lay those foundations right from<br>the outset around um promotion of<br>acceptance for all people and that that<br>differen is great it's not something to<br>be frightened of and that there's a<br>range of ways of being and whatever way<br>you happen to be is is okay and I think<br>um until we actually get some<br>professional development uh back into uh<br>working with teachers that's not going<br>to<br>change how are you going to get um that<br>kind of teaching into I suppose it's<br>teachers colleges isn't it or faculties<br>of Education how how do you do that well<br>I think you know you know um in days<br>gone by we actually did a reasonable job<br>of it and it was in partnership with um<br>some outside agencies like New Zealand<br>Family Planning and the mental health<br>Foundation uh people like the alcohol Li<br>advisory um Al you know so we worked in<br>conjunction with some really important<br>organizations in New Zealand as well<br>along to develop teacher professional<br>development courses and resources that<br>can then support teachers and how they<br>do that in schools and I think you know<br>for a while now um the policy of<br>government has been um to not focus on<br>attitudes and values and citizenship and<br>those sorts of values within schools has<br>been mostly um professional development<br>done in the area of literacy and<br>numeracy but I think if you don't have a<br>healthy a health literacy then I mean<br>what kind of person are you in society<br>and I think it's fundamental to um the<br>way that we want our society to be is to<br>have some social justice uh education on<br>the<br>agenda you talked about mental health I<br>was going to say um what will be the<br>long-term effect on on these young girls<br>that were affected and also on these um<br>boys that actually you know were part of<br>the<br>crime you asking me that Alison I'm<br>asking who wants to<br>answer well I mean think it's it's it's<br>it's well established that there are<br>long-term effects of um sexual violence<br>on on arm victims um you know there's<br>there's so much evidence to support that<br>um obviously um it will affect every<br>individual in a different way but but<br>the you know the psychological effects<br>along with some sometimes physical<br>effects are you know can be<br>significant uh in terms of the the the<br>um alleged<br>perpetrators uh I I guess you know this<br>is potentially something that will that<br>will follow them for the rest of their<br>lives as well um and um you know<br>regardless of whether they're actually<br>charged with an offense or<br>not I would just add to that that I<br>think the impact down the line is hugely<br>influenced by the reaction uh to those<br>events what do people around the young<br>women say are they supportive are they<br>encouraging uh do they allow them to to<br>talk um do they reinforce their uh<br>understanding of the issues um without a<br>doubt um helpful supportive responses<br>can go a long way to um helping people U<br>develop the resilience to move forward<br>in their in their<br>lives and conversely the same with the<br>young men I mean if what the young men<br>learn out of this is that they can be<br>super popular um have a high profile and<br>uh get through without getting into<br>facing any serious consequences then the<br>Outlook is very dire but on the other<br>hand if they uh are confronted with the<br>impact of their behavior if they uh get<br>into some kind of program that will help<br>them explore the uh the consequences of<br>their behavior the in fact the<br>self-defeating nature of the behavior in<br>the end which is perhaps another point<br>that could be made further down the<br>track then the these guys may live um<br>you know perfectly honorable lives um<br>further down the track so it really<br>depends I think to quite a large degree<br>them Robin do you wish to add to<br>that well I think it's absolutely right<br>I think what happens now is crucial for<br>both the girls and the boys uh if I<br>personalize this and some of this this<br>as these stories have unfolded in the<br>media I have reflected back on<br>experiences that I had at a similar age<br>age 13 14 many years ago now and um you<br>know I I remember some of those<br>horrendous things that happened at<br>parties when there were you know there<br>was a lot of alcohol being drunk and and<br>I I remember them really clearly they<br>were formidable scary frightening events<br>that happened for me that happened for<br>my friends and and the fact that a<br>several decades have now passed doesn't<br>mean that that memory has been so I you<br>know I feel fairly sure that these girls<br>are going to remember this for for their<br>lives and and and therefore it's really<br>important now that they're supported<br>encouraged to move through it not to<br>feel that they're hiding things um these<br>are these are really important life<br>things that<br>happen I think we need to remember that<br>we only know about some of the girls and<br>that there are many many women and men<br>who are rap well you know that is that<br>is absolutely right we just we are<br>getting tiny tiny sort of little view on<br>a world and and I know that there's of<br>course we all know there's there's a lot<br>happening that we're not hearing about<br>and a lot of hurt even for people who<br>are not actively involved in in those<br>kinds of in that culture themselves<br>there's uh other ways in which sexual<br>violation is is happening in society<br>where people are being hurt I mean just<br>in fact this week when when it was<br>announced that we would do this Google<br>Hangout I had a colleague come to my<br>office and she said that she'd wanted to<br>ask a question on the hangout um but<br>felt too upset to do so and so in fact<br>what she did was she handed me a piece<br>of paper with her question on it and I<br>think that that speaks the act of coming<br>to my office and handing me a piece of<br>paper and then being tearful I think<br>that that in in some way says more than<br>a question and her question was about I<br>told her that I would I would put it to<br>the group you know her question was<br>about her 11-year-old son at school and<br>she said at Intermediate School there's<br>a lot of talk in the playground and a<br>lot of um about about rape and and the<br>children do use that word rape and that<br>her son had come home very upset about<br>some of the things that were happening<br>so and I know we've talked a bit already<br>today about the need for education and<br>what goes on in schools and sex<br>education and the like but I think that<br>you know here is someone who whose child<br>is is younger than than the ones you<br>know the young people we're talking<br>about in the roast Busters but someone<br>who's profoundly deeply emotionally<br>on I think um you know anyone everyone<br>at school has the right to be safe and<br>uh whether that's physically emotionally<br>or mentally safe and um I think it's one<br>of the things that are happening in<br>schools is that what we don't address<br>becomes what we actually condone and so<br>it's really important that you know that<br>a child feels safe enough to be able to<br>actually go and say something to a<br>teacher in a school um and the kind of<br>environment that we are promoting in<br>schools around safety and uh well-being<br>is important we have a really um<br>fantastic health and physical education<br>curriculum document but it's bigger than<br>the context that we just teach in the<br>classroom it's actually about the whole<br>school environment and you know until we<br>get that right you know do need to have<br>the skills we need to be able to teach<br>the skills for young people to be able<br>to stand up and say something when those<br>sorts of things happen as well so<br>because we can't protect them all the<br>time and unfortunately we do have to<br>teach those skills around how to stand<br>up be assertive how to ask for help um<br>those sorts of things along you know<br>they fit in in this<br>discussion I can I just um go back to<br>the point about um comes partly into<br>your point Robin um as well but also<br>point about that there are a number of<br>victims um that we don't know about and<br>because sexual offenses are one of the<br>most under reported offenses and not<br>only are they under reported those that<br>are reported are probably one of the you<br>know the least likely to result in a<br>prosecution and then the least likely to<br>result in a conviction but one of the<br>reasons why why Under reporting occurs a<br>part from the fact of the shame and the<br>fear of revictimization and all of those<br>things is and this applies particularly<br>with younger complainants like the the<br>child that Rob was talking about is that<br>sometimes they're not actually sure<br>whether an offense has<br>occurred um so it's there are things<br>that are happening that are wrong but<br>but the the victim isn't actually you<br>know fully aware of whether what has<br>happened to them is actually criminal<br>and therefore they don't say anything<br>about<br>it we've had a few questions coming<br>online while um you were talking um the<br>first one is does the type of behavior<br>exhibited in this case support the<br>regulation of online pornography in New<br>Zealand I know it is regulated so I'm<br>not quite sure where the question is<br>going yes but you only have to say yes<br>I'm over 18 and you're in there and you<br>know you might be 12 so it's I'm I'm not<br>sure that that constitutes regulation it<br>was interesting Annie Linux um from the<br>rhythmics was calling this week for<br>regulation of the music and music video<br>industry and I think you know so here we<br>are talking about um you know just the<br>videos that kids are watching let alone<br>um pornography I think there um you know<br>social media has moved very quickly um<br>around 30% of what's on on the Internet<br>is pornographic we've got children as<br>young as 10 consuming pornography every<br>day um and how you regulate that I'm<br>really not sure it's not my area but I<br>would totally agree that we need to be<br>discussing that and I don't know how how<br>one regulates it either but to me one of<br>the things that this particular part of<br>the conversation raises is the<br>importance of teaching our young people<br>critical thinking so to be um sitting<br>with them when they're watching things<br>and inviting them to question the images<br>that they're seeing so in the music<br>video to ask what's the message being<br>portrayed here about uh women what's the<br>what would be the consequences of having<br>that kind of behavior elsewhere do you<br>feel comfortable seeing that as the<br>image of women or of men um I think<br>it's these days young people are being<br>um deluged in all sorts of really<br>unhelpful uh images and ideas and I<br>think one of our best hopes is to<br>encourage them to think critically about<br>them so that they don't just accept them<br>unquestionably and and that is you know<br>fundamental aspect of health education<br>um is around critical thinking and<br>critical action and so you know if we're<br>not having Comprehensive Health<br>education happening in schools then<br>we're missing that opportunity I was in<br>a classroom just the other day where a<br>student out on placement from um from<br>our University was doing exactly that<br>Nevel and the kids in the class it was a<br>year 10 classroom that she was using<br>blured lines with and they were just<br>totally Blown Away by what the actual<br>words of that song were they hadn't<br>actually thought about until that moment<br>in time what the words were actually<br>saying and what the implications of that<br>were moving on from that then this is<br>another question that's coming what does<br>the panel think about the role of<br>parents and farno Brenda asked who was<br>having the discussions around consent<br>and the questioner says they think that<br>it's the primary role of parents and<br>faral where a victimizer has family and<br>faral organizations are helpful but they<br>are<br>secondary I think there's a uh there's<br>there is a responsibility um on all of<br>us not not just parents but as a society<br>to have discussions in any way that we<br>can you know no matter what our rle is<br>um there are always ways of of um<br>starting a conversation um one of the<br>risks I think in making the parents<br>responsible for um for their children's<br>Behavior if that's if that's the<br>direction that people think we ought to<br>go is that and as as the question<br>actually um identifies not all of these<br>kids actually have Faro or parents who<br>are who are present and one of the risks<br>and and sort of blaming parents for the<br>for the Follies and or the criminal acts<br>of their children is that that burden<br>will fall disproportionately on um solo<br>mothers who are usually the ones that<br>are present with the children so you<br>know there is a fine line between making<br>us all accountable and responsible for<br>talking with children but we don't want<br>to go so far as to saying that those<br>parents are responsible because you know<br>often they're not they're simply not<br>there Robin you've worked in that kind<br>of mothering space how do you feel about<br>I think it would be I think it would be<br>um a real problem if it all fell on the<br>shoulders of mothers yet again because<br>so much falls on the shoulders of<br>mothers and um I think that we have to<br>broaden the scope really and think<br>definitely about family Inferno but but<br>beyond that as well I really do think we<br>need to consider how we operate as a<br>community as as various social<br>groupings um even to the point of kind<br>of how we negotiate these things as a<br>nation state you know there's multiple<br>scales to be considered so certainly<br>that micro scale of of friends of family<br>of Pho is important but but I would<br>encourage you know to think well beyond<br>that as well in terms of joint<br>responsibilities there's a question that<br>sort of leads on from that it says is<br>there less respect around women and<br>men well less more I don't know you know<br>I don't don't quite know how you judge<br>that um but what I could say with some<br>certain is there's certainly scope for a<br>lot more respect for girls and and<br>daughters and mothers by men um but that<br>comes down to the fact that we live in a<br>in a society that's organized in a very<br>patriarchal way still and um and<br>therefore I think that we we do need to<br>think about those the gender roles that<br>we play but the gender relations that we<br>have between men and women boys and<br>girls and um there's certainly room for<br>an enormous amount of improve movement<br>there obviously as we've been talking<br>about today CU I think the thing is too<br>that it's not just youth that that this<br>is not just a youth problem and it's<br>it's also very easy to um because the<br>the this case has arisen out of the<br>behavior of young people but the the<br>gender issues in society are much much<br>broader than that so you know the<br>question isn't really about whether<br>young people are dis disrespecting their<br>mothers it's about the views of of women<br>generally within society and there's a<br>risk that we we you know could demonize<br>all young people by focusing on the<br>young people are the only ones who rape<br>woman you know so we you know we come<br>back again to the fact that actually um<br>we learn from those around us and so um<br>you know it's all of the people around<br>us it's what we watch it's what we<br>listen to It's it's what we see um<br>action and and the non-action is teaches<br>us as well so you know Society is bigger<br>than just um one piece and it's uh we<br>can't today I mean we've seen this<br>situation I'm quite heartened by the the<br>response from the public around this<br>issue because it clearly says that this<br>is not okay um and so we we need to to<br>work with that and I think we need to<br>work with young people about respectful<br>relationships and what those mean and<br>what they look like what they feel like<br>you know um we don't always have<br>respectful relationships within our<br>families so we need to find them in<br>other places and so uh you know it's<br>complex there's no easy answer here<br>nille I agree I think um another of the<br>areas that's fairly problematic I think<br>is uh advertising I'm really concerned<br>about the um sexualization of young<br>girls and advertising from a very early<br>age the sorts clothes that are sold the<br>kinds of poses that young women are<br>photographed in in advertising and other<br>forms of uh media um I think that that's<br>one of the areas that we really need to<br>be having a conversation about now as an<br>individual parent or Auntie or or<br>neighbor you might feel powerless about<br>these things but again I think we can<br>start having conversations point out the<br>advertisement um that's perhaps<br>portraying women in a particular uh way<br>invite conversation say what's asking<br>what is the message here do we really<br>want to support a um a product line that<br>is conveying these uh kinds of messages<br>um but I think the early sexualization<br>of uh young girls is part of the problem<br>that we are seeing the implications of<br>here yeah and we can start having those<br>conversations with children as young as<br>preschoolers around you know the kinds<br>of toys that are marketing for young<br>girls compared to young boys and the way<br>that young men are are stereotyped into<br>one area and young girls are into<br>another and you know very very early on<br>that that is sexuality education and it<br>can continue all the way through so<br>great point nille it's very I agree very<br>clear that it forces young women uh into<br>a very narrow kind of space um such that<br>to be popular they need to kind they can<br>feel under huge pressure to be kind of<br>hot in a certain kind of way but on the<br>other hand they can come under huge<br>pressure to be SE if they are seen to be<br>too so they are negotiating their<br>their identities their ways of behaving<br>in a very narrow space which is at least<br>in part shaped by advertising and the<br>media and in a different but similar<br>kind of way you have the same kind of<br>issue for for for young men and that<br>kind of how to uh develop a masculine<br>identity that is not confined Within<br>These very narrow uh<br>walls I was wondering too how much I<br>don't know if you've considered this the<br>impact of lowering the drinking age<br>might have had on this kind of behavior<br>if at<br>all well I don't think lowering the<br>drinking age makes one scrap of<br>difference because we have adults who<br>are perfectly legal to drink alcohol who<br>rape women and um and share that with<br>other people so I think yes alcohol um<br>is a component of that of the issue that<br>we're seeing but I think you know adults<br>drink alcohol and do these sorts of<br>things as equally as young people do we<br>do need to have a discussion and we do<br>within health education talk about the<br>um responsibilities of ourselves and<br>with our friends when we go out and<br>looking after each other and um I think<br>you know it's that bystander approach<br>that I talked about a bit earlier that<br>if you see somebody who is particularly<br>drunk or has used other substances it's<br>about your social responsibility as a<br>human to look after people um and not um<br>just leave them to be taken advantage of<br>and we do explore those sorts of<br>scenarios on what you might do if um<br>you're out with friends and those sorts<br>of things happen in health education but<br>we need we need more discussion around<br>this bystander approach as well as you<br>know looking after ourselves but we all<br>make mistakes you know Robin talked<br>about it when we were younger you know<br>we we all make mistakes along the way<br>but and it could be that something like<br>that happened to us or we were looked<br>after it by our<br>friends yes I think that's one of the<br>unfortunate parts of some of this debate<br>is that there is this huge focus on<br>holding individuals accountable and and<br>I can understand that individuals need<br>to be held accountable when they do bad<br>things<br>um but in some ways it's also<br>unfortunate if it reinforces this notion<br>that we are individuals that we're<br>responsible for ourselves and everybody<br>else can go to hell um we really need to<br>be developing a social ethic of care<br>care for one another in exactly the ways<br>that Debbie is is talking about um we<br>all have a responsibility for each other<br>to speak up to stand up to uh be<br>supportive to to intervene and lowkey<br>kinds of ways I think there's lots that<br>we can do to be looking after each other<br>and we really need to be um emphasizing<br>care if we look at the laws around<br>social media do you think because things<br>happen so fast in that space that we're<br>catchup um it's it's it's unfortunate<br>that um that my colleague Wayne rumbles<br>is not here to um to to speak on this<br>because this is his area of expertise um<br>I'm not sure that we're always playing<br>catch up one one of the things about<br>social media that from a legal point of<br>view that is actually beneficial is that<br>it um it does make the detection um of<br>offenses you know in some ways uh a lot<br>easier so there are I guess it's it<br>swings and roundabouts in terms of<br>social media it can<br>facilitate um things from a criminal<br>point of view but<br>um from from a from another point of<br>view um it does mean that there's is<br>always something that that we haven't<br>quite got our heads around um you know<br>that's happening before we we actually<br>have the we have the technology to do it<br>but we don't necessarily have the<br>framework like a legal framework for<br>so and as Robin pointed out earlier the<br>social media has also been a wonderful<br>site of resistance here and that's<br>that's really encouraging I mean way<br>people have been signing up to to<br>petitions organizing marches that's to<br>be<br>celebrated I think that it's um it's<br>quite important to remember that that<br>social media is is a site that it in<br>some ways it both um reflects what<br>happens in real space or everyday lives<br>our real material lives uh and it and it<br>kind of in a sense sort of reinforces<br>that too they're not actually separate<br>space I mean when scholarship first<br>began on on on the cyber world it was as<br>though it was a fairly distinct kind of<br>sphere and people had their real<br>material lives and then people had their<br>online lives where they were just<br>avatars or they were some kind of<br>fleshless bodies and I think it's<br>understood much more clearly these days<br>that that the real world and the and the<br>virtual world or the world of social<br>media are incredibly interconnected and<br>I think that's what we're seeing<br>actually in this particular case of of<br>the um the roast Busters we're seeing<br>what's happening in fact in Real Worlds<br>at parties and the like and then we're<br>seeing it both reflected and reinforced<br>in the world of social<br>media and I think these things have<br>happened in the past but we just didn't<br>necessarily know about them and now we<br>know about them because of you know the<br>realities of of the way social media is<br>I mean I was chatting with some young<br>men the other night and and who are in<br>their early 20s and they've been<br>consuming pornography on a daily basis<br>since they're about 10 now this is a new<br>this is new so you know this this we<br>haven't seen this kind of access to the<br>way um particularly women are treated um<br>on a daily basis in through social media<br>the accessibility of this and the fact<br>that um you know that there is more and<br>more violence and and the way that women<br>and what might be termed as um you know<br>weaker men but who are not but you know<br>other men that are um violated against<br>on on social media as well I think you<br>know it's there's no easy answer I think<br>the social media is making it more<br>explicit uh we we do have to we have to<br>be able to think outside the box around<br>how we turn this around now and move it<br>yeah sorry carry on N Michelle the court<br>in a blog yesterday I think kind of<br>pointed out that young men boasting<br>about their sexual conquests and I need<br>to put those in inverted comers because<br>it may actually mean right um in a<br>earlier age that such boasting happened<br>behind the shelter shed now it's<br>happening on Facebook and I thought that<br>was a really nice way of of putting it<br>um which is not to minimize it because<br>as I say behind that sort of strutting<br>and stuff there is real misery U<br>brutality um and oppression and so it's<br>uh it's really important that we're not<br>kind of Simply normalizing it but at the<br>same time it's I think only realistic to<br>accept that this has been going on for a<br>long time yeah and the fact that that<br>kind of accessibility actually the<br>impact that it makes has on people's<br>attitudes and values and the way that<br>they live their lives um you know is<br>some of the research coming out um<br>around the impact of viewing this level<br>of of pornography is quite frightening<br>around the attitudes and values changes<br>in young<br>people uh indeed I have um women<br>students in my classes who have talked<br>about the the way pornography has shaped<br>their male Partners expectations of what<br>a sexual relationship is it's been<br>incredibly uh oppressive and distressing<br>and also young women thinking that they<br>need to that that's the way they're<br>expected to act as well so yeah both<br>sides<br>yeah so the media has played quite a<br>substantial role in highlighting this<br>issue the trouble is the media is a<br>Fickle beast and you know ly Brown's<br>been pushed aside now and you know we've<br>had roast Busters and so the fear is do<br>you think that you know the next big<br>thing comes along and this roast basts<br>issue is kind of the bottom drawer and<br>these conversations that we should be<br>having we we're not going to have and it<br>won't get you know put out to a level<br>where you know something actually<br>happened so how do we stop that how do<br>we make sure it still stays on top of<br>the<br>pile well I'm hoping the shock value of<br>what's happened you know that it's<br>obvious that um you know a large amount<br>of the community is completely shocked<br>by what um about this event and I think<br>think I well I hope that that means that<br>that translates into some action around<br>thinking about how do we address these<br>sorts of things I mean I'm I'm from an<br>education background I would like to<br>think that the government actually<br>thinks about prioritizing health<br>education again in schools um we've<br>known for a long time that there's not<br>enough health education going on and I<br>think you know we've talked about the<br>fact that it's multifaceted the way that<br>young people are um influenced and<br>school is one of those things um one of<br>those places but until we can start to<br>critique the messages that we're getting<br>and and form our own opinions around<br>with that critical thinking element that<br>leads to critical action you know what<br>where do young people learn otherwise<br>how to address some of those things so I<br>would hope to see that um you know<br>health health education is definitely<br>table and it's really important isn't it<br>that that health educ ation um as you<br>say comes with a critical uh<br>analysis and it's not just about the<br>biology of sex which was the sex<br>education that I kind remember from my<br>school days that it's much more about<br>the ethics of of<br>relationships uh those kinds of things<br>isn't it I think it really needs to be<br>looking at Power and where that fits as<br>well um control you know the mental<br>health ects uh around these and the<br>Dynamics within relationships and and um<br>what what tmin healthy relationships and<br>what doesn't so it's bigger than um old<br>school what was called sex education So<br>within sexuality education we absolutely<br>look at relationships but we also need<br>to be thinking that this is definitely<br>around mental health this is around<br>power control and um and and<br>abuse and and I think if I could just<br>add in there just to reinforce that you<br>know the the critical thinking has to<br>happen not just through education<br>programs at school of course it it does<br>need to be happening from for kids from<br>a very young age and and families Faro<br>friends again it has to be part of a<br>collective Enterprise and I don't think<br>that simply um bracketing our young<br>people our kids off from the kinds of<br>images that we find uncomfortable<br>whether it's Miley Cyrus and her<br>twerking or what whatever it might be I<br>think just sort of trying to put some<br>blanket censorship over those won't work<br>for kids they're going to become they<br>they're surrounded by these images<br>there's no escaping them so in fact<br>being able to in some ways Rob those<br>images of their power by being able to<br>to think them through deconstruct them<br>whatever engage in critical thinking<br>about them no doubt from we children are<br>quite young I think it's important and I<br>know some people would rather Shield<br>their kids off from anything to do with<br>sexuality when when kids are young<br>because they feel they don't have the<br>capacity to deal with those complex<br>issues and and there's some I can see<br>what drives that kind of thinking but<br>but I do think that from quite an early<br>age um children need to be able to and<br>we've said this but just you know to say<br>it again need to learn to question to<br>think for themselves um and in a sense<br>it kind of robs those things of the<br>power that they have agree totally can I<br>um also say just as part of that<br>Collective Enterprise and and keeping<br>that conversation alive it's you know I<br>do agree that all of us as as academics<br>um have a role in in our respective<br>fields in trying to trying to foster a a<br>a different view um and one of the one<br>of the things about the law is that that<br>once you change the law you can start to<br>shift in some way public opinion as well<br>and we have over the last 20 30 years<br>made some really big changes in the in<br>relation to the law of sexual violation<br>you know there are things um in the<br>crimes act now that that do facilitate<br>the prosecution of sexual offenses but<br>that's got to be an ongoing thing and<br>you have to constantly the law has to<br>constantly change to to um to you know<br>try<br>and um get these views wider views about<br>the role of women in society and enforce<br>those views reinforce those views out<br>there um and it comes back to as I said<br>the way in which we you know sexual<br>offenses are characterized in the crimes<br>act as being offenses against religion<br>and public morality well that needs to<br>change you know because you know that<br>those things I mean they might seem like<br>minor things but it does it does um feed<br>into a particular discourse that we want<br>to<br>change and talking about the the law<br>brended um the law commission did some<br>work on the prosecution of sexual<br>violence and came up with<br>recommendations for a more inquisitorial<br>approach do you have a view on on on<br>that uh in terms of prosecut I I don't<br>know that changing to an<br>inquisitorial system um<br>for sexual offenses or for a a VAR you<br>know for one category of offenses is<br>necessarily the way to go because one<br>thing it does portray the In a Different<br>Light to other offenses of violence and<br>um yes I think there are changes that<br>can be made within the adversarial<br>system that will make it easier for<br>complainants to um to deal with with the<br>process of and and we have made some of<br>those changes we have made changes about<br>the way in which complainants may be<br>questioned in court and um being giving<br>evidence in alternative ways and you<br>cannot ask a complainant about their<br>sexual experience with anyone other than<br>and the defendant and all those kinds of<br>things have helped to to make the<br>process of of um prosecution a lot<br>easier on complaintant but there are<br>further changes that that can be made um<br>in that way I wouldn't Advocate moving<br>system we have about five minutes left<br>to go we've had a couple of comments<br>come in I agree it's difficult to<br>regulate social media but more<br>discussion in the open about what our<br>children are seeing online would help<br>them process this in a more healthy way<br>if we are silent then we will continue<br>to believe what they are seeing is<br>normal I think we' covered that pretty<br>well um and then from another person<br>what our children are seeing in the<br>media then has more influence than what<br>is being taught in the home question<br>mark is there not enough discussion in<br>the home um is there no healthy<br>influences in the home<br>I think that's pretty complex of course<br>um I think that as parents who didn't<br>have the same accessibility to social<br>media like our children have that we<br>really um<br>are in a new situation and we may not<br>always have thought about how best to<br>address that um you know people think<br>that their children are on Facebook or<br>whatever and that's okay but they<br>actually probably through<br>naivity um are not aware of the kinds of<br>things that they might be actually<br>accessing and I think um I think you<br>know I talked before about this Gap and<br>between um the parents reality and what<br>children's reality is today and I think<br>probably there hasn't been a bigger one<br>around you know the accessibility that<br>children have online these days compared<br>to their parents so I think it's just<br>that we we haven't had to go into that<br>space before with our parentals what the<br>others think here I think one of the<br>things is that the the media is so<br>overwhelming I mean there's just so much<br>of it that it is very hard to balance<br>that I mean I think even in even in<br>situations where parents are trying<br>their hardest as as nille said to you<br>know to to Advocate a a critique of what<br>these kids are seeing um there's just so<br>much of it that they have access to it<br>in so many different ways that it's um<br>it's the sheer volume that makes it hard<br>to<br>counteract there's plenty of healthy<br>influences around um it's about<br>critiquing those as well and whether<br>they're healthy for you you know so um<br>it's but but perhaps we are inundated<br>with um you know but just because of the<br>sheer number of uh the accessibility the<br>things that we're bombarded with on a<br>daily basis from advertising to songs we<br>listen to to the television programs we<br>watch to the movies we watch you know<br>like that it's really important we begin<br>to critique the the messaging and there<br>and and how it fits with their own ideas<br>about<br>reality and I I do think it's a real<br>challenge for parents being able to to<br>keep up with kids and what's happening<br>with social media I know as having two<br>sons myself continually sort of saying<br>what are you doing on in your bedroom on<br>all that time oh I'm just on the<br>computer yes but what are you doing on<br>the computer and not really<br>understanding quite what's going on or<br>I'm just looking at Facebook you know<br>what's Facebook having to it seems like<br>there's a continual having to learn uh<br>for parents new ways of being new ways<br>of being online and virtual spaces and<br>and trying to understand and with their<br>kids around what their kids are are<br>doing and I I really have some empathy<br>here but for parents but I do think it's<br>important that we try and keep those<br>channels of communication open all the<br>time so that we have an active voice in<br>all of that about well if you're looking<br>at that image you know why what's going<br>what is going on with that image as<br>Neville has said before so it's uh it<br>does seem to be a rapidly changing World<br>in which we live that's for certain an<br>interesting little uh statistic I have<br>here is that 67% of teens have cleared<br>out their browser history to make sure<br>their parents can't view their online<br>activity and um 64% of parents do not<br>use any online parental controls<br>filtering software and that's from<br>Microsoft 2011 so I think you know there<br>is a gap in how we actually address it<br>because we didn't have to face it<br>ourselves we we're a little bit naive as<br>parents<br>perhaps well we've covered a lot of<br>issues today and it seems to me that<br>there a no there are no easy answers I<br>guess the important thing is to keep<br>talking about it and that's at all<br>levels really from educ<br>legal social cultural you know in the<br>home online so um and and we just don't<br>want to let it drop out of sight um<br>Brenda midson Debbie futi Neville<br>Robertson and Robin Longhurst I want to<br>thank you for taking part in the googgle<br>hangout today now you can go and have<br>some lunch thank you very much thank
