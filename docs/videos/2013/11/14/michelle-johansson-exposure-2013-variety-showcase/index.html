the<br>author of course the real author is a<br>man named<br>I don't look like him not in the<br>slightest I don't sound like him besides<br>he was a much older man than I am<br>about the only thing we have in common<br>is that well we're both<br>he's part someone and I'm part one<br>anywhere he made me up I don't know why<br>so<br>here I am an act of the imagination<br>creates it out of nothing in particular<br>on a rainy day so that other acts of the<br>imagination these characters display<br>might come into existence<br>and unreality bringing forth into the<br>does that seem so strange to you<br>it is<br>no not really I mean without these other<br>characters I have no reason being here<br>and without us the real author really<br>has no reason for existence and that has<br>so I have as much right as he to say<br>that I am the author the real author of<br>this pain<br>even to use his name is mine<br>ladies and gentlemen here and now I<br>create him and then that creation<br>creates<br>myself<br>now that you all understand let me Begin<br>Again<br>friends<br>dear friends<br>my name is John Newton and I am the<br>author of the play you are about to see<br>welcome to the Golden Shores of Paris<br>welcome to the golden days of Awakening<br>when the elite Reigns in the original<br>Splinter and they are loyal and carefree<br>subject welcome to a meeting of<br>hurricane clouds and Views bangle days<br>there are big rainbows across azure's<br>gospel welcome to the land of true alarm<br>oh<br>foreign<br>pattern you took the word right out of<br>Aloha Cafe my name is Michelle Johansson<br>I am not Hawaiian and Louis is not the<br>author of this play the real author of<br>this play is not Hawaiian either and nor<br>are these beautiful Waikiki hula dances<br>I am a Tongan director working in<br>aotearoa with a pen pollination cast in<br>May of this year to produce a Hawaiian<br>play by a sound one playwright having<br>said that though I am<br>and the real playwright isamon<br>the question of the day then is cultural<br>authenticity<br>and the medium of Polynesian theater<br>making and specifically in medical by<br>John Newbold<br>so why Newville why here and why now<br>so to do this we need to imagine a time<br>before the 1990s in New Zealand where<br>Polynesian actors were unaccustomed we<br>were unaccustomed to seeing pollinating<br>actors play Polynesian people on the<br>stages of aotearoor<br>so this was a time before Samoans were<br>naked or laughing or in bro town and<br>before Dr Maxwell alvia and his cousin<br>Vinnie appeared on the streets of<br>insurance<br>there were virtually no stories about<br>about Polynesians or for them on the<br>in 1992 a play called think of a garden<br>was written and this story told a Sam<br>Warren story using Samoan language from<br>a samoan-centric world view<br>it was the first time at the Samoan<br>language was heard in the theaters<br>and it held new zealanders to tasks so<br>think of a garden tell us the story of<br>the assassination of the poor time<br>assisted leader of the Mal movement<br>gunned down by the New Zealand Police in<br>December of 1929 and in a peaceful<br>protest and sorry in up here<br>so<br>for specific people in aotearoa and<br>particularly San Juan people this was a<br>landmark play and John newball as a<br>landmark playwright I'm a Polynesian<br>theater maker I have a duty to pay back<br>and to pay forward so because of noble I<br>can stand here on the stage today and<br>the themes and characters and stories of<br>his play melatonicle have arguably never<br>newbles players explore themes of<br>cultural identity loss and Redemption<br>for Polynesians of mixed blood and<br>second thoughts and it's a fusion of<br>newbles well-educated Western<br>perspective but also his deep-seated<br>Polynesian roots that create the<br>dramatic tension through which evil<br>stages questions of authenticity<br>in the field of postcolonial studies the<br>concept of authentic culture is<br>problematic does this imply a return to<br>some perfect state of pre-colonial<br>indigeneity or do we mean something that<br>is true to a more fluid sense of a<br>culture that evolves<br>in 1976 Professor Albert wink wrote that<br>there is no state of cultural Purity<br>from which there is decline usage<br>determines authenticity<br>I argue that our production of medical<br>is culturally authentic despite the fact<br>that we had no Hawaiians in our Hawaiian<br>flag<br>I argue that newborn's play script is<br>culturally authentic despite his own<br>status as an outsider to the culture on<br>which he comments anti-criticizes<br>I argue that the methodology that binds<br>is a weaving<br>culturally authentic Polynesian way of<br>selecting Gathering and joining<br>different fibers together<br>and I argue that our production was also<br>a weaving the weaving together of a play<br>script that was written in 1975 and the<br>weaving together of a diverse pan<br>Polynesian cast of dancers actors and<br>musicians and an authentic Polynesian<br>production that could only have happened<br>says that newbles layers of story and<br>theme continually speak to and across<br>each other weaving in and out of the<br>text like the fibers of a pandanus mat<br>Albert wintz says of Polynesians that<br>our dead are woven into our souls like<br>the hypnotic music of bone flutes we can<br>never Escape them and if we let them<br>they can help us illuminate ourselves<br>into one another it is this illumination<br>of ourselves and to ourselves that the<br>layers of the play work towards and Mele<br>Kanika<br>in the story actors in a pageant are<br>preparing for their hula performance for<br>tourists to Hawaii<br>the concert has a sense of being fake oh<br>rather than a genuine performance of<br>cultural practices until the native<br>Hawaiian expert arrives with an<br>authentic hula halal the kumuhula is<br>drunken I agree I like to be drunk so I<br>hate<br>and defensive and he tells the<br>traditional Hawaiian Legend of kahikiloa<br>and here and we as the audience accept<br>this<br>accept it<br>I accept it good wonderful but a little<br>more are leaking in your voice I accept<br>it<br>the story of the young Mali kahikilo's<br>love for the beautiful care<br>you all know the story of how love<br>turned into jealousy and how it helps<br>you remember the beginning how hikilo<br>grew up in the valley<br>how he was favored with power and beauty<br>and how he spread all of women until<br>finally<br>while visiting Kauai he came to right<br>now<br>and the people were Feast You Can Dance<br>and when you saw the beautiful young<br>has in his Shadows<br>your sweet<br>foreign<br>that into<br>dreams<br>is<br>lately<br>amen<br>however this moment which purports to be<br>the most traditionally authentic and<br>Hawaiian of all of the moments in the<br>play is actually the biggest fairy tale<br>of them all it is a made-up Legend<br>performed by ghosts<br>what does it mean men to be culturally<br>authentic<br>the play functions as a charge to all<br>Polynesians to reconnect with their<br>cultural pasts and to re-weave the<br>fibers of their own identity accordingly<br>it is therefore an individual and<br>personal June just as the lead character<br>Carl must find his own way to live in a<br>culturally authentic manner so must we<br>all<br>in Polynesian culture<br>the art of weaving These Fine mats is<br>passed on through the generations as<br>other Mets themselves they are woven<br>with strands that travel to and from two<br>different directions and we might Define<br>these directions in different ways in<br>Noble script they might be said to<br>represent his totalore his two bloods<br>Heritage these scribers are woven into a<br>match of cultural value that might be<br>laid down as a prized gift or at a<br>special occasion at a wedding or a<br>Christian or a funeral marking loss as<br>the play does in its melatonical<br>personal and Collective<br>however this precious met now woven<br>it might be used as a marker of cultural<br>value<br>adorning a bride<br>the performance itself then becomes the<br>gift<br>it is a reminder of traditional customs<br>it is a way to show cultural<br>authenticity<br>as witch says usage determines<br>authenticity<br>how offer and Wilson say that to<br>contemporary discourses of identity<br>politics newbles work offers the lighter<br>perspective from ancient Oceania that<br>one's identity is a work in progress<br>continually being woven from the fibers<br>of lineage heart and volition<br>thank you<br>many clinical reminds us that we must<br>choose to weave our own identities<br>it reminds us of the need to retain our<br>cultures and cultural practices<br>it presents a culturally authentic and<br>Polynesian story that focuses on<br>individual Duty and Collective<br>responsibility<br>Like Houses of words and to which our<br>thing can move and love again and speak<br>to us oh listen if you would only listen<br>it is in you a green let us through
