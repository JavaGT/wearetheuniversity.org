The competition challenges candidates to present a compelling oration on their thesis and its significance in just three minutes in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>how are our judges alistair's still<br>writing good that's good that's great<br>i've also discovered already that three<br>minutes is just enough time for me to<br>check my lipstick so<br>you're not going to have to put up with<br>me looking completely doggy at any point<br>during the evening i can do it which is<br>good is anybody else middle aged enough<br>to need to carry a compact and check<br>their makeup all the time<br>because yes you are you're too young you<br>just put your hand up for that because<br>you know that at some point the whole<br>because you pile it on don't you is it<br>just me you pile it<br>and some point at some point it goes<br>like that i carry a little uh antique<br>compact that used to belong to my<br>grandmother which is really cute but i<br>just looked in before and i went oh my<br>god it's still got my grandmother's face<br>i don't even know how that works because<br>i'm not good with physics and stuff is<br>that quantum physics i don't know how<br>i don't know how that works<br>what about you what are you doing what's<br>happening with you good are we ready<br>alistair you're writing a thesis of your<br>own<br>still working<br>nearly done<br>no pressure okay all right and jan<br>you're all sorted<br>god i love a man with a beard all right<br>number two<br>our second presenter tonight is damon<br>whitton he's from hamilton and he's with<br>the faculty of education his title of<br>his thesis is understanding and<br>enhancing adult learners beliefs about<br>mathematics<br>while in school many students develop<br>negative beliefs about mathematics and<br>unfortunately those persist into<br>adulthood and influence how adults<br>engage in numeracy instruction in the<br>tertiary sector to tell us more about<br>aaron hates maths<br>it makes them feel dumb when i<br>interviewed him he said that he spent<br>his school days at the back of the class<br>avoiding the attention of the teacher<br>and a secret from family and teachers<br>alike is that since he started high<br>school maths he slowly stopped<br>understanding anything<br>his worst moment was at 15 and the<br>teacher saw him copying and asked him to<br>solve a problem on the board and as he<br>approached the board<br>all those feelings of dread eroded his<br>ability to think and he froze<br>frustrated and embarrassed he stormed<br>out of the class and never returned<br>so now at 23<br>aaron's perception of failure is tied up<br>with his self-identity and his beliefs<br>about himself and mathematics have<br>become part of the architecture of his<br>mind<br>you see while we were at maths at school<br>we were also learning lessons about what<br>maths is how math is learned and what it<br>means to be good or bad at maths and for<br>aaron this has simply evoked feelings of<br>inadequacy and shame and that is why he<br>has avoided maths like the plague<br>until this year<br>see recent research has revealed that<br>hundreds of thousands of young new<br>zealand adults have both poor numeracy<br>and negative beliefs about the topic and<br>that puts them at risk from some very<br>nasty social and economic outcomes and<br>as a response the government has<br>mandated that numeracy instruction be<br>included in every entry-level vocational<br>course so every day in new zealand tens<br>of thousands of errands into numeracy<br>classrooms and re-confront the very<br>environments they fear<br>well my research explores how adults<br>beliefs influences their engagement with<br>mathematical content tutors resources<br>and each other and it seeks to improve<br>beliefs in order to reignite the<br>learning potential inherent in people<br>like aaron<br>well my research has found that aaron's<br>story is anything but unique<br>many adults experience the numeracy<br>classroom as a dangerous environment and<br>it has a really damning effect on the<br>level of engagement and the quality of<br>thinking that occurs and worse it's<br>contagious so the negative beliefs and<br>attitudes are quickly picked up by the<br>group and reinforced<br>beliefs about mathematics have<br>ramifications that go beyond just maths<br>they catch the heart of who people are<br>and what they believe they're capable of<br>by improving beliefs we can re-engage<br>people like aaron with mathematics<br>and imagine the impact on aaron<br>and his family when he discovers he can<br>learn maths and begins to experience<br>feelings of joy of success<br>potentially life changing<br>ladies and gentlemen how was that did he<br>17 seconds so he could have done a<br>little tap dance could have<br>snippet of a song anybody else in the<br>room but frightened of numbers<br>you are were you frightened by a number<br>as a small child it happens does it i<br>love numbers i you know one of my<br>favorite things is doing a gst return<br>really i really do i think because you<br>know most of my life is walking into a<br>room full of people i've never seen and<br>trying to work out what makes them laugh<br>so if i can be confronted with some<br>columns on a spreadsheet that might add<br>up to something that i was expecting i'm<br>just thrilled<br>occasionally for a gig i just wish i<br>could go out and you know multiply<br>something by three and divide it by 23<br>and people would be impressed with me<br>there are three accountants in the room<br>that's how you work out what the gst<br>content is of something did you know<br>that<br>yeah so so you know 15 gst you there's<br>the the<br>gross number and then you add 15 to it<br>but when you pay 2.73 for something if<br>you want to know what the gs content<br>gst content of it is i don't know why<br>i'm telling you this hurry up judges is<br>um the way to work out the gst content<br>is to multiply it by three and divide it<br>by 23.<br>because it works every time and i don't<br>know why i have no idea why that works<br>none of those numbers has anything to do</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background:
