Science)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hello everyone my name is jacob martin<br>and i'm currently an honors student in<br>the chemistry department<br>at the photon factory<br>under the supervision of dr keitha<br>simpson and today i'd like to talk to<br>you about a really cool project that<br>we've had in the lab over the last year<br>called poetry off the page<br>so<br>let's begin with some humble beginners<br>in the photon factory<br>so what is the photon factory well the<br>photon factory is a multi-user laser<br>facility which specializes in producing<br>exotic laser pulses<br>and so we've got what's called a<br>femtosecond laser and what this means is<br>that the pulses that come out are are<br>only a fifth a second long<br>and so what is the 5th second well it's<br>10 to the minus 15 seconds so that's<br>0.14 0 is one<br>second so that's really really short so<br>i'll just give you an idea of that so<br>one femtosecond is to a second as a<br>minute is to the age of the<br>earth so that kind of gives you an idea<br>and we can use this these photosecond<br>pulses for two main things firstly we<br>can take slow-motion pictures of<br>molecules and so for example the<br>molecule of the backyard retinol<br>that's a cartonnoid from carrots so your<br>mum was right when she said if you eat<br>carrots it does improve your eyesight<br>when that gets hit by light it breaks a<br>double bond and you get this flipping<br>that happens within hundreds of<br>femtoseconds<br>and that is what that has been triggered<br>into your brain and that's how you<br>register seeing light<br>so we can take slow-mo pictures of<br>molecules the second thing is we can<br>machine anything<br>so usually when you machine something um<br>you create a lot of heat and that heat<br>can<br>can melt it can crack objects<br>but our femtosecond laser hits the<br>sample there's no time for heat to go<br>into the material and so you vaporize it<br>and it just kind of<br>evaporates<br>and so i'm just going to show you a<br>video um from the director herself dr<br>cather simpson explaining what we do in<br>and one of the things that we do in our<br>lab in the photon factory is we use that<br>idea of belief as a model to make our<br>own energy converting machine eventually<br>we'll be able to make a material that<br>you can embed in a roofing tile and just<br>lay on your house and then your house<br>will absorb sunlight convert it to<br>electricity which for us is the useful<br>form of energy we would like to have and<br>be able to run your television<br>so we use laser pulses exotic laser<br>pulses as a tool<br>and we can study everything<br>from<br>art restoration trying to figure out how<br>pigments degrade and prevent that<br>degradation in renaissance paintings to<br>understanding the fundamental nature of<br>how<br>electrons and nuclei interact with one<br>another on a molecular scale to<br>developing better drugs things like<br>cancer therapeutic agents use light in<br>order to kill off cancer cells we also<br>use that light to do<br>engineering type things on tiny scales<br>so scales that are length scales that<br>are smaller than the width of the human<br>hair so we can use our lasers to drill<br>features into materials or make little<br>architectures of things little molecular<br>scale machines<br>and start probing things on the<br>nanoscale<br>so the reason the photon factory was<br>established here at the university of<br>albany was to enable the creative<br>research of a wide range of basic and<br>applied research to<br>improve human health<br>to<br>improve our ability to harvest clean<br>renewable energy<br>improve the technology that we all use<br>every day<br>and to understand the basic fundamental<br>so yeah it said much better than i could<br>ever say it<br>so so then how does poetry come into<br>this<br>well<br>keith has got a knack of of<br>of saying that we can machine anything<br>and so she was talking with um with<br>michelle leaded and helen sword and they<br>run a class in the english department<br>called poetry off the page and they're<br>trying to get poetry into new mediums<br>which people aren't used to so that<br>people can engage with them with the<br>poetry in ways they'd never have before<br>and so when they heard that we could<br>machine anything<br>they came knocking at the door to see if<br>they could test our claim<br>and so<br>we fired the laser<br>um<br>we had um 10 groups that came through<br>our lab from the poetry of the page<br>class 2012<br>and um and they chose uh they chose an<br>object from a stanza of ian witty's<br>shadow stands up<br>that related to that stanza and then<br>they micro machined that so i've just<br>got a video when they came in last<br>september and showing them what they<br>so<br>so what<br>so they came in in september and they<br>they we started machining the projects<br>the the poems but it took us a lot<br>longer than that took us about six<br>months and the downtime in the lab to<br>machine the rest of these because each<br>object had to be set up with the precise<br>laser laser tuned parameters so it took<br>us quite some time<br>but i'd like to share a few stories<br>about kind of the<br>mishaps and some of the funny stories<br>that arose from from machining these<br>poles the first thing is<br>this banana box which we tried to<br>machine so that's the banana box there<br>and this isn't the original banana box<br>we got<br>actually we got a different banana box<br>um and we laser machined it so that was<br>great however we left it in the lab and<br>as you can see it makes it looks like a<br>very nice cutting board<br>and so someone came along and got their<br>piece of plastic and<br>and uh basically cut it to pieces uh so<br>my fiance and i had to go down to the<br>supermarket and explain to them that we<br>wanted another banana box in order to<br>laser machine poetry<br>we got some pretty blank locks until we<br>said that it was an art project and then<br>they all kind of seem to understand<br>the other thing um is uh is this dice<br>this dodecahedron and um<br>it uh it should have the palm on the<br>three face and it does however it also<br>has palm four on the fourth face um so<br>that was my bad<br>that had to be corrected<br>um<br>but<br>we did show that we could machine every<br>object so we can machine everything<br>uh up to date<br>so i'd like to show some some really<br>cool some of my favorite objects that we<br>machined so this key here<br>has the smallest poem on it<br>and so it's just in there and you can't<br>even see it with your eye um<br>and it is about uh 600 microns across<br>about six gears<br>that's how big the entire poem is<br>so that is by far our smallest poem<br>um the other thing is that we were able<br>to machine glass so this here is a<br>little stand of something i'm not sure<br>what but we were able to machine in that<br>without cracking it or doing any thermal<br>damage and this is actually what we've<br>received a large grant to do in order to<br>machine dielectrics for the<br>semiconductor industry in order to<br>basically design sensors and<br>chemical sensor technology and so it was<br>it was great to be able to show that we<br>could<br>machine that when normal lasers would<br>definitely fall short<br>and the last thing is the power shell so<br>this beautiful<br>power shell here we actually didn't get<br>a whole shell to begin with we got a<br>tiny little piece and we couldn't<br>machine it so um so i i went and we<br>found another powershell my hand sanded<br>this took me a whole afternoon so<br>different grits and finally a diamond<br>polish<br>and<br>interestingly this here is a nanosecond<br>laser machining and you can see all the<br>thermal damage and melting that occurs<br>and then here compare that with the with<br>the sharp um lines that we get from the<br>50 second laser so you can really see<br>the difference between using a<br>nanosecond a longer pulse and a very<br>very short pulse we literally can<br>machine that away with no<br>and there's a super<br>secret so as i was doing this i was also<br>preparing a secret<br>so i'll let you discover what that is<br>is it in nanometers how small is that<br>well your fingernails grow one nanometer<br>every second and in this tiny kingdom<br>it's hard to see where science stops and<br>art begins jake martin who we met before<br>was the man that the auckland university<br>english department called when they<br>wanted poetry inscribed on everyday<br>objects this stanza reduced from this<br>the width of five hairs on the face of a<br>watch<br>what this says to me<br>is it's a message to say to us all that<br>there's a lot of beauty in the world<br>that we completely miss<br>yes<br>i i guess i remember taking a picture of<br>a power shell<br>just seeing the beautiful ridges in the<br>power shell which actually splits the<br>light up<br>and and being able to look at it on such<br>a small scale<br>it's just a whole new dimension of of<br>reality which<br>it is really quite quite stunning<br>it takes poetry to places where poetry<br>doesn't usually go and that's just<br>exciting because poetry is almost<br>everywhere around us but to take it into<br>this different kind of space makes us<br>think<br>differently about the media during his<br>hours of writing microscopic poetry with<br>the university's million-dollar laser<br>that he also wrote a message on a ring<br>in litters the width of a grain of sand<br>while it sealed the deal it's not the<br>whole reason she said yes<br>it's not a whole package<br>yeah that's one of the things<br>because you'll be surprised though he's<br>got wonderful attention to detail about<br>the memory<br>you can't see it<br>so i'd invite you to check us out<br>firstly there's the website poetry off<br>the page<br>dot org.nz you can have a look and we've<br>got a zooming interface so you can have<br>a look at each poem and read<br>all the different stanzas we've also got<br>a library display where we've actually<br>got a usb microscope so you can actually<br>hold it over the object and see the<br>different poles<br>and email us if you have a challenge<br>if you think of an object that can be<br>machined that<br>currently can't be<br>some object then then go wild so i'd<br>like to thank all the people that helped<br>out um frozen mcmullen was really great<br>at helping out with the machining side<br>of things dr cather simpson for<br>obviously allowing us to to do this<br>helen sword and michelle leggett for<br>inviting us to<br>to be involved with their poetry of the<br>page class uh in whitey for for<br>providing the the poem and allowing it<br>to be um circulated uh brian donovan for<br>the photo and um<br>and also uh<br>and all the students from poetry off the<br>page 2012 and thank you very much for<br>listening</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
