packed house for those<br>who've of you have attended before uh<br>welcome back for those who have not<br>attended welcome to one of the<br>highlights of our postgraduate month<br>this event is the culmination of our<br>postgraduate research month which we<br>hold every year and it's uh and it's<br>when we take time to promote and<br>celebrate our postgraduate research our<br>world leading research the contribution<br>the supervisors make<br>the students achievements and their<br>contribution to the development of<br>knowledge across the disciplines within<br>the University<br>I hope you'll All Be Inspired<br>entertained surprised and encouraged by<br>what you see tonight<br>the three-minute thesis competition is<br>part of an international competition<br>that originated out at the University of<br>Queensland in Australia<br>this competition requires students to<br>communicate to a lay audience such as<br>ourselves in three minutes what they're<br>doing in their PHD research<br>they're allowed to use one PowerPoint<br>slide to support their oral presentation<br>and this has to be a static slide no<br>animations<br>they'll be judged tonight on three<br>categories comprehension<br>in other words did the presentation help<br>the audience to understand the research<br>engagement did the present to maintain<br>and capture your attention did they<br>convey enthusiasm of their research<br>communication style was the topic<br>communicated in a language appropriate<br>the culmination as you saw of 32 PhD<br>students who presented three-minute<br>theses<br>and tonight we have 10 finalists I want<br>to thank the three judges of the Heats<br>MJ Waddington Jeremy Bell and David<br>Swain for getting us this far this<br>evening I also want to thank prior<br>Blackburn and the University of waikato<br>foundation<br>tonight's finalist also goes forward to<br>the 2014 competition in in Perth<br>so we wish all the contestants well and<br>we'll look forward to their<br>presentations it's my real pleasure to<br>introduce the MC who introduced me and<br>you may have recognized her voice<br>at Michelle Accord<br>uh she will be our MC this evening as<br>you will many of you all know she is a<br>regular attend attender on seven days on<br>the panel in the afternoon I sometimes<br>listen to her having to drive back from<br>Tauranga and I notice from both seven<br>days and the panel that she's an<br>um and also uh for her she was also that<br>in 2010 made comedian of the decade so<br>it's my real pleasure this evening to<br>welcome uh to this University and to<br>this facility and to this event Michelle<br>good evening Hamilton are we well<br>on behalf of seven days I'd just like to<br>say I'm very sorry<br>that's good I grew up in Levin I'm not<br>going to talk about that because it<br>makes me sad but it does make me think<br>people who live in Glass Houses you know<br>she probably put the stones down and<br>back away so it is an absolute pleasure<br>to be here with you tonight I always say<br>that and I hardly ever mean it but<br>tonight I actually do I love the concept<br>that this night is all about which I<br>think of is brainy people talking very<br>fast<br>and I can't wait she said we're going to<br>have a stage filled tonight with with<br>people who are young and fresh and<br>bright and full of ideas you know that<br>light of Hope in their eyes and that'll<br>fade but it's lovely to see it<br>now while it's still actually there uh<br>before they turn into you know an old<br>slapper like myself<br>I um whenever I do any events at<br>University it takes me back to my<br>university days which were more years<br>ago than I care to tell you and the<br>things that I was at University for four<br>years and then at Polytech for a year as<br>well and the things that I remember are<br>not so much what I studied but the How I<br>Learned to think and how I learned to<br>communicate those ideas and so that's<br>why I think this event is such a<br>fantastic one because it forces people<br>to work out how to communicate quite<br>complex ideas in a really<br>straightforward way I've worked for many<br>years as a journalist and uh and a<br>writer and whenever I had a challenge<br>for how to express anything in a clear<br>and concise way my way of dealing with<br>that was to explain it to my daughter<br>because I figured if I could explain it<br>to her you know when she was four or<br>seven or whatever it was then somebody<br>else would be able to read it and<br>understand it I don't have her around<br>anymore unfortunately not in a bad way<br>but she's um she's she's 20 now and<br>she's gone flatting for the first time<br>um I'm sure we're the parents in the<br>room we have probably heaps of parents<br>don't we parents of people who are on<br>stage tonight as well and you know that<br>um it's quite amazing when your kid goes<br>flatting for the first time we can all<br>picture what that's like you know<br>sleeping in late staying up late uh or<br>eating what you like when you like wild<br>parties crazy sex I got no idea what<br>she's doing but I'm loving it so um<br>I really should come here and see how<br>she's getting on but I'm busy so<br>um<br>and the other thing that you notice as a<br>parent I think is that when your kids<br>leave home you have a whole lot more<br>time and energy and I think I've worked<br>out what that is about it's because when<br>you're a parent you have to know<br>everything and you need to be able to<br>explain it in really simple ways uh like<br>you know I remember when my daughter was<br>three years old she said to me mummy why<br>is uh why is the sky blue<br>and I said well sweetheart<br>um light is made up of all the colors of<br>the rainbow from red right through the<br>Spectrum to Blue the red light waves are<br>short so they pass through<br>the gaseous particles in the atmosphere<br>but the blue light waves are long so<br>they bounce off the gaseous particles or<br>refract and<br>come back to Earth where our eyes read<br>them as blue so actually the sky is all<br>of the colors of the rainbow but we can<br>only see the blue<br>eat your broccoli you see you have to<br>if you can't answer those questions you<br>lose your Authority and they won't eat<br>their broccoli obviously now obviously<br>I'm not telling any of you anything that<br>you don't know you've all had that<br>conversation about the color of the sky<br>with your kids haven't you clearly but<br>then they start as they get older to ask<br>you questions that you don't know the<br>answer to and so you have to start<br>making stuff up<br>don't we don't we parents we do don't we<br>I remember she was about 12 she said<br>Mommy how does internet work<br>I said well sweetheart easy now uh when<br>you shouldn't have brought the<br>tambourine with you when<br>you ask the computer questions the<br>questions<br>go through telecoms fiber optic cables<br>into the sky<br>feed the answers to the unicorns who<br>eats the questions and digestion digest<br>the questions and then they they poo<br>them out as answers<br>but sweetheart if you spend too much<br>time on the computer then the fairies<br>obviously feed the unicorns too many<br>Christians and it upsets their tummies<br>eat your broccoli<br>I don't have to know anything anymore<br>it's fantastic now you know I don't have<br>to hear the answers to stuff it's<br>fabulous and liberating occasionally she<br>comes over and she sees to be like a<br>little while ago she came over she said<br>Mommy why did they make seven sharp and<br>I said I don't know darling no one's got<br>the answer to that that's just<br>it's not news it's not entertainment<br>just make mummy a cocktail so<br>let us supplement the process that these<br>uh that these students have been through<br>with trying to make their Theses make<br>sense to people who are like us who are<br>intelligent but not necessarily experts<br>in their field and tonight is actually<br>it's not about me which I've always find<br>quite weird but let's push on through<br>this is about celebrating excellence and<br>celebrating big new ideas and<br>celebrating our ability to communicate<br>those ideas and of course it's a<br>competition so we need to meet our<br>judges tonight we've already met our<br>head judge tonight up there as within<br>the middle if anybody needs to bribe<br>anybody that's where you should be<br>passing the money to we have Professor<br>Aleister Jones who is as you know Deputy<br>Vice Chancellor and former dean of<br>Education used to be a research<br>professor and director of The Wealth<br>Malcolm Institute of educational<br>research at the faculty of Education God<br>I wish I had a title like that<br>what that means is that his work has<br>influenced how and what we teach in New<br>Zealand and also internationally and in<br>2000 he was awarded the New Zealand<br>Science and Technology medal for his<br>significant contribution to technology<br>and education so there's our first judge<br>we also yes Round of Applause well done<br>we also have the quite delightful Jan<br>Jamison who is a university of waikato<br>council member her career has spanned a<br>whole lot of Industries at various<br>Industries public and private healthcare<br>Executives search and Consulting and<br>education she lives in Tauranga and she<br>was the CEO of a hamilton-based law firm<br>at Norris Ward McKinnon so a round of<br>and our third judge is Dr Ian Graham<br>he's an Emeritus professor at waikato<br>University and a former dean of<br>computing and mathematical Sciences he's<br>taken academic research into the<br>commercial world made it make use found<br>ways of making use of it he found his<br>end Ace and is that the correct<br>pronunciation in days well done thank<br>you me uh in 2001 which was a computer<br>network monitoring company they used a<br>lot of fairies and unicorns<br>um<br>to do research which they pooed and uh<br>and it was research that had been begun<br>by the fairies and unicorns at the<br>computer science department here the<br>company was listed on the alternative<br>investment Market of the London Stock<br>Exchange and it won a whole lot of<br>awards before being sold to an American<br>company this year so I'm assuming that<br>Dr Graham is incredibly wealthy and I<br>and Dr Graham was also named New Zealand<br>engineering entrepreneur of the year<br>2011. so they are our three judges Round<br>and now down the front we have one of<br>the most important people in the room<br>this is Alexandra D and she's of the<br>postgraduate Studies Office she is our<br>time keeper Round of Applause for<br>Alexandra<br>there are some very strict rules tonight<br>so I'm going to explain what they are<br>and how Alexandra is involved in that<br>the format tonight is that each finalist<br>will come on stage to give their<br>presentation when they start speaking<br>Alexandra will start the timer and it<br>starts counting down from three minutes<br>in a green light look at that will<br>appear on Alexandra's desk like magic<br>it's beautiful at 30 seconds to go and<br>amber light and we all know what an<br>amber light means it means going much<br>faster<br>and so each contestant will know that<br>they have 30 seconds to conclude and<br>then at full time they get a red light<br>and they have to stop talking and if<br>they don't stop talking they will be<br>disqualified<br>sorry darling the red lights on shush<br>now so and then the judges will take a<br>couple of minutes hopefully list to just<br>tally up their marks for each presenter<br>I will chat to you during that get to<br>know you a little better and then we'll<br>bring out the next contestant and there<br>are 10 of them also once all of the<br>presentations have been completed I'm<br>going to invite all the finalists back<br>on stage for you to have one last look<br>at them in a lineup because you also get<br>to judge them we have the People's<br>Choice Award it's worth five hundred<br>dollars so inside your program you will<br>find a voting slip a very small-ish<br>voting what's that A5 a I don't know<br>it's a slip it's quite clearly a voting<br>slip and uh you it doesn't say anything<br>about fluoride and you<br>well down on that by the way well done<br>so um so you get to choose the person<br>that you have enjoyed the most tonight<br>and during the intermission we will have<br>uh staff walking around with red boxes<br>so that you can put your vote into the<br>box we will tally those and announce<br>that after intermission so your criteria<br>is very much the same as the other<br>judges so it will be interesting to see<br>if this large group of people comes up<br>with similar choices to this tiny group<br>of people you need to think about<br>comprehension<br>did you understand it that they help you<br>to understand their research engagement<br>were you engaged did you want to hear<br>more did you were you thrilled when they<br>left or were you a bit disappointed that<br>they had to go and communication was the<br>topic and its significance communicated<br>in a language appropriate to who you are<br>which is an intelligent but<br>non-specialist audience so you think<br>about those as you listen to each of our<br>presenters if you need to check those<br>criteria they're on page two of your<br>program during the intermission we'll<br>have the bar open because that's<br>important the more you drink the funnier<br>I am and then<br>we will come back to announce our winner<br>our runner-up and also our People's<br>Choice Award can I just check with you<br>that you've done the sensible grown-up<br>things that all your phones are switched<br>off or switched to silent please uh<br>please notice where the exits are if and<br>the unlikely event of an emergency we'll<br>meet out with somewhere by the lake or I<br>should have done that properly never<br>mind can I also say the doors will be<br>closed during each presentation we would<br>prefer it if nobody moved until<br>intermission if you absolutely have to<br>go somewhere please do it in between<br>presentations they've got three minutes<br>which is a really short amount of time<br>it's well it's not that short it's more<br>time apparently than Lynn Brown needs<br>but it's<br>foreign<br>so please stay very still and quiet no<br>heckling you know nothing like that give<br>them their best shot I think it's fair<br>to say that they're all pretty nervous<br>um the the one of the things the thing<br>that most people are most afraid of is<br>speaking in public and these aren't<br>professional public speakers these are<br>academics talking about their research<br>so they're probably quite nervous<br>um apparently the speaking public is<br>more terrifying than uh than dying so<br>the most terrifying thing obviously<br>would be speaking at your own funeral<br>but<br>that hardly ever happens so just<br>just treat them with absolute and entire<br>respect during those three minutes that<br>would be fantastic into I don't know if<br>any of the presenters are listening<br>right now but do bear in mind that<br>physiologically anxiety nervousness is<br>precisely the same as excitement so what<br>you're feeling right now lovely people<br>is what you used to feel when you're a<br>kid just before Christmas<br>shall we start unwripping the Christmas<br>presents my friends should we do that<br>are you ready<br>excellent okay good I don't know why you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
