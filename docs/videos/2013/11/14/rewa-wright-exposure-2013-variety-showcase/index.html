aesthetic<br>reconfiguration<br>at times the forms appear as bird-like<br>kite-like or hive-like without ever<br>actually fixing themselves to that shape<br>fluid and evolutionary these forms are<br>produced through shifting the<br>algorithmic parameters of 3d models<br>deploying shifts in movement position<br>and gesture<br>placing these algorithmic forms as a<br>layer using augmented

how might we augment our lives using<br>the smartphone and can augmented reality<br>despite the smallness of these screens<br>smartphones are portable socially<br>interactive and context-sensitive<br>these attributes make them ideal as<br>devices for delivering augmented reality<br>the design of this research departs from<br>the premise that if it's normal practice<br>to pull out a smartphone and capture an<br>image of a compelling scene then this<br>convention provides an opportunity for<br>the artist to design an experimental<br>artwork that operates alongside this<br>behavior<br>when placing 3d models at a site using<br>augmented reality there are several<br>techniques we can use to trigger the<br>network either by print gps or a local<br>folder on the device itself<br>here using the phone to read an<br>interactive print image positioned on a<br>marker at the site triggers an embedded<br>video<br>the video we are viewing another excerpt<br>from my locative art project kombungafo<br>kerunga was filmed on the north western<br>edge of maungafo and references flight<br>and the airborne<br>the manure flying bird is a symbol of<br>freedom and communication<br>while the accompanying sound design<br>evokes the water storage reservoir<br>beneath as well as the very deep lava<br>caves under this dormant volcano<br>designed as an engagement between the<br>specificity of the augments in collision<br>with cultural geological and<br>archaeological influences komongofo<br>kerunga opens mongafo to a virtual<br>dimension in art where the past is<br>invoked to explore new possibilities for<br>the second method used to trigger<br>augments on mongafo utilized global<br>positioning systems or gps<br>through this location aware technology i<br>was able to place my augments at precise<br>as the user walked around the site they<br>could navigate to the augments using<br>their smartphone and explore these<br>invisible interventions as they walked<br>critically it is the agency of the user<br>that facilitates the connectivity<br>between memory time and perception<br>inviting a series of theoretical<br>comparisons participating in this work<br>causes the user to examine their own<br>existing memories of the site and<br>position these in relation to the new<br>layer of reality that they are now<br>offered<br>in the context of a discussion of henry<br>bergson media theorist anna munster<br>notes attention is an attending two<br>tracing how something singularly unfolds<br>relationally<br>this singularization occurs dynamically<br>in relation to previously grasped<br>actualizations<br>as the user navigates to each augment<br>activating perceiving and engaging with<br>it they're leaving a recent past and<br>moving to an indeterminate future<br>the augment we are now watching is<br>located at the site of temarai kohanga<br>the former marae<br>used by the waiahua people until the<br>17th century<br>consisting of two forms folding into one<br>another this 3d model symbolically<br>references the ceremonial co-mingling of<br>peoples that would have occurred at this<br>locale<br>thinking about the social life of<br>communities in our present geopolitical<br>sphere timothy lenoir has identified an<br>affective collectivity emerging with our<br>portable techniques<br>he states that our new collective minds<br>are deeply rooted in an emerging<br>corporeal axiomatic this is the domain<br>identified by felix quitari as the<br>for 21st century art practice the issue<br>of how the individuated user will couple<br>with such an affect of collectivity is<br>not only an issue of context within the<br>localized cultural sphere but pushes<br>toward the extended mind of global<br>once we have viewed an augment at a<br>particular location we cannot think of<br>that place in the same way<br>our memory archives this intervention so<br>that our experience of the site is now<br>inseparable from our experience of the<br>augment<br>in this way inserting augments into the<br>everyday instantiates a radical<br>an ancient maori wakatoki or proverb is<br>pertinent here<br>or the past is the future<br>the saying can be treated as providing a<br>conceptual window to a maori approach to<br>time as non-chronological and deeply<br>vested in a notion of the present as<br>embodying both the past and the future<br>the past is not expressed as a remnant<br>or ruin as in the conventional western<br>paradigm rather it is vital and alive<br>with every moment<br>philosophically kimura kimuri can be<br>seen as a strategy where in the past as<br>virtual as actualized in the present a<br>strategy which while from a very<br>distinct tradition finds points of<br>resonance with jill's delusions

a recreational and commercial<br>fishing location<br>and is part of the oceanic performance<br>biennial this november in wynyard porter<br>the user plays an active role as a<br>fisher person by establishing a<br>site-specific situation where they<br>become a performative participant<br>the design of the work reflects a<br>symbolic joining of three elements earth<br>sea and sky<br>this is physically expressed as a nodal<br>connection between the user who stands<br>on the earth the augments posted on a<br>cloud-based server and the creatures<br>imaginary yet latent within the<br>metaphorical depths of the ocean below<br>the wall<br>the smartphone becomes a symbolic<br>interface with which you fish and much<br>like the real active fishing you never<br>quite know what you would pull up<br>symbiosis in an ecological sense is a<br>core design principle of this research<br>site work and user are not treated as<br>separate entities rather they are in a<br>process of responding to one another an<br>unstable network of molecular relations<br>that signals unexpected forms of<br>cultural production<br>this is not a situation where we might<br>ask where does the site begin and the<br>work end<br>rather we ask what affects functions and<br>activities does the work elucidate in<br>regard to the site<br>while the user has been cast in a<br>performative role their decisions are<br>guided by the design of the work and in<br>particular the energies of the site<br>aspects which will not operate in the<br>life in what has become known as the<br>anthropocene this current epoch as<br>articulated by paul crewson<br>is a combination of actual and virtual<br>ways of knowing acting and being<br>augmented reality through the smartphone<br>affords the user with an accessible and<br>in a moment through an interactive and<br>performative artwork we will together<br>utilize this environment to explore some<br>of the ways the virtual can both enhance<br>i'm an artist and practice based<br>researcher currently doing my phd<br>in the area of 3d modelling<br>augmented reality and digital<br>interactive performative artwork<br>you've been watching my video and i<br>think that um it gives a fairly true<br>representation of my work at this time<br>and what i would like to do is show you<br>a little situation that i've established<br>for us in this room<br>when you normally go into an art gallery<br>what we find are objects paintings<br>sculptures photographs even the virtual<br>work the moving image work<br>resides in an object a screen normally<br>mounted on the wall what i have for you<br>tonight is quite a different experience<br>and it's an experience motivated by<br>i've been researching ocean<br>acidification<br>and i have an upcoming work at the<br>oceanic performance biennial<br>which is<br>taking place and how it pointed at you<br>taking place in one yard quarter this<br>november<br>the tamaki region used to be known as<br>the place where the fish were so<br>succulent you could eat them bones and<br>all and unfortunately this is no longer<br>the case due to acidification<br>due to carbon dioxide levels in the<br>water what we're going to find in the<br>future is that our fish species are<br>smaller than ever before<br>so this work addresses some of those<br>issues and creates a fictional situation<br>where we might ask what will our future<br>sea creatures look like<br>the idea of this work is that if you<br>have your own device here<br>you would be able to walk around it you<br>would be able to navigate about these<br>augments while they were placed inside<br>as you can see it's created quite a<br>from what we could see before<br>if all of you here had your own portable<br>media devices you'd also be able to<br>catherine hales has theorized that<br>currently<br>our bodies are actually developing<br>alongside our portable media devices<br>particularly in the age group of people<br>who are 18 to 30 not so much in those of<br>us over 30.<br>what we find in the future is that<br>people are going to be<br>more attached to their devices and in<br>fact we already use our ipads and our<br>iphones and our digital cameras<br>the computer ram that this affords<br>as memory aids so that rather than using<br>our neural network to remember<br>experiences<br>we are simply archiving them on our<br>computers and this is slowly changing<br>the way that we think and the way that</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
