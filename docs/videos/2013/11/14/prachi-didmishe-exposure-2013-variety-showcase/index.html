of d center portion of<br>ok so this is what d vision bill be like if<br>you have this condition<br>so i don't know what is this because not k<br>so dat c different<br>so just like a camera has d lens and d<br>film d human rights actually portion<br>And the new century portion so d refractive<br>portion is according to the<br>function is you convert d incoming light<br>rest from this around rings one dem and<br>fox dem on you d right no wich is you<br>no sensory bed a d macular is d central<br>portion of d street na<br>Seen Heart IT converts visuals into<br>electrical impulses and sensors in the brain<br>through the optic nerve and the brain Ashwini<br>recognizes the image  and process dem but if<br>u have like your generation not only but<br>u see great laughter u also see like lullabies baby<br>d most important point about this<br>conditions and by d time dat they no dat they have<br>just condition it's really  very late so tha<br>c the same date happens no further you can see in<br>d pictures her d left and d right eyes<br>c you different parts of d se object<br>you are looking at this object her your<br>left eye and your right eye will so i will see<br>you different parts of the object d<br>electrical impulses bill be sanity your<br>brain and your brain well actually my<br>please you image and form one complete picture<br>of the object what happens when i rich<br>generation is slow the using and one of your<br>ice because in one  I am 10 years old who may not know what to do<br>next time so what happens because this<br>change is very years and it's<br>not really very fair  Obviously you don't<br>answer it's too late and you know you have sensed<br>the generated and there is no way you can<br>do her and<br>example if you okay on d green dot<br>in d central her<br>c in  D center d metaller is d portion of<br>d right no dat actually further in central<br>vision and in detail and fine vision so if you<br>'re doing daily like driving and reading<br>text on your own phone and darling your<br>phone number it's d math bill r dat is<br>engaged  During this process and immature<br>they are generation i like your ice so no d<br>grinders date kar your favorite question<br>so you are verifying with the contact but<br>yourself would be last and it takes you three<br>days to drive you can't see if you try you<br>so ho  you know if you have micro generation<br>and not<br>well this is gan this is something date you are after<br>which just you and welcome you  you him and<br>everything is not substitute on d after<br>which justice<br>of dat so<br>close one i and look like d center of d<br>great center of d picture<br>aa you see which d four corners of d<br>great<br>ok do you see  straight lines<br>you see the interactions come right angles<br>great you don't have a you help<br>watch<br>actually did and you know see d great hj and<br>baby and good  and glory lines instead of<br>shot find right angle interactions thank you<br>so what is this mythology generation what are<br>its types what is it called asian lady because its usually<br>seen in patient am r<br>abbas and dewar style taif of mathematics<br>generation date they have d right height  Which<br>progress to geography atrophy that<br>ding of this alls in de macular and de way<br>in advanced  criddle neocameralization on the form<br>me game of you can if<br>this way and this is a contradiction what<br>happens is there is actually the formation of a<br>this is what happens and try a and<br>this is what your I bill look  like and under d<br>microscope if you co tu see a doctor<br>and and eye specialist and d region you see this<br>yellow spots in your eye because of d<br>formation of juices and d ej<br>ruminations of your regular cellular debris<br>so like and during normal parents you can see<br>yourself and are able  so clear d se break<br>and it's cups line dewar and it's in waves<br>d various cellular area so like d<br>brooks membrane and d fu yourself<br>because just layers of d ratan wich can wich<br>because of d present and d other hand what<br>you are i  and please actually in wow d<br>right no and the bill fresher  very big so they are<br>eventually blue and flooded when the area<br>and date how it comes down to layers<br>so what are you about this well it<br>mains take care of your options but there are no<br>treatments on this it is di mirror no<br>treatments on md a  specially d right<br>hi because you don't really know ho you stop<br>it on d other hand but d weight they have<br>taste different kids of options available<br>what do you is basically tomorrow d new that<br>questions are growing and your I d bever in not<br>going you stop dem  growing so it's<br>not a curd an treatment and it's exactly what<br>you call it and what is the<br>origin of this disease and stop and<br>destroyer<br>injection please and injections life is<br>really divided and your actually ok I<br>and it's bill and buying and<br>you have nd and film your sister<br>and  normally growing news data vessel and<br>using an laser bomb this vessel would be<br>destroy the problem with this kid of an<br>therapy is data it is not localized within<br>your ice so if it escapes from your<br>eye and you are your sister and if you have an<br>condition from  like stroke and excuse me<br>up give this bill actually be you more da<br>little help you because it is stop da<br>blue vessel drawing and your jo games jo dat<br>you people like me and do and do<br>you you help taste well this  this where me<br>research and me project<br>but i don't doing this something you know and<br>its very normal i get working so i<br>actually get cold over ice and i take<br>sections of dem in an krios dat well<br>this is actually - 20 so its very cold  and<br>i take really the sections of the guys so<br>like 20 mics on 15 who and i label them<br>with antibodies  Which high bill he is and buying<br>you d sell there are not suppose you be<br>present me what me highpot d series<br>is d present of inflammatory<br>factors and khol dat actually how and<br>information and d once dat lead you macular<br>dc generation this is unfortified  Because they do<br>n't know what d basic is yesterday on d basic<br>source of origin but this is<br>your present in d i world you can be<br>president you can see dem inside<br>microsoft chris gears and you bill wickam<br>microscope<br>d region this is a potential<br>nutrient is because actually  and<br>buying you d to d cells that are present<br>in the i which are supposedly causing this to<br>c science md such a multiple factorial<br>this is devar is like generating studies and<br>smoking related studies and environment<br>bill studies d to dzron studies that say ok<br>it's  you have an empty you get peace i am you know<br>true no that you have an empty stomach basically<br>i am over  50 years of age<br>and population<br>and it's really dangerous because I think<br>Tuesday is loss and irreversible by best they don't<br>care about anything special and that's really doubtful<br>we because 90% of d people over d age of<br>So that's very sources like me are
