Leading academics from across the University explored the creative workings of the brain, how the brain benefits from making and appreciating art in its various forms, the importance of play, how a wandering mind allows for creativity, the science of imagination and the science of happiness.<br>Find out more: http://www.auckland.ac.nz/creativity</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>it's like<br>taking two things that haven't been<br>joined up together and making some sort<br>of connection<br>it's it's learning to um think<br>differently<br>learn to try things learning to be risky<br>so i think<br>the term creativity to me is um<br>is a heterogeneous term it's not a<br>single thing for a single person<br>it's a bit confusing what creativity<br>it's ideas it's all like<br>an emotion isn't it sort of sort<br>but it's like sort of creativity is when<br>you're sort of like pushing the limits<br>and thinking outside the box maybe<br>um it feels to me as though creativity<br>is<br>anything that sits in the engagement<br>with possibility<br>so you know there is research being done<br>to look at for example the aha<br>moment when you suddenly solve something<br>and we can see the network of activity<br>in the brain as that moment<br>occurs and leading up to that moment the<br>principles and the rules<br>that we think are right and wrong um<br>will<br>very often proscribe or limit<br>our creativity what i love about<br>children is that they seem to be more<br>fearless<br>and as we grow up we<br>somehow become more anxious but<br>if we play as adults we can get back to<br>that state very easily<br>and what our research would suggest is<br>that it's the times when you're just<br>free and you're not really engaged in<br>anything like when you're in the shower<br>or you're cooking or you're driving that<br>quite often those ideas just pop<br>into mind it's just they arise out of<br>nothing<br>but actually there's a lot going on<br>underneath and you're actually<br>remembering and imagining even though<br>you're not aware of it but it is not a<br>waste of time to sit and think<br>the world needs more people to think<br>about what<br>creative thinking really is what's the<br>point of living if you're not creative<br>if no one were creative everything would<br>stop and so i think creativity has no<br>bounds<br>universities should be a hotbed of<br>creativity because you<br>allow and promote by definition freedom<br>of thought<br>and we have actually found that<br>creativity enhances your ability to<br>simulate future situations<br>but no society's gone far without<br>creativity where we have a human mind</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
