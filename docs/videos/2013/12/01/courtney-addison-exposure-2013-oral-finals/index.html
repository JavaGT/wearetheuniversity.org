Zealanders living with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome<br>(Faculty of Arts)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi my name is Courtney Addison I'm a<br>master's student in the Department of<br>Anthropology and I am very pleased to be<br>speaking to you this evening about a<br>part of my master's project in its<br>entirety my research is looking at the<br>personal and interpersonal aspect of<br>living with chronic fatigue syndrome<br>which I'll refer to from now on s CFS<br>just for brevity's sake so today I'm<br>focusing on one part of my research<br>which explores the coping strategies of<br>people with CFS I situate these within<br>broader discussions of autonomy and<br>responsible ization and I question how<br>people's coping might be characterized<br>as a form of self management or<br>alternative built alternatively<br>encapsulated in ideas of care and I<br>think that this is actually really<br>important because see if they're<br>sufferers are underrepresented in the<br>academic discourse developing around<br>their condition despite having a wealth<br>of lived knowledge on the matter CFS<br>effects 20,000 New Zealanders it is<br>debilitating sufferers often housebound<br>for months or years it's poorly<br>understood both scientifically and<br>publicly which has huge implications for<br>its treatment the primary symptom is<br>fatigue sustained for six months or more<br>and dramatically exacerbated by exertion<br>muscle pain sleep problems headaches<br>tinder lymph nodes and peered<br>concentration depression and anxiety are<br>other symptoms commonly reported and all<br>of these things vary from person to<br>person and from day to day moreover<br>neither cause nor cure has been<br>definitively identified for CFS so to<br>understand what it's like to live with<br>CFS I held cine structured interviews<br>worth 15 people who'd had CFS for<br>between 1 and 25 years these talks took<br>place in my participants homes they took<br>between 45 minutes and three hours and<br>gave me a good sense of people's<br>experiences of chronic fatigue one of<br>the most interesting outcomes of these<br>talks to me the part that I'm telling<br>you about tonight was when people spoke<br>about how they were coping<br>this was something that I'd wanted to<br>look at from the outset and I decided<br>early on that it might be useful to<br>think about it in terms of self<br>management in self-management programs<br>patients assume primary accountability<br>for their health this approach is<br>characteristic of the New Zealand<br>medical system and it's actually also<br>advocated by the international<br>association for CFS self-management<br>recasts the patient practitioner<br>relationship patient's actively seek out<br>information on their health they engage<br>in more equitable relationships with<br>their GPS they negotiate they monitor<br>their health keeping an eye on its ups<br>and downs and adjusting the medication<br>accordingly without needing to consult a<br>doctor every time so the owners to<br>obtain health care shifts from the state<br>on to the individual the physician is<br>now a physician consultant the patient a<br>patient expert in a patient consumer and<br>this shift occurs as part of broader<br>liberalizing health reforms amidst a<br>political climate that sees state<br>accountability give way to individual<br>autonomy sociologist nicholas rose<br>writes about these broader movements<br>using the notion of responsible is a<br>shin and especially relevant here the<br>responsible eyes patient that patient<br>who is empowered or obliged to take care<br>of themselves so I began interviewing<br>with self-management in the back of my<br>mind and as my fieldwork progressed I<br>identified four key strategies the<br>people described as coping firstly they<br>were actively seeking out information on<br>their health online in books through<br>their contacts their support groups and<br>from their doctors when they knew enough<br>to help them and in doing this they<br>build up a reservoir of information on<br>their condition that they use to both<br>understand and explain CFS and also to<br>live with it the standardized advice was<br>sometimes waved in favor of a second<br>coping strategy the privilege of<br>embodied knowledge after months years or<br>even decades with CFS<br>most of my participants have developed<br>an intimate awareness of their bodies<br>they can feel when they need to stop<br>what they're doing rest and close their<br>eyes so one participant Rosa told me we<br>can feel it like if I do too much<br>reading I can feel it rising in my head<br>until it reaches a limit that I simply<br>can't go over and another Lisa said that<br>just walking around her house I could<br>feel that if i didn't get down suddenly<br>i was just going to collapse on the<br>floor and so this deeply personal<br>embodied knowing often takes precedence<br>over official advice it also informs<br>their third coping strategy a behavior<br>that's known amounts the CFS community<br>as pacing pacing involves people paying<br>attention to their health and the energy<br>slowing down or spacing out their<br>obligations accordingly my participants<br>told me how they would carefully plan<br>out their weeks with one activity per<br>day or perhaps every two or three days<br>in plenty of rest time in between the<br>fourth way my participants cooked with<br>CFS was through a form of experiment<br>ality by which i mean not an experiment<br>in the normative scientific sense but<br>rather a process of every day trial and<br>error highly individualized my<br>participants would test out different<br>drugs and therapies to find those that<br>best managed their illness in the<br>context of their lives often with less<br>than desirable results so for example<br>one woman I spoke with Vicki had been<br>prescribed diet pills to manage your<br>energy and she'd actually tried six<br>other medications in the year before we<br>spoke to try and improve her sleep and<br>the diet pills were so rough that she<br>actually now only takes them once a week<br>for her daughter's sanity soccer games<br>and she told me how she had cut down all<br>of those pharmaceuticals to the bare<br>minimum whenever she started to feel<br>well again so these for coping<br>strategies have some parallels with<br>self-management you have the informed<br>patient the collaborative patient<br>practitioner relationship the adaptable<br>treatment regime where people's<br>experiment ality enables them to adjust<br>how they cope according to how they feel<br>however I encountered a serious<br>limitation in applying self-management<br>to CFS because the majority of my<br>participants had periods of illness were<br>they were actually not self managing at<br>all they'll barely surviving so we have<br>here a quote from Rosa and she had had<br>CFS for 25 years by the time we spoke<br>and she'd been bedridden for seven of<br>lowes and so she says I could feel<br>myself going down that was the scariest<br>because you never knew how far you would<br>go and you just have to stop doing<br>anything if it meant mean absolutely<br>nothing I meant not turning over a beard<br>I couldn't open my eyes I couldn't talk<br>I had difficulty even eating and I had<br>to turn really really slowly because<br>quick movements use too much energy and<br>so everything I did was very very slow<br>and it was the only way I could cope<br>self-management and times like this is<br>not an option so to really understand<br>how people cope over the years with CFS<br>over the ups and downs we need a little<br>more than self-management I suggest we<br>look to care here is presently being<br>rethought from within the social<br>sciences most notably in the work of<br>anne-marie mol quoted who's been<br>publishing extensively on the topic mol<br>argues for a shift in our logics of<br>treatment from a paradigm dominated by<br>ideals of choice to unguided by care my<br>case here closely aligns with this<br>except that rather than choice I begin<br>with self-management and note that both<br>posit the patient is a rational and<br>autonomous actor I think here also of<br>self-care and the manner described by<br>Foucault in his analysis of the<br>greco-roman practices of the south a<br>large part of which centered on care of<br>one's health and bringing these ideas<br>back to my own work I ask what can a<br>theory of care of the CFS that<br>self-management overlooks care entails<br>ongoing practices of attentiveness and<br>adjustment but these are more flexible<br>than self-management so even when Rosa<br>was bedridden unable to manage her<br>health she was able to care for herself<br>to some small degree she prayed and she<br>planned her healthy future<br>and these things were important to her<br>so here care allows for a manner of<br>coping that has oriented less around<br>symptoms and more around one self-care<br>also allows for an effective element<br>that isn't accommodated by<br>self-management and learning to live<br>with CFS is an intensely effective<br>process it is frustrating and<br>heartbreaking disorienting and<br>depressing and these are all things that<br>my participants told me but for meaning<br>it also triggers a process of discovery<br>of acceptance and of empathy towards<br>oneself and others in the shifting<br>emotional terrain of CFS profoundly<br>shapes how people cope with it both by<br>guiding how they can care for themselves<br>and whether they can or will accept care<br>from others and this is another<br>possibility that the concept of care<br>allows for that care can come from<br>outside of one's self care goes beyond<br>the patient practitioner relationship<br>privileged by self-management and it<br>travels instead along relational<br>pathways of individuals relating to<br>themselves and relating to their friends<br>and their families and their partners<br>Kevin may be a more useful way of<br>thinking about CFS because yes at times<br>my participants did self-managed but<br>they did so in a deeply effective manner<br>they did so with care the field of<br>knowledge on CFS is still nascent<br>biomedical research is only just<br>beginning to untangle the many things<br>that cause and characterize this illness<br>and clinical protocol for dealing with<br>patients is being made and remade as new<br>information emerges and despite this<br>there is a huge body of knowledge that<br>has received almost no scholarly<br>attention almost no published<br>acknowledgement that is the knowledge<br>acquired by CF is sufferers from living<br>with the condition by asking how are you<br>coping I hope to have highlighted some<br>of the struggles and strategies<br>important to my participants I hope that<br>in years to come we will see them move<br>to the front and centre of work on this<br>condition and I hope that in the<br>meantime this project has contributed to<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
