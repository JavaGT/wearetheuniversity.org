font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so hi my name is Shamir I'm associated<br>with the gastrointestinal research group<br>at the ockland bi engineering Institute<br>I'll be talking about a mathematical<br>model that we have developed for<br>optimizing gastric<br>pacing so everyone might have heard of<br>what is a cardiac pacemaker is so it's a<br>device which is implanted into your body<br>to either to deliver an Impulse<br>electrical impulses to either to slow uh<br>either to trade the slow heart trate to<br>a normal H rate or to bring back the<br>fast H rate to a normal ha trate a<br>similar approach can be used for uh<br>treating the stomach uh morality<br>disorders as well so let's see how so<br>I'll be talking about an electrical<br>activity that happens inside the stomach<br>they related muscle contraction they'll<br>be talking about the gastric pacing then<br>why we require Compu ational models then<br>I'll be I'll be briefly describing about<br>my research objectives my mathematical<br>model and some preliminary<br>results so this is the uh human<br>digestive system the main function of<br>which is to uh uh to to process the food<br>that we eat and absorb the nutrients<br>from it so out of this the stomach the<br>main function of the stomach is to uh<br>grind the food particles to and bro<br>break down the food particles into<br>smaller particles and then mix it with<br>the enzyme and acids to proper<br>digestions for proper digestion so how<br>does that happen so there happens a<br>muscle contraction which happens uh<br>which starts from the Corpus region and<br>it propagates like in a coordinated<br>manner down to the antrum and later this<br>this mixture of the uh food particles<br>with the I mean the broke broken food<br>particles is passed onto the intestine<br>for further processing so what causes<br>this muscle contraction well there is<br>something called interstitial cells of<br>kahal which excites this electrical<br>activity and this electrical activity is<br>passed onto the smooth muscle cells<br>which are actually helping the uh<br>stomach to contract so these are the uh<br>recordings that have been obtained so<br>it's quite significant amount of uh<br>recording that's like the range is from<br>- 65 MTS to - 35 MTS and the blue one<br>assembles the smooth muscle cells so my<br>concentration of the ICC is because<br>these are the initiators of this entire<br>process so these electrical activities<br>otherwise call as slow is the reason is<br>because in human it happens like three<br>cycles per minute which is pretty very<br>very<br>slow what happens if this electrical<br>activity is somehow distorted or gets<br>gets uh gets improper maybe because of<br>the interstitial cells of kahal being<br>damaged or dies off or<br>or behaves behaves some weird way well<br>that gives rise to abnormal electrical<br>activity I'm not sure how many of you<br>know about gastroparesis but<br>gastroparesis has been attributed to<br>abnormal electrical<br>activity for those who don't know<br>gastroparesis gastroparesis is<br>characterized by delayed gastric<br>emptying and U severe cases include uh<br>vomiting stomach pain and all those<br>stuffs and mostly patients require like<br>prolonged care and like they have very<br>bad quality of<br>life it should be noted that the 5 to 10<br>percentage of uh uh diabetes develop<br>gastroparesis which is considering the<br>present lifestyle there because of the<br>increasing cases of diabetes it's going<br>to be a serious issue so how are we<br>going to solve it well like in the<br>pacemaker like as a pacemaker for her we<br>will use a pacemaker of a stomach we'll<br>keep it somewhere somewhere over there<br>close to a stomach and put to Needles<br>which delivers electrical impulses well<br>the question is where to put the needles<br>where that's<br>how we come to either to do a<br>experimental study for selecting the<br>position of the needles or come to<br>either a computational study so for an<br>for experimental study that's basically<br>you do experiments on animals you you<br>need to get a a pick from the palm and<br>finally you have to kill it which is not<br>like and then you have the ethics then<br>you need to get the ethics approval<br>approvals as well um then you have the<br>cost cost Factor as well then then the<br>other alternative is the computational<br>models which of course from our past<br>experience in the cardiac modeling we<br>found that the computational models were<br>very effective in predicting the<br>pathophysiology of diseased case and<br>normal<br>cases so my research aim was to develop<br>a maem mathematical model to uh to<br>simulate a slow wave activity and um uh<br>analyze the effects of gastric pacing on<br>it or to predict finally to predict the<br>effects of uh two studies there was one<br>to predict the effects of uh fi<br>directions and the other one was to<br>predict the effects of different pacing<br>frequencies of like the frequency of<br>which you are going to input the pulses<br>to the<br>stomach so the first thing in any<br>modeling study would be to get the<br>experimental experimental data for that<br>so for that in in the year 2010 our<br>group uh did a experimental study in<br>which we placed a um set of pcbs and we<br>recorded normal slow wave activity then<br>we what then what we did was we put two<br>electrodes<br>and given we we inputed that with<br>specific impulses and we got the<br>propagation which is shown by the arrows<br>as you can<br>see using this data what we did was uh<br>uh we developed a finite element model<br>coupled with a cell model now this cell<br>model describes the activity of the<br>icc's well this was the most complicated<br>part this developing the cell<br>model and the reaction diffusion<br>equations were solved over it which are<br>basically elliptical partial<br>differential equations um so uh which I<br>didn't mention over here because kind of<br>complex then I did I did a simulation<br>validation so what what I did was like I<br>simulated a normal slow activity and the<br>parameters were matched so such that the<br>normal activity matches up with the<br>experimental observation then after that<br>what I did was I put the same protocols<br>that were used in the experiment studies<br>so the top on uh shows the experiment<br>and the bottom one shows the simulation<br>so what so I was able to validate and uh<br>get the almost like pretty good results<br>um which could be further utilized for<br>prediction<br>studies so I did I did two prediction<br>studies uh so which which were this<br>these ones were done very recently they<br>two weeks back so one was the effects of<br>fiber directions like that is the<br>preferential conduction Direction uh on<br>the effects of pacing and the normal<br>activity that is coming from somewhere<br>say an ectopic activity ectopic activity<br>in a sense like some activity that<br>happens uh somewhere in the stomach<br>somewhere down on the stomach which caus<br>an electrical activity to come from anal<br>to top to the Corpus so that sort of<br>activity can be overcomed by if you<br>apply electrical pulses at the top and<br>that so that is what that's what's been<br>done here so it's been applied over top<br>and this is still slowly tries to cover<br>the uh ectopic activity so we found that<br>the for the cases for two different<br>cases there was a significant difference<br>so we came to a conclusion that a fiber<br>Direction played a key<br>role then the second thing was uh we<br>tried to analyzed the effects of<br>different frequencies uh frequencies of<br>pulses uh for the and calculated ploted<br>that against the time taken to uh<br>overcome the normal activity and we<br>found that it starts from a peak and is<br>slowly parallels out and we found that<br>the for optimal pacing frequency for<br>3.16 natural slow wave activity that is<br>coming from anywhere can be entrained<br>effectively by 3.8 cycles per minute of<br>pulses uh delivered from a pacemaker or<br>stimulator so we de we developed a<br>mathematical model that could uh that<br>could U that could showcase the slow<br>wave activity and the effects of gastric<br>facing the results were quite<br>interesting and we were able to get the<br>found that the conduction direction is a<br>principle it plays a key role as well as<br>the different<br>frequencies it should be noted that this<br>model is the only model<br>which can which can realistically<br>simulate U the effects of gastric<br>pacing I will thank I will like to thank<br>my supervisors Dr Leo Chen and Maru for<br>their expert guidance Bret Institute for<br>their funding and Dr Gro gry and pangu<br>for their experimental suggestions
