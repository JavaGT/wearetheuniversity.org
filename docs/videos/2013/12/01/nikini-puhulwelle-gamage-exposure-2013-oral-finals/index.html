Institute<br>and I'm going to talk to you about my<br>research which is titled soft tissue<br>so shaking baby syndrome is defined by a<br>tribe of injuries that are seen and<br>mistreated infants these injuries<br>include subdural hematomas which is when<br>there's bleeding between the brain and<br>the skull retinal hematomas which has<br>been this bleeding behind the eye and<br>brain swelling<br>New Zealand has one of the highest rates<br>of shaking baby syndrome in the world<br>when compared to all the other oecd<br>countries<br>however one of the major problems facing<br>child protection agencies is the lack of<br>scientific evidence linking the<br>deliberate shaking action to the<br>injuries that are seen<br>and this issue arises in a lot of court<br>cases in New Zealand and worldwide<br>and it is hoped that computational<br>modeling will be able to solve this<br>issue<br>so the main project at the Auckland<br>bioengineering Institute can be broken<br>down into three separate sections and my<br>PhD focuses on one of these sections<br>the first part is to couple the head and<br>torso kinematics this will tell us how<br>the head moves when the Torso is shaken<br>the second part is to predict the<br>mechanical indices on the brain under a<br>shaking motion<br>the certain mechanical indices that<br>we're interested in are the pressures<br>and also the deformation the brain is<br>under when it's being shaken<br>and finally we hope to relate these<br>mechanical mechanical indices to the<br>injuries that are seen in these infants<br>my PhD focuses on the second part and I<br>hope to achieve this by creating a<br>computational model of an infant's head<br>that will be able to predict the<br>mechanical indices under a shaking<br>motion<br>one major step in creating a<br>computational model<br>is to make sure that this model is<br>validated and it gives us proper results<br>one way to do this is to validate this<br>model against Real experiments<br>however due to the nature of my project<br>this cannot be accomplished<br>but a way to get around it is to<br>investigate how the brain behaves under<br>a shaking Motion in dummies or physical<br>Phantoms<br>that replicate the infant head<br>so the main idea of these Phantom<br>studies is to one validate my<br>computational model and also two to tell<br>me how<br>um<br>the different parts of the infant's head<br>interact and affect the behavior of the<br>brain under a shaking motion<br>all the parts all the major sections<br>that I'll be concentrating on in my PhD<br>are shown here<br>but for this talk I'll be concentrating<br>on the first series of phantom models<br>that I've conducted<br>which will be based on a linear shaking<br>modality<br>and I've also investigated the effects<br>of the cerebral spinal fluid layer which<br>is the layer between the brain and the<br>skull and also Incorporated realistic<br>the very first Phantom that I created<br>was a very basic Phantom<br>and the idea behind this was to validate<br>the contact pressures between the brain<br>and the skull under a linear shaking<br>motion<br>um<br>a hollow a plastic Cube was used to<br>mimic the skull gel was used to mimic<br>the brain and in this case the the gel<br>was bonded<br>directly onto the plastic<br>pressure transducers were inserted into<br>the plastic<br>to measure these contact pressures and<br>the Phantoms were shaken over a range of<br>frequencies<br>an analytical model was also created<br>this is a mathematical solution to give<br>us the pressure between the pressure<br>difference between two points inside the<br>gel<br>and finally a computational model was<br>created and a software program called<br>ansys<br>which replicated the Phantom model this<br>computation model was also shaken over a<br>range of frequencies and the contact<br>pressures were sold for<br>and the idea behind this was to validate<br>the results that we got from a<br>computational model by using the<br>measurements from our analytical model<br>and our<br>Phantom model<br>and you can see that validation in this<br>graph here<br>so two things to take note from this<br>graph is the square relationship that<br>pressure has with the frequency of<br>shaking<br>this is what we expected from our<br>analytical model<br>and the second point to take note is<br>that there's a very good match between<br>the phantomodo computational model and<br>our analytical model<br>and due to this we decided to increase<br>the complexity of our Phantom bit<br>further<br>so the second Phantom that I created<br>investigated the effect of the cerebral<br>spinal fluid layer on these on the<br>pressure distribution and another<br>and and I also wanted to validate the<br>internal pressures that were experienced<br>in the gel<br>so again uh a phantom was created using<br>a hollow plastic Cube to model the skull<br>gel was used to model the brain<br>and cerebral spinal fluid oh sorry water<br>was used to mimic the cerebral spinal<br>fluid<br>pressure transducers were inserted<br>inside the gel and also in the contact<br>regions and the Phantom was shaken over<br>a range of frequencies<br>an analytical model which was used in<br>the previous case was also valid in this<br>case as well<br>in fact and finally ansys was used again<br>to create the computational model of the<br>Phantom<br>the main difference between this<br>computational model and the previous<br>computational model is that in the<br>previous model the brain was directly<br>bonded onto the<br>the gel was directly bonded onto the<br>plastic whereas in this case<br>um there's the frictionless or slip<br>layer between the brain and the cerebral<br>spinal fluid<br>and we wanted to validate that<br>interaction<br>so again we use the results that we got<br>from our analytical model and our<br>Phantom model to validate the solutions<br>that we got on our computational model<br>and you can see that there was again a<br>very good match<br>so we were happy to go a step further<br>and increase the complexity of our<br>computational model<br>um<br>so the next step that we wanted to<br>incorporate was to bring in more<br>realistic geometry into our<br>computational model<br>MRI scans were obtained from the<br>Auckland Hospital<br>and using these MRI scans the brain<br>brain stem optic nerves<br>cerebrospinal fluid were all segmented<br>using a program called itk Snap<br>once these were segmented the images<br>were then processed and the final image<br>was brought into the final 3D image it<br>was brought into the ansys environment<br>where we could perform shaking<br>experiments<br>to make it a bit more realistic as well<br>realistic linear displacements were<br>obtained from shaking experiments that<br>we conducted earlier<br>and this was used as a boundary<br>condition in our model<br>you can see some of the results that we<br>obtained from these experiments<br>and to put a to to give it more meaning<br>to the 17.3 kilopascals that I got from<br>three Hertz Shake that's about one tenth<br>of the pressure observed of an Olympic<br>um this kind of Border close to the<br>first series of phantom models<br>um that I investigated<br>so from all these<br>um from from all these experiments we've<br>figured out that the pressure gradients<br>have a square relationship<br>with the frequency of the shape<br>we validated the internal pressure<br>gradients using those using both our<br>analytical model and our Phantom model<br>in the slip<br>Phantoms<br>and we also validated the slip layer<br>interaction under a linear shaking<br>motion<br>and finally a validated computational<br>model of an infant head was created to<br>predict the pressures the brain<br>experiences under a linear shaking<br>motion<br>however there's still a lot of work to<br>be done<br>um I need to look currently I'm working<br>on the fontanelle model the front<br>analysis soft part of the infant's head<br>and I need to figure out how this<br>affects the pressure distribution and<br>also the deformation of the brain under<br>a shaking motion<br>I also need to go back to the slip model<br>and figure out how this affects how the<br>slip model is changed when more<br>realistic shaking profiles are<br>introduced<br>and finally I need to incorporate tether<br>links into my computation model these<br>are the links between the brain and the<br>skull<br>and the main ones I'll be concentrating<br>on are the brain stem and the optic<br>nerves<br>and finally I hope to be able to predict<br>the mechanical indices on the Infant<br>brain under a shaking motion<br>uh<br>I'll also like to take this opportunity<br>to thank all my supervisors and my<br>advisors and all the staff and students<br>at the Auckland bioengineering Institute</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
