Education)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>a lot of the time I feel uncomfortable<br>because I'm scared that I'm going to get<br>a bad Mark and people will judge me<br>so said nine-year-old Ben when I asked<br>him to explain why he had circled a bit<br>worried<br>in answer to the question when my<br>teacher was about to hand out the<br>reports I felt<br>well the report referred to in Ben's<br>question was a student speak individual<br>learning Pathways report I'll refer to<br>it as a silk report from now on you'll<br>be grateful for created by the e-astil<br>online assessment test and here is Ben's<br>on the screen now<br>providing accurate timely<br>curriculum-specific feedback to inform<br>Nick's learning steps it appears to be a<br>powerful tool for formative assessment<br>practice<br>that's assessment that's used to modify<br>teaching to address the needs of<br>learners<br>the report provides post-test feedback<br>to students that includes correct and<br>incorrect results as well as graphic<br>representations for curriculum levels<br>scores reading attitude and achievement<br>compared to the New Zealand average<br>my name is Sue Smith I'm a primary<br>teacher<br>and I'm the year 5 team leader at my<br>school and during 2012 our team had<br>experimented with printing off and<br>sharing these reports with our students<br>within their classroom reading groups<br>whilst they seem to be much that was<br>positive about the experience<br>questions arose around several issues<br>how do the students react emotionally to<br>the results scores and feedback<br>how do they respond to and process the<br>information<br>how do they use sorry<br>how do they use the results to inform<br>next learning steps<br>I wanted to investigate these issues and<br>it was in early conversations with my<br>supervisors that we decided that I<br>should clearly Define my focus and look<br>at them through the mediating factors of<br>relationships<br>reading ability<br>reviewing the literature on formative<br>assessment reinforced my suspicion that<br>studies focused on young students<br>perceptions were thin on the ground<br>black and William Clark Hattie and<br>timperley Brookhart Heritage and many<br>more wove together for me an<br>understanding of formative assessment<br>its theoretical basis its features and<br>apparent benefits<br>locally Harris Brown and Harnett had<br>studied children's perceptions of<br>assessment but as a whole<br>I still couldn't find anything that<br>honed in on one particular tool being<br>used in the context of classroom-based<br>formative assessment<br>researchers such as Raider Roth Popham<br>and Cowie have written about the effects<br>of assessment on classroom learning<br>relationships and vice versa sometimes<br>positive sometimes not<br>others have sounded serious warnings<br>with regard to the effect of the<br>presence of grades with feedback<br>Paul black and his colleagues<br>acknowledge that<br>the giving of numerical scores or grades<br>has a negative effect in that students<br>ignore comments when marks are also<br>given<br>some of you are nodding<br>Laurie Shepherd goes so far as to<br>propose that<br>a goal in developing a formative<br>assessment classroom culture is to<br>counteract students obsession with<br>grades and to redirect interest towards<br>sorry and effort towards learning<br>but she was writing in America and<br>there's tons of standardized testing<br>going on all the time over there this is<br>New Zealand and we're different right<br>well so what of our silk report and the<br>students perceptions of it<br>a mixed methods design that gives equal<br>status to quantitative and qualitative<br>data has been used to investigate the<br>students reactions and responses and<br>this took place on two data Gathering<br>points in terms two and three<br>of this year<br>firstly and as soon as possible after<br>receiving their silk report all<br>participating children in this case 35<br>year five students from across four<br>classes<br>completed a 14 item mostly quantitative<br>questionnaire featuring Leica scale type<br>answer options<br>two written answer or questions were<br>also included and I'll be referring more<br>to these later on<br>scoring of the questionnaires produced a<br>range of student positivity levels<br>towards the reports<br>10 students representing a cross-section<br>of positivity levels were then<br>identified to me for one-to-one<br>follow-up interviews<br>these were designed to find out why<br>students felt the way they did about<br>their reports<br>it was during this stage that the<br>opportunity existed to uncover expected<br>and unexpected constraints affecting<br>students emotions response to an ability<br>now I'm sure that pretty much all of us<br>here today have at least two important<br>things in common that mean that we can<br>each relate to the issue that I'm going<br>to focus on later well in a moment<br>actually firstly<br>we all went to school<br>well or at least we all received some<br>form of formal primary education just in<br>case you were homeschooled secondly<br>we have all received feedback in some<br>form of scores or grades and perhaps<br>learning related comments<br>so today I'd like to give you a glimpse<br>at one particular aspect of my study and<br>pick up on the issue of scores and their<br>presence on the silk reports<br>you see if students feel awkward or<br>embarrassed about the presence of scores<br>on a report that they're then going to<br>share with others<br>item 14 on the questionnaire I asked<br>do you think the reports should show<br>people's reading levels and scores<br>well here's what the children told us in<br>term two<br>and in term three oh yes we're quite<br>convinced<br>well whether the levels of schools the<br>levels and scores are ultimately helpful<br>for learning or not it would seem that<br>even quite young students including ours<br>thought they ought to be there<br>for questions 15 and 16 students written<br>responses were categorized as relating<br>to either scores or learning or both<br>based on the response to the previous<br>question I suppose it was no big<br>surprise that when the questionnaire<br>asked<br>what part of the report did you want to<br>look at first<br>the overwhelming response was you<br>guessed it for the scores in term two<br>and in term 3. now I get that I've done<br>that you've probably done that<br>so was there answers to the next<br>question that were going to be<br>significant<br>what is the most important information<br>well the pendulum is swinging away from<br>a performance orientation and towards<br>learning but at 50 50 it could still be<br>argued there's room for improvement<br>was term two and with the passing of<br>time increased familiarity with the<br>reports a bit of increased maturity etc<br>etc it's not difficult to assume how far<br>sorry about that<br>or not<br>you see it might not be difficult to<br>assume but it would be very wrong to<br>assume<br>rather than using a very comprehensive<br>purpose-designed formative assessment<br>tool to persuade children away from a<br>preoccupation with performance and<br>scores towards a learning Focus the<br>possibility seems to exist that we might<br>have inadvertently reinforced the exact<br>opposite<br>well as I mentioned earlier this finding<br>is just one part of a much larger study<br>but it was an unexpected finding a<br>finding that needled and demanded to be<br>acknowledged a finding that reminded me<br>this is why we research<br>so that we don't just carry on with all<br>the best intentions of the in the world<br>but based on faulty assumptions<br>I began this presentation with a rather<br>sad quote from Ben<br>happily by term three his feelings had<br>improved a bit can you guess why<br>the results were a much better as last<br>time I feel a little bit more great<br>about myself<br>good on you Ben<br>foreign</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
