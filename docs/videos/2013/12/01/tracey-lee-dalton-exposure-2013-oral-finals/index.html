of people with disabilities or chronic illness<br>(Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences)</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>caring for caregivers who cares<br>my life as an outdoor educator was full<br>of risk Challenge and Adventure I lived<br>a relatively Carefree life<br>I whether it be kayaking down waterfalls<br>or climbing to new heights I was seeking<br>the ultimate adrenaline Buzz one minute<br>my life was Carefree the next I was in<br>need of care<br>I woke in a hospital bed not knowing who<br>my neighbor was let alone Howard got<br>there what was to follow was intense<br>Rehabilitation yet through it all it was<br>my caregiver who ensured that I ate<br>rested and looked after my personal<br>needs to enable my health to improve<br>thanks to caregiving I am standing here<br>today<br>having also worked as a caregiver I know<br>it's not a glamorous job feeding bathing<br>toileting this does not require<br>sophistication rather dedication empathy<br>and genuine care<br>given my background I care for<br>caregivers the question is do you<br>I would like to take this opportunity to<br>introduce my study caring for informal<br>caregivers I'd like to explain the<br>methods and the preliminary results<br>so what's the issue<br>in New Zealand the value of informal<br>caregiving is seven billion dollars per<br>year this is a reflection of an<br>international Trend where whereby<br>informal caregivers provide the backbone<br>of Health Care due to<br>de-institutionalization Aging in place<br>and medical advances<br>so why support caregivers<br>New Zealand research shows that fewer<br>than 10 out of 300 informal caregivers<br>were able to remain in paid employment<br>this means they suffer financially they<br>also suffer from Health needs especially<br>Mental Health<br>anxiety stress depression two-thirds of<br>informal caregivers suffer from<br>depression 45 suffer from their own<br>disability or health need 40 percent<br>suffer an injury while providing care<br>caregivers are often locked into the<br>role forced on them by circumstances<br>they're surrounded by uncertainty for<br>the future<br>it carries with it a huge responsibility<br>especially when administering serious<br>medication it can be time consuming up<br>to 24 7 with no exit strategy<br>so how to address the issue<br>this study provides the opportunity for<br>change by developing critical success<br>factors associated with positive<br>outcomes for caregivers of people with<br>disabilities or chronic illnesses<br>essentially how best to support informal<br>caregivers<br>so best practice being practices<br>generally leading to out to valued<br>outcomes and formal caregivers being<br>unpaid family and friends who provide<br>care and support being both emotional<br>emotional and physical<br>the methods I have used are mixed<br>methods so I have taken exploratory<br>qualitative caregiver interviews and I<br>have combined I have used these to<br>develop the quantitative online survey<br>these two combined will create a working<br>model<br>the robust<br>quantitative survey currently online was<br>created from a culmination of factors my<br>personal experience as a care recipient<br>and a caregiver combined with best pack<br>practice themes from the literary<br>reviews and the qualitative interviews<br>from caregivers hence<br>creating a robust survey this survey is<br>currently available through Survey<br>Monkey and available through carers New<br>Zealand it provides the opportunity for<br>caregivers both past and present to have<br>the preliminary results<br>currently<br>there is<br>551 responses from the online survey<br>achieved through promotion via newspaper<br>websites non-profit organizations<br>Etc<br>in terms of the qualitative phase<br>five caregivers were perfectly chosen in<br>order to provide a cross-section of<br>information<br>from the these intensive semi-structured<br>interviews for major themes emerged<br>each of these qualitative themes I will<br>talk about in turn now<br>the first of these themes is that of the<br>social welfare system looking only at<br>health and education we can see that the<br>negative nature outweighed the positive<br>two to one<br>and each of the themes there were three<br>dominant categories dominant categories<br>were determined by<br>10 cent or more of the quotes being<br>focused on that topic I will leave you<br>to read those categories but I feel the<br>quotes speak for themselves<br>it was a constant struggle trying to<br>make people realize that we don't fit<br>into little boxes<br>it was emotionally and mentally and<br>physically exhausting trying to battle<br>the system because they don't listen to<br>you<br>when it comes to caregivers tasks and<br>time you can see it was overwhelmingly<br>negative 79 percent<br>here it was about the all-consuming<br>nature of caregiving<br>you have to give it all no matter what<br>you feel in yourself and the<br>interruption to paid work and a lot of<br>interruption<br>fin three effects of caregiving here you<br>can see that the negative impacts of<br>quality of life<br>overshadowed the rewarding nature of<br>caregiving<br>having said that each of the five<br>participants acknowledged the rewarding<br>nature of caregiving it's quite<br>rewarding actually because I was helping<br>someone to get along with the rest of<br>their life<br>however<br>it must be said that 48 of the comments<br>focused on the negative aspects on the<br>mental and physical health of the<br>caregivers I think this quote sums it up<br>very aptly<br>it's all consuming you almost wish that<br>your loved one would pass away you're<br>theme for caregiver experiences here you<br>can see that information is rather<br>lacking whereby but support and<br>strategies are a more balanced View<br>in terms of support there's recognition<br>that there is support and it is meeting<br>some needs but there is a need for more<br>support to give the caregivers the<br>strength to cope whereas in terms of<br>information caregivers<br>succeeded by being stroppy Advocates<br>they had to use their own initiative and<br>I have taken those four qualitative<br>themes I have combined them with the<br>best practice themes in order to create<br>quantitative sections within the survey<br>the aim of the quantitative survey is to<br>determine the best practice for<br>caregivers by investigating training and<br>information and assistance needs the<br>inclusiveness of caregivers by health<br>professionals and the support<br>and the flexibility there of it<br>in conclusion I would like to say that<br>from the qualitative interviews it was<br>obvious that there is some success<br>factors in our current system<br>indicated by some satisfaction with the<br>system however there is great room for<br>improvement it is ironic that caregivers<br>are invaluable in terms of Financial and<br>social worth yet they are undervalued in<br>our current system the time to care is</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;
