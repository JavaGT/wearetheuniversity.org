0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>right good evening everyone my talk<br>today will focus on some of the work<br>that I've done during my PhD at the<br>department of Optometry and vision<br>science our eyes are constantly exposed<br>to UV radiation from the Sun now in New<br>Zealand especially we're very much aware<br>of how damaging these UV rays can be<br>they produce these particles known as<br>reactive oxygen species that can<br>interact with and damage every component<br>of the cell this condition is called<br>oxidative<br>stress now so the tissues in ouris are<br>required to possess high levels of<br>antioxidants like glutathione or gsh<br>that can combat this oxidative stress<br>and prevent any lasting tissue damage<br>however as we get older levels of<br>antioxidants start to decrease making<br>the tissues of our eyes especially<br>susceptible to oxidative stress and<br>hence damage so it's no surprise that<br>eye diseases like cataracts and glaucoma<br>are age<br>related the tissues in the front of the<br>eye like the cornea lens and tbic mesh<br>work are especially vulnerable now<br>firstly this is because of their<br>positioning within the eye because at<br>the very front they bear the full brunt<br>of those damaging UV rays in addition<br>these tissues don't have any blood<br>vessels so they cannot Source their<br>nutrients from the blood like most other<br>tissues normally would instead they rely<br>on a body of fluid called the aquous<br>humor for their source of nutrients and<br>more importantly antioxidants like<br>gsh now this fluid and all of its<br>components are continuously being<br>replenished by the sary<br>body now this uh which which ensures<br>that there is a constant and fresh<br>supply of nutrients for these tissues<br>the traditional school of thought is<br>that the gsh in the aquous humor is also<br>produced solely by the celery<br>body however interestingly of all the<br>tissues in the eye the lens has the<br>highest concentration of gsh now of<br>course the lens requires some gsh to<br>protect itself from oxidative damage<br>however these high levels suggest that<br>perhaps like theary body the lens may<br>also be involved in supplying gsh to the<br>aquous humor so we hypothesized that<br>perhaps the lens ax is a reservoir of<br>gsh releasing it into the aquous humor<br>so that the tissues in the front can<br>then take it up so my primary aims were<br>firstly to investigate whether the rat<br>lens was capable of releasing gsh into<br>the aquous and this is called gsh E flux<br>so if this was the case I then wanted to<br>functionally characterize the mechanisms<br>through which e-lux was occurring<br>to address the first part of my<br>objectives I cultured pairs of R lenses<br>in artificial a humor over different<br>pairs of time now this mimics the<br>environment in which the lens would<br>naturally exist within our own eyes then<br>I collected samples of this aquous humor<br>to measure the amount of gsh in it oh um<br>to do this I added a fluorescent tag<br>that binds specifically to the gsh and<br>then I measured the levels of<br>fluoresence in in each sample so by<br>doing this I get a graph that looks like<br>this one here so if you look at the Y<br>AIS that's gsh amount versus increasing<br>time at the bottom there so if I um if I<br>get you to focus your attention on the<br>middle value or the median value of the<br>data at each time point you can see that<br>the amount of gsh increases with time so<br>basically this graph is telling us that<br>the lens can and does release G into the<br>aquous<br>humor so having established that this<br>elux does occur we then wanted to<br>identify the mechanisms that could be<br>mediating this e-lux now gsh transport<br>across a biological membrane is mediated<br>by membrane proteins called<br>Transporters we uh we previously no we<br>screened for the presence pardon me for<br>of eight known gsh elux Transporters<br>that specifically move gsh out of the<br>cell these have previously been<br>identified in the kidney brain and lungs<br>so we wanted to do the same in the lens<br>using a technique called PCR now PCR<br>allows us to identify the presence of<br>these Transporters at the DNA level in<br>the lens so you can see that the<br>presence of a transporter is seen as a<br>presence of a black band so of the four<br>of the eight candidates here only four<br>are present in the lens<br>to further narrow down our choices I<br>then looked at whether these four<br>Transporters were present at the protein<br>level in the lens using a technique<br>called W blot now you can see that it's<br>quite similar to PCR in that the<br>presence of a transporter is seen as a<br>presence of a black band however this<br>involves looking at all the proteins<br>rather than the DNA in the lens so now<br>out of the four Transporters only two<br>are present in the lens mp1 and M<br>P5 The Next Step was to visually<br>localize these two Transporters within<br>the lens using imunohistochemistry now<br>what this basically means is that I take<br>the rat lens cut it up into very very<br>thin sections of tissue and then add<br>fluorescent green labels that<br>specifically bind to the Transporters<br>and then fluorescent red labels that<br>highlight the cound membranes like in<br>this image now this is great because it<br>allows me to orientate myself to the<br>specific part of the lens that I want to<br>look at so what you see here is a<br>capsule which covers the entire lens and<br>basically holds it intact then a single<br>layer of epithelial cells that directly<br>interfaces with the aquous humor and<br>then the rest of the lens consists of<br>several fiber<br>cells now for a transporter to be able<br>to mediate gsh flux out of the lens I<br>would expect it to be found at the<br>epithelial cell membrane why because<br>this is is the cell layer that's the<br>closest to the acous humor from the lens<br>now you can see that with<br>mp1 it<br>clearly as strongly labels the<br>epithelial cell membrane with MP5 it's<br>not as obvious however there does still<br>appear to be some labeling in that image<br>so we so these images suggest that<br>perhaps both mrps could be mediating gsh<br>flux out of the lens the next and final<br>step was then to test whether those two<br>Transporters were actually functional so<br>I did this using an MP specific MP<br>transporter specific inhibitor called<br>mk571 now an inhibitor compound is one<br>that specifically prevents the normal<br>function of the transporter that it<br>interacts with so in this case that's<br>the mrps so once again as you see I<br>cultured pairs of rat lenses in<br>artificial aquous humor but this time in<br>the presence and absence of the MP<br>inhibitor then I collected samples of<br>the media as I've previously described<br>to measure the amount of gsh in<br>it now if the mrps were actually<br>functional I'd expect to see less gsh e<br>flux from the lenses cultured with the<br>inhibitor compared to without the<br>inhibitor so I carried out three<br>separate experiments as you see here and<br>if we look at experiment one there you<br>can see that there is less gsh e flux<br>from the L is cultured with<br>mk571 compared to without the same<br>pattern is seen for experiments 2 and<br>three pardon me um which confirms that<br>gsh e flux from the lens is in fact<br>mediated by the MPS so to summarize I've<br>shown that the lens is able to export<br>gsh into the aquous humor and that this<br>e flux is most likely due to mp1 and or5<br>now once the gsh is in the Aquis<br>it can then be taken up by the tissues<br>in the front of the eye so you're<br>probably wondering what the health<br>significance is all of is to all of this<br>data well persistent damage can occur to<br>tissues in the front of the eye several<br>years following cataract surgery and<br>lens removal this means that um ad me uh<br>traditionally cataract surgery has been<br>performed on the elderly however with a<br>growing diabetic population and hence an<br>increased incidence of diabetic<br>cataracts more and more people are<br>requiring cataract surgery at an earlier<br>age now this means that there is a<br>longer period of time after surgery in<br>which damage to the tissues in the front<br>of the eye can<br>manifest so my results have shown that<br>the lens can supply gsh to the acous<br>humor therefore loss of this Reservoir<br>during surgery could reduce gsh<br>availability to those tissues in the<br>front thereby increasing their<br>susceptibility to oxidative stress so<br>it's important to consider the long-term<br>effects of cataract surgery and perhaps<br>look to finding therapies that enhance<br>antioxidant levels in the front of the<br>eye thereby protecting Against The<br>Accelerated onset of age related eye</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
