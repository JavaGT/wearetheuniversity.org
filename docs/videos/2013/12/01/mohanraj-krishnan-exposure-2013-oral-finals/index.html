entitled a model of childhood<br>obesity obesity is a major public health<br>issue and is associated with long-term<br>increased risk of heart disease diabetes<br>and H hension all of which are<br>consistent risk factors of the metabolic<br>syndrome these days children are<br>becoming more obese and they are also<br>presenting with similar symptoms early<br>in<br>childhood and it's no different in New<br>Zealand in 2006 the New Zealand Health<br>the New Zealand Health survey showed<br>that the obesity rate in children was 8%<br>and has risen to 10% in<br>2012 furthermore there ethnic<br>differences with Mai and Pacific island<br>children showing higher rates of obesity<br>compared to Caucasian<br>children now there are a number of<br>factors involved in obesity including<br>intrauterine factors genetic factors<br>environmental factors and microbiology<br>environment of the gut and it's likely<br>all of these factors play a role with<br>each other to contribute to the onset of<br>obesity however my project will focus on<br>polymorphisms which a single unit change<br>in the the DNA code which might slightly<br>alter the gene<br>function furthermore I'll be looking at<br>diet and exercise as possible<br>intervention mechanisms to reduce<br>childhood obesity and whether these<br>environmental factors May modify the<br>genetic risk of<br>obesity I would like to introduce to you<br>uh to you the th Gene<br>hypothesis um uh proposed by James Neil<br>to explain the modern emergence of<br>obesity genes that promoted obesity were<br>considered advantageous in early human<br>history where starvation and migration<br>were an issue however in today's modern<br>society where there is constant<br>availability of food and decreased<br>physical activity levels these genes<br>that were once beneficial for a survival<br>and now<br>detrimental this results in gene uh<br>disruption of Gene inter environment<br>interactions resulting in a development<br>of modern chronic diseases including<br>obesity<br>this diagram here shows the an um thy<br>Gene hypothesis during ancient<br>times um early humans went through<br>cycles of feast and famine and during<br>Feast these uh individuals uh would<br>store fat in preparation for the famine<br>phase um humans that had the Thrifty<br>genes were more efficient in storing fat<br>and utilizing fat and were more likely<br>to survive during<br>famine likewise these humans also went<br>through physical activity cycles and<br>these individuals that also have the<br>Thrifty genes were more physically<br>capable of surviving the hunt and gather<br>and were also more likely to survive the<br>famine phase combined both these Pro<br>processes provide a greater drive for<br>thft<br>genes these genes was uh passed down to<br>their offspring and subsequent<br>Generations had a greater chance of<br>surviving the next famine phase<br>cycle however in modern Society there is<br>no famine or hunt or gather instead it's<br>replaced by constant food availability<br>and with uh industrialization reduced<br>physical activity levels this creates a<br>mismatch between the genes that have<br>evolved to protect us from starvation<br>with today's culous<br>environment this results in A disruption<br>of cycling and uh results in excessive<br>Thrifty storage uh which gives rise to<br>obesity<br>if we can intervene in this TP of area<br>here we have the potential to restore<br>post uh cycling um uh proper cycling and<br>thereby have a greater chance of<br>reducing<br>obesity therefore my project is looking<br>investigating um associations between<br>polymorphisms with obesity and the<br>children of screening for pregnancy end<br>points cohort where these children are<br>separated into three main categories<br>into under uh normal overweight and<br>obese<br>furthermore I'll also be looking at<br>whether physical activity and diet can<br>be used as possible intervention<br>mechanisms to reduce childhood obesity<br>and whether these environmental factors<br>can actually compensate for the effect<br>of obesity related<br>genes my study is a cross-sectional<br>survey of six-year-old children with<br>detailed pregnancy data collected at 15<br>and 20 weeks late pregnancy and after<br>Del after delivery currently I've<br>extracted DNA from either saliva or<br>blood from these children and we'll be<br>using squin mass to measure this and<br>squin mass is an experimental tool to uh<br>designed to detect differences in<br>polymorphism this is a scatter plot um<br>output file from a sequin Mass array<br>each dot here represents an individual<br>and each cluster represents a different<br>polymorphic<br>combination we will compare the<br>difference in frequency between each<br>cluster between our obese cases and<br>normal controls and see whether our<br>selected polymorphism is associated with<br>obesity currently I've also been SE uh<br>identifying genes involved in obesity<br>and separated them into three main<br>categories adicity storage uh and these<br>genes are involved in fat accumulation<br>and<br>distribution appetite regulation and<br>these genes are involved in feeling of<br>fullness energy expenditure and behavior<br>and Fetal growth and birth weight and<br>this last category is potentially<br>interesting as Studies have showed that<br>children babies born bigger at Birth<br>have a greater risk of becoming obese<br>later on in<br>childhood I want to highlight this<br>diagram here to show that um a<br>polymorphism may have a modest most<br>polymorphisms have a modest effect and<br>that they could either protect from or<br>confer susceptibility to<br>obesity however it's a combination<br>between genetic and environmental uh<br>factors that drive uh most of the<br>population to an obese<br>phenotype ideally if we can shift this<br>distribution to a normal State uh we can<br>reduce obesity and one way we could do<br>this is to modify lifestyle factors that<br>we can control for which includes diet<br>and physical<br>activity therefore we have collected one<br>week's worth of physical activity data<br>from these children using exeler meters<br>which measure acceleration Peaks this is<br>an actor graph which is an output file<br>of these accelerometers and each Peak<br>here represents an acceleration of a 1<br>minute time interval over one day we<br>have separated each of these into three<br>main categories sedentary moderate and<br>vigorous and we want to compare if level<br>or intensity of exercise directly<br>correlates to levels in fat Mass we also<br>want to see if any form of exercise can<br>actually compensate for a polymorphism<br>outcome or polymorphism<br>effect we've also collected dietary<br>information from a 24-hour diary food<br>diary a food frequency questionnaire and<br>family questionnaire and these surveys<br>collected information regarding General<br>dietry habits um nutritional awareness<br>frequency of meals and specific types of<br>food they have in their household and<br>we'll be also using this dietary<br>information to estimate how diet diet<br>May modify the genetic risk of obesity<br>children hopefully if proper uh routine<br>exercise and a balanced diet can<br>restore uh proper cycling and normalize<br>Thrifty Gene storage this has a chance<br>possible potential uh mechanism to<br>reduce childhood obesity<br>so my study offers a unique opportunity<br>to advance our understanding between<br>environmental factors and genetics in<br>the context of childhood obesity and<br>although there is a fixed genetic risk<br>some we know that early intervention in<br>life by CH modifying our lifestyle<br>factors has a better success rate if we<br>intervene later on in life this study<br>also provides the tools to understand<br>how genes May respond to environmental<br>factors which can result in differences<br>in body uh body mass in in fat levels in<br>and also obese and lean<br>phenotype I would like to thank uh my<br>professor associate professor Andrew<br>shelling Leslie McCowan and Dr Donn<br>Thompson also um Dr Lindsay cre and<br>everyone who participated in the<br>children of scope uh study including the<br>parents the children and the recruitment<br>nurses and all other researchers and the<br>members of the shelling Creed Cham and<br>Print Lab also like to thank my funding<br>body um HRC who's funded this project<br>and
