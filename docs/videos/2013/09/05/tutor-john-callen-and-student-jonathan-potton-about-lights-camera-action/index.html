things that uh most interests<br>me about this whole business is actors<br>if you involve an actor in any project<br>obviously the actor thinks that he or<br>she is the center of the universe I know<br>I certainly think that um but when we're<br>making drama the relationship between<br>the script and the actor is key to<br>actually producing a story that people<br>want to watch it doesn't matter to me if<br>we've got the most fancy shots in the<br>world the most brilliant of<br>equipment if the story isn't very good<br>and the performances are rubbish well<br>you're not going to keep your audience<br>entertained so I just wanted to have a<br>word with Jonathan here about his<br>experience on our course lights camera<br>action uh relative to working with<br>actors and<br>directors how did you find that<br>process um it was really interesting I<br>think the big part of the course for me<br>because especially my role as as<br>executive producer was pretty much<br>people really I didn't have a lot of<br>kind of technical input other than kind<br>of just overseeing things so my whole<br>role was my relationships with the<br>people in the group um and it was a<br>massive kind of it was a massive Journey<br>To be honest learning I learned so much<br>about how to manage people and how to<br>manage people people with different<br>personalities and kind of just making<br>sure they were okay more than anything<br>else um which is something that I run a<br>small business and so it's kind of the<br>same set of skills that I learned in<br>this um course apply to that where<br>you've kind of constantly got to keep<br>everyone happy um keep trying to get the<br>best out of everyone pretty much sure so<br>as an executive producer you were able<br>to see all the script offerings that the<br>writers and the other participants in<br>the program offered and um and assess<br>them presumably right and then<br>translating all that into a coherent<br>story for actors can you tell me if you<br>were uh finding people wrangling was key<br>how you see the process of directors<br>working with actors right<br>um yeah I suppose there's lots of kind<br>of facets to there's obviously the most<br>obvious one which is getting the right<br>performance and just directing so<br>telling them what to do but I think a<br>big part of it is also um just the<br>relationship between the director and<br>the actor and you know making the um<br>actor feel comfortable um and yeah just<br>that relationship I think is what really<br>um I know in our case with the course um<br>some of the best performances were<br>because the director and um the actor<br>were friends and stuff and so I think I<br>think that kind of played into things<br>quite a lot really okay I always think<br>that uh offscreen relationships can make<br>a big difference to what happens on<br>screen ultimately though the audience<br>has no knowledge of that unless they're<br>reading the gossip magazines but um in<br>terms of what we're doing once we've got<br>a good story uh told by good characters<br>the whole thing can fall down if the<br>people management isn't working so uh<br>you you have to make sure that the<br>directors are on task that the writers<br>have produced the good equipment for us<br>to use and that uh the actors are the<br>right people were you involved in any of<br>the casting processes um yeah I was I<br>sat in on all the casting process and<br>just um had a big discussion with the<br>directors and the producers about who<br>would be best for the role um so we went<br>through everyone and just um just<br>basically just talked about would they<br>do they have the right look for the role<br>are they the right kind of personality<br>for the role um and all of that played<br>cuz I mean I suppose a big part of<br>directing I guess is casting you solve a<br>lot of your problems by casting the<br>right people as you say it's it's a tool<br>and a way to tell your story um and so<br>yeah it was we had huge discussions<br>about um which would be the right people<br>for the job and I think I think we did<br>really well um with the people we had um<br>yeah yes I think so too and it's<br>interesting that that uh a couple of the<br>people that we worked with on this<br>course who were in front of the camera<br>have gone on to further training in the<br>industry and are now at drama school for<br>instance here in Oakland and are looking<br>forward to stepping into the industry uh<br>running at full speed uh in a very short<br>uh space of time it's been quite<br>outstanding so this is uh a training<br>ground not just for the people who are<br>on the course but for the people who<br>come in and assist us with that process<br>um for people from overseas who are<br>coming here obviously they won't have a<br>lot of friends necessarily in New<br>Zealand um can you think of ways in<br>which we can assist them to find<br>actors um there's yeah there's a variety<br>of different places I think um the first<br>obvious one is just going to agents I<br>guess but there's also here at the<br>University there's this really great um<br>club called um stage two Productions<br>which is the the theat organization here<br>and it's basically a community database<br>I guess you could say of actors that are<br>all just looking for experience they do<br>a lot of the um all their the theater<br>work at University but they're really<br>Keen to get involved in film in a lot of<br>cases and often I've used it a lot um as<br>kind of a source for I had to cast a big<br>project um a couple of weeks back now<br>and a lot of our the best people that um<br>we got to um cast came from that um<br>group excellent so we can help in many<br>ways uh one of the things that really<br>interests me is whether or not people<br>are totally committed to what they're<br>doing for instance uh one of the writers<br>on the course on which you worked uh was<br>working on his second novel he'd written<br>two or three um film scripts and was<br>also working on a television series as<br>he was working on the project that we<br>were doing together so that kind of<br>commitment to the work I think is very<br>important did you find that that made a<br>difference in the group that we were<br>working<br>with yeah I think it's it's really<br>important to um I mean with this course<br>because it is such an intense kind of um<br>intense course you have to be committed<br>I reckon and it's a huge amount of um<br>it's a huge yeah like it's it is it's a<br>huge um amount of your time that it's<br>going to take up and so you need to say<br>yeah I really want to do this um but at<br>the same time I don't know they I the<br>phrase is just going to my head but<br>what's the phrase where it's like um you<br>know busy people find time to I've lost<br>it anyway find time to you know the um<br>yes indeed I find uh the older I get<br>even though I've got less time on the<br>planet I have more time for the things<br>bu people make time for things you know<br>because they'll find ways to fit it in<br>if you can't remember the actual phrase<br>create a new one okay yeah<br>all oh no um but no and in like it's I<br>think especially with that um case that<br>guy cuz he was already doing so much<br>stuff<br>um he was already kind of ready to go in<br>terms of writing a script and then was<br>cre just said um listen we want the<br>script done and he cuz he was already<br>working on five of the project it was<br>already kind of in that way of mind so<br>we just flicked one out really quickly<br>and was just really really polished well<br>a lot of the other writers I know they<br>hadn't done as much and so it was a lot<br>a lot of a slower process to get going I<br>guess what I was thinking about was the<br>commitment to the work because it is a<br>fairly intense course as you said and uh<br>while you were working on that um all<br>the students I think had other things<br>going on at the same time during our<br>course that we're doing in the middle of<br>next year 2014 we will be focused almost<br>entirely on the job in hand which means<br>that we'll be able to perhaps spend a<br>little more time each week on developing<br>what it is we're doing uh I think it<br>could be quite exciting and uh as I said<br>looking forward to meeting you thanks<br>hi</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
