The University of Waikato's Professor Alexander Gillespie hosted a Google Hangout as a follow-up to his recent public lecture on the Syria civil war. <br><br>Professor Gillespie, a Professor at the University of Waikato, and author of the History of the Laws of Laws(Oxford) and The Causes of War (Oxford),says if it's proven the Syrian regime used chemical weapons on its own people, it would be the "biggest breach of international law in the last two decades". "Ethically, we should do the right thing. The question is, what is the right thing?"<br><br>View the full hangout here where Professor Gillespie answers public questions around the Syria Civil War.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity:

the<br>hangout this is a first for me I'm in wo<br>Hamilton New Zealand it's 1:00 in the<br>afternoon and we're going to see how<br>this goes it's an exciting new<br>Endeavor I'm speaking on the back of a<br>series of public lectures I've been<br>doing about Syria and the current<br>situation and also a large number of<br>media interviews I've been doing up and<br>down the<br>country<br>the starting point of today is I I just<br>talk about some of the recent<br>developments of what's happened<br>overnight and my thoughts of what's<br>Happening Now um the first one obviously<br>is the Russian proposal to make this<br>matter<br>um taken under an international orice of<br>disarmament of chemical weapons the<br>broad point I would make about this is<br>that this is a very good initiative we<br>should be very grateful and happy that<br>that the Russians are taking a lead in<br>this debate on a positive note it's good<br>because it gets the matter to the<br>security Council and all discussion of<br>Syria previously has not been at the top<br>table the other thing that's very good<br>1:00<br>afternoon I'm speaking on the bank<br>series of lectures I've been doing about<br>Syria and the current<br>situation and also a large of Med the<br>country<br>Point<br>very very grateful and happy the<br>Russians debate on a positive note it's<br>um<br>hi folks we're going to we're going to<br>try again we're having a few<br>technological difficulties here but I'm<br>hoping it's all in good order now um and<br>as I was saying with the Russian<br>proposal there it's good because it's at<br>the security Council and it's also good<br>because they're talking about<br>International control of Syria nuclear<br>weapons um sorry chemical weapons and<br>this is important because had it just<br>been a proposal for the Russians to<br>oversee the disarmament and dismantling<br>of them or the syrians we would be very<br>skeptical but to get it under the<br>international orace is is<br>positive the skepticism of which we must<br>have with this is that to actually do<br>this on a technological basis is very<br>hard the best precedent we have of how<br>to disarm and dismantle safely chemical<br>weapons comes from Libya at the end of<br>their conflict it took them eight months<br>to verify and collect what weapons they<br>had and the destruction of them will not<br>be completed until the end of<br>2016 that of course is an ideal<br>situation in that they are doing it<br>without a civil war going on in the<br>background in this situation there is a<br>Civil War and the time frame means it<br>could only be Spilled Out even<br>longer so that's the first thing we have<br>to be skeptical of the the second thing<br>that we should be skeptical glob with<br>the proposal is the current debate about<br>using what's known as a section seven<br>intervention section seven under the<br>charter is whereby the use of force is<br>authorized to<br>go to war for an aggressive purpose the<br>resolution on the table that the<br>Russians and the Americans are<br>discussing has the French and the<br>Americans saying we would like it to<br>have a section 7even reference what this<br>means is that if Assad did not disarm as<br>promised it would be deemed a breach of<br>International Peace and security and<br>then a attack a military use of force<br>authorized by the security Council would<br>be<br>legitimate if that<br>happens then we are following the exact<br>same precedent with what happened with<br>Saddam Hussein in<br>2003 there we had the first Gulf War we<br>had a promise that he would disarm um<br>his chemical weapons as well and when he<br>did not disarm his chemical weapons um<br>the United States took it as under its<br>own authority to strike um Saddam<br>Hussein and Iraq<br>there are of course very very strong<br>questions of legality of this action but<br>that's the precedent that the French and<br>the Americans are currently working<br>on now the other issue I wanted to<br>briefly talk about um before starting to<br>answer some of the questions that have<br>come in is what do we actually do from<br>here because everyone right now has been<br>focusing very strongly on the debate<br>with regards to chemical weapons and<br>we've actually forgotten that the<br>purpose of all this exercise is to find<br>peace in the region and the chemical<br>weapons are just one small part of a<br>very difficult equation the the equation<br>consists of the the type of crimes that<br>are being committed and and how we can<br>move forward and on the topic of crimes<br>I think it's it's fair comment to say<br>that the there are criminals lunatics<br>and fanatics on both sides or all sides<br>in this conflict there is no Monopoly on<br>bad acts there are crimes of War there<br>are crimes against humanity there are<br>crimes against Heritage it's it's<br>becoming<br>extremely difficult in terms of the<br>horror of this war it's reaching levels<br>which have been unseen for quite some<br>time and the only two conflicts I think<br>which are comparable in this area are um<br>what happened in the Balkans and what<br>happened in Sudan in terms of the United<br>Nations intervention and interest<br>the point I want to add here about the<br>crimes that we're seeing is that the<br>evidence would suggest that the majority<br>of the crimes are coming from um<br>governmental forces but by no means are<br>these holding a monopoly on the<br>crimes on the topic of how do we find<br>peace in this region I think people need<br>to start casting their mind to the<br>future of how it may play out and at<br>some Point peace will come and there's<br>there's two options here the first<br>option is that one side effectively wins<br>and trumps the other side and then you<br>have a complete regime change or regime<br>stability or you have a stalemate I<br>think it's likely at the moment we're<br>going to be going towards a stalemate in<br>time to come it's I come to this<br>position because of the amount of<br>Weaponry which is going into Syria uh<br>the Russian Weaponry is obviously<br>providing the bullets for the Syrian<br>regime and the Manpower is coming across<br>from Lebanon and hisbah and Syrian<br>forces despite early projections are<br>holding together quite well on the<br>opposing side the rebel s the rebel<br>soldiers are um flush with volunteers<br>there's over 10,000 foreign volunteers<br>there there is no shortage of people<br>willing to fight out of a population of<br>22 million and the Weaponry is now<br>coming from a number of Middle Eastern<br>countries and importantly from the<br>United States what this means is that<br>it's more likely that the war will<br>gridlock over a period of time if it<br>gridlocks as opposed to that there've<br>been a victory for one side or the other<br>at a certain point the International<br>Community will have to get involved and<br>split the country apart the two<br>precedents we we've done this recently<br>were in the Balkans which had a death<br>toll of 360,000 before intervention and<br>San which had a death total of 200,000<br>to put that in perspective the death<br>total at the moment in Syria is about<br>100,000 but the refugee count in the<br>Sudan in the Balkans and in Syria is<br>about the<br>same if we get to that<br>point if we get to that point whereby we<br>have to divide the country then we are<br>in completely uncertain areas but we<br>have in terms of the geographical<br>distribution<br>but I do think it's the likely thing<br>that we're going to have to be looking<br>come okay should I start answering some<br>questions yes please okay so<br>um the questions that have come in so<br>far which I will just go through them um<br>from top to bottom the first question<br>I've got is if Assad accepts Russia's<br>proposal but that signal he wasn't<br>behind the chemical weapons attack um I<br>think in times of conflict we should be<br>skeptical of all sides there there is no<br>um good guy or bad guy when it comes to<br>telling the truth with regards to the<br>weapons I expect that the evidence is<br>going to suggest that chemical weapons<br>have been used I think the evidence will<br>tell us what type of chemical weapons<br>and these will be second generation<br>chemical weapons but it will be<br>difficult for the evidence to say who<br>used them the only indication that we<br>may want to bear in mind is that second<br>generation chemical weapons are very<br>difficult to weaponize as in like Saddam<br>Hussein wanted second generation<br>chemical weapons of the type used most<br>likely in Syria but never had the<br>ability to actually make them functional<br>so that's an indicator um would it<br>signal that he wasn't behind the<br>chemical attacks no not not not at all I<br>I think<br>it's it's possible that the rebels use<br>them I think it's more like that they've<br>pels um second question why the big fuss<br>about chemical weapons when Conventional<br>Weapons have killed so many more people<br>in<br>Syria chemical weapons are a particular<br>type of weapon which is different to<br>everything else they are prohibited<br>because they are inhumane and they are<br>prohibited because they are in rate they<br>are the only class of weapon to actually<br>fulfill both<br>criteria um in terms of inhumane weapons<br>the laws of war banss a series of types<br>of weapons such as dum dum bullets um<br>lasers which blind the<br>opposition and chemical weapons chemical<br>weapons the inhumane nature of chemical<br>weapons is found in the way that they<br>kill people the first generation were<br>choking agents and we a victim would<br>primarily choke to death although the<br>the process of choking would um take<br>anything from 6 hours to 12 years and<br>and so many of the victims of the first<br>world war actually died in the decade<br>after the first world war<br>ended second generation chemical weapons<br>different these are nerve agents of<br>which um a drop of the agent depending<br>which one it is on your skin or um<br>vaporized if you breathe it in e<br>anything go through your eyes it will<br>eventually lead to paralysis of all your<br>nerves you will lose all bodily<br>functions and you will um suffocate it's<br>a particularly brutal way to die it<br>there's nothing dignified in it or nor<br>quick the indiscriminate nature of<br>chemical weapons in addition to the<br>inhumane is<br>that every attack broad projections<br>suggest<br>that for every Soldier killed 20<br>civilians will be killed this figure can<br>be much larger if it is in an urban<br>environment so this is just a broad<br>figure it's the indiscriminate nature of<br>chemical weapons which makes them<br>illegal as a weapon of mass destruction<br>so they're inhumane and they're<br>indiscriminate and together they are<br>banned by a specific treaty with the<br>chemical weapons convention<br>and this is the second treaty following<br>an earlier Prohibition in<br>1925<br>the prohibition on chemical weapons<br>makes them the most prohibited weapon on<br>the planet there are more prohibitions<br>on chemical weapons than there are on<br>biological weapons or nuclear<br>weapons part of the reasoning why the<br>International Community is so concerned<br>is that this type of chemical attack has<br>never been used before on civilians<br>whilst it is correct that um chemical<br>weapons were used by Saddam Hussein they<br>were first generation chemical weapons<br>they were not second generation chemical<br>weapons the use of second generation<br>chemical weapons is new and novel and to<br>put that into some kind of historical<br>perspective the fear in the second world<br>war was that the opposing insid who both<br>had chemical weapons would use high<br>explosives when they bombed each other's<br>cities and then to make sure that there<br>were no survivers they would put down a<br>layer of poison gas the amazing thing<br>about the second world war is despite<br>all of its<br>atrocities that fear never came to<br>fruition however it would appear that<br>Assad has crossed that boundary where<br>it's been high explosives followed by<br>chemical weapons so this is why this is<br>why the concern about chemical weapons<br>trumps everything else from landmines to<br>cluster bombs to just um rifles which<br>straight<br>the third question is even if all<br>chemical weapons are recovered from<br>Syria there's still the matter of the<br>ongoing Civil War who who ultimately<br>wins that um well I I addressed that<br>point when I started this talk and as I<br>suggest I think what's most likely now<br>is it will end up as a stalemate whereby<br>both sides um fight each other to um<br>gridlock unfortunately I think to do<br>that you're looking at the death toll<br>having to almost be double what it is<br>now but the growth rate of the death<br>toll is exponential and and we could get<br>there very<br>quickly 200,000 dead people 200,000 dead<br>civilians I should say um was the<br>Tipping Point for their un intervention<br>sedan<br>the fourth question I have is that more<br>than 30,000 Americans are killed each<br>year each year from um small arms and<br>gun and<br>gunshots shouldn't they worry about<br>cleaning up their own backyard before<br>sticking their nose into someone<br>else's<br>um it's for each country to regulate how<br>it deals with its small arms and I don't<br>believe that any country is got a<br>perfect social<br>policy the Americans certainly have to<br>deal with their issue of the um Second<br>Amendment as do all countries although I<br>hasten to add that whilst everyone is<br>busy looking at a country like America<br>and the problems that it has with small<br>arms a country like New Zealand has a<br>higher rate of ownership per capita of<br>weapons although most of them are rifles<br>and they actually in<br>America and just because the country has<br>its own domestic problems I do not think<br>means that you should not be taking a<br>leadership role in international Affairs<br>on that point about a leadership role I<br>do think we<br>have a legitimate expectation that<br>countries in the west like um Britain<br>like France like the United States will<br>take the higher ground sometimes I<br>believe it's what the international<br>Community I think it's what those who<br>are vulnerable expect us to do having<br>said that Russia has now taken The High<br>Ground and we should applaud them for<br>that it's the responsibility of all of<br>us to ensure that the international<br>upheld uh the question number<br>five what would be the likely fate of<br>Syria Christian population if if<br>this this question is a little bit blunt<br>and the reason I would say it's blunt is<br>because people tend to see this conflict<br>in Syria as being between Islamic<br>Fanatics and non-islamic Fanatics of<br>which people tend to assume that the<br>Christians are there and in fact there<br>are more layers of complication in the<br>ethnic diversity of this place and the<br>loyalties of each group than in most<br>other conflicts the it's not so much a<br>question of one type of Islamic group as<br>multiple varieties of Islamic groups<br>some liberal some less liberal than<br>others some Orthodox but professing<br>great support for secular<br>concerns and even on the governmental<br>side you will find Fanatics as well so<br>there there's no Monopoly of fanaticism<br>in this um there is a legitimate concern<br>with no matter who wins this conflict<br>that there will be<br>retribution and the retribution could<br>come from government forces or it could<br>come from the victors at the moment the<br>majority of the crimes being reported<br>are coming out of government sources so<br>the government appears to be responsible<br>for more crimes of war and crimes<br>um the next question what would be the<br>consequence for the us if it doesn't<br>intervene in the<br>situation I<br>think if there is no<br>settlement if the International<br>Community does not act if Assad did did<br>not follow through on his commitment to<br>do away with the weapons the<br>consequences for the US is that it looks<br>weak it it looks like it and I must be<br>honest here I think the United States<br>has been outmaneuvered on the high<br>diplomatic levels I think Russia has<br>completely grabbed the ascendancy here<br>and they are controlling this debate<br>America looks indecisive and we can<br>discuss that later about the the<br>American position and why Mr Obama went<br>down that route but it makes America<br>look the weaker of the international<br>players and I think it can to a degree<br>undermine its<br>credibility<br>the primary reason that the American<br>credibility may have been undermined was<br>the decision to by Obama to take the<br>vote to Congress and to taking the vote<br>to Congress in constitutional terms was<br>a nice gesture because it looks like<br>you're giving a lot of legitimacy to the<br>discussion about whether you should go<br>to war um the American<br>Constitution clearly places a heavy<br>weight on Congress in such<br>deliberations and it's this is a very<br>old tradition it goes back to Greek and<br>Roman times where the people are the<br>ultimate Arbiters of whether a country<br>should go to war or not<br>the practice historically has been that<br>when a president gives the matter to<br>Congress Congress affirms the<br>president's desire and they go to war<br>and the case of the United States it's<br>happened 22 times in 20 uh 11 times<br>declaration of war approved and 11 times<br>use of force also<br>approved um so if Obama went to Congress<br>and got refused it would look bad it<br>would be bad for the presidency but it<br>could be good for the Constitutional<br>process of the United<br>States because it's bad for the<br>presidency or potentially bad for the<br>presidency that is why has been the<br>practice of pretty much all the American<br>presidents when needed to avoid putting<br>the vote to Congress over 100 times of<br>military use of force by the United<br>States are done without recourse to<br>Congress and the decisions are made to<br>intervene or to engage in the conflict<br>and they happen very quickly and<br>Congress is not consulted the<br>American um decision makers the Senate<br>and the House of Representatives deeply<br>dislike this process whereby president<br>can effectively do what they want with<br>regards to draging the country into war<br>if became particularly problematic with<br>Vietnam and there have been a series of<br>attempts with the War Powers Resolution<br>to try to make them much<br>more<br>um controlled than they have been in the<br>past the problem is is that the<br>presidents really don't care the the<br>best example of this recently was was<br>President Clinton and the intervention<br>in Kosovo here again not authorized by<br>the security Council but<br>um he decided to go in Alone by himself<br>and under the guidance of humanitarian<br>intervention so presidents if they're<br>not certain don't give it to Congress<br>but if they do give it to Congress then<br>there's a risk in this instance he'll<br>say no I think what will happen now is<br>if the Russian proposal does not play<br>out then and Obama wants to get back<br>involved in Syria I doubt he'll give it<br>back to Congress I may be wrong on that<br>Live question on screen I got a a<br>question here um if the conflict stopped<br>today what will be the lasting impact on<br>the<br>region um I don't think the conflict<br>will stop today I I think this<br>conflict's going G for a fair time yet I<br>think when you see the region we need to<br>see a much bigger picture and to me the<br>bigger picture here is not just that<br>instability in Sy<br>but also the Brewing conflict between<br>Israel and Iran and we also need to be<br>conscious of considerations like what's<br>been going on with the Arab Spring and<br>the turmoil going on in countries like<br>Egypt at the moment the biggest concern<br>here I have in terms of International<br>Peace and<br>security is the other Red Line when I<br>say the other Red Line everyone knows<br>about the red line or remembers the red<br>line that Obama talked about with the<br>weapons but people have forgotten about<br>the red line that was set by the Israeli<br>Prime Minister with regards to the<br>nuclear buildup of<br>Iran Iran remains a non-compliance with<br>International Community as it moves<br>towards its pursuit of nuclear<br>weapons and Israel has been very clear<br>that it will not let this happen at some<br>point unless there is a resolution of<br>this conflict it is quite possible that<br>um the conflict between Iran and Israel<br>could kick off and<br>because Iran is linked to Lebanon and<br>Lebanon and Iran are both linked to<br>Syria the regional Dynamics are still<br>very unstable so to to answer the<br>question the lasting impact on the<br>region this is one small part of a very<br>unstable place our goal right now has to<br>be to try to stop the spread of conflict<br>from Syria into other regions but<br>promising that spread has been part of<br>through um next question uh how can we<br>be 100% sure it was the government not<br>the rebels who use chemical weapons and<br>attacks on civilians we can but we we<br>will not be able to know for a long time<br>who was responsible I think at best<br>we'll be able to identify if chemical<br>weapons were used and what type of<br>chemical weapons they were<br>as I said earlier I think this means<br>that for second generation chemical<br>weapons the difficulty of weaponizing<br>the suggests that it's more government<br>forces than not having said that it<br>would not be impossible for ripples to<br>well uh next<br>question if the use of chemical weapons<br>is the use of chemical weapons the the<br>new Benchmark for attracting us<br>intervention um yeah it's certainly<br>a a benchmark of sorts yes it is as I<br>said it's because they're illegal<br>they're<br>indiscriminate and they are inhumane and<br>so this is the absolute threshold of<br>prohibited weapons the skeptic out there<br>will say well this means therefore if<br>these weapons are so bad if you want to<br>get America into a debate<br>then you should be using chemical<br>weapons and there may be a level of<br>Truth to that but that's not an argument<br>concerned how can a further chemical<br>weapons attack be prevented further<br>think well the the way there's two<br>arguments here that the first argument<br>is what the Americans have said and that<br>is the threat of the use of force will<br>prevent them from using um chemical<br>weapons again or the Russian approach<br>which is you should just disarm them and<br>then remove the possibility I like the<br>second approach I think if we can disign<br>them it's a fantastic thing although I<br>do believe you have to be concerned<br>about the technological ability to do<br>this and the issue of verification is<br>also a strong concern remembering as I<br>said that the it was the inability to<br>verify what Saddam Hussein was meant to<br>have done with disarming and dismantling<br>his chemical weapons that led to the<br>second Gulf War to this day we still<br>don't know what happened to a lot of<br>them with Syria the fear is that not<br>only have the chemical weapons been<br>decentralized within Syria they may have<br>been pushed across the border into<br>Lebanon in which case the chemical<br>weapons were not so much being pointed<br>at only the rebel held areas in Syria<br>well um further question um how can the<br>US justify intervention in Syria when<br>atrocities in other countries go<br>unpunished such as the Congo and<br>Palestine um this is a a question about<br>international law and the security<br>Council<br>and<br>atrocities go get punished if there is<br>an agreement International atrocities if<br>they are a threat to um International<br>Peace and<br>security and the security Council agrees<br>that they are a threat to International<br>Peace and security so what this means is<br>that if there's no veto put on them by<br>the security Council then we<br>will see the International Community get<br>engaged so with the Congo the the<br>International Community is engaged and<br>and within the last month the the<br>peacekeepers have been reinforced and<br>the mandate to use Force has been<br>increased so I think we are engaged in<br>the Congo with Palestine what you see is<br>the difficulties of the security Council<br>whereby The veto of one country in this<br>case the United States ensures that any<br>atrocities that occur tend to be<br>invisible at the international level<br>this is not to say that all atrocities<br>that Israel has been involved in with<br>regard to the Palestine are invisible<br>many of these are visible by the<br>security Council but many aren't another<br>example would be say something like Chia<br>whereby a or Tibet with China whereby a<br>country can completely keep an<br>agenda um another<br>question the UN seems impotent in this<br>conflict doesn't need to find different<br>approaches to conflict what might they<br>be<br>um the security Council does seem<br>impotent in this conflict but we need<br>to and and this is a huge problem in<br>international law that sometimes you can<br>see the most terrible things going on<br>which range from crimes of humanity all<br>the way up to genocide and the<br>International Community is impotent and<br>the reason it's impotent is because of<br>the veto whereby one country or two<br>countries prevent International action<br>going through the answer to many people<br>is that if that's the case what we<br>should do is remove the<br>veto the risk with that and I honestly<br>believe this is the bigger risk is that<br>when you do that you forget why the<br>security Council was formed in the first<br>place the security Council was formed<br>after the second world war after the<br>League of Nations failed the purpose of<br>the security Council and indeed the<br>United Nations Charter is to prevent the<br>third world war and we because of what<br>happened in the first world war and the<br>second world war then we had to create a<br>mechanism whereby the most powerful<br>people could control a situation and as<br>unpalatable as it has been when it means<br>if certain atrocities go past the<br>alternative of removing their veto could<br>effectively tip the balance towards<br>leading to a greater conflict so we must<br>there um another question how much power<br>does the UN have in this situation and<br>what can they do that the power that the<br>UN has in this situation comes down from<br>the security Council to get involved in<br>someone else's War if there is no un<br>authorization<br>then we can't do anything apart from<br>humanitarian gestures like getting the<br>Red Cross involved and to get the Red<br>Cross involved you have to have the<br>consent of the countries and um<br>belligerent involved in the<br>engagement what can they do well it if<br>it's a lowlevel engagement that they<br>will tend to try to stay up but when it<br>becomes a civil war like this when the<br>death toll gets big enough eventually<br>The veto will stop<br>is is the normal practice the difficulty<br>with that is that you're talking about a<br>mathematical equation when at base you<br>are talking about innocent civilians<br>being killed and this is something which<br>particularly concerns me because I have<br>a tendency to slip into mathematical<br>figures and Grand numbers but at base in<br>all of this what you're talking about is<br>individuals um people normal people<br>people who just want to pay their<br>mortgage or people just want to bring up<br>their family or people who want to go to<br>scho and so yes the Tipping Point for<br>sadan was 200,000 it was a similar<br>figure for the Balkans and you've got to<br>get to a very high death toll before<br>eventually The veto disappears but even<br>then there's no guarantee that the veto<br>will disappear allowing in outside<br>intervention as I say Wars like chichia<br>Wars like Vietnam you have much higher<br>death rates but the course of one<br>country's control of the security<br>um do followers of Islam really need<br>another excuse to hate the United States<br>um many followers of Islam do not this<br>is not a this is not a Islam pro-islam<br>anti-islam type of debate there are many<br>different types just communities<br>involved the majority of the communities<br>clearly are<br>um Muslim but within the Muslim branches<br>there are a variety of different<br>interpretations of their theological<br>Works they don't all agree some of the<br>worst Civil Wars historically um in both<br>the Christian tradition and in the<br>Muslim tradition have been Interfaith<br>Wars there is a degree of interfaith<br>conflict going on here but even within<br>these people they are not all of the<br>same brush there are Christians there<br>are Muslims there Sunni there a shi<br>there are a whole<br>collection I don't think it's um<br>accurate to portray this as Muslim and<br>anti-muslim there are as I say Fanatics<br>and criminals and lunatics on both sides<br>there there's no Monopoly here but these<br>are not just for Islamic groups they can<br>also be for Christian groups and they<br>will the US<br>intervention bring about any real change<br>for the people of Syria I think if we we<br>look at what's going on here and the<br>possibility of real<br>change well I think you got to look at<br>the long-term picture and the apart from<br>stopping the Civil War apart from<br>building the peace you have to look at<br>some of the underlying considerations<br>for why a region goes to war and how you<br>can actually change those I think in a<br>time like the Middle East what you're<br>seeing is huge demographic change the<br>population is growing very quickly I<br>understand that 40% of the population is<br>under the age of 25 I also understand<br>that 30% of the population is below the<br>poverty line and so when youve got a<br>huge amount of young people who are poor<br>and unemployed it doesn't matter what<br>ethnicity they are or what religion they<br>are or what political views they hold is<br>that if you want to build peace you have<br>to build economic prosperity and<br>Economic Opportunity in a lot of these<br>countries and what you see in a lot of<br>the Middle East is despite a huge amount<br>of laress coming through from the oil<br>revenues and other assistance over the<br>years as it has not been captured and so<br>unless you can rebuild a country<br>economically as well as socially<br>and in that regard you've got to be<br>thinking about considerations of Human<br>Rights the rule of law<br>equality then you were just going to get<br>into a pattern where the conflict will<br>continue and this is<br>um obviously these considerations of<br>equality the rule of law Liberty as such<br>this is a lot of language that came out<br>from the Arab<br>Spring and I think it was easy to be<br>very optimistic about these in the Arab<br>Spring but these were not clearly<br>articulated Visions more often than not<br>the supporters of the Arab Spring were<br>reacting against tyranny of which much<br>of the Middle East was in terms of<br>either um dictatorships or authoritarian<br>monarchies of which there was no<br>democracy and whilst I personally am a<br>great fan of democracy and<br>equality I'm not certain that many<br>people engaged with the Arab Spring<br>share the same value<br>structure I was particularly Disturbed<br>over what happened in Egypt with the<br>toppling of the democracy and whilst I<br>would agree that the Democracy as it was<br>operating was clearly problematic I<br>don't think it was correct to allow<br>another military dictatorship to take it<br>over and I found the Silence of the<br>Western countries in the face of this is<br>a particular hypocrisy and so<br>unfortunately that kind of context for<br>the war about the Arab Spring about<br>shallow what is the outlook for the<br>intervention PL to be honest the outlook<br>for for refugees is Bleak you've got<br>you've got two types of refugees here<br>you've got internally displaced people<br>and you've got externally displaced<br>people we tend to think of refugees as<br>those who have moved beyond the<br>border<br>the the bleakness is due to two<br>considerations the first one is that the<br>International Community has currently<br>got a very dim view of helping out<br>refugees nations are increasingly<br>intolerant and do not wish to allow<br>refugees to come into their countries<br>there is a degree of fatigue so the take<br>up of refugee numbers is not great the<br>second reason why it is Bleak is because<br>many of these people will have lost<br>their homes and depending on where they<br>are in the conflict and where there may<br>be an eventual peace settlement they may<br>never be able to return to what they<br>once had and they may end up<br>forfeiting um or losing a huge amount of<br>land to put that into some kind of<br>context<br>the people of Palestine have a<br>legitimate grievance against the people<br>of the government of Israel with regard<br>to land that was taken in<br>1947 I understand and also the 1967 war<br>and the refugees from those two<br>conflicts dating back now over half a<br>century<br>continue to regard this as a legitimate<br>grievance which can still upset the<br>peace processes<br>today so it's Bleak for the refugees and<br>the likelihood that this could become a<br>future sticking point also very<br>difficult the return of refugees was a<br>very hard Topic in the Balkans because<br>when the peace settlement<br>comes<br>then<br>the division of the land it can be very<br>forthright and some people who once held<br>where will the next Middle East War be<br>will conflict increase<br>think as I said the the one we've got to<br>watch for the next Middle East War to be<br>worried about is Iran and Israel I think<br>there is a strong likelihood that Israel<br>will strike militarily against Iran as<br>their nuclear capacity gets quite<br>close I think<br>that will be the most likely external<br>War I think<br>internally it's more likely that<br>countries will implode and<br>explode I believe that<br>Egypt Iran no sorry not Iran Egypt<br>Iraq<br>Algeria are currently on the cast of<br>civil wars and the Egypt in particular<br>Afghanistan we'll have to wait to see<br>and to what actually happens there I<br>know it's not part of the region but<br>it's also<br>unstable<br>well will conflict increase um unless<br>you can remove some of those basic<br>considerations for why conflict starts<br>in the first place then yes it it it's<br>it's hard to fight against the tide<br>you've got to look at the economic<br>considerations for why people fight<br>you've got to look at Human Rights<br>you've got to look at considerations of<br>equality there are base things that all<br>societies need to prosper one of the<br>most important things we know that will<br>end conflict is that when democracy is<br>imposed upon people or adopted by people<br>I should say adopted because you can't<br>impose it people have to grow into a<br>democracy but we know pretty clearly now<br>that democracy is very very very really<br>ever fight other democracies so one of<br>the best guarantees that we can have<br>with peace in this region and in any<br>other parts of the world is to promote<br>democracy democracies will fight<br>authoritarian regimes democracies will<br>fight tyrants but they will very very<br>rarely fight other democracies so if you<br>want it in<br>Conflict we know what to do but as I<br>said that's only part of the equation<br>democracy is not the whole answer it is<br>also about economic considerations as<br>well it's about trying to deal with<br>youth unemployment it's about<br>environmental standards it's about<br>ensuring that there are enough resources<br>not just in of monetary considerations<br>but also in terms of physical things<br>such as the distribution of water and in<br>the Middle East we can see water also<br>conflict who has the world's largest<br>stockpile of chemical weapons in why um<br>this was the Russians and the Americans<br>but and they held something like 95% of<br>all the chemical weapons in the world up<br>until<br>1993 and between 199 6 and 2012 they<br>have been systematically destroyed and<br>it's been a long slow process but it's<br>it has been achieved and it's almost<br>completed now in the Soviet Union uh<br>Russia the difficulty with the stock<br>pile of weapons is not just the actual<br>Munitions themselves it's also with the<br>precursors which are the precursors of<br>the chemicals that you actually mix into<br>the chemical weapons to weaponize them<br>so you may have a th000 tons of s and<br>gas but you would typically have about<br>4,000 precursors to make the weapon and<br>you have to get rid of the precursors<br>well<br>that's I've lot of<br>questions if there are more questions<br>you can<br>just okay all righty folks well that's<br>it it's um alisp and my views on Sera I<br>hope it's been<br>informative um if you got any more</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
