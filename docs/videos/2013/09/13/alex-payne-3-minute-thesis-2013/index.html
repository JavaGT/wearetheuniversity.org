font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>cereal posy is one of the most common<br>physical disabilities in children in New<br>Zealand alone there are around 2,000<br>kids and 5,000 adults living with this<br>disability cereal posy is brain damage<br>to the nent brain that takes away some<br>of that person's ability to control<br>their own muscles what does brain damage<br>really mean for that person to answer<br>that question with the help of eye<br>tracking or at least part of that<br>question I want to evaluate people's<br>cereal BOS effect on people's planning<br>ability during tasks that involve ey<br>hand coordination but before I talk<br>about that firstly I want to show you<br>how your brain influences what you see<br>so if you look at my slide you'll see<br>down the bottom there are two pictures<br>that are the same picture nothing<br>special about it just something I took<br>on holiday in Malaysia and now what I<br>want you to do is stare at the white<br>cross at the top of the slide between<br>the red and the green and we're going to<br>stare at that for about 30 seconds so<br>don't look at me stare at that<br>now<br>and as I was just saying I'm doing this<br>to show you how your brain<br>subconsciously controls your vision so<br>when I say so I want you to look down at<br>the white cross between the other two<br>pictures<br>so if you could all look down now and<br>you should be seeing that the one on the<br>left is now a bit green and the one on<br>the right it's a bit<br>red this is neural adaptation it's<br>perfectly healthy don't worry about<br>it so for my research I want to<br>investigate how your brain<br>subconsciously controls the timing of<br>when your eyes move rather than the<br>colors they see by looking at the timing<br>of eye movement during I hand<br>coordination tasks such as using a<br>computer mouse<br>I want to get a better understanding of<br>how humans plan their motions because<br>when you move something with your hand<br>what happens is your eye moves towards<br>the Target first and then your hand<br>follows and in a specific case it's been<br>shown that the harder the task the less<br>and less in advance your eye moves ahead<br>of your hand so by measuring this<br>latency between your eye and your hand<br>starting to move want want to evaluate<br>people's planning ability and<br>currently it's known that people with<br>cerebal policy have more difficulty in<br>tasks that involve them planning further<br>ahead but what's not clear is sorry<br>what's not clear is whether this is due<br>to a reduced planning ability or whether<br>it's due to the fact that they're<br>planning for a task that's subjectively<br>more difficult for them due to reduce<br>motor control so to test this I want to<br>come up with a model of what it's like<br>for someone to use a computer mouse with<br>cereal pausy and then apply this to some<br>unknowing control participants and see<br>if it affects their gaze in the same way<br>and that's how I hope to better<br>understand the human body's Control<br>Systems all by observing vision and<br>thinking about brains thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
