2019<br>before we get started I'd just like to<br>acknowledge and we are planning to put a<br>plug in for a future of anybody on that<br>few housekeeping matters toilets go out<br>here to live if we have an emergency<br>evacuation so this is a collaborative<br>effort between Sydney and the center and<br>just reminded of a contribution that<br>Mike Bennett made in an earlier energy<br>method series when oil is pushing home<br>$1 a barrel so it's really great to have<br>seen energy their rating<br>again just thank you very much for the<br>opportunity to bring viable to this<br>event and now I'm going to attend about<br>it to join them to talk about making<br>money to full name<br>good evening and it's a real pleasure in<br>perpetuity to be able to introduce<br>Michael<br>and to be here with you tonight and I<br>just attuning that the acknowledgement<br>and it was always sort of a part of how<br>efficiently when we thought about<br>bringing Michael out for a few days at<br>special time in October so we wanted to<br>move from him and we've had lots of<br>really good conversations whether were<br>there hoard and executive and members of<br>the team but the vision always was to<br>try and share them around it give the<br>opportunity for people in the wider<br>community with interest in ways that was<br>talked about to do so to see so many<br>such a diverse group in today today<br>that's really all I really wanted to say<br>introducing Michael natoons are sitting<br>over the content from each point of<br>viewers why are we interested in this<br>conversation and I think invisible to<br>the tunes of Mike peanuts and terms of<br>certainly how he stood up to energy and<br>his leadership is there even a day where<br>the energy comes into moving people<br>around the moment we do that by selling<br>a lot of hybrid carpets but we know that<br>their stories changing and our challenge<br>is to understand when their technique<br>and to make strategic choices about what<br>we want to do<br>and so having someone like Michael here<br>is really really useful for us because<br>it really challenges L thinking and gets<br>us to stop so I my name is talking you<br>some of the to manager strategies and it<br>doesn't help you options so mothers are<br>really happy is reduced because he has a<br>really good environment bio and it's<br>he's coming are those guys that you go<br>work bother doing more my life because<br>the Bible is full in this in it's really<br>impressive in its projects whether this<br>is your here but the things that I'll<br>say to help that introduces he's most<br>well known a lot of reasons we were<br>totally receiving a community finance<br>which the new Energy Finance which we<br>believe provides I said on numerous<br>advisory boards too many to to really<br>mention but one that's certainly<br>prevalent for us and I think some of the<br>people be talking to you just being six<br>years Transport for London so we but the<br>key point that I want to make him who I<br>think is so interesting is that he's a<br>participant in this conversation as<br>opposed to an observer so you might be<br>indication of that as he goes through<br>but he he's in a mister he's an adviser<br>and he's he's playing in the space<br>someone sitting there for me and and<br>what comes with it which I've because<br>you sure refreshing it's something you<br>never quite knowing to bring people out<br>to what a lot of things really<br>refreshing this is really really happy<br>to provide the opinion on something so<br>it doesn't sort of sit on the things and<br>I think I was sort of introduced me this<br>morning the team sometimes they<br>determine that you straight between the<br>eyes and a really good thing it sort of<br>wakes you up so that's a hugely valuable<br>thing that I think you can bring it's<br>not only provide us with some<br>information but it's cheap challenges so<br>lastly I would say is it's not enough<br>local speed in the 1992 Winter Olympics<br>so he's kind of covered those bases as<br>well so we to south island we keep or<br>he would have been thanks very much<br>Julian thank you madam there's always<br>somebody out there that's thinking wow<br>you know scooting the Olympics did he I<br>wonder if he won so I was on the British<br>team but I was the highest placed<br>management consultant so what I can I<br>can I can give almost I can always give<br>opinions to means if you're very kind<br>you like being hit between the eyes of<br>my opinions my opinions are slightly<br>more likely to be right than wrong but<br>they're certainly not infallible and<br>I've been in New Zealand all of under a<br>week it's been a wonderful week and I'm<br>really honored to be here but it's less<br>than a week so you know anything I say<br>about New Zealand take with a pinch of<br>salt but I do do this quite a bit I go<br>round the world I travel to different<br>countries and so hopefully what I can do<br>is give some trends and some data and<br>some information about energy I try and<br>I think do a little bit more on<br>transportation and understanding this<br>audience been sort of sold the idea that<br>I will have some thoughts or answers on<br>transportation but we will start with<br>energy and you'll see sort of why<br>because I think the convergence is very<br>important and hopefully I can give some<br>some insight might be of use one of the<br>things I take as a starting point social<br>media today and there's all these news<br>stories about how wonderful you know<br>wind power is solar-powered the problem<br>with social media is if you click on one<br>of these stories your entire timeline<br>fills up with how the problem is solved<br>it's all easy you know you click on one<br>story about offshore wind being<br>competitive with no subsidy and suddenly<br>all you get is this fantastic sort of<br>stream of good news fabulous stories<br>about innovation and you think well I<br>don't understand what the problem is and<br>it's the same with electric<br>vehicles you know you click on one story<br>about how fabulous the Tesla three years<br>then that's all you see and you see this<br>you know steady stream of stories about<br>innovation and this that the other and<br>transformation how quick it's going to<br>go and you get some crazy people saying<br>so we're going to be using it you know<br>doing self-driving electric cars<br>ninety five percent of all trips by<br>weather and it's just you know that's<br>all you'll get and your timeline<br>and of course there is a parallel<br>universe that I don't know I'm assuming<br>because you've all come here to listen<br>to me and nobody's thrown a bread roll<br>yet you'll probably all the sorts of<br>people who do click on those stories and<br>but then there'll be a part of you that<br>will worry because there's a parallel<br>universe there are people who are<br>clicking on the story about you know so<br>that these these appalling things like<br>the Sun doesn't shine at night and and<br>every soft and there's no wind and you<br>know and you know batteries don't get<br>recycled they get thrown on the garbage<br>and there's also there's a halt of a<br>parallel universe of bad news and also<br>then you know in all seriousness very<br>serious very sensible people who say<br>things like the great hope for a quick<br>and sweeping transition to renewable<br>energy is wishful thinking and this<br>isn't just anybody this is a very<br>eminent economist it's it's Bill Gates<br>as favorite economist writes you know a<br>book every 15 minutes or so very<br>prolific but also very very smart and he<br>says energy transitions are slow they<br>tend to take 50 years and all this stuff<br>about wind and solar doing anything<br>important in the world is actually<br>wishful thinking so where does the truth<br>lie and so that's something that perhaps<br>I can try and and help with I've been<br>using this paradigm the three third<br>world where we're headed by 2040 and so<br>I'll start by just trying to explain<br>this is kind of where we're going based<br>on existing trends this is just you know<br>so it's neither we're gonna get all<br>renewable all problems solved fully<br>electric by whatever nor is it this is<br>all nonsense and nothing's happening I'm<br>gonna try and persuade you that we're<br>going to go to this three third world by<br>2040 and then we can ask whether that's<br>enough from a climate perspective is<br>that fast enough because it's certainly<br>I'll tell you the three<br>world 1/3 of electricity to be wind and<br>solar probably about half of all global<br>electricity to be zero carbon if you<br>include nuclear and and bioenergy<br>one-third of vehicles to be electric and<br>the economy one-third energy more energy<br>productive so one-third more output for<br>every unit of energy this is a pretty<br>positive picture compared to when I<br>start at New Energy Finance back in 2004<br>you know either out of if you'd have<br>offered me that I don't mean like by<br>that's great that's us that's way better<br>than we would have thought but then<br>we'll answer the question at the end is<br>that enough and if it's not enough what<br>do we want to do about it so the idea<br>here is where are we going so then we<br>know whether we have to sort of do a<br>handbrake turn accelerate a bit whether<br>we just coast to victory whether we have<br>to destroy capitalism hopefully we can<br>sort of get some sense of that in the<br>first part of my remarks so let's talk<br>electricity first I started tracking the<br>money flowing into clean energy in the<br>definition that I was using renewable<br>energy energy efficiency power storage<br>smart grid carbon capture and storage<br>all the kind of good things I didn't<br>include the somewhat good things like<br>nuclear and natural gas although they're<br>part of our future<br>you know globally not nuclear in New<br>Zealand but globally for the next few<br>indefinitely few and probably many<br>decades and what you can see is that it<br>sort of grew very quickly that I<br>actually I looked at this just recently<br>I hang on a second I know what's going<br>on here New Energy Finance I found it in<br>2004 and I sold it in 2009 and if I'd<br>have actually kept hold of it not sold<br>it then frankly climate change would<br>have been solved by now because it would<br>have kept growing but what it did was it<br>stalled the dollar value stalled about<br>350 billion dollars a year going into<br>these kind of into the clean end of<br>clean technologies I'm sure all of you<br>are you know such experts here at the<br>Energy Center you already know that<br>there's about two trillion dollars every<br>year that goes into energy if you take<br>upstream oil and gas midstream<br>downstream so the all the way down to<br>the sort of four courts that call<br>mine's the investment in the grid as<br>well as the generating capacity because<br>grid investment is not in this figure<br>that's two trillion so a rule of thumb<br>you know if you walk away with any sort<br>of simple heuristics weird about one<br>dollar in every six that is being spent<br>on this stuff and it grew you know<br>pretty rapidly and you can also see here<br>something very interesting<br>the eras of history starting to build<br>out so the first era the more you wanted<br>the more you spend there is the<br>installations in gigawatts so that for<br>the first period it pretty much tracks<br>the money so if you subsidized more you<br>got more and if you didn't and you<br>didn't but then it goes into this kind<br>of second period where you although the<br>investment has stalled the gigawatts<br>installation has not and the reason for<br>that is of course that the costs started<br>to come down and you can very clearly<br>see there's a kind of cusp somewhere in<br>the middle of that period that so lying<br>behind it is the experience curve and I<br>was just very fortunate in my career<br>because very early on in the 1980s I was<br>calculating experience curves in my<br>first job and so that was one of the<br>reasons why I started New Energy Finance<br>I could see all these problems in the<br>energy sector climate change Gulf War<br>depletion peak oil there was this thing<br>didn't happen but I could also see that<br>these other technologies clean energy<br>technologies that would have rapid<br>experience curves and I sort of that was<br>the foundational insight I started the<br>company and that's kind of in a way why<br>I'm here today so you can see they<br>continued and very aggressive very fast<br>experience curves 28% it pretty much the<br>fastest you'll find outside software<br>right and then 15% for wind so for every<br>doubling these figures are for every<br>doubling of cumulative capacity built<br>cumulative experience you'll see these<br>cost drops and they'll never stop the<br>experience curve never rests the<br>experience might cumulate more slowly as<br>things get big but they will never stop<br>working it's very very different from<br>Resource Economics you know this is<br>different from find some call you know<br>open a mine build some rail and then<br>your costs are pretty much done very<br>difficult to reduce costs thereafter<br>this is material science it's software<br>it's also cost of capital dropping as<br>people became familiar with the<br>technology what does it look like over<br>on the left you can see what a solar<br>farm looked like in 2005 that was a big<br>solar farm and then over on the right<br>you can see what they look like now and<br>obviously this is not New Zealand but<br>that's big solar farms now we're talking<br>about the first gigawatt scale solar is<br>being built and actually given that<br>there's a lot of desert in the world as<br>our Sun these are going to get bigger<br>and bigger with wind when I started they<br>were installing the average turbine<br>being installed was about 1.7 two<br>megawatts but four megawatts were on the<br>you know we're coming down the tracks<br>and we were all like oh my god four<br>megawatts Oh megawatts that's just such<br>a monster and of course what happened<br>you know shortly after they start<br>talking seven megawatts that was another<br>family of wind turbines nine megawatts<br>and we're about to see the first 12<br>megawatt than first of the new GE big<br>wind turbines but mainly offshore<br>because people kind of object to these<br>things but I was told that the story<br>that my mother doesn't know what I do<br>for a living and so I sort of she's 88<br>she very sharp so I showed her some of<br>these charts and said look I go around<br>the world and I tell people that you<br>know these trends and I showed it and<br>she said she said Wow Jesus 13 to 15<br>megawatts that is unbelievable really<br>unbelievable ship right what I don't<br>understand is why would you build one in<br>so where that trend has taken us is now<br>this this is the world record these are<br>the Usain Bolt of the clean energy<br>project world and you've got solar PV to<br>US cents per kilowatt hour to put it in<br>perspective even in the US a new gas<br>fired power station CCGT would be<br>probably five or six cents per kilowatt<br>hour so this is one third of the cost<br>wind 1.77 and this is unsubsidized you<br>know this is this is the before you add<br>the effect of any government support and<br>then offshore wind quite extraordinarily<br>five US cents that is an even and all of<br>these surprised everybody even you know<br>me and my team you know offshore wind<br>just a few years ago with 12 cents and<br>now suddenly it's five cents per<br>kilowatt hour and that project there in<br>Mexico that one point seven seven cents<br>per kilowatt hour you know we used to<br>get this kind of when is clean energy<br>going to be grid competitive this is a<br>third of the price of any conventional<br>alternative forget grid competitive this<br>is killing the grid and it's the<br>cheapest form of new electricity added<br>to a grid anywhere in the world from any<br>technology at any point in history and<br>it's clean energy and this is still not<br>understood by most mainstream<br>commentators and many business people<br>and even people in the energy industry<br>they just don't believe it right but<br>that's what did it now not only is that<br>the world record which means that the<br>median is not quite as good as that<br>although it's going to approach that<br>over time but also it's variable so the<br>other thing people say is proven if they<br>believe it they say are but that is not<br>the full cost and so on but what's<br>happening is that the paradigm for a<br>utility if you see something as cheap as<br>this you buy it if you need electricity<br>you see it two cents you buy it and then<br>you go Sun doesn't shine at night well<br>let's try and figure out using the money<br>you've saved by buying this cheap<br>resource you will then try and figure<br>out how to meet the need at night or if<br>the wind doesn't blow and so on<br>and so you obviously need a portfolio<br>approach and salt and technologies which<br>we'll talk about but this is being<br>driven into the electricity markets<br>around the world country after country<br>by the underlying economics now not by<br>policy decisions but by the underlying<br>economics and the policymaker has to<br>sort of create rules of the market and<br>have to regulate utilities appropriately<br>so that this cheap wind and solar can<br>get into the market but that's what we<br>see what's happening around the world<br>there you can see the the Americas<br>Europe Asia New Zealand renewable energy<br>penetrating into the markets the blue is<br>dispatchable right so that is hydro and<br>biomass and got a biogas and then the<br>yellow is this growing wedge of wind and<br>solar and a couple of things that are<br>worth noticing first of all there are<br>some blessed countries I mean there's a<br>bunch that can do to sent wind and solar<br>those world records that we've seen<br>which will eventually be one cent<br>there's some other blessed countries<br>here or lucky countries you could call<br>them which are the ones that have got a<br>lot of hydro or while the blue which is<br>mainly hydrated Canada Brazil New<br>Zealand because it's much easier to<br>balance the grid if you've got lots of<br>hydro much easier to integrate that<br>variability so you can see it really<br>stands out that some countries are very<br>very lucky from that perspective the<br>other thing the other heuristic is that<br>if you can see the yellow wedge it's<br>probably messing up your wholesale<br>prices why because it's variable wind<br>and solar appear when they want to not<br>necessarily when the market wants them<br>to and they have very low or even zero<br>marginal costs and that's why<br>policymakers are having to rewrite the<br>regulatory book because it's great to<br>have really cheap power but if it means<br>that your gas your coal maybe your<br>nuclear so well I can't make money<br>operating not 6,000 hours a you have a<br>now I'm down to four thousand and two<br>thousand I'm just gonna shut up shop and<br>go away then there's a regulatory<br>problem because obviously<br>somebody has to you know the politicians<br>get kind of annoyed when the lights go<br>out so the regulators have to do<br>something about that that's really the<br>this is not some you know Birkenstock<br>wearing you know hippie this is the<br>Minister of State for power Cole you've<br>got a figure he knows his economics new<br>and renewable energy and he says the<br>cost of solar power is now cheap<br>he means the cost of new solar power is<br>now cheaper than the cost of new coal<br>right what he's not saying is all we can<br>now shut all the coal in India and just<br>have solar right it's not saying that<br>he's saying if you're building new stuff<br>you've got increasing demands for<br>electricity you'll add solar before you<br>add coal but interestingly as the<br>experience curve continues to drive down<br>the cost of wind and solar there will be<br>a second breakpoint in India it'll be<br>about 2040 in other countries about 2030<br>where actually you could say the cost of<br>new solar power is now cheaper than old<br>existing or not even old but just<br>functioning coal plants are in the<br>market and we're already seeing that in<br>some parts of the US where you're<br>actually you'll just shut relatively new<br>gas plants because it's so much cheaper<br>to build new solar and new wind<br>particularly new wind in the US so<br>there's this second breakpoint where<br>wind and solar approach not just the<br>market for additional power but all<br>existing power this is what's happening<br>to capacity factors of coal so rizal why<br>should we do anything China's building a<br>coal-fired power station every week that<br>they were building to so that's good<br>news<br>but the thing is that those power<br>stations are being used less and less<br>those investors building coal-fired<br>power stations in China have a very good<br>chance of losing money or making their<br>mates lose money to coal you can see<br>this is new build right but there's also<br>retirements underneath the line a net<br>new build has come down<br>by about two-thirds since 2006 coal is<br>being forced out of the system on the<br>economics and not everybody has heard<br>about that and some people may have<br>heard I don't know so the nice thing<br>about a statement like this we've picked<br>up forty five thousand mining jobs in a<br>very short period of time is that you<br>can fact check it I'm sure you'd like to<br>do so there are only fifty thousand coal<br>mining jobs in the US it's actually half<br>an order of magnitude fewer than there<br>are clean energy jobs and they certainly<br>have not increased so these are final<br>investment decisions for coal but the<br>interesting thing is also gas has not<br>picked up the slack the myth is that<br>well emissions dropped in the u.s.<br>because coal was replaced by gas very<br>simple story right very easy to get your<br>head around it's not actually true if<br>you look at why emissions dropped from<br>the power system in the US the biggest<br>contributor was energy efficiency or<br>energy productivity if the if the<br>emissions had grown in line with the<br>economy right they would have continued<br>to go up but they didn't they've gone<br>down the biggest contributor is actually<br>energy productivity the second biggest<br>contributor is actually called to gas<br>switching but it's only just ahead of<br>renewable energy by a smidgen that's the<br>full picture so where are we well 2017 I<br>think we've have to we've just seen<br>there's just been an update now 2018 six<br>percent wind and solar globally and it's<br>now today about eight percent in the<br>first half of 2019 eight percent of<br>electricity ever in the world is already<br>wind and so you wouldn't know that<br>reading the business press right and<br>this is for an industry this has been<br>done from pretty much a standing start<br>about 15 years ago start<br>from a huge cost disadvantage and<br>despite being irritating and variable<br>and difficult to integrate into the grid<br>and against resistant resistance from<br>some very aggressive and wealthy<br>incumbents so I don't think it's<br>controversial at all as the IEA says<br>we'll get to a quarter and the team that<br>I trained says 40% wind and solar by<br>2040 so that's the first third is<br>somewhere between 1/4 and 40% as I said<br>I don't think that's controversial as I<br>talk to audiences they usually are sort<br>of bludgeoned into agreeing even if they<br>started out not liking wind and solar<br>now it causes problems on the grid right<br>because it's variable and you have to<br>manage that so the grid needs to balance<br>and what a lot of people sort of don't<br>know is it has to balance across all<br>timeframes right you can have minutes to<br>second so for instance suddenly a<br>generator trips out and you have to keep<br>the voltage and the frequency stable or<br>you might have days two hours ahead you<br>might not forecast the fact that I don't<br>know the Sun burns off the fog a bit<br>quicker and suddenly there's more power<br>than you thought from the solar or the<br>New Zealand women's soccer team makes it<br>through to the final and so suddenly you<br>you know everybody sits down in front of<br>their television to watch it or not and<br>then months 2 weeks so this one's really<br>hard right because people love solar and<br>Germany it's got all this solar of<br>course but it only has it in the summer<br>and in the winter it's not there or<br>you've relied on a lot of wind and the<br>problem with that is that wind is<br>absolutely fantastic except that every<br>soften there's three weeks where there's<br>almost literally no wind across fairly<br>large areas and so your system has to be<br>able to deal with all of that and the<br>good news is there's a bunch of<br>technologies which are already at scale<br>and they're growing at double-digit<br>rates to deal with this and this is<br>the zero-carbon ones of course there's<br>gas peakers and you could then have gas<br>with ccs but gas pkers with ccs will be<br>very difficult to make economic these<br>are the zero carbon ones and you've got<br>demand response right at that very kind<br>of rapid changing end of things software<br>is going to dominate because bits are<br>always cheaper than kit whatever anybody<br>says oh I can do that with a battery if<br>you can do it with software it's cheaper<br>I guarantee you but you've got them<br>batteries electric vehicles pumped<br>storage of course in the New Zealand<br>context very important interconnectors<br>not so important and then biomass and<br>biogas which you can use for balancing<br>there's some cool new technologies<br>economics much less well proven solar<br>CSP where you can melt your assault and<br>and then it can carry you through the<br>night and those sorts of things but it's<br>all up at the short end I'm very<br>interested in smart heating and cooling<br>hot water is cheaper to store than<br>electricity in a battery and then<br>there's longer-term you're almost<br>certainly for the longer-term staff<br>talking about molecules storage of<br>molecules is going to be easier than<br>storing in a battery think about it if<br>you've got that three week wind lull how<br>do you store three weeks of electricity<br>storing electricity overnight two days<br>fine three weeks with a battery really<br>and seasonal definitely not you're not<br>going to get towards the sort of end of<br>summer charge up your battery and say ah<br>there you go I'm sorted for the winter<br>single cycle in what the per year<br>economics not very good so you're going<br>to talk molecules and digitization<br>unless it's digital you cannot manage<br>this system will not happen because<br>everything is moving all over the place<br>and you're having to balance it and also<br>you're having to get value out of your<br>assets you're now an asset intensive<br>system instead of a fuel intensive<br>system and to get the best value out of<br>your assets you'll need to manage them<br>with digital and luckily digital is your<br>friend because the world that we are in<br>and going even deeper into is one where<br>chips and<br>we'll be ubiquitous not one thermostat<br>per house but per room and moisture<br>sensors and air quality and all sorts<br>ubiquitous communications everything is<br>going to be connected 5g or various mesh<br>technologies and Bluetooth and ZigBee<br>and goodness knows what processing and<br>storage you can process things in a ena<br>device or you can process it in the<br>cloud you'll have plenty of options<br>machine learning used to be for big<br>companies and big problems and now you<br>can have machine learning in your<br>thermostat especially if it starts<br>communicating with the cloud so it can<br>send it up to the cloud learn something<br>and then be managed at the very low<br>level and that's becoming very cheap and<br>affordable and then blockchain and<br>distributed Ledger's transactions<br>pervade the system so you won't have<br>just one meter per block of flats or one<br>meter per office building as we still<br>have in much of the world you will have<br>essentially the ability for a light bulb<br>to buy some electricity from a solar<br>panel because the transaction capability<br>will be ubiquitously integrated into the<br>control of every device and if you think<br>wow that sounds kind of you know crazed<br>and futuristic there's a picture of<br>Pluto in 1994 20 years later this is a<br>picture of Pluto that digital stuff goes<br>really really fast<br>I think it's artificial colorings and<br>maybe it will wait a few more years and<br>we'll get real color so batteries that<br>was that why digital wins up there but<br>battery is also very important on this<br>system and we're only at the very<br>beginning of the battery journey by the<br>way there's no shortage of lithium<br>there's no shortage of all the stuff<br>that you read you know over clicking in<br>that sort of the people who hate it sort<br>of click world no batteries can grow<br>like this there are no obvious reasons<br>why not but here's an<br>interesting thing that's where the<br>batteries will be some will be connected<br>to the grid the purple I think - down<br>from the top but most of them will be in<br>vehicles why because the battery in the<br>vehicle offers this thing that's really<br>valuable which is clean mobility and the<br>grid services whereas if you stick it<br>stationary it only provides the grid<br>services so clearly that's more valuable<br>than that so we're talking about the 1/3<br>of vehicles being electric you're<br>getting the idea that I kind of like<br>experience curves prices on electric<br>cars will continue to drop until they're<br>within the reach of the average family<br>the washington post's not very<br>controversial statement the only problem<br>with this statement is it was a little<br>bit premature hundred years or so<br>premature but it's now happening because<br>now we start to see the volumes of<br>electric vehicles going up very rapid<br>growth rates over seven eight years now<br>Asia 90% Europe 60% Americas fifty<br>percent you know buoyed by the Tesla<br>three launch but that growth is has<br>really started to move batteries down<br>the experience curve so we've seen those<br>two for solar and wind bat batteries<br>eighteen percent battery costs have gone<br>down by eighty percent plus since 2010<br>and they'll go down another 70 percent<br>by 2030 because the cumulative volume is<br>not being driven by little batteries in<br>your phone anymore<br>but by cars and larger installations<br>this is the economics of a car blue is<br>the boring bit purple is the drivetrain<br>blue is the battery that's an electric<br>car yellow is the internal combustion<br>equivalent what you can see is because<br>of the battery cost 2016 it was absurdly<br>more expensive and the only way you buy<br>one is if you got a rebate from the<br>what happens is sometime around 2024<br>maybe as early as 2022 for the<br>equivalent vehicle the sticker price<br>they become competitive and the<br>experience curve never sleeps which<br>means that once they cross over it keeps<br>going so you walk into a showroom in<br>twenty twenty two or twenty twenty four<br>and you look at the two vehicles and<br>they're the same cost and you think hang<br>on a second but that one accelerates<br>better off the lights I can smoke my<br>neighbors right and that one has got a<br>better entertainment system and that<br>one's smoother and that one I don't have<br>to go to those fabulous Z energy petrol<br>stations which I enjoy going to because<br>did you know that the coffee's really<br>good and the buns and everything except<br>that apparently and I carry me does my<br>head in<br>a parry there are some people that would<br>rather lie in in the morning then go to<br>a petrol state I'm into Z but I just<br>don't get it okay I me but but that's<br>where we're going it was very obvious<br>what which car at that point you'll buy<br>by the way it'll be cheaper to fuel<br>because electricity is cheaper than<br>petrol and diesel and it'll be cheaper<br>to maintain because it only has<br>seventeen moving parts in the drivetrain<br>so it's a no brainer at that point and<br>we'll see you know the batteries will be<br>available etc we'll see the volumes<br>really taking off now where we are at<br>the moment is actually because the fuel<br>cost is lower and the maintenance cost<br>is lower on a total cost of ownership<br>basis you've already had that cross over<br>for many use cases if you drive 40 miles<br>a day every day and that's all you worry<br>about you don't worry about the longer<br>journeys or any of that other stuff then<br>you should be electric today without<br>subsidies but most people don't do<br>spreadsheet calculations they just look<br>at the sticker price when they go into<br>the show that'll be twenty twenty to<br>twenty twenty six models model<br>availability in 2008 there was one model<br>of electric car event though this crazy<br>guy who put loads and loads of phone<br>batteries into a car 2010 11<br>ok you get the idea by 2022 there will<br>be over 300 models of electric car and<br>up the left you can see small vans<br>roundabouts hatchback sedan sports cars<br>SUVs and trucks so right now there are<br>people like me can't find the right<br>model of car I've got three kids and<br>again there's a granny and a nanny and I<br>live at the top of the hill for part of<br>the year and it's icy<br>I need a seven-seater four-wheel drive<br>SUV and I can't get one but I will be<br>able to and so as soon as I can I'm<br>going electric done air quality who's<br>got really good eyes can you see what<br>these are they're cars they're Fulks<br>wagons in the desert that's why the<br>title is diesel gate and it's not just<br>European cities that have air quality<br>problems you have them here as well and<br>that's a big driver and that's a big<br>driver for immediate decisions that<br>mayor's can make and councils can make<br>and there's this move to banning<br>internal combustion vehicles what are<br>you going to replace them with<br>personally I'm waiting for one of these<br>as well<br>I just think the sort of dual use you<br>know not only is an electric car and I'm<br>sort of saving the world you know plot<br>from climate change but it's also<br>sucking up all the particulates so this<br>is Bloomberg New Energy Finance it's the<br>team I trained this is their forecast in<br>grey you can see internal combustion<br>vehicles in blue you can see the<br>electric pure electric and in purple<br>battery sort of pure blue is pure<br>electric battery electric and in purple<br>is the hybrids and one thing that's very<br>interesting we are already at peak sales<br>of internal combustion cars already<br>right that's not figured into the<br>strategic plans of a lot of oil and gas<br>companies or oil companies so we're<br>already at the peak and then you can see<br>the blue section takes out all of the<br>growth and the yellow line on the right<br>because that's the fleet takes a few<br>more<br>so you get to about 55% of new cars<br>being sold that will be electric by 2040<br>but the fleet will be one-third so<br>that's the second third of the three<br>third world but it's not just cars two<br>wheelers OPEC keeps meeting to talk<br>about reducing the supply of oil because<br>they want the price to be higher right<br>and they meet and there's all these<br>acres of newsprint and all this news<br>coverage and websites and whatever they<br>talk about trying to get a million<br>barrels a day out of the supply side<br>these two wheelers have taken a million<br>nearly a million 800,000 barrels of oil<br>per day out of the demand side already<br>with no media coverage and of course the<br>other two wheeler which I know you're<br>all expecting to see up there these<br>things arrived in Wellington on the<br>exact same day as me it was auspicious<br>but it's not just two wheelers it's<br>buses I was very proud of us on the<br>board of Transport for London and we had<br>120 electric buses biggest fleet in<br>Europe Europe as a whole had 2,000<br>something other electric buses Shenzhen<br>China<br>16500 electric buses 400,000 electric<br>buses in China I thought I thought as a<br>type I thought somebody puts a couple of<br>zeros too many on No and why well<br>because it solves the core problem of<br>cities of air quality and the economics<br>work already<br>if you drive a bus hundred miles 120<br>miles a day then the electric the reduct<br>the reduced fuel costs get rid of all<br>that diesel petrol if there are petrol<br>but mainly diesel and of course the<br>maintenance cost being lower it already<br>makes sense these things<br>trucks small delivery vans bigger<br>delivery vans and even the Tesla semi or<br>the Mercedes equivalent the issue is not<br>distance for commercial vehicles it's<br>not weight it's not about heavy vehicles<br>it's about the distance they travel as<br>long as you're traveling a short<br>distance<br>a battery is a better solution than<br>anything else and then we'll see these<br>things also electric we already see them<br>a bit on the streets in London because<br>there's a huge amount of attention paid<br>to drones right to Amazon drones you<br>know doing drone delivery and you know I<br>joke I say well the first time an Amazon<br>drone flies over my house is the day I<br>buy a shotgun but I'm very happy for<br>these things to drive past my house<br>right I don't mind in Putin's past at 3<br>or 5 miles an hour if they painted a big<br>smiley face on it I'd be even happier<br>but people don't mind there is social<br>acceptance of these small delivery<br>robots so those will be coming to<br>streets a you know all over the world in<br>the next few years and then you get<br>these kind of utility vehicles the<br>garbage trucks very interesting not<br>because it's going to save the world<br>from climate change or anything but<br>because it's silent you don't get that<br>revving while it has to crush the<br>cardboard boxes and then these ones<br>they're going to go electric because the<br>talk of electric is very very<br>interesting and so you'll get a lot of<br>electric that will that will be<br>penetrating into those sorts of vehicles<br>and a conversation a few days ago out<br>somebody who is looking at doing<br>electric logging trucks because they<br>figure that the trees are on the<br>mountainside and you can sort of coast<br>down with regenerative braking and then<br>drive back up again never never never<br>have to put fuel in it<br>ships not every ship goes 5,000 miles<br>10,000 miles right nautical miles what<br>you've got is a coastal freighter at the<br>bottom you've got ferries we have a lot<br>of ferries in New Zealand so that's kind<br>of interesting and then you can do<br>electric things on ships those are<br>actually flatten the rotors they act<br>like sails and big ships are actually<br>just blew my mind when I've discovered<br>it quite recently big ships already<br>going hybrid that's something called an<br>Aussie pod so you put your big dirty<br>bunker fuel burning engine on the ship<br>but it's only connected to the<br>propellers by cables well once you've<br>gone hybrid that gives you options for<br>things like adding batteries and<br>starting to use the flexibility of<br>hybridization and then aircraft and if<br>I'm not happy with Amazon doing a drone<br>delivery over my house you wait until<br>it's a Goldman Sachs investment banker<br>in one of these things so they get a lot<br>of attention as urban air transportation<br>and I think that the way to think about<br>these things correctly is they're just<br>really really cheap helicopters<br>economically if you think about them as<br>cheap helicopters then you have a better<br>idea of where they'll go into the market<br>soonest<br>does anybody know anywhere where they<br>use a lot of helicopters I've just come<br>back from Queenstown these things<br>slightly longer distance the one at the<br>top actually is already being bought by<br>flying schools and then you get this<br>Norway has said that all internal<br>flights will be zero-carbon by 2040 that<br>chap there it's as-sunnah m-- and that<br>would be great for buzzing over between<br>Auckland and Wellington or Christchurch<br>and Wellington and so on because the<br>distance that that will do with a just<br>fully battery would enable it and those<br>are going to reach the market they're<br>going to actually sort of start popping<br>up in places in about 20 22 and in about<br>20 24 they'll figure out that they don't<br>actually know where to plug them in and<br>charge them and then that will all get<br>sorted out with investment obviously and<br>then this thing is really interesting<br>this is a hybrid and obviously of a much<br>bigger aircraft you're not<br>go fully electric but you will go hybrid<br>so it'll still burn jet fuel<br>maybe hydrogen why go hybrid because<br>putting electric motors across the wing<br>electric motors have got fantastic<br>torque so you can take off from shorter<br>runways they're quieter so you can take<br>off earlier and later li ER in the day<br>later in the evening and what you can do<br>with this thing is take off with all of<br>the electric motors and then shut most<br>of them down for cruise which is very<br>efficient so you'll save fuel shorter<br>runways more operating hours more<br>efficient obviously not been built yet<br>but all of the major manufacturers are<br>playing around with these sorts of<br>designs hybrid and of course in a part<br>of it it you can put a battery in and<br>you could you could maybe do short hops<br>with renewable energy generated from New<br>Zealand wind or whatever but but<br>fundamentally you'll be using jet fuel<br>still so isn't it all going to hydrogen<br>shouldn't we be - no this is all it's<br>everything's going electric in this<br>world maybe not the aeroplane and maybe<br>a lot long-distance ships and very long<br>distance trucks but most of it's going<br>electric isn't this all wrong well here<br>you've got drawn to scale battery<br>electric vehicle sales and fuel cell<br>vehicles and if I came back in ten years<br>time and showed this chart it would look<br>the same and the reason is that the<br>scale would have been crunched down by<br>you know an order of magnitude or two<br>but it would still fundamentally look<br>the same why won't hydrogen fuel cell<br>vehicles work apart from the fact that<br>they are much more complicated those<br>seventeen moving parts against hundreds<br>for the fuel cell so that the vehicle be<br>more expensive maintenance will be more<br>expensive because it's more complex also<br>because every workshop has to get<br>certified to work with hydrogen which is<br>actually quite expensive but mainly<br>because if you have electricity you want<br>to drive somewhere stick it in a car and<br>drive there and you've got about ten<br>percent losses your alternative is turn<br>it into hydrogen and have thermodynamic<br>losses and efficiency losses and then<br>turn it back from<br>hydrogen in the car into electricity and<br>had more losses why would you do that<br>hydrogen cars have a hold on the public<br>imagination which which mystifies me if<br>somebody knows why I think it's to do<br>with the 1970s and the shock that people<br>got by the southern thought that we<br>won't have oil and hydrogen was the<br>savior technology and it's very<br>difficult to relinquish your hold on the<br>on the Saviour technology of the day but<br>it's mystifying so now I just finish off<br>with a few thoughts on smart<br>transportation okay<br>well actually I've finish off the trend<br>that I've got a few get back to Paris<br>and so on so smart transportation<br>obviously most visible is the appearance<br>of these services right uber and lyft<br>actually there's still as many taxi<br>drivers in the u.s. they just don't earn<br>as much the other trend that people love<br>to talk about is driverless there's old<br>Barry being replaced by a card and it<br>looks funny but you know Barry's a job<br>Barry's got a family that he's looking<br>after and he's earning money for so<br>there's a very serious public policy<br>questions as well<br>the money is flowing into this is VC<br>money going into mobility as a service<br>connected and autonomous vehicle you can<br>see there it's around averaging now the<br>last sort of year and a half about seven<br>billion US dollars per quarter 30<br>billion dollars a year and the big<br>companies are getting into it too I'm<br>sure many of you know this automation<br>levels schematic right so you've got<br>level 5 the car doesn't have a steering<br>wheel you just jump in it and you say<br>take me to Grandma's level 4 you can do<br>that but only in certain places you<br>drive along the motorway and you say<br>right over to you car and I'm not going<br>to check email and that's fine or in<br>certain towns or certain areas of town<br>maybe the CBD you could do that level 3<br>is where the car takes that you know the<br>car can drive but you have to sort of<br>stay alert ready to pounce sort of<br>moment's notice in case the car does<br>something stupid like suddenly swerve<br>into oncoming traffic<br>and I think level three is essentially<br>another word for corporate manslaughter<br>because humans are really bad at staying<br>alert and then just waiting to take over<br>at over seconds notice and rescue their<br>their passengers from from it from a<br>potentially fatal situation we've seen<br>that so or even the big companies the<br>Daimler's the GM's the Volkswagens they<br>all level-3 and then all of them are<br>saying that they'll get up there level<br>five by 2025 and I think they're wrong I<br>think this is a much much harder<br>technological problem than they think<br>there was a huge amount of hype<br>everybody was terribly excited about<br>this and then you know Elon Musk was<br>going to drive a car across America no<br>driver by 2016 I think it was is now<br>2019 no sign of it happening and this<br>chap John krafchick is the CEO of Weimer<br>Weimer is the most advanced in this race<br>according to all the metrics of how<br>often way no cars you know require<br>interventions and so on and what he says<br>it'll be decades before autonomous cars<br>are widespread on the roads and even<br>then they won't be able to drive<br>themselves in certain conditions and my<br>warriors of those conditions will be not<br>things like when the road is in New<br>Zealand or when the road is in the UK<br>because it'll have rain and snow and<br>there's always something going on right<br>oh this is not California and neither is<br>the UK so there'll be this will be a lot<br>longer to reach the market than people<br>have been saying and I think you know if<br>you bet on 20 anything this side of 2030<br>I think would be very dubious it could<br>be even a lot longer there's also<br>problems with smart transportation that<br>society needs to deal with which is not<br>technological problems these are policy<br>problems behavioral problems you know<br>parking is being restricted parking<br>parking is a really stupid use of road<br>space you it's a you've got this big<br>assets it's there does nothing and it<br>obstructs everybody it's a road hazard<br>for kids and it means you can't have a<br>bus lane or a cycle lane or something<br>else you'd like to do with the space<br>sustainable Dre<br>roadside cafe parking his daft so<br>everybody says okay we're fine<br>we'll just ratchet down the amount of<br>parking and we'll invest in public<br>transport or these very clever<br>autonomous things that will come along<br>at some point but meanwhile the problem<br>is what happens when I said fine I'm not<br>going to park I'm just going to let my<br>car drive round and round and round you<br>know people with chauffeurs get to do<br>this now but what happens when every<br>rich person gets to do it or this when<br>you booked to go to the boxing at<br>Madison Square Garden you look like<br>boxing fans or the concert and when you<br>buy your ticket it says do you want<br>transportation go yeah one click that's<br>cool I like that feature on the website<br>and it sends all of these cars to the<br>same place at the same time and it<br>doesn't have an allocation algorithm<br>right because the cars are smart so they<br>all just turn up at the same time and if<br>you live near Madison Square Garden or<br>you're trying to run a business uh Denis<br>all these cars turn up within a few<br>minutes and then you can have this<br>algorithms which are collectively dumb<br>despite being individually smart because<br>algorithms are not gonna be different<br>from humans right humans are<br>collectively smart but they can also get<br>in stupid traffic jams and create<br>gridlock and we're going to see that and<br>so municipalities also have to step into<br>this and whether it's dynamic road<br>pricing dynamic curb pricing or<br>algorithms to allocate to say okay<br>you've all booked the same boxing match<br>but some of you are disabled so you get<br>to go and drop off nearby and some of<br>you look pretty fit and so you're gonna<br>have to just walk three blocks<br>who's going to police that Travis<br>kalanick founder and former CEO of uber<br>wien visiting the world where there's no<br>more traffic in Boston in five years<br>December 2015<br>that's 2019 how we doing be very careful<br>about promises that technology will save<br>congestion or all of these problems so I<br>want to speed up now because I'm<br>conscious of time but I want to just<br>touch on the last one of these the<br>economy being one-third more energy<br>productive that's actually not a<br>controversial thing at all because it's<br>really the trend that we've already seen<br>over the past few decades<br>you know the economy will grow will more<br>than double over the next hopefully over<br>the next 20 odd years final energy will<br>grow I use final energy in all of these<br>things primary energy if anybody if you<br>ever see anybody using primary energy<br>what they're trying to do is make<br>renewables look stupid primary energy<br>there is not a single question I've ever<br>come across which can be answered using<br>the metric of primary energy primary<br>energy goes up you don't know whether<br>it's a shift to coal or whether it's<br>economic growth or whether it's pouring<br>fishes you just doesn't tell you<br>anything final energy starts to tell you<br>about how your economy uses energy so<br>final energy will go up final energy per<br>GDP goes down by about a third and<br>that's a trend that we've seen it's not<br>controversial there is however a pretty<br>cool innovation around energy efficiency<br>and you see these sorts of things<br>you've got we've talked to our<br>digitization at the top right you've got<br>solar thermal integrated with solar<br>photovoltaics then you've got these like<br>climbing on which can take waste heat at<br>quite low temperatures and generate<br>extra electricity from it so you you can<br>recover heat usefully you've got in the<br>middle layer you've got a fuel cell<br>micro CHP fuel cell I've got one of<br>those in my homes beautiful works 24/7<br>one-and-a-half kilowatts fantastic don't<br>ask how much it cost and then on the<br>bottom left you've got thermal batteries<br>phase change or molten salts or there's<br>just different ways of doing that that's<br>not what it looks like by the way that's<br>a schematic for a for a thermal battery<br>in case anybody gets disappointed by one<br>and doesn't look like I sort of like<br>that so there's an enormous amount of<br>innovation around heat and efficiency<br>and I think this is another new frontier<br>for innovation and maybe that's<br>something that some people in the Energy<br>Department would be or in the the energy<br>what's the energy<br>in center might be thinking about I like<br>this this was energy innovation New<br>Zealand style we saw this over the<br>weekend you fill it with kerosene it's<br>really cool snus cool so there we are<br>with the three third world and what the<br>three third world will do it's far<br>beyond what we expected 15 years ago and<br>when I start a new energy finance it<br>will stop the growth in emissions it's<br>enough to cap emissions growth the<br>problem is that emissions growth<br>emissions accumulate in the atmosphere<br>so just not growing the emissions<br>doesn't mean they don't grow in the<br>atmosphere and so it's absolutely not<br>enough it's absolutely not enough what<br>Paris says is that we have to eliminate<br>emissions in the second half of the<br>century if you eliminate them by 2050<br>then we have a chance of being at one<br>and a half degrees if you eliminate them<br>by 2100 we'll see something around two<br>degrees and there's new answers around<br>capture and you know negative net<br>negative and so on but broadly speaking<br>that's how I see it and we know from the<br>IPCC report in October last year that if<br>you really want one and a half degrees<br>you have to get by 2030 to 45% emissions<br>reductions 2030 now what we've seen is<br>that things change pretty fast go back<br>to the beginning we saw in six years<br>this growth in clean energy to the point<br>where it broke even and we've seen this<br>six years you can do a lot six years the<br>Norwegians went from almost no electric<br>cars to half for their cars 6 years LEDs<br>went from almost nothing to 40 45% in<br>six years the UK went from forty percent<br>coal to now two percent cold the Germans<br>are absolutely mystified they don't know<br>how we did it which opens a secret we<br>left the nuclear running<br>but six or seven years you can do stuff<br>but you've only got between now and 2030<br>two of those kind of decision cycles so<br>the mic balances of the world they get<br>to do some stuff and see if it works and<br>then they get another go at it and then<br>we're in 2030 and we have to have 45%<br>reduction for one and a half degrees 20%<br>reduction for two degrees that's the<br>challenge and I as I talk to audiences<br>around the world and they say oh you<br>know well we got 2050 2050 is easy right<br>2050 no forget 2050 think 2030 think<br>about those two cycles that you've got<br>you get to launch a business grow it if<br>it doesn't work you've got one more<br>chance think of it like that<br>2030 you better start tomorrow if<br>they're only investors in the audience<br>if you think about what do you need to<br>own in 2030 that has 20 to 45 percent<br>lower emissions figure out what you want<br>to own and then start work Monday<br>morning right because don't leave it to<br>2029 when everybody else is already<br>running for the exits you need to be<br>starting Monday morning so I use this<br>concept of 2030 in business cycles to<br>try to get some sense of urgency into<br>audiences not like this one who may not<br>yet be feeling it and if you want to get<br>to 20 percent 45 percent reductions in<br>emissions and on to zero emissions you<br>won't do it just from what we've covered<br>in the three third-world electricity V's<br>bit of energy efficiency we've got to<br>accelerate all of that you'd want to go<br>faster than the three third-world you<br>know you can get to the 40% 40% 40% and<br>that'd be great but you've got to get<br>into these difficult things you've got<br>to get into shipping and freight and air<br>travel and manufacturing and chemicals<br>and agriculture and heat and if you look<br>at it in the New Zealand context some of<br>these are existentially important to do<br>and to start now to lead for us to do it<br>yourselves and also to lead the world<br>air travel what does New Zealand's<br>economy look like in a world where<br>air travel has to go zero-carbon maybe<br>it can be done with hydrogen but what<br>happens if it's really expensive what<br>does that do to New Zealand's economy<br>there might be something you want to<br>work on sooner rather than later<br>agriculture<br>similarly existential is you're too big<br>economy big sectors tourism and<br>agriculture and finally as you do all of<br>that it's got to be a just transition<br>and by that I mean you've got to do all<br>this stuff most of it can be done<br>without pushing up costs because the<br>economic drivers are so powerful that<br>some of it will drop that drive up costs<br>and it mustn't drive up costs for the<br>most vulnerable in our society and<br>you've got to do this at the same time<br>there's still 900 million people without<br>electricity it's the lowest number in<br>the history of the planet of people<br>without electricity well since we since<br>we had 900 million witches which is many<br>hundreds of years ago in fact that may<br>possibly I don't want to guess there but<br>we've had many billions without<br>electricity and it's now come down all<br>the way to 900 million which is great<br>but they've all got to have access to<br>modern energy services and there's 2 and<br>1/2 billion that still cook at great<br>cost to their health and their family<br>health using wood and charcoal and even<br>dung and we've got to sort that out at<br>the same time as dealing with all of the<br>above and I know we can do it thank you<br>um you talked about the cost of wind and<br>solar that's what that is is say yes a<br>levelized cost which looks at the<br>lifetime of the asset so that would be<br>generally 20 years for wind 25 years for<br>solar and then it it but it also covers<br>the cost of capital so that's what an<br>investor would need if you've got one<br>price for that whole period what would<br>that price need to be in order not just<br>to pay for the capital cost and the<br>maintenance and so on but also to cover<br>the cost of equity and the cost of debt<br>at the sort of debt equity ratios that<br>we know you're able to achieve and by<br>the way you know that what you can then<br>do is you can reap our project and so on<br>and it doesn't get into all of that<br>stuff it just says right 25 years we<br>dismantle we're done I I don't know<br>enough but I doubt it because one of the<br>first you've got a transmission grid and<br>then when you say got many companies<br>those would be distribution companies<br>and what you will need to do is to<br>balance more at the distribution company<br>level so the old model was you had lots<br>of big generators connected to the<br>transmission grid and then it was kind<br>of one-way traffic out to the edge and<br>now of course you've got stuff hanging<br>on the edge whether it's rubes personal<br>you know individual homes but it<br>we also box retailers and and so on and<br>then you've also got a lot of your you<br>know wind and biggest solar farms<br>connected to the distribution grids what<br>you need to do then is first of all run<br>each grid as a market balancing as much<br>as possible locally so it doesn't go off<br>to the transmission grid and back but<br>then buying an imbalancing via the<br>transmission grid and the good news is<br>that as I said with digitization you can<br>do that just better and better and<br>better so if you do have one grid that's<br>got lots of Pumped hydro let's say and<br>another one that's got wind you've got a<br>good transmission grid and you've got<br>great engineers and so you really should<br>be able to solve that without having to<br>sort of do anything very heavy-handed<br>and you know institutionally blunt like<br>reen a tional izing at all well that's a<br>really interesting question thank you<br>about what do you do with depleted<br>batteries and how fast do they degrade a<br>song and I started out being very<br>skeptical about vehicle-to-grid because<br>what happens is you saw that the<br>batteries were really really expensive<br>you know you'd have that was that chart<br>that I showed with the green battery bit<br>that was probably a Nissan Leaf and it<br>was sort of $45,000 of battery or<br>something you know and it only had 500<br>cycles and so you just do the division<br>and you think wow that's you know of<br>somebody to do the maths now but I think<br>it's like $90 per cycle you know very<br>very expensive and 100 but you can you<br>know you can use it to support the grid<br>and you can earn all maybe a dollar a<br>night but you're doing $90 or $40 or $10<br>you know as it comes down of damage and<br>so I thought this is all rubbish<br>and then you say okay well maybe what<br>you do is when the battery is you know<br>is dumb and starts not performing<br>there'll be a second life market because<br>that's the other business model that<br>people postulate and they say well<br>you're going to connected to the green I<br>thought you know what it just doesn't<br>sound very plausible you know when<br>server farms<br>came along we wanted to have servers<br>serving all of this content on the<br>internet nobody went round and bought<br>all the used PCs to say I'm in a server<br>farm business I've got some old you know<br>three eighty Sixers in a bunch of four<br>eighty Sixers and and I and I got really<br>clever so know what we did was we built<br>tailor-made pcs for and we'll do the<br>same if we want to hang on things onto<br>the grid there'll be tailor-made<br>batteries for the grid so that was kind<br>of my what that was kind of liebreich<br>1.0 thinking about those two models is<br>you know you'll keep the batteries and<br>you'll either replace the battery<br>halfway through the life of the car or<br>probably you'll sell the car which in<br>most countries what would happen is is a<br>car from germany would get sold to<br>Poland and from Poland it would go off<br>to you know Moldova or whatever but of<br>course you've got you've got a slight<br>problem with your cars to be coming from<br>Japan but that is what I thought now<br>what we're seeing though is battery<br>technology in terms of you know<br>breakthroughs that make energy density<br>so you know that so high that you can<br>you know use them in aircraft and so on<br>that's not where innovation is you know<br>we'll we'll kind of get solid-state<br>batteries in five or ten years and and<br>and whatever but where we are going with<br>batteries is that their lifetime is<br>becoming longer and longer the number of<br>cycles so although you may only have you<br>may only have a thousand cycles for a<br>vehicle battery there's 10,000 cycles<br>for essentially the equivalent battery<br>in the home so your your power your<br>power wall or zonin the equivalent they<br>say 10,000 cycles and then you start<br>thinking what I'm saying supposing<br>technology keeps going and there's no<br>reason why it shouldn't in fact there's<br>every reason to believe it well suppose<br>when we get to 10,000 cycles of vehicle<br>battery for 200 mile battery and you get<br>10,000 cycles that's a two million mile<br>battery that battery is going to way<br>outlast what the car can do so then you<br>start saying and you know there's<br>another data point which is the big<br>amount of data at the largest data set<br>that we've got is Tesla's where you've<br>got 90 percent battery life after 250<br>thousand kilometers so we're not yet at<br>a 2 million mile battery but<br>implausible to think within a few years<br>that battery new batteries and cars can<br>expect to be three hundred thousand four<br>hundred thousand five hundred thousand<br>kilometers or even even into the<br>millions and then you start asking well<br>why wouldn't you do vehicle-to-grid<br>and why wouldn't you at the end of that<br>cars life when the doors fall off and<br>the I was going to say the exhaust pipe<br>falls off and of course there isn't one<br>but you know when that car becomes you<br>know unusable for whatever you know or<br>you know one thing is maybe we just<br>start make cars that last longer because<br>they didn't need to up till now because<br>the engine didn't last that long you<br>know so I don't know the answer to what<br>happens but I know it's going to get<br>really really economically interesting<br>and none of it is in these models you<br>know that the the idea of having<br>vehicle-to-grid becoming essentially<br>free after a few hundred thousand<br>kilometers really interesting and and I<br>don't think anybody is putting that into<br>any of these models so on this my my my<br>guide my guru on on this is rag-and-bone<br>man who says I'm only human if you know<br>the song because you know I really try<br>but unfortunately you know I have a<br>lifestyle where I travel around the<br>world and I have to fly so in Milan what<br>I've done is in my home in London I have<br>to place I've got a home in a holiday<br>home in Switzerland in London I've done<br>a very deep carbon retrofit and I've<br>implemented a dozen innovative<br>technologies phase change materials that<br>fuel cell very efficient appliances<br>insulation passive ventilation in the<br>chimneys and so on and so it was able to<br>reduce the carbon footprint of that home<br>by sixty or seventy percent and it's an<br>eight it's an 1860<br>home so I could not get it to zero but I<br>did what I could and then also looked at<br>innovative ways to meet that so I've<br>also got solar on the roof I've got a<br>heat I've got a heat pump I kind of got<br>one of everything and and I think the<br>big impact of that is is actually you<br>know it was actually it was I mean it<br>was written up in the FT if you want<br>more information I can point you at it<br>but it was also I think the big value<br>for me at least was the learning because<br>I can go around I know I've got the scar<br>tissue associated with that so I can<br>tell policy makers a lot I can be much<br>incredible talking to policy makers<br>about what to do I don't have a car in<br>London that's terribly virtuous and our<br>utilities are green green gas green<br>they're screen that okay cool<br>Switzerland very interesting Swiss<br>buildings are so well insulated my<br>chalet that the snow melts on the ground<br>before it melts on the roof it's a very<br>good insulation amazing and I've got the<br>heating is pellets wood pellets and<br>solar thermal and the electricity is all<br>green<br>unfortunately it's at the top of the<br>hill and it gets snow and I have three<br>kids in a granny and a nanny often it's<br>you know so I need a seven seat SUV and<br>I've got petrol 4.4 liter petrol Volvo<br>xc90 and my next car will be electric<br>because I believe that stuff about the<br>models and so my big you know what do i<br>do that's evil then in in dietary terms<br>I'm way the hell off red meat or you<br>know and I you know I apologize to a<br>nation that has built its wealth on<br>sheep and and cows but I am almost off<br>beef not entirely I do like a little bit<br>of lamb especially here where it's<br>fantastic but I've also been doing a lot<br>more sort of experimentation and in fact<br>I was in California and I tried the<br>impossible burger which my kids declared<br>tastier than a beef burger and they<br>weren't wrong so I think beyond me all<br>of that stuff is actually it's a thing<br>and I think by the way it's a thing<br>that's going to an impact on New<br>Zealand's economy so my evil things are<br>basically my car which is going and<br>flights<br>vastly my flight footprint and most of<br>it is associated with you know doing<br>this and I hope and it'll be up to you I<br>hope that there'll be an offset in the<br>sense that some of you will go out and<br>say well you know we can you know<br>accelerate we can lean into the<br>transitions that are being discussed<br>here in New Zealand and then I can feel<br>not sort of horribly bad about having<br>flown down here twenty eight hours from<br>London I don't I don't offset my flights<br>and I I think long and hard about it<br>it's not a there's a first of all I<br>don't think there's a wrong answer on<br>these for anybody who's thinking about<br>it that's good that's the first thing to<br>say I don't offset my flights because I<br>can't work out why I should given that<br>you know if you look at that that that<br>investment trend the green bars right at<br>the beginning has been about must be now<br>nearly three trillion dollars invested<br>in clean energy and a guarantee that<br>half of it was done by Ben F clients and<br>I think my impact if you take I'm a I'm<br>a thermodynamics guy right so what is<br>the boundary of the system of Michael<br>liebreich that you're trying to offset<br>why only his flights why not his whole<br>life and if you take his whole life that<br>means then then I think you'll be okay<br>with the impact that I've had on<br>accelerating investments in wind and in<br>solar and energy efficiency etc etc so<br>the selection of my flights you know<br>saying well not only do you have to be a<br>good person overall but you actually you<br>got to break it down every single thing<br>you do has to be good<br>I just can't follow the logic of that I<br>know other people can but they've not<br>been able to persuade me so I'm trying<br>to be a good person and by the way I<br>plant my plant trees and one thing I've<br>said is before I you know shuffle this<br>multiple call I'd like to plant a<br>million trees so that will probably deal<br>with all of that as long as I you know<br>live long enough to actually do it which<br>I hope - can I just ask for one side but<br>there are the gender mix here is<br>fabulous but guys tend to ask questions<br>more than women so can we try and get<br>balance I don't know if we I don't know<br>who was next up but I'd like to do that<br>just to send a message about inclusion<br>sorry sir for the greater good<br>I'm coming to come last meal question<br>afterwards come on there must be some<br>come on there must be a it come on if<br>not we'll go back to the gentleman but<br>there must be something there must be a<br>woman here that wants to ask something<br>the reason I do that by the way is I<br>wrote a piece a few years ago it's<br>really resonated with a lot of people<br>and I said that you know we're doing<br>this um these extraordinary transitions<br>at the time people had just woken up in<br>the mainstream yes there is an energy<br>transition there's a transport<br>transition and the point I made was that<br>the leadership of the energy and<br>transportation sectors which was<br>essentially guys who looked like me<br>there is no way at the end of those<br>transitions if we want to do those<br>transitions efficiently and effectively<br>and with justice there's no way the<br>leadership will look the same afterwards<br>as it did before and it resonated a lot<br>of people like hey thanks for saying<br>that so I now take the opportunity to<br>make that point in public forums<br>whenever I get a voice right you got the<br>microphone that was me just winning just<br>right I get you a bit of time that good<br>thank you<br>okay so there's it's and that's a great<br>point that you know cooling when people<br>say oh there's this sort of more and<br>more cooling you sort of say well you<br>know that can't be that big of a problem<br>because mainly cooling happens in places<br>where it's sunny and you know yes it<br>could be hazy so it's like okay just<br>build more solar it's not that big of a<br>deal because it's so cheap but but but<br>cooling sorry heating is a different<br>thing because heating happens when there<br>isn't Sun and it's much more complex the<br>changes in that as a result of climate<br>change are for the next few decades you<br>know with all respect<br>the gravity of a climate challenge which<br>I don't discount they all have a<br>second-order relative to the fact that<br>the middle classes in the developing<br>world all want air conditioning they<br>want air conditioning today they want it<br>more as climate change progresses but<br>that's an additional effect that<br>second-order relative to the first order<br>of fact which is they want air<br>conditioning now but you raise a really<br>interesting point about there's two<br>interesting things I'd like to comment<br>on if I have time one is when I say well<br>you know if it's hazy just built more<br>solar we haven't talked about<br>curtailment and a lot of people say oh<br>you know this stuff because it's<br>variable not only is it the wind doesn't<br>blow all the time and the Sun doesn't<br>shine at night and so that's a huge<br>problem but then they say okay well<br>there's this other problem which is<br>sometimes there's too much of it and we<br>must use it because our parents told us<br>never to leave anything on the plate so<br>if there is extra wind we must build an<br>electrolyzer and we must make hydrogen<br>or electrons as a capital intensive you<br>need compressors you need to store the<br>thing you need to invest a load of stuff<br>the idea that you would then use it only<br>when there's a big puff of wind or on a<br>really really sunny day I think is<br>fanciful so we're gonna get curtailment<br>Oh terrible curtailment but actually<br>think about this supposing you've got to<br>sent wind or to sent solar and supposing<br>you had a vast level of curtailment more<br>than any system has ever experienced so<br>far 33 percent right one-third<br>curtailment that means one-third of the<br>output is wasted all that does is turn<br>that to sent wind to sent solar into<br>three sent wind or three sent solar it's<br>still half the price of anything else so<br>just you know obviously try and deal<br>with curtailment try and store it do<br>something sell it to a neighbor but it's<br>not the end of the world and the other<br>the final thing about energy modeling<br>all these models that go out to 2050 and<br>Beyond and so on they're all they all<br>become nonsensical including you know<br>the ones that say oh it's going to be<br>this percent of this percent of GDP and<br>and you know the the RCP 8.5 how much<br>carbon is gonna because things get so<br>unpredictable you know you cannot<br>predict that they will be continuing<br>emissions from power stations that will<br>be under<br>water and we have no idea frankly how<br>our economy works we know that because<br>what happened in 2008 and so all these<br>people who can say well there's going to<br>be 5.6 percent of GDP absorbed by this<br>that or the other no we we just deal<br>with this issue then we don't have power<br>stations under water and we don't have<br>economic losses and we don't have<br>justice issues so we just deal with it
