you cherish I remember hard work<br>I was probably one of the only students<br>at like 8 o'clock lectures because I<br>didn't had to scurry off to my job I I<br>enjoyed my time at Law School I left<br>halfway through because I decided that I<br>didn't want to do law and I got a really<br>good job in a public relations firm<br>doing financial PR and I got really<br>tired after a year of saying to clients<br>to earn my credibility I have three<br>quarters of a law degree I thought to<br>myself one day how many years are you<br>going to say that and decided I'd better<br>go back and finish my final year I've<br>got AIDS or a-pluses and all of those<br>last papers I ended up with a senior law<br>prize which I found really ironic I<br>didn't want to do law so you sound like<br>a model student I wish we had more<br>students like you today not sure about<br>there I didn't we start off with ice I'm<br>pretty sure I found it in fact I know I<br>failed a couple of papers too I heard<br>Claudia batten speak a few years ago and<br>I loved her description that she was<br>asked wiggler and asked wiggler<br>describes the squiggly line of some<br>people's careers and I'm definitely<br>asked wiggler and I actually think that<br>very few people fall into doing what<br>they love first off and I think that we<br>need to encourage more squiggling and I<br>think that's a good universities job as<br>well because the more that we squiggle<br>the more experiences that we gather I<br>think the more rounder it makes us and<br>hopefully the more it means that we're<br>more likely to do the work we love and<br>ultimately I think that's the most<br>I want to talk about the northern Club a<br>little bit a very old club they call it<br>the male Bastion<br>the first female member was admitted in<br>1990 what changed the committee at the<br>time recognized that they needed to stay<br>relevant and there were members who were<br>saying that they were going to have to<br>resign their membership because their<br>female peers were unable to enjoy the<br>membership of the club or even come into<br>the club so if they wanted to have lunch<br>with the partners you know there was an<br>awkwardness for the woman feel women<br>feeling that they were excluded so the<br>club recognized that they needed to stay<br>relevant and to quote the words of one<br>of the committee then the club needed to<br>stand tall again and so they made the<br>decision we had a governor-general<br>designate at the time who was a woman<br>there were lots that there was a couple<br>of women who were QCs there were lots of<br>more women partners than we'd seen for a<br>while we had some more women on boards<br>the 1990s were a period of change and<br>thankfully the northern Club recognized<br>that and made the changes to their<br>constitution so that was leadership yes<br>yes and you still only have I think<br>about 15% a little less than that 13<br>isn't<br>I'm fascinated at why despite endless<br>encouraging so many women aren't joining<br>clubs or the northern Club in particular<br>and I realized that men tend to have the<br>habit of joining a club they joined the<br>Cricket Club the Rugby Club the Tennis<br>Club and all the squash club and women<br>at least practiced at that I think<br>that's changing with things like gym<br>memberships but back when I joined the<br>club in 1997 it wasn't something that a<br>lot of women did and so I think we need<br>to encourage that a little more<br>and and I think too we have to show<br>women why white matters and what their<br>benefits that they will get from it<br>because belonging to a club like the<br>northern Club has got so many benefits<br>we know that New Zealand was one of the<br>first nations really where women had the<br>power to vote how are we doing today<br>on the world stage can we learn from<br>other countries can we teach other<br>countries can we lead yes it's wonderful<br>that New Zealand was so courageous back<br>125 years ago to give women the vote<br>have we continued that great progress<br>I'm not so sure when I see discussions<br>around whether there are enough women at<br>the table and when I hear people<br>dismissing the suggestion of quotas<br>I used to disagree with quotas but I'm<br>now forming a view that the change is<br>taking so long that perhaps we do need<br>to force the change and if we are<br>serious about having as many women in<br>roles as we have men then perhaps a<br>quotas the only way of doing it because<br>giving people the choice to do that<br>hasn't worked I feel very strongly that<br>if you want innovation then you have to<br>have women at the table and there's<br>loads of research by Boston Consulting<br>and McKinsey on what they call the<br>innovation contribution that having<br>women and a bit more diversity at the<br>board table bring and it's very<br>important that there's not just one<br>woman at the board table or in the<br>leadership teams and there's some really<br>interesting stats that are showing the<br>the difference that that women and<br>diversity quotient is making to the<br>profitability of those companies so what<br>is your advice for young women out there<br>I say to everybody<br>take every opportunity keep saying yes<br>because you don't know where it will</p></main><footer
