be 100% accurate.</p><p>you arrived here on the University of<br>Auckland campus half a century ago what<br>was it like back then much smaller<br>actually the old gothic building on<br>Francis Street was the main building<br>that's where the the library was that's<br>where the student canteen was and the<br>lecture theatres were the upper and<br>lower<br>and what was it like being on staff here<br>and at a time like you said when there<br>were very few women in the teaching<br>profession<br>well you didn't feel discriminated<br>against as a as a woman on the staff and<br>Bob Chapman you know appointed me other<br>guys and candidates but you didn't<br>notice that you were in quite a small<br>number and it's good to see now how much<br>that has changed that women are very<br>prominent and academic life but it<br>really needed that wave of post-war baby<br>boomers to come through - to break the<br>ground on that and you were quite<br>involved in politics the moment you<br>stepped onto campus and participated in<br>the princess Street branch of the Labour<br>Party which is quite famous and to<br>historical tombs at least can you talk<br>about that was that a place that was a<br>female friendly environment and where<br>women's issues and you know part of<br>their repertoire or was it more about<br>the foreign policy stuff that was going<br>on at the time in the late 60s the<br>foreign policy issues were the dominant<br>issues for students on the campus and so<br>there was the issue of whether I think<br>it was Mount John and the South Arvind<br>could be used as part of a series of<br>American listening cases there was of<br>course the Vietnam War there was the<br>anti-apartheid movement and there was<br>the movement against nuclear testing so<br>these were all things to mobilize around<br>and I got involved in those issues from<br>the time I came to the campus as a foot<br>soldier or someone who would turn up at<br>a protest somewhere and then in 1970 I<br>was<br>on the the committee for halt or racist<br>tours with trevor richards and and<br>others women were very involved in these<br>movements you you never felt that there<br>was any any issue about that because we<br>were in significant numbers on the<br>campus and we took our part and<br>when I went to Parliament at the end of<br>1981 the numbers had doubled from four<br>to eight it was still a pathetic number<br>it was clearly under ten percent of the<br>Parliament at 92 member Parliament at<br>the time and so you were just a tiny<br>minority and and not taken particularly<br>seriously to be frank very few women had<br>ever been ministers three actually<br>Mabel Howard who was the first and 9:47<br>Dame Hilda Ross<br>for the National Party she was a<br>Hamilton member and then feta terracotta<br>knee Sullivan was the Minister of<br>Tourism and the in the third labour<br>Labor government so it was very rare<br>dead woman ministers and when you went<br>into Parliament as a young woman MP<br>really your top aspiration was maybe one<br>day hope to become a minister and that<br>was a big hill to to climb so it wasn't<br>a welcoming environment at all the local<br>party caucus was very very tough<br>actually often very unpleasant if you<br>are on more progressive end of it you<br>came in for quite a lot of hard time<br>actually but you know I just sort of<br>knuckle down and fought my way through<br>it and I did think after I've been at it<br>you know close to six years that if I<br>couldn't crack through to become a<br>minister and that third term then there<br>might not be a lot of point in staying<br>around if there was just always going to<br>be a blockage but then in 1987 I did get<br>elected to the cabinet of the fourth<br>Labour government and I guess the rest<br>if you had you know a crystal ball<br>what would you say still needs to get<br>fixed and efforts possible in terms of<br>thinking about women's rights and<br>women's place and politics I think we're<br>now on a third stage of feminism I say<br>the first stage goes back to the battle<br>for the suffrage a battle fought you<br>know then successful in the in the 1890s<br>and then you had the second wave of<br>feminism which really came with the<br>post-war baby boomers who weren't going<br>to be constrained the way they saw so<br>often their mothers had had their career<br>aspirations constrained so you know<br>we're a generation that what a choice to<br>want to do things and I sometimes wonder<br>whether we made it look too easy for<br>following generations because really<br>after us the feminism kind of went into<br>a bit of a dive because people thought<br>the battle have been won well now it's<br>the third face because we're dealing<br>with the unfinished business now one bit<br>of unfinished business obviously is the<br>gender pay gap but it's smaller than it<br>was at ten percent it it could be close<br>particularly if men's life cycle<br>patterns become closer to those of women<br>and they take more responsibility for<br>children older parents relatives with<br>disabilities all the needs and the<br>broader family that that women still<br>disproportionately attend to globally<br>three-quarters of the world's unpaid<br>work is done by women speaks volumes<br>probably the same here but then there's<br>this really pernicious issue of the<br>domestic family sexual and gender-based<br>violence in New Zealand so it's said<br>that we are the worst in the OECD how on<br>earth can this be that our lovely<br>country can provide the worst<br>environment for violence in the home I<br>don't get just finally if you had one<br>piece of advice to give young women and<br>rolling in a politics or any other<br>degree now and they had aspirations for<br>political office what what piece of<br>advice would you give them I'd say go<br>for it<br>women must believe that they can do<br>those jobs and they can do them very<br>very<br>oh of course young women should think of<br>politics and the atmosphere in<br>Parliament is a very different<br>atmosphere from what when I went in<br>because there are so many women at close<br>to 40 percent we can see that with<br>goodwill from political parties in two<br>to three elections you could you could</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
