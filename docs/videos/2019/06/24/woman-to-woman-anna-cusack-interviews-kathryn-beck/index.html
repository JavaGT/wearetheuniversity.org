be 100% accurate.</p><p>thank you so much for coming laughing<br>joining us I know you've been a student<br>here and you also have done lectures<br>here too yeah thank you for having me<br>it's nice to be back what would you say<br>the big issues on campus were well it<br>was late 80s so we had Rainbow Warrior<br>and we had nuclear-free we all happened<br>at that time<br>yeah from a legal perspective we had the<br>challenge to the Springbok tour we had<br>Dame Silvia Kat writes inquiry so there<br>were some quite interesting stuff going<br>on in the 80s as a student do you feel<br>like woman has quite an active role to<br>play in the leadership of those courses<br>I probably remember my women lecturers<br>more than some of the men that taught me<br>back then I don't remember it being<br>disproportionate but when I think about<br>it it was they were less women than men<br>but but they were but they were some<br>very strong women leading some of the<br>legal curriculum how do you find moving<br>from that into the legal profession<br>that's always quite a big transition for<br>everybody and I think we underestimate<br>the level of transition that is required<br>and then something up there as president<br>of the Law Society I'm really aware of<br>and trying to work with our young lawyer<br>groups and and law students associations<br>to try and get a bit more connection<br>really on but personally I like nowadays<br>it was hard to find a job straight out<br>of law school but I was lucky enough to<br>do that how many woman computer been<br>wearing office there was all of the<br>lawyers one other woman who was a year<br>ahead of me were women and so it was<br>quite disproportionate we would have<br>been you know five ten percent of the<br>lawyers there and all of the partners<br>were men there was no senior woman there<br>at all how do you think things have<br>changed and how do you think that's<br>affecting leadership I think it's around<br>about 1993 that we started to have at<br>least 50 percent graduates being women<br>from our law school yeah and we've now<br>well over 60 percent and that's been<br>consistent for quite a few years now but<br>that still didn't show and practicing<br>certificates or lawyers and the<br>profession<br>until last year was the first time we<br>got to fifty percent women and treestand<br>yes took a long time we were close but<br>50 percent woman and now that's the<br>majority of women and the profession but<br>we're still not and we're still not them<br>a job we're not still not equal in terms<br>of leadership why do you think it's<br>taking so long for a woman to be equal<br>in leadership I think people thought it<br>would just be a matter of time that once<br>we got so that we had 50 percent plus<br>coming out of law school that a lot of a<br>lot of the barriers appeared to have<br>come down and that it would just be a<br>matter of time and what we've learned<br>over you know 20-something years is that<br>that just wasn't the case and so we are<br>seeing an improvement but what we know<br>now and we should have been acting<br>sooner is it's going to take really<br>concerted action to change some of those<br>things people don't consciously think I<br>want a man over a woman what they'll<br>often be thinking is I'm just gonna<br>choose the same thing I'm going to<br>choose what's worked before I'm going to<br>stick with what's comfortable and that<br>often means the status quo and of course<br>I see more women on leadership roles I<br>think we achieve a few things one as we<br>know we've got science that tells us<br>that having more diversity around a<br>decision-making table you you're going<br>to get a better range of decisions<br>you'll bring different perspectives<br>different thought processes different<br>experiences different skills so having<br>any form of diversity will help you make<br>better decisions we know that means<br>you're more productive you're more<br>profitable so there's a good business<br>case for diversity gender diversity and<br>other forms of diversity the other thing<br>about having women and leadership<br>positions is that really that role<br>modeling the visible pathway for people<br>the giving of hope to people showing<br>people that there it is that this is<br>something that they kept it as<br>I think the work that we're doing at the<br>Law Society now will make a difference<br>it has to make a difference I do<br>completely take on board that we needed<br>to be doing it so you know then we have<br>done we've been doing a lot of stuff for<br>a while but not enough but I I think<br>yeah I know actually that the work we're<br>doing now will make a difference and<br>there's a really bright light shining on<br>the legal profession at the moment and<br>it's not a like that we're very<br>comfortable with but most people are<br>taking it as an opportunity to actually<br>really make the changes that we know we<br>need to make to be a safe and respectful<br>but truly inclusive profession and so<br>what's the law society's role and that<br>how are they holding firms to account<br>how are things being reported so the Law<br>Society has sort of two roles one as<br>representative and that we we support<br>collegial activities and and support<br>ongoing education and professional<br>development and so that's one area that<br>we're working on and the other area as<br>you've sort of referred to as our<br>complaints and our regulatory side<br>whereby if somebody if there has been<br>bad behavior or unsatisfactory conduct<br>or misconduct then the Law Society is<br>the place where people come to in the<br>first instance and they raise those<br>concerns we investigate them and they<br>will take action on them we're also<br>undertaking quite a bit of culture<br>change work and so that because we<br>actually think we'd like to quite<br>prevent the behaviors that lead to<br>complaints happening in the first place<br>we're doing a lot of work and the<br>culture and systems change space and<br>helping law firms do that and more firms<br>are doing a lot of those things<br>themselves in terms of the complaints<br>area for example we've set up an 800<br>line what's called our law care line in<br>anyone in a legal workplace can ring<br>that number if they don't know what to<br>do they don't know whether behavior is<br>okay or not okay they don't know who to<br>talk to<br>they don't know what their options are<br>this is a number that they can ring they<br>can tell us the name or not up to them<br>and these people are specially trained<br>to help them understand what what is a<br>very<br>to them and help them make a decision<br>about what to do or not to do what<br>they've done to make sure it's safer for<br>interns and there's more protections in<br>place so from I mean in my view in terms<br>of safe as they've ever been and you<br>know and our law firms now and that's<br>because as I've said this really bright<br>light shining on our processes and on<br>our firms in terms of how they are<br>caring for these young people when they<br>come just on loan really from the<br>universities for a period of time law<br>firms are still quite hierarchical yeah<br>and of course they're partly bids and<br>some of these issues yes so if you're<br>sitting right down the bottom of the<br>pyramid it's hot and the problem is with<br>somebody's behavior at the top of that<br>that's doesn't matter what procedures<br>and policies you have in place raising<br>those issues is hard and so law firms in<br>the law society with them is looking at<br>what we can do to sort of break down<br>those hierarchies and and open up those<br>lines of communication between people<br>but also help help people understand<br>what it means to be part of a profession<br>both as new entrants to the profession<br>but also ones that have been around for<br>a long time you know we've signed<br>something every year that says we're<br>afoot and proper person that we're going<br>to conduct ourselves with the utmost<br>integrity and that means treating people<br>that work with you with respect and<br>courtesy and we need to as I say<br>recalibrate create a new normal do<br>things differently and we need to do<br>that not just because of the issues that<br>have arisen in the last few months we<br>need to do that because the future of<br>the law if we want to survive the future<br>of the profession cannot look like it<br>does now yeah it needs to look different<br>it needs to retain young talented<br>fabulous people we need to do things<br>differently we need to have flexible<br>work practices we need to be more<br>collaborative we need to have healthy<br>workplaces they need to be a place that<br>someone it comes to and feels valued and<br>respected and that should always be the<br>case but more so now given the future<br>that the legal profession as is looking<br>at if we don't get this right we won't<br>be sis<br>Anibal</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
