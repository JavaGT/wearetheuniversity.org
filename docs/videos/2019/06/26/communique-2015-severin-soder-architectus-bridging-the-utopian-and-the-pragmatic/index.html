community 2015 thank you for coming<br>tonight we are aware that there are a<br>series of things happening in Auckland<br>so thank you very much for being here<br>and so tonight we have a speaker say<br>special for me because we are friend we<br>have been friend for a long time<br>savoring so they're associated<br>architectures and he is of course quite<br>well known and architecture is also well<br>known but I'm sure also you will<br>introduce the practice a certain point<br>of your presentation but there is no<br>need apparently for the office here<br>which is good<br>we are happy anyway<br>what I was trying to say is that very<br>often in large practice those people who<br>are really the core of the practice are<br>often not on the front line so they see<br>the work they organize but we don't know<br>and also for you meaning so I think that<br>is good for me to have you here and to<br>introduce you and also your your<br>background so saving as being we<br>architecture since 2005 at least is yeah<br>ten years long time so after he is a<br>graduation from the University of<br>Innsbruck in Austria he completed a<br>postgraduate Master degree at the<br>Ballard school of architecture in London<br>the directional peter cooke I spent<br>eight years in a number of important<br>detectors architecture architectural<br>firm in Paris in London at som and later<br>also future system and then back in<br>Austria he was it also worked for bombs<br>lager a belly so severely enjoys working<br>across a variety of project types and<br>scale from house of the sitting and has<br>a particularly interesting<br>infrastructure as well as a multi-unit<br>residential office buildings for the<br>lecture tonight sibling has selected<br>some project from the archives of<br>architectures all of which share the<br>common trait of being unrealized and<br>only exist as drawings or digital and<br>physical models every one of this<br>project has been developed in response<br>to specific client context and budget so<br>it's pragmatic in the sense of being<br>realistic<br>however they have all remained<br>immaterial they are imagine imaged only<br>as the title of the presentation<br>suggester so please join me in welcoming<br>Thank You Paula welcome thanks for<br>coming<br>can you hear me okay breaching the top<br>and interpret Matic when I'm Paula gave<br>me the topic for the CSM lecture series<br>I thought well it's kind of what I have<br>done and the not-too-distant past<br>criss-crossing<br>utopia and in the pragmatics and I<br>thought as an introduction I'll just a<br>little bit about this journey it's a<br>picture taking a DI in the members room<br>the the exhibition opening young<br>kopetsky<br>drawings that was just a couple of<br>months ago and young completely founded<br>future systems in 79 together with David<br>Nixon in the exhibition accompany the<br>launch of a new book by Richard Rogers<br>and Anwar coleus called young kopetsky<br>drawings that celebrates yawns visionary<br>craftsmanship and his drawings young<br>built through his drawings he didn't<br>burn much but and what he built was<br>Mabel equally important as the drawings<br>but once the drawings were done and the<br>model was done he was happy as long as<br>the drawings were clear that the motor<br>was good that sort of wasn't he his his<br>to trademark drawings were is incredibly<br>detailed kara by sections in montages<br>that is I am unfold the platform<br>structure that he developed for NASA he<br>actually ended up getting a patent his<br>work so it's Yan Yan unfortunately<br>tragically passed away in two<br>9 in this orange door behind him was the<br>door to the future for me from 2000 to<br>2004 and that's I mean they were joined<br>future systems in 89 there were two<br>parts you know I always wanted to work<br>there ever since I picked this book up<br>on a trip to London in 93 by Martin<br>Pawley the table tells the story of<br>tomorrow and it's probably my favorite<br>page in the book Green Building with one<br>of those cut away sections the little<br>place this in model with the broken<br>pencils explaining the structure the<br>little sketch in that model and that<br>model was built by um it is all the<br>other models at future systems by a keen<br>shuttle booth brother he he had a motor<br>shop unit 22 and he handed the drawings<br>and any he would get donan who will do<br>the model for him and when I arrived<br>there unfortunately too late to get<br>involved in the Lord's media center to<br>Cricket Ground in London but just just<br>in time to work on one of the packages<br>for Selfridges department store blooming<br>ham part of the bullring development and<br>I thought I had seen the future you know<br>excited it is you're sort of a young age<br>you know and this is a pin from the<br>1940s Futurama exhibition electric spin<br>once that been through it you know they<br>had seen the future but then I am I<br>moved on from London to to Brigance to<br>Victoria where I'm originally from<br>these two guys are going deep Maya<br>Valley and these two they see the world<br>a bit different they are a bit more<br>pragmatic but nevertheless they are<br>getting a job after going through DM<br>future systems portfolio and and<br>Deepavali on the right there were none<br>he was recently interviewed for website<br>called was architecture and when he was<br>asked a question and he answered like<br>this architecture is to find the most<br>specific material solution with the most<br>general value in it what he means by<br>this that the most specific that refers<br>to climate history the site the culture<br>the construction technique the general<br>value that relates to a flexible<br>building that they can fulfill a<br>multitude of uses over its lifetime and<br>also what they call it on a socio<br>aesthetical approach to sustainability<br>meaning that a building is accepted or<br>even better loved by the users in the<br>process by so in in society if a<br>building is like people look after it<br>and it lasts for long time which is my<br>way more sustainability no you know<br>having a few photovoltaic panels on the<br>roof in the philosophy office there's to<br>design from the outside in so that the<br>facade is always developed first and<br>they're less interested about the<br>internal subdivision because the layout<br>is gonna change anyway so the focus is<br>on the exterior and also the facility<br>climatic interface with the environment<br>is you might have seen a testament that<br>philosophies is this building<br>22:26 their own office building as well<br>which keeps the climate inside the<br>temperature between 22 and 26 without<br>air-conditioning systems or they're like<br>in dinner<br>as came the big move from Austria to New<br>Zealand aiya did arrive at architectures<br>picked in Cincy in in Centre Street and<br>in architecture said Sam we operate<br>between order and opportunity is hectic<br>in Jackie Cooper diagnosed in in the<br>book an ice cube everyone's got a copy<br>the ones who made it so on we don't have<br>to talk too much about it but just just<br>briefly the the order refers to the<br>analytical and irrational and the<br>opportunity is the aspiration of the<br>intuitive you know it's a bit of both a<br>healthy balance and now I'm good I am a<br>series of unrealized projects that I am<br>the archive and you wouldn't want to<br>give such a talking and dying economic<br>times but luckily before good enough to<br>do so we can afford and you know go<br>through projects that you know remain<br>prototypes and didn't get built so on<br>the first one let's start on the<br>waterfront its and it's not about the<br>extension of the port at some its Queens<br>Wharf its controversial competition if<br>we entered together with our friend such<br>as Maxim<br>a few years ago so the brief was for a<br>major public space on Queens Wharf in in<br>the cruise ship terminal that could also<br>be a multifunctional building and the<br>diagram shows the park on the western<br>side in that and a piece of<br>infrastructure it can work as a cruise<br>ship but can also fulfill other<br>functions and is a building that you can<br>walk on incorporates a promenade so it's<br>it's the plane and in section you can<br>see the park the open space to<br>waste in the terminal but it's roof<br>raising up to the cruise ship<br>and we're coming it on the right hand<br>side and also elevating people above the<br>wharf and giving them different ways to<br>experience the harbor and a few pictures<br>of looking at walking wandering down<br>Queen Street with a few more to the left<br>and the big ramp that elevates the<br>people to so high level<br>walking out to the end of the wharf<br>bring it out in the distance in<br>Devonport the variant the tip of the<br>wolf was what sort of lift open-ended<br>fall for future projects to hit him<br>there were steps proposed where you<br>could go down and time you know get<br>close to the water and engage with a<br>very different way this is up on the on<br>the promenade liver were you elevated<br>and you get you get different views<br>inside the terminal under debt that<br>Pacific roof week we saw it as I am as a<br>longhouse to give it that identity and<br>there could be used for other purposes<br>as well see it here from Keith Street<br>rising up we're coming at all or<br>farewelling<br>the cruise ship passengers as a none of<br>you looking across from Princess Wolf<br>and yeah that's rendered some of you<br>might remember the picture from the air<br>at a couple it's a calendar it was<br>moving a further west about remaining on<br>the waterfront the hotel and the<br>waterfront there was a another<br>competition and unfortunately the winner<br>the winner didn't get to build it either<br>so if that's any consolation the site<br>was the site where T New Zealand<br>allocated by Corona Plaza and the idea<br>was the<br>the notion of a courtyard by the<br>waterway we were inspired by the<br>slipways and in the boatyard states of<br>enclosed space and in welcome arrivals<br>from the water and we also tried to mix<br>in lies the views to the harbor for all<br>the rooms because we thought if if you<br>were to stay on the waterfront<br>you know you'd like a room where you can<br>actually see that's looking from the<br>courtyard to the east and we had this<br>sky bar going across there you could<br>from the second row you could look<br>underneath instead of being thrown aback<br>and we we structured the building we<br>layered it the bottom layer the<br>ground-floor sort of hurry out of rock<br>and we've got a layer of timber timber<br>shutters to the roofs some planting in<br>game another layer at the top the sky<br>body relates to the sky in material and<br>including glasses this is a street where<br>you don't actually see into the room<br>sort of see and as a shot of the lobby a<br>mediating between the courtyard in the<br>sky and in a game of the waterfront<br>further west again a denim or in Hobson<br>well where the mahabhava crosses the<br>Odeon if it's it yeah this is what it<br>looked like at the time but Sutherland<br>hang and see plane hangar and that's<br>what he imagined could happen down at<br>the landing the wolf ok the wolf cockpit<br>sort of<br>roughly like we imagined but a lot of<br>the other stuff didn't we we mentioned<br>new uses for the various hangers and<br>complemented at my sympathetic buildings<br>sort of in a like form relating to<br>that industrial language and also just<br>to a different master plane as well that<br>accompanied all this said at the time<br>that so long linear green spine<br>organizing the large residential<br>development that's undergoing up there<br>at the moment now from Circular clients<br>to a bit of cord work Holy Trinity<br>Cathedral in plan L the competition for<br>the completion project of the Cathedral<br>then we we sort of had a competition<br>within the competition in the office<br>explored a number of options but they<br>all had the same idea we the idea was to<br>have a courtyard a closer behind the<br>altar and have an ambulatory around so<br>we could have a loop you go out through<br>the ambulatory into the chapel and<br>income can bacon we we just explored how<br>we would expressed it and that's what<br>the internal competition and the office<br>and this picked up on professor toys<br>vision of the cathedral cluster and the<br>roof shapes you see it here looking into<br>the courtyard it's a view from the<br>ambulatory into the court record head I<br>am a point in it and the court echo<br>connect to the chapel<br>so that those two could become one the<br>ground floor was surrounded by a screen<br>at the light of mainly coming from the<br>upper skylights you see here this is<br>looking from the memorial garden up to<br>the Rose window of the Cathedral so a<br>roof shape preserved it's not only the<br>Anglican Church that didn't like us the<br>Catholics recently in the New<br>Territories of Flatbush but a brief was<br>for a church a community center and the<br>parish offices together with the priests<br>residents so three elements and they<br>will be implemented in stages and this<br>is I am section through the rivet model<br>we didn't that explores how we express<br>the form how we generated image of the<br>church and we've got the simulated<br>seating it it comes down just above the<br>altar you see and since it's a Catholic<br>Church it's also allowed to be a bit<br>rich and more colorful and inside and if<br>anyone wonders what the priest is<br>carrying there it's someone strength<br>which is used on feast of Corpus Christi<br>this is what done stage one would look<br>like from the outside with a<br>freestanding bell tower you'd enter<br>through the courtyard into the basket<br>Victoria water not spiritual client but<br>nonetheless charismatic I don't know if<br>anyone remembers rhubarb line lower west<br>side it was a master plan for one<br>substantial mixed-use development and<br>I'm gonna look at building two daughters<br>which we could teachers if anyone<br>remembers their so we were interested in<br>in a three-dimensional exercise of<br>arranging apartments staking units in in<br>a way that would make for interesting<br>apartments that way but a different sort<br>of volume from what what you usually get<br>and we hit isn't it Russ you have<br>different three-dimensional objects in<br>the skies the apartments like at each<br>they're always there were always two<br>happening on two levels<br>and they never connected like this one<br>like on a t-shape this one here an<br>l-shaped there will be a double height<br>space in and we hit am a structural<br>framework and a service strategy there's<br>four yellow risers and then we would<br>fill it up you drop those units in like<br>you're doing Tetris in that framework<br>and put a skin around and the details<br>and and some of the views of those<br>apartments might have look like inside a<br>sphere you or the bathroom renders that<br>we did there's quite a few things as<br>complex planning regime controls around<br>it and envelope that constraints one<br>you can do and we came up with this roof<br>escape that provided all the<br>accommodation that was needed preserved<br>the public open space and in respect<br>that the heritage core building but it<br>was powerful enough to become a it could<br>have become a real city landmark but<br>with a new unifying roof over the<br>building that has a strong expression<br>and the way it was organized Louis in<br>the basement ports and the judges on top<br>shape crazy we knew what time what could<br>have become a sitting there was a chance<br>it's on mayoral Drive looking to the<br>tunnel made up of two parts one part on<br>mile drive and a soft organic one in the<br>park and the one on the front contained<br>a big atrium that focused all the views<br>and look back to the tunnel that's what<br>you see here entrance open inviting and<br>now being inside the atrium that allows<br>views building feedback from the floor<br>plate but yes Korean couple of towers<br>are that Street something else getting<br>birthday after many attempts at the<br>moment on the corner of Albert and in<br>Swanson this was a mixed-use building<br>combination of office on the lower level<br>and apartments on top with a site<br>Corgan's existing buildings this is the<br>city side the ethnic hard sided<br>addresses Albert Street and there was a<br>more modulated side on the park side<br>onto<br>Patrick's career and services and<br>Patrick's Cathedral Catholic on the<br>square and those those colored things to<br>the offices that are more to lightly and<br>the wasteland Sun the colors they relate<br>to the basement colors in the Catholic<br>Church the green another one probably<br>not that tall on foot Street next to the<br>building in this building was a lot<br>about context the adjacent heritage<br>building the sunlight control to email<br>e-reserve and we that's from the bank we<br>came up with a tripartite elevation of<br>base a middle in the top but we<br>interlock those so the stone reps around<br>the glass and we had a cycle an l-shaped<br>office flow tonight and we pushed the<br>building against its neighbor and<br>another one in fearless in the street a<br>triangular site and maybe in a similar<br>way we were interested again in in<br>sticking and arranging<br>floor plates and we turned this into<br>volumetric exercise and many stick<br>blocks and a triangular site you end up<br>with gaps and these were not leftover<br>spices we turn those into winter gardens<br>which were dancing around the building<br>is the sticking goes up and break hot<br>spices<br>for the workers and look out over the<br>the green areas are the Winter Gardens<br>and wherever the blocks we didn't cut<br>the rectangular blocks we're at the<br>corners of the triangle we just let them<br>cancel event and she passed now staying<br>in not far from their house Victoria<br>University<br>PBT our campus next to the railway<br>station and the law school an existing<br>tower in the podium prominently just the<br>one in the front and then they are<br>renting the area and the railway station<br>but they had to move out so they they<br>were looking for more space and so what<br>you see in the diagram here and we came<br>up with this idea of the skirt in the<br>shadow<br>we looked into maximizing the podium and<br>physically building a shadow to the<br>tower<br>otherwise leaving the tower itself<br>untouched and it was very constrained<br>because there's a view shaft from the<br>steps of Parliament going down to the<br>harbour that guy was right in front of<br>the tower buildings he couldn't you<br>couldn't come out at the front where was<br>the podium so we worked the skirt the<br>podium really really hard and extended<br>it and created the Rangers over the<br>footpath and bay windows and arranged<br>the program in a way that it is related<br>to its context in the end the black part<br>is the shadow of the tower where we<br>needed some more height and it's of your<br>own linkie where where the skirt just<br>comes out over the foot partment and it<br>makes of a rain band and provides<br>shelter that's the model of it so the<br>every part is the extent that is the<br>extended skirt and the blackest is that<br>our shadow<br>bit further up the world again between<br>PPTs straight and little baby Street<br>ppto Street<br>proposal for TM Indian embassy and we<br>call this designing diplomacy it was all<br>about the zoning the the front lawn for<br>the ceremonial or the Chancery itself<br>and in a building that would be the<br>background that would contain the Consul<br>and his residences and and and staff<br>that's that's how we arranged it in<br>these zones and colours and the Indian<br>stone and we put a veil around the<br>embassy makes a shape that you reminded<br>us on the mountain ranges you can see<br>from India course you start looking over<br>the grass Plains and you see that that's<br>mountain range in the background new<br>zealand school of music right in the<br>heart of wellington a site with great<br>potential you can see the microphone<br>center the town hall the library ER<br>gallery the m the city to see bridge<br>crossing across Jaworski this is the<br>diagram so we had a plate in the<br>introduce two intersecting atreus one<br>the orange one connects from the square<br>and hcc through to the harbor and the<br>blue one was aligned with the water from<br>the excess that that takes you inside<br>the building then the program required<br>three big performance places those<br>yellow volumes it arranged and connected<br>with ramps and then a series of smaller<br>teaching spaces and practice rooms that<br>we put on the outside because those big<br>performance spaces they don't have any<br>windows you don't see basically just<br>black boxes but these smaller rooms they<br>provide a smaller grain and I can<br>activate and<br>take through the streets around so this<br>is everything together and that's what<br>it could have looked like from the<br>square that's looking through that first<br>orange atrium getting a view out to the<br>harbor that's a view there's that line<br>yeah library will be behind me animated<br>by a series of small practicing rooms<br>and they all left England asymmetric<br>shapes because that's what's required<br>acoustic it worked really well in terms<br>of providing interesting in that time<br>it's a few multi made an appearance in<br>the foyer of the recital hall now is<br>that say the Vela forecasted to the<br>region's Nelson NASA Melbourne Institute<br>of Technology the site was here the<br>brief was for new Arts and Media<br>building on the campus there was one<br>part of the brief the other part was for<br>a timber demonstration project because<br>there was sponsorship was available from<br>the industry Nelson pine and this was<br>our proposal which is best explained in<br>section a taller building defining the<br>street age with artist studios and<br>south-facing sheet roofs on the top<br>lever the low part of the back contained<br>the more industrial workshops pure metal<br>work in the two were linked by a<br>suspended Simba creature so there was a<br>lot of an innovative<br>ideas in terms of building with lvl<br>include them and there that's how one of<br>those but in terms of being<br>demonstrating the technology and the<br>timber structure that obviously would be<br>clear how would we do it we had this<br>idea of an x-ray how can you see through<br>the building and how can you see through<br>the cladding back to the bounce or<br>illustrators what's what's under the<br>body and we had this idea that because<br>the building was very much a sectional<br>building that so we actually built the<br>section and we we have a facade that<br>reveals the my crap so we had a<br>corrugated polycarbonate clearing and<br>through that you would see insulation in<br>embedded you would see the the timber<br>the timber structure in them that could<br>have looked like that wall that you had<br>Christchurch after the earthquakes a<br>very prominent site right by the Ivan we<br>are cashing more crosses on the bridge<br>in Kiev us for mosaic because what we<br>what we try what we try to do is because<br>obviously there's the city still<br>existing in everyone's memory and it's<br>very much needed so we thought we we we<br>create this really vibrant and<br>multi-layered environment made out of a<br>series of smaller buildings of different<br>buildings and and have a series of<br>laneways crossing the site and bringing<br>some the footprints of the various<br>buildings that's what it looked like in<br>the model and they all were given the<br>different groups group shapes to do to<br>pick up on that crane and give them give<br>them a different identity so you could<br>you could relate to them it's a view<br>from from inside those line wise and<br>that's that's the corner view and what<br>you see there on the base this is a<br>large winter gardens harvesting the the<br>Western Sun and looking and looking out<br>to to Hitler park across the Ivan<br>bringing bringing the greenery that a<br>green material that the river is<br>bringing that inside and and and<br>creating I am stimulating and healthy<br>environment and the last project the<br>largest competition that we've entered<br>so far the International Criminal Court<br>in The Hague the the Criminal Court<br>currently still resides in interim<br>premises within the city but there was a<br>new site on the out on the outskirts<br>just where the city ends and and<br>introduced that the dunes begin on the<br>Atlantic coast in in this for just four<br>squares they they represent the four<br>courts that were required and that's<br>that's what anchors the building in that<br>landscape that's what you see in the<br>model here does does for timber volumes<br>in the rest was some arranged around<br>that the prosecutor's office did<br>judiciary and on the other side the<br>registry<br>you can see that heavy volumes of the<br>coats sunk into the sand and everything<br>else is attached and then the roof and<br>declaring website in the hike the city<br>means the hitch so there was this idea -<br>because there's a lot of requirements in<br>terms of privacy and security obviously<br>to build to build a huge in front of the<br>building and in employing these<br>different parts together and under one<br>unifying element and the building is<br>best explained in in section mechanic on<br>the left hand side you can you can see<br>the street the street address the<br>arrival on the right-hand side you see<br>the commune scape the building opens -<br>didn't and allows using and creates a<br>trust to create a very human environment<br>so you ever try it you were fired<br>no Mira try again fail again fail better<br>thank you<br>creeper in time and space and I think<br>that it's kind of fascinating thinking<br>that our cities could have been<br>different somehow we need a little bit<br>of evaluation but because we have a<br>little bit of time I think that well I<br>don't know if you want to us but<br>otherwise most of the other if you have<br>any question of all these projects and<br>oh maybe something more some more<br>details some something about also those<br>can I say the way you are presenting the<br>project because I mean we have seen<br>different<br>I don't think we differentiate you know<br>and you just put in the love you know<br>that you're willing to give to make it a<br>good project obviously you know<br>competitions they they they always<br>require you know a big effort it's 9:00<br>to 5:00 maybe that's the job but you<br>know you pick something that you want to<br>we were just talking about this before<br>when we walked up and said well why are<br>we doing this this is like looking at an<br>ex-girlfriends Facebook account you know<br>why why are you doing this to yourself<br>but I don't know I don't know really<br>they're all they're all da babies you<br>know for different reasons I wouldn't<br>yeah I can't say we do it but we is the<br>design team that includes consultants we<br>we do that we look at things like that<br>but we always keen to to push the<br>boundaries yeah but this is a city in<br>the very beginning you know what's<br>what's more important and especially at<br>this early stage the Rudi's project<br>projects were you know they didn't go<br>any further you make the key decisions<br>in terms of orientation you know all<br>building envelope they did the<br>relationship of a facade to volume you<br>know all these critical things or do you<br>refurbish or do you rebuild that's<br>that's way more important then so what<br>type of PV panel that was on the roads<br>lights on you know these are the<br>fundamentals these decisions that you<br>well obviously in hindsight we sometimes<br>you know you find out a bit more what<br>the particular jury or client was<br>looking for you know but if you had the<br>same amount of knowledge that he had at<br>the outset we probably you know maybe we<br>do the same again you know you do it<br>different but I mean we we still stand<br>behind<br>so back to the title of what do you<br>allowed to change but only for the bit<br>you know otherwise you still want them<br>you want to look at the end at the<br>initial idea and but in in terms of how<br>much they're about to change what's you<br>know it's not important or still it is<br>important but it's not the primary<br>importance of what they look like but<br>you know you started a diagram you know<br>and you always come back to that diagram<br>and you still want that diagram to be<br>intact at the end of the project you<br>know does the diagram tells you what the<br>idea was and what is important and what<br>not so if if if change has come along<br>during the design development process<br>you yourself ask yourself more so what<br>are we trying to do here you know what<br>was hi<br>yeah does this support it does it work<br>with the idea or it doesn't destroy the<br>idea telecom for example a secretary<br>come for example changed a lot telecom<br>was initially developed this is for<br>individual office buildings with with<br>high quality public space links going<br>through and and you know the header<br>facade on all four sides and you know<br>different proportions different heights<br>they were a little group of buildings<br>and then they the client had the chance<br>to start talking to the tenant telecom<br>and they said well we like the site and<br>everything else but you know we were a<br>big organization we need all those<br>buildings and we want our people to do<br>to work in one building and then the<br>idea was to bring those buildings<br>together and in what was public space in<br>between them became an atrium which<br>still remains public everyone can walk<br>through there you know and then they in<br>and the bridges that link the buildings<br>that cross in the atrium so in principle<br>you know the young yesterday are just<br>petition everything is there is your<br>best and then you want to start cutting<br>well if you if you overlook something or<br>you haven't you haven't known something<br>I mean you know sometimes you just have<br>to to start the game okay so I think<br>that the first time we all own time<br>I'm surprised hundred and eighty slides<br>yeah I can't leave them up to the house<br>keepers but it's not sketching and<br>taking pictures prototypes so thank you<br>very much again for coming tonight and<br>thank you for coming to all of you I<br>just want to remind you that next week<br>we have quite another interesting<br>lecture and it is to remember Ian happy<br>also or if you want to come I think will<br>be very very important for us to be here<br>to remember thank you for coming tonight<br>yeah thanks for coming in thanks for<br>having me thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem;
