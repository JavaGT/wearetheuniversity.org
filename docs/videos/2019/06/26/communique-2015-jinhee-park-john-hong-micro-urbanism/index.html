because it's a funny<br>microphone yes I suppose my name is Paul<br>Aliyah Dini as most of you know already<br>and welcome to the final lecture of<br>communicate 2015 in this of course a<br>special one because it's the last and<br>for this reason we decided to finish as<br>we started having some international<br>prominent speaker and so it's a pleasure<br>for me tonight to introduce Jeanne Park<br>and John Horne who kindly came actually<br>from Australia because they are working<br>the employee at the UQ University of<br>Queensland but they are based in New<br>York and and so and when I was still<br>organizing these few years I and I had<br>the chance to invite them<br>I of course checked their project and on<br>on the website I found a quite<br>interesting sentence which I I read to<br>you and I decided that they were the<br>perfect match for these lecture series<br>and you understand why and I mean I'm<br>already there following st. a so<br>single-speed design which is the name of<br>their architecture office is an<br>architectural firm that approaches<br>design as a convergent interdisciplinary<br>venture that aspired to bridge the<br>utopian in the pragmatics so of course<br>that became the<br>name of these are serious I ask the<br>permission and in any way just to<br>explain their approach to architecture<br>instead of separating aspects of<br>architecture urbanism landscape history<br>social systems and codes into their<br>constituent disciplines these essential<br>design ingredients are simultaneously<br>explored so that minimum form gains a<br>maximum effect and this is their<br>statement a little bit about the<br>background along with being published in<br>major media single-speed design has<br>received many procedure design awards<br>including the AIA young architects award<br>the emerging voice is a word and the<br>young architects a forum award by the<br>architectural League of New York Austin<br>my foundation for sustainable<br>construction award the metropolis next<br>generation prize and 12 AIA awards Ginny<br>and Jonah have lectured and exhibited at<br>many university and conferences<br>including the Harvard Graduate School of<br>Design Columbia University and the seoul<br>national university as well as at<br>international design conferences just a<br>couple of say knows about their<br>background<br>jeanny Park received a master's in<br>architecture from the Harvard Graduate<br>School of Design and BFA in industrial<br>design from Seoul National University<br>since 2009 she has served as a design<br>critic in architecture and they have a<br>school school graduate of School of<br>Design and the previous appointment<br>included the Morgenstein chair professor<br>at the Illinois Institute of Technology<br>and the Sasaki distinguished visiting<br>critic at the Boston Architectural<br>College John Hong also principal of<br>single speed design received a master in<br>architecture with distinction from the<br>Harvard Graduate School of Design and BS<br>in architecture with honors from the<br>University of Virginia and since 2007 is<br>associate professor in practice<br>at Harvard Graduate School of Design and<br>in 2012 and 13 was appointed<br>distinguished visiting professor at the<br>School of Architecture of the City<br>College of New York so I think without<br>any further ado I would like to invite<br>our speakers to share with our as their<br>concept of micro urbanism<br>please join me in welcoming Jeanne he<br>and John okay thanks so much to coming<br>out on yes do I hold this mic what have<br>other speakers done maybe I just hold<br>this and it's like like a microphone<br>yeah how's that how's that okay well<br>thank you everyone for coming out a<br>final review week I heard it's very busy<br>so it's it's it's a privilege that many<br>of you come out yes so we just took for<br>a quick introduction we have three<br>speaking of micro urbanism we have three<br>micro offices in Boston and New York and<br>in Seoul as well the they work we work<br>on different projects each of our<br>offices but when we need to combine the<br>resources and the knowledge and and the<br>and even the academic potential we we<br>combine the work and and it's not that<br>the project scales up it's that there's<br>different kinds of local knowledge that<br>we can draw from so instead of having an<br>office that that that you know in a<br>corporate setting you would have an<br>office that works globally but brings<br>maybe more general things to to the<br>global setting we're actually true<br>race something like this okay good I got<br>it I got it<br>we try to bring actually very specific<br>and very very deep local knowledge to<br>the projects sort of a representation of<br>our travel route in our in our work in<br>progress and one of the one of the<br>things that we we try to base our<br>practice on is the idea that that the<br>aspects of design are not looked at in a<br>linear way like this in an additive way<br>from programs to social systems but<br>actually we try to think of them in a<br>term that we're calling conversion which<br>means we begin to think of these aspects<br>simultaneously and begin to look at<br>leveraging the I guess the aspects of<br>each of these and so instead of starting<br>with program and going to zoning budget<br>structure and these kind of things and<br>and becoming a kind of system where you<br>begin to add on solutions all the<br>solutions begin to then converge so<br>therefore our our emblem the but the<br>single speed bicycle I will hand this<br>over to Ginny micro urbanism it's the<br>one the subject that we've been<br>discussing and researching through our<br>projects past several years so the<br>microorganism is a new way to form the<br>city by breaking down the elements that<br>forms the city into micro scale so it's<br>not about making everything small is<br>it's about the fine being core elements<br>in micro scale so that we can recompose<br>and and<br>come up with the system that that can<br>create the more broader spectrum of<br>possibility so we the the set up this<br>these to the words the seemingly<br>contradicting each other but that has a<br>characteristic of the microorganism so<br>the first one is the physical x<br>perceptual this is the the project we<br>did for the Gwangju Biennale it's a 2<br>meter by 2 meter by 2 meter cube box<br>that we are supposed to design in the in<br>the reflection of this the famous the<br>pavilion in Korea and so what our<br>approach is the this the box is that the<br>well define from the outside and through<br>this through this gap when you enter<br>that you have a through the reflection<br>that you the the boundary gets disappear<br>and it gets expanded endlessly so that<br>this inversion of the defined boundary<br>from the outside and the undefined<br>limitless boundary the inside that we<br>explore and the we've found that becomes<br>one of possibility that when we deal<br>with this physical built environment so<br>from there to credible in the less<br>experienced and the true the inversion<br>that we can invert not only about<br>boundary but also the perception of this<br>the elements so there's a planar<br>elements that forms the object like that<br>so that through the sister just quick<br>the exercise that the week to test out<br>how we can expand the possibility of the<br>physical elements the issue issue is<br>owning breath sharing this is the loft<br>renovation that we did in Chelsea<br>Manhattan the client came to us the<br>three different family is the clients<br>and they asked us to to design there's<br>the space they can share so in the<br>original day the proposed actually the<br>several rooms further each families<br>which they completely filled up this<br>space and what we suggested instead is<br>that the space they can they can be<br>transformed to accommodate all this<br>different families needs so and we<br>researched research the further so to to<br>find out this potential user of this<br>kind of space so the when we look at the<br>this nomadic user that so that we mapped<br>out those type of the user and then we<br>actually look at the occupancy ratio of<br>the you know how the how much actually<br>they used their own property in the in<br>the city and then the we analyzed the<br>kind of the setup of the their space and<br>by breaking down those elements and by<br>making this combined of all the space in<br>they can share too and that share in the<br>convert to their own special need then<br>we can bring up their the occupancy rate<br>up to you know the higher side so that<br>was the the our arguments and we<br>expanded that argument to the urban<br>scale so this is the the image that used<br>you think the this the high-density<br>urban condition and this is a you know<br>actual occupancy so if we identify by<br>creating the space that there can be<br>shared then we can have this the VAS of<br>the empty space it for the public<br>library or park or things like that for<br>this that becomes amenity for the city<br>going back to the project itself so<br>because of the this the space has a very<br>good view in the one side to Empire<br>State Building so we made this<br>agonal wall which is the consist of the<br>okay so that through the we through this<br>diagonal wall they can have this<br>extended view to the Empire State<br>Building but also the that allows the<br>the both rooms can have a view to the<br>major side otherwise this these rooms<br>can have only you to the other side and<br>also that that diagonal wall is some<br>part is used as the individual Locker<br>for the this different family members so<br>they can leave their own belongings that<br>brings the sense of ownership over them<br>so we realize this is very important too<br>to make them feel that this is you know<br>their own space although their occupancy<br>is shorter so that the the ownership and<br>the sense of ownership actually it is<br>important when we designed the space to<br>be shared also this this alumina mesh<br>curtain that that defines the forms the<br>different divisions and we use the this<br>the curtain with the lighting so if we<br>lived outside it looks at OPEC it if you<br>live inside it looks transparent so that<br>by adjusting the lighting placement and<br>just by simply turning on and off the<br>lighting that we can actually change the<br>property of this the same material to<br>adjust the feature privacy<br>and also we the same themes we designed<br>also this the sliding sliding bookshelf<br>so by horizontally I'm sliding that we<br>cannot just actually hide between the<br>shafts okay so another aspect of micro<br>urbanism timing x programming we<br>experimented with with this I don't know<br>if you have heard about the project in<br>or dos where a hundred architects were<br>invited out into the desert by Hertzog<br>to me Ron and also I Weiwei the artists<br>from China and asked to design a villa<br>and so this was this was from the Iowa<br>way exhibit in Switzerland and this is<br>this is our project here but in a way<br>it's a kind of showcase of global<br>architecture and here's the kind of<br>events that work was<br>happening we were is this safe we're<br>sort of in this our models not here yet<br>but uh we caught it the New York get oka<br>somehow we had a random draw of which<br>lot we could get this is all kind of AI<br>weiwei see he's also works a lot in<br>performance as well and so this is one<br>of his ideas that each architect would<br>randomly draw out of literally out of a<br>fishbowl which lot they would work oddly<br>enough all the firm's from New York<br>ended up in the same area so we called<br>it the New York ghetto but it was fun<br>working in sort of in collaboration with<br>with our our our fellow architects from<br>New York and so here's the site and<br>here's us occupying this blistering hot<br>desert in mainly black clothes which is<br>not very comfortable with all the<br>sunlight actually I don't have my black<br>jacket on there's there's me and there's<br>Jenny but the interesting thing about<br>the sighted is isolated and and most of<br>the of the clients would be actually<br>people that would be visiting on<br>occasions so similar to the project that<br>Ginny was talking about in New York that<br>the project is not something that is is<br>in constant use and we thought that this<br>was this was one of the kind of strange<br>problems of this and we and we would use<br>it as a platform to exercise in terms of<br>timing and programming so the idea is<br>that each of these towers has a very<br>specific program there's eight towers so<br>instead of beginning to think of this as<br>one large house we began to think of<br>each of these towers have having their<br>own distinct programs like the living<br>room tower the bedroom tower the<br>bathroom tower and through that<br>verticality that stacking of programs we<br>were able to turn on and off that energy<br>use of the house so that during a kind<br>of diurnal cycle only parts of the house<br>are occupied and this was a kind of<br>energy strategy but also a kind of<br>timing and programming strategy and<br>here's a here's a view of those eight<br>towers and and the the project begins to<br>capture this kind of vast on<br>controllable light with a series of<br>openings that are controlled so that<br>they give a sense of privacy but also a<br>sense of space where you don't see the<br>adjacent towers because many of these<br>windows are pointing towards the sky so<br>there's a sense of openness within the<br>kind of density that we've created but<br>also a sense a different layers of<br>privacy we had to work with very<br>low-tech means so the leaning of each of<br>these towers is based on the distance<br>from the foundation while we worked with<br>SGH was which is a very great<br>engineering company in Boston trying to<br>figure out how we can make a kind of<br>load-bearing structure that can lean but<br>not need any additional structure other<br>than its its kind of weight so through<br>that leaning the the the power start<br>from these kind of autonomous blocks but<br>then begin to converge into one large<br>building and then they begin to separate<br>again at the roof this so they unbundle<br>and bundle back again and through this<br>kind of collision you get these<br>separations but you also get different<br>kinds of adjacencies that might be<br>unexpected and so we also wanted to<br>create a kind of village feel to these<br>towers so in a way the lighting of it<br>begins to reflect from one tower to the<br>next and make these spaces that are that<br>are communal in a way so instead of<br>conceiving it as one large house it<br>becomes a kind of complex there there's<br>these flash floods that that happen in<br>the Mongolian desert and we thought it<br>was a waste to let that water just run<br>off as it usually does like a sieve<br>through the sand so by by just using<br>clay pots which we you can get locally<br>the water is trapped in the ground for<br>longer periods and that begins to<br>regenerate the landscape similarly we're<br>looking at this idea of division as<br>multiplied by continuity again two terms<br>that seem like they're in conflict but<br>they they can actually work together<br>we did a kind of mini Ordos project this<br>was in in in Portland Oregon and many of<br>the same characters from Ordos were<br>invited to to participate in this<br>smaller development project<br>everyone wanted these kind of larger<br>lots you know will brooder is very<br>famous he gets the end lot julienne dish<br>MIT he gets this sort of the front lots<br>this was we didn't draw these out of a<br>fishbowl we kind of negotiated but<br>fortunately we wanted the lot that<br>nobody wanted which was the smallest lot<br>it's 16 by 16 feet really difficult to<br>build anything of substantive volume in<br>this lot but we were actually excited by<br>its potential this kind of castaway lot<br>that nobody wanted here's our little<br>project and the idea was that through<br>curation you could actually begin to fit<br>the entire city within 16 by 16 feet and<br>and again looking at the diurnal cycle<br>as a kind of music score so instead of<br>there being rooms dedicated rooms that<br>are like living rooms bathrooms kitchens<br>what if we thought about surfaces that<br>were used throughout the day and began<br>to compose them and kind of musical<br>scores so so instead of these these<br>rooms that maybe are unoccupied we're<br>actually working with surfaces that are<br>programmatic at the same time there's no<br>we were planning no clear glazing there<br>would just be shutters that you would<br>open up the weather is pretty mild in<br>Portland and but what that does on the<br>interior is create spaces that have very<br>high few shadows there's no sharp<br>shadows that so that the the lack of<br>sharp shadows blurs the distinction of<br>space it actually makes the distances a<br>little bit ambiguous so that also<br>increases the that sort of perceptual<br>size of the space we also want it to be<br>a kind of a toy on a kit of parts<br>something that you could go to the<br>hardware store and buy so all of it is<br>based on dimensions of plywood and<br>lumber that you could get from from the<br>so another aspect local as as x national<br>we instead of a showing a project for<br>this one we wanted to show show a book<br>that we pretty recently finished a<br>couple years ago card called convergent<br>flux and we were looking at the<br>architecture in Korea and and and a lot<br>of times when you see architecture<br>coming out of Korea in publications it<br>there's a kind of wow factor like look<br>at all the crazy stuff that Koreans are<br>doing but we also but we wanted to put<br>it on a global metric in a way and begin<br>to compare the the events and and the<br>kind of issues that are going on in<br>Korea so that we could use it used the<br>kind of rapid development of design in<br>Korea as a kind of example that other<br>nations could learn from so instead of<br>isolating Korea as a kind of local<br>unique situation we also we want to open<br>it up into a global discussion and that<br>was one of the goals and there's many<br>contradictions that are happening in<br>terms of the landscape in the city I<br>mean you have this also in in New<br>Zealand in terms of the kinds of density<br>that are happening density but also<br>low-rise density the the almost insane<br>cycles of construction and urban renewal<br>and and destruction so we began to map<br>some of these factors out with with five<br>metrics dealing with with landscape<br>history materiality and also also in<br>terms of social aspects as well and and<br>began to map out these projects projects<br>that seemed very diverse and again that<br>are that have celebrated been celebrated<br>internationally but also celebrated and<br>I think a kind of superficial way in<br>that they're looked at projects they're<br>looked at as projects that are like<br>unique and one-off and and very specific<br>we actually want to tie them to other<br>kind of global networks and global<br>i glow Belov situations and invited some<br>some really great theorists to begin to<br>talk about the work series of the<br>project that in korea through that study<br>so diaper see multiplied by density just<br>the swipe a plop art gallery that we<br>built in Harry in South Korea they we<br>this way we got it through competition<br>and competition brief course mainly for<br>flexible space and because the owner<br>doesn't know that time that what kind of<br>work art that he's going to want to<br>exhibit so the usually the the<br>flexibility of the exhibition space<br>can be achieved by this big empty space<br>that can be partitioned off and the way<br>that we approach the flexible space is<br>different and so the we instead of<br>making a big one big space and then the<br>providing just one big space we should<br>have provided many different space the<br>with the different the scales different<br>proportion of proportions and different<br>lighting conditions so that the we we<br>created this variety of the different<br>condition for the different area of Arts<br>the site is located in the center of<br>this the British British and the in<br>front of this the lake<br>and because of its location that it<br>could block the view to the lake from<br>this neighbor so we open up the the<br>certain part of the building so that the<br>old neighbors can still keep the view<br>and the other issue of the Sur projects<br>is that is the Harry art police is<br>located in the near North Korean border<br>so you know that is the in a North Korea<br>there's a the you can you cannot see<br>that statue but you can see North Korea<br>from the site so through this kind of<br>tension if you look at this the site<br>itself<br>it looks really calm and it's a really<br>nice area with the and nice folk and the<br>nice nature element but the the<br>underlying the condition is that that<br>because of there is this military<br>conditions that there's a very strict<br>height restriction also so to meet that<br>height restriction and to gain the the<br>enough floor area the you know to have<br>this flexible space the conventional way<br>to do the to create a flexible space is<br>it it becomes is this like a pancake<br>homogeneous space but we what we propose<br>this this a series of diverse space so<br>through that along the the viewing<br>sequence through this gallery that the<br>the people can experience the different<br>scale of the exhibitions and different<br>different lighting conditions or so that<br>there's the this enclosed box and then<br>that you can come out to this<br>transparent box that they can see the<br>nature so this constant the constant<br>shift of this very clean exhibition<br>space to the outdoor the landscape<br>actually is it becomes the that provides<br>very vibrant viewing experience and was<br>the the column instead of having the<br>thick fewer column we proposed this<br>dinner but many columns to expand this<br>the the transparent view the from the<br>entry that entries hinted by this the<br>curved glass and that this curvature<br>actually the provide should be the<br>transparency to the to the lakeside so<br>as you walk in through there by but its<br>diagonal the glass opening that you are<br>guided to the the today there's a<br>departure point of the whole viewing<br>sequence and so each the or every the<br>space of the this gallery is designed to<br>become exhibition space and each<br>exhibition space but different<br>proportion again and as some of the<br>space the the can be used as a purple<br>space<br>and this the completely enclosed space<br>and coming out of this the transparent<br>box that can have the four of the<br>natural light actually can bring the<br>diapers diverse experience of the open<br>to this building as I said that we the<br>we made it that every space can be used<br>as a exhibition space and even this fire<br>stairs that can be used as a nice<br>exhibition area and was the surrounding<br>here I said there is one of the<br>distinctiveness feature is this the<br>foggy weather and we use we wanted to<br>use that the the the characteristic of<br>nature and fog and also the pear blossom<br>trees so you know during the blossom<br>seasons that it can feel the transparent<br>area of this the glazing and that that<br>convert the perception of the space from<br>the inside and we when we designed this<br>preparin on the glass we actually wrote<br>this program to define the location and<br>density of the the free pattern that<br>reduced the heat gain and also cut the<br>glare for the exhibition of course<br>there's the limited budget so we limited<br>to the ten plate and different the<br>parents to form more organic expression<br>of the facade and surveillance and<br>amenity we're we're beginning to think<br>about micro urbanism and also the idea<br>of this smart City and our friends at<br>Arab let us borrow this great diagram<br>where if you look at if you look at the<br>tactics for achieving a kind of<br>sustainable city renewable resources is<br>is sort of at the bottom physical<br>interventions you can make a significant<br>change but the most significant change<br>is achieved by behavior change so this<br>we found this incredibly interesting in<br>terms of the the role of architecture<br>because someone so much we we talk about<br>materiality in terms of sustainability<br>but how can architecture then work in<br>terms of changing behavior so in that<br>way infrastructure can be looked at in<br>two different in two different aspects<br>there's there's of course the hard<br>infrastructure which we're all familiar<br>with but also can can we begin to look<br>at soft infrastructure like information<br>data security and social networks and<br>can that be in a way that urban<br>performance is achieved so we did a<br>project that was based on on some of<br>these notions but also was specifically<br>looking at security cameras and how that<br>can become a in urban amenity so that<br>the site itself was something that was<br>that needed lighting for safety and it<br>connected a very important Road and this<br>is our white block gallery the project<br>that Geneva showed to the waterfront and<br>so this kind of underutilized path the<br>task of the project was to make a safer<br>path through lighting and so we were<br>looking at this idea of interactive<br>architecture<br>also the the way in which surveillance<br>cameras can be used so it tracking<br>movements of people but also looking at<br>weather conditions as well and beginning<br>to look at how both of those can<br>intertwine in a in a new interface for<br>lighting here's the path itself and just<br>a second so here you see there's no<br>people right now but it's tracking the<br>so in a very simple way it likes a path<br>for you but we also wanted to general<br>way augment social behaviors so if<br>there's a group drive they could begin<br>to converge in the middle you get a kind<br>of forth animated interactive<br>experiences you begin to come together<br>and so some of these clouds can then<br>become a kind of impromptu stage where<br>where you get to perform maybe<br>underneath them the middle cloud<br>whispers to you we wanted to have these<br>kind of poetics that were slightly<br>ominous because this needs about<br>surveillance as well so we were also<br>questioning how surveillance<br>of course could have an ominous side to<br>it so it's a kind of revealing of that<br>process and these are just ways in which<br>the weather is being tracked so when<br>it's hot it gives you a cold life to<br>give you a sense of of warmth but when<br>it's cold it gives you a sense of heat<br>through the sound of light and then in<br>terms of the fog it would begin to kind<br>of pulsate and then things that are<br>usually invisible like wind becomes<br>visible<br>so each of these clouds have have<br>elements that the cloud that's further<br>ways is called the water cloud middle is<br>the whispering cloud the one closest to<br>you is fire and so these kind of<br>elements begin to mix in terms of their<br>lighting in their sound yet this is when<br>many people gather there's a view of<br>that underneath oh we don't have the<br>diagram showing the infrastructure<br>there's there's um very small speakers<br>the structural resolution of this was<br>interesting because we wanted to make it<br>as thin as possible and we could have<br>even made it thinner but it was it was<br>limited by the by the kind of technology<br>so there's these these linear speakers<br>that are embedded in this there's kind<br>of security cameras that are also up<br>here and and of course the lighting<br>itself so in a way it's it's it's a kind<br>of display system that is embedded with<br>infrastructure and the columns<br>themselves are diagonal so that they<br>they can take lateral forces and and so<br>the the construction of this was was<br>actually really interesting because at<br>the same time it wanted to be a kind of<br>material thing it also wanted to be a<br>material as well so we were trying to<br>attain something that was really thin<br>finally the we built this the<br>oh no last year and we so we did they<br>built this all this different idea into<br>the process the small multifamily<br>housing development then it is it has<br>enough diversity and different function<br>different programs and different social<br>lives that we can bring in this<br>variability into their the site is is it<br>in Korea in China shear area that is its<br>from there so the JumpShip area the area<br>is if the the main residential district<br>that you have two different type of<br>residential building which is the this<br>high-rise apartment complex and this<br>mid-rise the mixed-use housing and when<br>we look at this there's very typical<br>image that you see in many different<br>cities that this apartment complex they<br>where that you only get this three<br>bedroom or four bedroom set up where<br>it's very the fixed and rigid and the we<br>are thinking that the this type of<br>housing it doesn't provide this<br>different needs and the new lifestyle<br>that the nowadays we need more and more<br>so we look at this the this typical<br>family type this is the the data of the<br>Korea so 1995 the this nuclear family<br>type the couple with the kids takes<br>takes it more than 30 percent of the<br>whole different family type and time<br>goes by so by year 2035 that the nuclear<br>family type is going to take a less than<br>10% and then we are facing all this<br>different type of families that will<br>fill this restaurant 90% and the this<br>the the current the set of previous the<br>type cannot provide this different the<br>family type doesn't provide the space<br>for the different family types oh and<br>also we look at the there's the the<br>fluctuation of this family size so when<br>you become single the age of 18 that you<br>live on lon<br>and until you get married and then you<br>two and then you have kid and you get<br>divorce and then we married and then you<br>are your kids get independent and they<br>do the repeat this cycle again and then<br>through there and then you leave what<br>you could become alone again<br>and then their life gets actually longer<br>and longer so this whole on the the<br>fluctuation of the family size actually<br>is it happens more and more and the<br>duration of living in the smaller<br>the scale of the space is it gets longer<br>in number so our ambition is the is it<br>how to make this new prototype that can<br>accommodate all this different change in<br>these days so this is the the<br>micro-housing we built and as you can<br>see this is the the surrounding is the<br>very looks diapers but the interior<br>condition actually is this similar to<br>this apartment like two bedroom three<br>bedroom or it's very fixed type and also<br>that what we looked at is that there's<br>the condition of the this residential<br>district the ground ground level<br>condition because of the parking<br>requirements that if you walk down to<br>the this residential area although this<br>is a residential area that what you see<br>is the the parking so it's an endless<br>parking that on the ground level so<br>there's no the sense of a committee<br>there's no interaction between the<br>neighbors and so we wanted to bring this<br>the the program down on the ground level<br>as much as you can and that is the one<br>of the reason why we made it our the<br>unit the small because the the area of<br>the unit actually triggers the number of<br>parking requirement and so the unit is a<br>twelve square meter hundred twenty<br>square feet which is extremely small is<br>minimum legal size of Korea minimum<br>legal residential space in Korea so that<br>we they use the tapioca actually is on<br>energy so there is a this a very private<br>core of this hard core of the<br>the the your space and then that is<br>surrounded by this gel kind of space<br>that you can expand that your boundary<br>to this the certain distance so when to<br>translate their idea into the plan that<br>so the we limited this the type of unit<br>into two one is a more rectangular type<br>and the other one is more scary to<br>maximize the construction if it is<br>efficiency then although the the unit<br>type is limited depending on how that is<br>located into the plan that it the<br>characteristic of the space can be<br>changed so for instance this unit has a<br>lot of parking space we name the<br>potential user either user green thumb<br>can grow the oldest the plans by using<br>this the outer space whereas the same<br>proportion the same space that the film<br>critic can the take advantage of the<br>wall that so that goes the to project<br>the the the movie which goes beyond the<br>the is or her own boundaries this is the<br>space that shows that the in between<br>space the tapioca space and also through<br>there the the this this is opening the<br>door to the this tapioca space and that<br>becomes also the the window when the the<br>user for about<br>desk so it can be used in a different<br>way also there's that idea of the<br>combining there's the small units into<br>to become the bigger units so this is<br>the one of the please combine the units<br>that becomes one bedroom space and<br>depending on how you the compose the<br>combined this units and this combined<br>the later on so there's the the<br>flexibility into this system that can<br>react to the different need throughout<br>your life cycles and you know the change<br>of their family the potential of the use<br>of the space and the boundary of the<br>space can go beyond physical boundary<br>for instance that this unit has it is<br>located in this in the kind of very<br>hidden area but still they can be you<br>can have a view to through this fire<br>stairs up to the sky and the view and<br>natural light natural ventilation<br>actually the there's the very major<br>elements that can bring the quality of<br>from ground floor that you we brought<br>down this the program to the ground<br>level and the underground there's the<br>the cafe and the galleries and the this<br>the micro cafe and the micro theatre<br>they can be used becomes the amenity for<br>this residence so from the death Street<br>you can enter through this the cafe so<br>the cafe during the day and uses the<br>theatre during the night so that there's<br>multiple use of the same space that<br>brings up the efficiency of the this the<br>use of this kind of space so we for the<br>screen we took cues from the context and<br>there's a lot of informal ways in which<br>these spaces that don't really belong to<br>one property or the other of course<br>there are property lines but they're<br>appropriated in many different creative<br>ways in terms of the edge condition and<br>and and there's many ways in which the<br>screen functions it can be a balcony it<br>can be a security and and and so on and<br>so forth but in a way it extends the<br>boundary in different kinds of ways<br>whether it be security or balcony so we<br>wanted to do the same thing with our<br>screen where even though it's a<br>homogeneous system that kind of wraps<br>the whole building there's subtle<br>variations with it that allows it to be<br>something that you might grow something<br>on the railings actually drain and<br>guides the water down back to the ground<br>there's there security bars over certain<br>that the lower units but also it can<br>and the the units themselves become very<br>flexible in that we wanted to say that<br>every unit actually has a living room<br>bedroom a kitchen this kind of thing by<br>folding out the furniture you can have<br>these different activities and so here's<br>a kind of day in the life wake up check<br>your phone of course but there's also a<br>closet that that uses the depth of the<br>bed and then you put the bed away so you<br>can actually have a larger space there's<br>a there's a in this this is the smallest<br>unit so we wanted to kind of demonstrate<br>this series in the small unit the<br>there's natural light that comes in<br>through the shower in the bathroom and<br>it begins to be distributed into the<br>room through this frosted glass but also<br>there's clear story lighting all the way<br>around so that there's an appealing that<br>the space extends beyond your unit quick<br>little breakfast say hello to your<br>neighbor and off you go<br>and then in in terms of the social space<br>the doors themselves so this was a kind<br>of required corridor space and you can<br>see how small the units are in in<br>relation to the required corridor<br>actually this this we were able to<br>extend these a little bigger so in in<br>terms of this idea of Tapioca space you<br>can use the doors to begin to<br>reconfigure different kind of social<br>arrangements and so here's that corridor<br>this kind of thing and I will give this<br>back to you so the we wanted to expand<br>or so that this the possibility of this<br>big kind of setup by implementing<br>technology aggressively in a way so we<br>when we implement the smart technology<br>that the wall becomes the more than wall<br>and window becomes more than Windows<br>so we mapped out the several possibility<br>and so for instance this best bill when<br>you enter the your own apartment through<br>the the fingerprint sensor that it can<br>censor the and to set up as the room<br>condition to customize your own need and<br>that you can also though the boundary it<br>can be achieved by different means not<br>only the physical walls or the windows<br>so that through they're the same the<br>opening can be used as screen or this<br>the dahmer curtain can also create a<br>boundary without the physically crossing<br>of also the even the the idea of a<br>privacy can be approached in different<br>ways so like bathroom very private space<br>of the window can be used as at a<br>display of different informations and<br>they can be it becomes transparent<br>actually so that that you can actually<br>watch the Adri or the the children why<br>we are working<br>in the other side and also that can<br>create the different kind of this<br>virtual environment so we are now the<br>researching on this the further to make<br>the to expand this possibility of this<br>micro-housing<br>further so that's it<br>so this is for a private developer that<br>what we propose is of course is that you<br>know making the profit is the major goal<br>for the developer so what we propose is<br>that instead of the making you know<br>bigger rooms or that we make the small<br>rooms but many so we fill in the many<br>units into here and then make this a<br>very efficient so that the the price of<br>rent actually can be higher than the you<br>know market rate so that was the one of<br>the strategy and the other one is we<br>wanted to create actually this this the<br>more like sustainable community by the<br>implementing is not only this housing<br>but also the galleries and the the cafes<br>and also that the the the owner actually<br>runs the the cafes and galleries and the<br>resident of the the micro housing also<br>is the part of it that the people that<br>is relate to that the industry so that<br>the the there is this interaction<br>between the residents and that there's<br>the use of this different program<br>actually the enhance the their quality<br>should I just write the it was is a it<br>was a bit of experiment from from the<br>get-go where where there there was<br>supposed to be a kind of artisan<br>residence program but but the demand for<br>housing for like like this slide that<br>Ginny showed the demand for affordable<br>smaller units that aren't these two or<br>three bedrooms that are mostly prevalent<br>in Korea was so great that that uh they<br>just decided to instead of curating and<br>the kind of artist in residence program<br>they just started to open it open up to<br>the market and it it with the idea that<br>that some of the units can combine<br>actually has become really fruitful<br>because there's 14 modules but right now<br>there's about nine units we're calling<br>them units because some of the modules<br>have been combined into a larger unit<br>and so but a lot of micro housing<br>doesn't have that flexibility and I<br>think this is where we're trying to<br>propose this innovation where the<br>tenants actually stay longer they're<br>renting but if there are life's changes<br>like for instance if you if you if you<br>become if you have a partner then you<br>can rent to the units next to each other<br>or if you break up and you can close the<br>units off again and so the idea is that<br>that that it's it's it will be more<br>sustainable in terms of its people<br>staying there longer it's only been open<br>for about eight months or so but it's a<br>hundred percent occupied and there's a<br>waiting list to get in and part of that<br>waiting list we want to say oh of course<br>it's designed yes we we we created<br>desire through the design but there is<br>that but there but the desire also is to<br>be part of a housing complex that does<br>have these amenities so the coffee shop<br>offers two free cups of really nice<br>coffee a day to anyone that lives there<br>and so there's this kind of<br>collaboration between living and these<br>community spaces<br>yes please we focused on this is it<br>again it's not about the size of making<br>micro but about the possibility of being<br>expendable so it can be combined or it<br>can be contracted so that is it so we<br>the currently we are working with the<br>this company developing this in bigger<br>scale and the the critical thing of this<br>that we see is the through this system<br>and with this system that we also the<br>programming of this is also important so<br>the the in addition to residential<br>program there's you know different kind<br>of program what kind of program that<br>that goes there is also important and<br>how to manage is also important and we<br>we are also trying to for the the<br>service into this whole system so it's a<br>it's not we are not only providing shell<br>but also the the whole programming and<br>to the maintenance and so one of the<br>things also about the scale is that it's<br>very nimble this lot is really difficult<br>to build on and it was it was challenged<br>getting the the crane on there<br>originally it was supposed to be<br>prefabricated boxes but the the myth of<br>prefabrication is you need to crane to<br>lift things into place it's so the<br>nimbleness of micro urbanism can be used<br>in existing parts of the city so this is<br>one of our arguments as well the the lot<br>is 500 square meters 5,000 square feet<br>some were like 500 square meters so it's<br>a very small lot and and we're just - I<br>wish we could shows images but we<br>haven't had our final review at<br>University of Queensland where were<br>actually the studio is about mer mic<br>urban ism in Pyongyang which is the<br>capital of North Korea and that's a<br>Stalinist city with with you know really<br>wide streets where there's no cars<br>obviously it's it's a kind of symbolic<br>city that was built on a kind of massive<br>scale so we're trying to experiment with<br>the idea of micro urbanism within this<br>other kind of context<br>bringing really fine grain to it to a<br>city that was based on these Stalinist<br>principles so hopefully we can show you<br>at an urban scale how this works in a<br>week yes oh the the width of the quarter<br>it's it's just the handicap access code<br>in Korea it's it's a little bit wider<br>than the States<br>interestingly enough one of the reason<br>why we made it as clearly the wider is<br>that the is if we made it this units the<br>smaller and then the the it made it that<br>the space that can be shared bigger so<br>the one reason is that as I explained<br>that is it because that triggers the<br>number of parking that we have to put<br>the other one is that the that actually<br>the the presentation we did is said we<br>want the people to use the corridor but<br>then of course you know people the<br>question often that you know if the real<br>essence can use or they will use like<br>the way that we describe but the the the<br>we believes that is really important to<br>describe that they not the the potential<br>user or suggestion of the the use of the<br>space because otherwise it came<br>on use or misuse later on so this is the<br>one of the the suggest and one of the<br>example but not the you know the only<br>way and the each floor have a different<br>set of depending on the you know the how<br>many the units are and also the what<br>kind of the the collation condition is<br>so the the use of this share displaced<br>the Korea space it can be very different<br>and depending on the range spaces I mean<br>out on their own<br>what's the difference that's a good<br>question<br>you I like the piano versus piano player<br>versus pianist right I think that<br>difference is becoming more and more I<br>don't have a good answer but I think<br>that differences become more and more<br>blurry I'm just thinking of like all the<br>people that have home studios and now<br>there are actually musicians like myself<br>almost all of a sudden a musician I but<br>I'm I'm terrible at playing music so but<br>that that difference is actually<br>becoming blurry and I and I think this<br>is a good question for maybe the next<br>lecture series because the the I think<br>the architecture profession is is is in<br>collaborative because of that you know<br>users are becoming much more but it's<br>also becoming much more<br>defuse I think you've noticed in in in<br>at the schools too that the efficacy<br>that the power of architecture to<br>actually kind of make a statement and<br>actually create change that's being<br>questioned at the core and I think this<br>is this is what you're actually talking<br>about so I don't have a good answer for</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
