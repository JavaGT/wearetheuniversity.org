They sound different. <br>They're funny, and that's important, and so  <br>they convey just a sense of youthful enjoyment and <br>vigour and they're playing this upbeat pop music.<br>Their experimentation with music is what <br>kind of drives the music industry today.<br>I think that's why they're still so popular <br>is that they were a voice of a generation.  <br>They voiced their own opinions. They weren't <br>afraid to, you know, stand up for civil rights  <br>or stand up for things that they believed <br>in and I think it was like a turning point.<br>Maybe in three years, they went from, you know,  <br>lovable moptops to people <br>sitting in the Himalayas.<br>You know, just that journey alone <br>and they took people with them.<br>My favourite is definitely George Harrison.<br>Mostly because my favourite song is <br>"Something." It's beautifully done. I like him.<br>I love George Harrison. I loved his look. <br>I mean, everybody thought that. He was,  <br>you know, I think he was the <br>best looking Beatle probably.<br>I studied the Rock to Reggae paper. It made <br>me very, very aware that I did not know much  <br>about the music industry at all. And I think <br>Graham really opened up the realism. It's cool.<br>Okay Graham, I'm now gonna <br>put your Beatles knowledge <br>to the test by giving you <br>some Beatles trivia questions.<br>Okay.<br>Are you ready?<br>Never, but go on.<br>What was the very first track <br>on a Beatles album in the UK?<br>Whoa, um... one two, one two three <br>four. "I Saw Her Standing There."<br>Correct! Well done. I'm impressed.<br>Isn't that a great way to start <br>that Beatles story? That career?<br>One two, one two three four <br>and away we go! You know, bang!<br>What important events took place <br>on July 6 1957 at a church fete?<br>It's when he was introduced to Paul McCartney.<br>Correct. Well done.<br>And finally, which respected New <br>Zealand journalist and music critic  <br>shares his birthday with Global Beatles Day?<br>Now who would that be?<br>I better celebrate on Global <br>Beatles Day my own birthday.<br>Yes. Happy birthday.<br>Thank you very much.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
