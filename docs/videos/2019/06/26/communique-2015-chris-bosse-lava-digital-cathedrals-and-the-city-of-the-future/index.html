because we<br>change the data we change the place we<br>change everything and you are here the<br>weather is terrible but you are here so<br>thank you very much for coming tonight<br>the second lecture of these are<br>communique 2015 and I think will be<br>rewarding so the effort and that were<br>speaker tonight is Chris process you<br>know and Chris is that the one of the<br>directors of lava the laboratory for<br>visionary architecture founded in 2007<br>together with Tobias Valley sir and<br>Alexander Rick and these are<br>award-winning practice has won numerous<br>international competitions and words and<br>its projects are published widely<br>amongst other important projects lava<br>design the city centre plan for the co2<br>neutral master city plant in Abu Dhabi<br>by Foster as you know the Michael<br>Schumacher tower in Abu Dhabi the future<br>hotel prototype in Duisburg and a new<br>university master plan in Saudi Arabia I<br>think that you will kind of give an<br>overview about your work so behind the<br>success of these affirm as they say is a<br>main nature and technology indeed lava<br>combines a digital workflow nature's of<br>structural principles in the latest<br>digital fabrication technologies to<br>achieve more with less more architecture<br>with less my<br>Tyrael energy time-cost so back to our<br>speaker he was educated in Germany and<br>Switzerland we just found out that we<br>were at a certain time more or less in<br>the same University in Switzerland and<br>he's a word winning design a project I<br>have one boss an international<br>reputation as a new generation architect<br>who pushes the boundaries of traditional<br>structure and architecture by digital<br>and experimental form finding whilst<br>associate architect @ PTW in sydney basa<br>was a key designer of the Beijing<br>Olympic Water Cube the following year he<br>received the emerging architect our IBA<br>a word and in 2012 at the perspectives<br>40 under 40 for Asia's raising design<br>stars alongside his architectural<br>practice bosses adjunct professor at the<br>University of Technology in Sydney and<br>lectures worldwide tonight Lisa will<br>share lessons from novice work around<br>the globe balancing cutting a design<br>with sustainability and the contemporary<br>client expectation please join me in<br>fantastic thank you so much for the<br>introduction and it was really funny to<br>find out that we spent some time at the<br>same University I was student at the<br>time and you were teaching and I think<br>it was a couple of years after I left so<br>that was in in Switzerland in mint ratio<br>which is this interesting school you<br>know Switzerland has different so this<br>is this is an audio test if you can hear<br>me scream if you can't and Switzerland<br>has different regions with different<br>languages in different cultures so<br>there's an Italian part in Switzerland<br>there's a French part there's a German<br>part and a part that they call romance<br>which is a language there's kind of a<br>mix between all other four languages but<br>that has nothing to do with this lecture<br>and I will start right now the lecture<br>is called digital cathedrals and the<br>city of the future and I want to firstly<br>talk a little bit about lava how we were<br>set up and about my partners and how we<br>collaborate with other firms we set up<br>in 2007 which is now I believe seven or<br>even eight years ago this year and I was<br>living in Sydney in Australia since 2002<br>where had moved pretty much two years<br>after I finished University I had met<br>two guys at the Venice Biennale who come<br>from Germany as well and we were kind of<br>thinking along similar lines and so when<br>we started lava we set up three offices<br>from the beginning so one in Sydney in<br>Australia where I live one in Stuttgart<br>in Germany where I come from and the<br>third one was in Abu Dhabi in the United<br>Arab Emirates where our first project<br>was which kind of brought us together<br>you can see on on the world map that<br>there's quite a few time zones going on<br>and the nice thing about that is that<br>you can<br>to work around the clock around the<br>globe the disadvantage of course is that<br>you want to go home at 6 or 7 o'clock<br>and your partner just starts getting up<br>and kind of downloading everything but<br>it has been a very interesting<br>experience and being kind of I mean you<br>see Sydney here is at the bottom right<br>of the world map and I think Auckland<br>hasn't met it made it onto this map<br>unfortunately but so we're a little bit<br>remote here compared to the rest of the<br>world but I found that since I came to<br>Sydney I have traveled a lot more I have<br>communicated a lot more and the whole<br>world has changed in a way where you can<br>all of sudden speak daily to people<br>around the world on skype on WeChat on<br>Worksop and the Internet has really<br>brought people together in a completely<br>different way I was reading a Harry<br>Sadler book the other day when he<br>designed Australia Square I think in<br>1971 or something in here an italian<br>engineer and nervy at the time and so he<br>had to draw up all the architectural<br>drawings and then put them onto in an<br>envelope onto a board that traveled to<br>Italy for three weeks the Nervii would<br>open the drawings mark them up send them<br>back so you can imagine what kind of<br>information exchange that is compared to<br>today where you literally do all this in<br>real time talking about the kind of<br>architects of the past this is always<br>the architect Frank Lloyd Wright who saw<br>himself as this god-given architect you<br>know the master architect surrounded by<br>his disciples and it was a very much<br>top-down approach the master kind of<br>does the master sketch and everybody<br>else works out what that sketch actually<br>meant we believe that in the 21st<br>century when you talk about architecture<br>but if you talk about design and<br>creativity at large then we think of<br>that more of a design universe where the<br>architect is part of this universe and<br>an essential part and maybe even in the<br>center of the universe but there's a lot<br>of different other disciplines that are<br>involved with architecture and design<br>and creativity and the role of the<br>architect then really not becomes doing<br>the master sketch and everybody else's<br>follows the sketch but the role becomes<br>the coordinator of all these creative<br>disciplines to bring Estela alignment<br>into the project so different from a<br>conductor this is Herbert von Karajan a<br>famous conductor who was well known for<br>conducting his orchestra down to the<br>control-freak so to speak we believe<br>that a contemporary practice is more<br>like a jazz band where you have experts<br>and all of you experts in something or<br>would become experts in something and<br>you all contribute different parts to a<br>practice and to a project and everybody<br>has the time to shine as long as you<br>play the same tune and that's really<br>what's beautiful about jazz so this is<br>the lava trio to be us Alexandra and<br>myself in 2008 at the Venice Biennale<br>this is a more recent picture in 2014 so<br>the Venice Biennale is really a great<br>time every two years to to reconvene and<br>to reposition ourselves and so we made<br>it for at least seven years but this is<br>really what I'm talking about when I'm<br>talking about this kind of network<br>practice and this is me in 2004 I<br>believe together with some director from<br>PTW architects but also with a Chinese<br>design institute called CSC EC and the<br>China state and Construction Engineering<br>Corporation and it shows you how many<br>different people you can actually<br>collaborate with and how important it is<br>to work with different disciplines so on<br>any given project we would work with<br>people like Tran Sola who sustainability<br>consultants people like realities United<br>who specialized in interactive media<br>facades and communication people like<br>design sport who we just submitted and<br>the stadium competition in Doha with so<br>all these people you know architects<br>always think they have to know<br>everything but we can't possibly know<br>everything one day we design a hospital<br>one day a childcare center<br>on one day a chair so how do you know<br>everything about all these things and<br>the key to that is really being open to<br>collaboration communication and embrace<br>that design universe so maybe then a<br>graphic of how these projects and these<br>teams relate and would look a little bit<br>like that just some pictures from our<br>various offices in Stuttgart in Berlin<br>and in the Sydney office that we just<br>moved into central park and the new<br>development I don't know if you've heard<br>of the Jonah bell tower with the green<br>facade that's directly opposite and the<br>white rabbit gallery and contemporary<br>Chinese art gallery so this is just the<br>inside of office with a little bit of<br>green in that kind of where hostile fit<br>out and these are just some shots this<br>is a recent project where we took a team<br>photo and just to show you it's not<br>necessarily about me or to be as<br>Alexandre it's about all these people<br>and the people actually constantly<br>change I haven't got the exact figures<br>but over the last eight years we would<br>have had hundreds of different people<br>this is an important photo for me this<br>is I call this our Chinese office but<br>you can see it's actually the car of Our<br>client and it's the kind of car and you<br>know that has a sofa and a lounge I'm<br>surprised that it doesn't have a spa but<br>China is so big that setting up an<br>office in China is like saying I set up<br>an office in Europe so do you put it to<br>Sweden or to Sicily China is so vast in<br>terms of the different regions the<br>different languages the different<br>cultures the different climates that we<br>in China are incredibly mobile and we<br>have to be mobile and China has become a<br>very important part of our practice and<br>of I think everybody's practice and just<br>to put that in perspective I always talk<br>about the number<br>I don't even know and I apologize how<br>many inhabitants New Zealand has but<br>Australia has 22 million I think and<br>China has 1.4 billion so enter China -<br>enter Australia still one point three<br>eight billion so it's almost no<br>difference and that tells you in terms<br>of the size of a market or impact on the<br>world in terms of in terms of building<br>infrastructure in terms of energy in<br>terms of you know producing produce etc<br>all of sudden Australia and New Zealand<br>in a critical geographical location and<br>I think culturally we're part of<br>asia-pacific and that becomes more and<br>more evident and I've just arrived in<br>Auckland so I haven't really solved that<br>all in but in Sydney certainly over the<br>last 10 years it has become a lot more<br>Asian than it used to be it's been the<br>scan of anglo-saxon City which is of<br>course to do with the with the history<br>but Sydney is really part of Asia and I<br>would dare to say that New Zealand is as<br>well<br>we love building models and we love<br>working on different platforms so we<br>build physical models we work with<br>computers we use 3d printers you<br>probably have a few of those here so ten<br>years ago this was a an emerging<br>technology five years ago these machines<br>cost twenty thousand dollars today you<br>can buy one I think for five hundred<br>dollars and it's interesting how that<br>changes the world and changes not only<br>architecture but everything from art to<br>medicine so this is a 3d print for<br>example of a kind of undefined object<br>which could be anything from a piece of<br>jewelry to a piece of furniture to a<br>contemporary piece of architecture the<br>concert hall or something<br>when we talk about inspiration then we<br>like to talk about this relationship<br>between nature technology and humankind<br>and our relationship with nature is that<br>nature<br>obviously has developed over millions of<br>years and the principles of nature<br>haven't actually changed technology<br>however changes on such a incremental<br>speed that we are now you know that the<br>telephone that you carry around with<br>yourself it contains a computer that 20<br>years ago wouldn't even have been<br>invented and ten years ago would have<br>been only one on the planet owned by<br>NASA<br>so it's unbelievable what technologies<br>have been developed over the last years<br>and people say that in the last or in<br>the next 10 20 years all inventions of<br>the world so far will have been<br>reinvented again so the number of<br>inventions is exponential so I think<br>that nature is the element that balances<br>us and that that keeps us really<br>connected to to the land to geography to<br>Sun to water to energy and I think that<br>technology is something that because it<br>constantly changes we need to build<br>buildings that constantly adapt and<br>change and integrate these technologies<br>and humankind of course being being our<br>client mostly or what we are designed<br>for is is trying to balance these two<br>aspects so there are people who say<br>let's go back to nature I don't want any<br>of this new technology and try to kind<br>of separate themselves from everything<br>that is new this is kind of one trend<br>but I think it's a very short-lived kind<br>of nostalgic trend other people are<br>completely immersed in technology and<br>completely deny the existence of nature<br>and natural environments but that is<br>also very single sided and we believe if<br>we can really bring these two things<br>together into a new kind of hybrid form<br>of architecture of design and<br>all other aspects of life then that<br>really expresses the world that we live<br>in this is my favorite building of all<br>times it's designed in 1972 and by<br>architect engineer Frei Otto and if you<br>haven't heard of Frei Otto he actually<br>received the Pritzker award last week<br>two days after he passed away<br>unfortunately but at the age of 90 I<br>believe and Frei Otto what's amazing<br>about this building is this was built in<br>1972 and Frei Otto coined the<br>terminology of form finding as opposed<br>to designing so he would say I don't<br>design the finished product but I<br>designed the process to find the<br>finished product and that would again<br>involve all sorts of different<br>collaborators but collaborators also<br>that are designed models that are soap<br>bubbles for example so he would do a lot<br>of experiments with nature and in nature<br>and try to translate things from nature<br>into architecture into engineering and<br>hence the result here is a building that<br>doesn't even look like a building it<br>looks like a landscape it's kind of a<br>cloud roof that hovers over a topography<br>and I find it incredibly contemporary<br>when you think that it's 43 years old so<br>learning from nature and learning from<br>you know patterns in nature from<br>organization in nature this really<br>unlimited inspiration when you look at<br>the rain forests or the different you<br>know strata levels different species how<br>they all coexist with each other and<br>when you look at things like the Great<br>Barrier Reef that is really the the<br>biggest living organism on the planet<br>and visible from space so we like to<br>think that these are kind of metaphors<br>for today's cities and ways of we could<br>today organize ourselves and within<br>these<br>ecosystems you find creatures and of<br>course these creatures are perfectly<br>adapted to the environment as well and<br>it's really amazing when you look into<br>that in greater detail and what kind of<br>geometries you find what kind of colors<br>you find and when you look into what<br>these geometries do where they come from<br>where the colors come from then you find<br>that they're really the ability of<br>adaptation of a millions of years to an<br>environment and buildings are pretty<br>much still straight boxes when you look<br>at technologies that come from other<br>disciplines technology this is a toy<br>this dog and even the dog is like 10 15<br>years old now the idea of building a<br>robot dog that kind of responds to you<br>that you know gets the newspaper in the<br>morning for you that barks at strangers<br>and that kind of reacts to your emotions<br>it's amazing that someone would develop<br>a toy like that and at the same time you<br>know biology medicine nanotechnology<br>there's all these things that are<br>incredibly developed and much more<br>sophisticated than contemporary<br>architecture contemporary architecture<br>seems to be stuck in modernism hence our<br>modernism was here one of the greatest<br>high-rise towers in the world built in<br>New York in the 60s which was based on<br>inventions like the curtain wall facade<br>the air condition and the elevator but<br>at the end of the day it's an extruded<br>box with an applied facade so it's<br>hermetically sealed and there's no<br>transition between inside and outside so<br>when you're inside that building you<br>have no idea of what the weather is<br>because the facade is put it in the<br>glass the temperature is constant<br>humidity is concerned and you have<br>absolutely no contact between inside and<br>outside you have to constantly<br>air-conditioned you have to constantly<br>electrically light the building and so<br>in a way as fantastic as this invention<br>is it's kind of the opposite of what<br>what we would consider like a natural<br>kind of way of living and when you look<br>at the human skin or the plant skin or<br>the enema<br>skin then it's all about this transition<br>between inside/outside adaptation to<br>humidity temperature air pressure etc<br>essentially mediating external and<br>internal forces and if architecture<br>could get around these kind of ideas<br>where you use technology to emulate<br>principles from nature then I believe we<br>put result in smarter more<br>environmentally friendly and more<br>pleasant environment and taking this<br>from the building skin to structure you<br>know investigations and that's the kind<br>of stuff that Frei Otto would do<br>investigating in nature how nature build<br>structures and as you would appreciate<br>there's not many straight lines in<br>nature so why are most buildings and<br>most engineering kind of systems based<br>on straight lines systems what I call<br>systems here kind of evolutionary<br>systems when you look at a school of<br>fish you know thousands of fish that are<br>all working together as a school and<br>they're all reacting to the external<br>forces but they are still individuals<br>why can't we develop building components<br>that are smart building components that<br>the overall building is not just a pile<br>of bricks which are all like relatively<br>simple and damp elements but a holistic<br>system where all the elements talk to<br>each other and all contribute to each<br>other the brick essentially is the same<br>brick that the pyramids were built with<br>thousands of years ago that we now build<br>our houses and suburbs with and we<br>believe there's potential for bricks to<br>collect water to produce energy to<br>mediate humidity etc and so on and so<br>forth new materials usually don't come<br>from the building industry they come<br>from other industries they come from the<br>space industry they come from the car<br>industry and only slowly trickle into<br>architecture but when they actually do<br>then they can be breakthroughs and one<br>example is for example I don't know if I<br>can laser point with this this material<br>here which is the ETF<br>a material that we used for the Aquatic<br>Center in Beijing which I will use as an<br>example later so having said all this I<br>want to show you this as a little<br>showcase this project was designed and<br>built during my time at PDW architects<br>in Sydney I spent my first 5 years in<br>Australia there from 2002 to 2007 and<br>when I started we started the<br>competition pretty much after a couple<br>of months and I had just come from<br>Stuttgart where fry auto was teaching<br>the Institute of lightweight structures<br>and we were all about structures in<br>nature so bubbles form coral reefs etc<br>and so that was one of the ideas that I<br>could bring to the project and which<br>became ultimately the competition<br>winning idea this is just a quick master<br>plan to position if you've been to<br>Beijing so you know there's the<br>Forbidden City in the center of Beijing<br>and then there's the central axis that<br>goes all the way up to the Olympic Park<br>this was the Aquatic Centre in the<br>competition brief and this was the<br>national stadium and the competition<br>brief now known as the bird nest and we<br>settled during the competition on this<br>idea of circle and square which is a<br>very Chinese kind of interpretation<br>where you kind of try to Palace contrast<br>balance contrasts so circle and square<br>red and blue fire and water<br>yin and yang those kind of and elements<br>and I obviously I will only show this<br>briefly here I could talk about this<br>forever but having settled on a Blue<br>Square we looked at the internet<br>essentially so you know 20 years ago you<br>would have gone to the regional library<br>looked at a couple of books maybe see if<br>we can order a few more books in but<br>today it's kind of 30 seconds and you<br>have these kind of results and if you<br>type in bubbles so we looked at nature<br>and together with our engineering<br>ah rope found that there's these<br>geometries that are actually hidden<br>between the arrangement of salt bubbles<br>so we wanted to build a box of bubbles<br>and what I didn't know in that detail<br>but what we found out is that physicists<br>from around the world for hundreds of<br>years have investigated this geometry of<br>form it's not something that you get up<br>every morning and think today I resolved<br>the physics of form but Lord Kelvin for<br>example did in 1873 come up with a<br>certain system and 20 years later<br>sorry 120 years later two people from<br>Ireland came up with another form model<br>which is this one here so-called we are<br>feel and formed and so the idea behind<br>this is that if you try to subdivide<br>three-dimensional space into equally<br>sized geometrical elements then you<br>ultimately come up with two different<br>polygons 12 sided polygons and a 14<br>sided polygon that you can tile<br>infinitely in space and it doesn't leave<br>any gaps in between sounds very<br>complicated but is actually very simple<br>if you fill the box with tennis balls<br>then they will all sit there nice and<br>tight but between the tennis balls you<br>have gaps and engineers had gaps because<br>it's space that you can't define with<br>this foam model you fill all the gaps<br>and all of a sudden you have a<br>mathematical model a theoretical model<br>of form and so this was our first 3d<br>print of this theoretical form and while<br>this looks like something that you would<br>find somewhere on the beach in Auckland<br>it's in fact 100% man-made 3d printed<br>100% repetitive mathematical structure<br>and so when Frei Otto in the 70s did<br>these kind of experiments he did it<br>manually and he found that when you try<br>to build form in three dimensions that<br>there's a lot of deviations between the<br>different form molecules so after 10 or<br>15 or 20 molecules they calculate<br>become so complicated and the physical<br>model becomes so distorted that becomes<br>uncontrollable in 2002 or 2003 when we<br>did this competition<br>now with computation we found that we<br>can build infinite amounts of this<br>theoretical form we can put it into an<br>Excel spreadsheet we can develop<br>three-dimensional models and this can<br>actually then become the mother model<br>for everybody involved in the project so<br>it becomes like a virtual prototype for<br>structure for the steel manufacturer for<br>the hydraulic engineer for the downpipes<br>the amount of rain water for fire<br>security etc etc and that is really<br>something that the last two decades have<br>brought to us or even just the last<br>decade interesting of course when you're<br>building in China that China has had an<br>extremely steep learning curve over the<br>last ten years but in 2003 you know we<br>have this amazing sophisticated 3d<br>virtual reality model but the realities<br>on the construction side there's people<br>with piece of steel and and you know as<br>fear and and the stake and welded<br>together by hand so that was a very<br>interesting period to translate the 3d<br>model and the 3d printed model into<br>reality with the help of essentially<br>pre-cut steel elements that came onto<br>the construction site or labeled and or<br>positioned and are cut to size and then<br>have 400 people that got trained inside<br>to weld these things together and I was<br>surprised sometimes to find these<br>manually written notes as if someone in<br>22,000 elements can just write down the<br>number of the steel elements but<br>magically and this is obviously kind of<br>cutting a long story short we built this<br>structure that is made of 22,000<br>elements a structure that is 180 meters<br>long and 35 meters high that is based on<br>this we're feeling foam from the two<br>Irish professors and that is now<br>recognized as the most efficient<br>three-dimensional subtly<br>of space following this theoretical<br>model and what you find is that the<br>structures actually extremely light and<br>extremely transparent in particular when<br>you look at it through the structure at<br>the bird nest in the background so these<br>two things were really shaping up at the<br>same time as these very stark contrasts<br>one kind of very heavy and very kind of<br>dominant and one kind of very filigree<br>and very light this steel structure is<br>then wrapped into a plastic skin and I<br>say plastic skin it's obviously a very<br>sophisticated high-tech material that<br>was developed by NASA for space<br>application and what it is it's a<br>plastic film that can be inflated and by<br>inflation it assumes structural<br>properties and you can build shapes or<br>panels of up to nine meters of this<br>material so you can imagine this entire<br>lecture hall would have one single panel<br>as a roof which is transparent inflated<br>point one millimeter thick plastic and<br>that created essentially a kind of<br>wintergarden effect a cavity between two<br>layers of this material and within this<br>cavity the air can be heated or cooled<br>by the Sun heated naturally heated<br>artificially heated and that energy can<br>be used then to heat or cool the<br>internal space and this is one of these<br>panels this is a mock-up in one to two<br>just to give you an idea of dimensions<br>and so piece by piece<br>these elements went onto the facade and<br>it's worthwhile pointing out here that<br>this is one complete set of geometries<br>that were used and then the geometry is<br>repeat so it's not 6,000 different<br>bubbles on the facade it's 16 I think<br>different bubbles on the facade and<br>because the 3d model is a repetitive<br>model we called it an apparently random<br>but repetitive model they they repeat<br>they rotate and mirror but you can<br>essentially prefabricate them and then<br>build them up correctly outside in 2004<br>I believe we won the venice biennale<br>award for this project which was quite<br>surprising because it wasn't even built<br>yet but when it was built in 2007 one<br>year ahead of schedule and you could<br>really see how how all these ideas of<br>structure from nature lightweight a lot<br>of light and a lot of air in the<br>building came through in reality and a<br>couple of spaces within the building<br>already my favorite spaces and that's<br>maybe where this Cathedral the digital<br>theater comes from because the<br>cathedrals were always this space where<br>humankind really pushed the boundaries<br>of what is possible to construct and and<br>kind of express their time in a in a<br>built form of you know art architecture<br>excellent engineering excellence and<br>what you really see here is something<br>that is 100% structure but it's also a<br>hundred percent architecture and the<br>facade and destruction of the<br>architecture all becomes one and the<br>same thing so there's no decoration in<br>this building there's nothing that is<br>added just because it looks good there's<br>nothing that you can take away<br>everything is integral part of it and<br>that gives you really this contemporary<br>expression and I mean what we do as<br>architect is kind of trying to express<br>the time that we live in and try to be<br>as contemporary as we can be so I'm<br>always getting upset when counselors for<br>example asked us to design Art Deco<br>buildings in Bondi Beach because Art<br>Deco is obviously a style from 1920s<br>which was fantastic at the time the<br>latest craftsmanship latest materiality<br>latest everything but it was hundred<br>years ago so if you do if you want if<br>someone asks you to do an Art Deco<br>building then try to apply the<br>principles from 100 years ago and make<br>it look like it is actually 2015 the<br>Olympics came and the buildings were<br>finished and very popular with the<br>public very popular with the athletes as<br>well when you if you watch the Olympics<br>and I think in the pool every single<br>world record in swimming was broken that<br>year and obviously that's not because of<br>the building alone but I think if you're<br>an athlete and entering a space like<br>that this is taken from the 10 meter<br>diving board and they're kind of<br>standing in front of this then you know<br>you feel like it's 2008 and you want to<br>break the world record and so I hope<br>that the building kind of keeps its<br>freshness and it's still standing now<br>which is seven years later time flies<br>it's crazy but the building is still<br>very well used this was the perspective<br>from 2003 from the competition and this<br>is the finished building and I'm just<br>showing this tool because in the<br>competition obviously we didn't want to<br>show something which is just kind of a<br>concept that never works but we really<br>had a virtual prototype where everything<br>was worked out to a degree that it was<br>100% beautiful and that's why we had to<br>change very little during the<br>construction process and also because<br>you can't actually change anything so<br>every time someone said oh we have to<br>put a pitched roof on it<br>we have to<br>you know simplify the facade there's<br>nothing that you can simplify or change<br>because everything is perfect<br>as it is at night it lights up like a<br>lantern with LED lights the individual<br>bubbles are illuminated and and that's<br>probably one of the reasons of its<br>popularity as well because at night it<br>really this bad photo but it really kind<br>of shines like a you know when you go<br>through an Asian city it's all about<br>lighting and about this interactivity<br>and since then the building has become a<br>bit of a celebrity and it's almost<br>embarrassing sometimes but there's these<br>books it's been on the cover of<br>architecture now and now there's this<br>merchandise shops and I'm just going to<br>flick through them quickly so you can be<br>completely dressed in Water Cube outfits<br>from t-shirts to Shahs to beanies to<br>jump us you can buy a Swarovski special<br>edition you can buy the Water Cube<br>telephone I haven't worked out yet how<br>to dial on this but certainly looks good<br>there's you know artists inspired<br>there's swimwear and there's this<br>swimwear I don't know swimwear design<br>competition or something here at the<br>Water Cube and so the building is used<br>for all sorts of things like that I<br>don't know if you had the pleasure of<br>drinking rice wine Baiju and so there's<br>a special bottle of the water cube<br>filled with 2008 by jewel which is kind<br>of very popular Chinese drink and yeah<br>bed sheets and so you can imagine my<br>home watches<br>and bathroom tiles and just maybe<br>worthwhile pointing out we of course<br>didn't receive a single cent from all<br>this and then there were buildings<br>popping up inspired by the Water Cube<br>you know restaurants and cafes this is a<br>day spa I think in Chongqing and someone<br>sent me this photo of this casino in<br>Macau where they thought why don't we<br>just copy the entire building so this is<br>literally a complete copy of the Water<br>Cube in Macau I haven't been there<br>myself but it's yeah it's a little bit<br>beyond me but it's kind of a compliment<br>because you know the pyramids have made<br>it into a casino the Eiffel Tower<br>I think entire Venice is kind of a<br>casino in Las Vegas the why not the<br>water cube the real water cube in the<br>meantime has turned into a public<br>swimming pool into a Leisure Pool so you<br>can now buy a ticket for I think 50 RMB<br>and take your family into the wave pool<br>and down the rides and all these funny<br>things this was designed before the<br>Olympics for the post Olympic condition<br>and we had some design involvement but<br>you can kind of see that the leisure<br>park designers kind of took it on<br>themselves but I think it's actually<br>it's a fun experience and since then<br>there's things like the what is this the<br>Formula One Championship around bird<br>nest and Water Cube and now there's<br>lighting artists who programs the Water<br>Cube and somehow you can send<br>interactive messages to the building and<br>then changes color according to the mood<br>of the people around it the building has<br>apparently become the second biggest<br>tourist attraction after the Great Wall<br>which I personally find hard to believe<br>but that's what people say you know<br>every Chinese there's a Chinese saying<br>which I can't say in Chinese but it says<br>that every man has to climb on the Great<br>Wall in his life and so now apparently<br>why do you do that you might as well<br>visit the Olympic site and so the other<br>day I don't know if you<br>watch that on television that's the APEC<br>conference so you had Putin and Obama<br>and this guy to know if you know him<br>they were off at the Water Cube and they<br>were all finally dressed in this amazing<br>outfit and so in the media that was<br>widespread so they anticipated the APEC<br>conference by about fifty years back<br>then and this is probably where they all<br>stayed this is the hotel next to the<br>Water Cube where he can have a room with<br>few on the Water Cube roof and you can<br>actually see that even the roof has<br>bubbles and you can't imagine the amount<br>of conversations we had about that<br>because everybody here under<br>construction processes are we just<br>bought kara gated metal on it but then<br>it turned out that everything else that<br>he wanted to put on there was too heavy<br>because it was designed for lightweight<br>ETFE which weighs a 1 percent of the<br>weight of glass so he couldn't replace<br>it with anything else and yeah so<br>there's lots of stories about how that<br>actually works with saffron and rain and<br>she can imagine trying to get water off<br>180 180 meters surface and ventilation<br>so these things popped out for<br>ventilation where the cores are but at<br>the end of the day the whole thing was<br>wrapped in one single plastic skin and<br>survived till now and lights up at night<br>even the roof yeah this is the last<br>picture of this building this is Michael<br>Phelps breaking the world record and<br>what was amazing that they had cameras<br>actually underwater so you could kind of<br>follow the swimmers in the pool and<br>looking at the water cube roof and the<br>only people apparently who didn't like<br>it was the backstroke swimmers because<br>they're used to swim in long straight<br>lines<br>thank you they didn't know where to swim<br>anymore<br>so that was the Water Cube and obviously<br>people always ask me back then now what<br>are you gonna do you know building the<br>Olympic swimming pool for the Beijing<br>Olympics the greatest pool for the<br>greatest nation what you do afterwards<br>so no pressure but we've been working<br>since then so since 2008 on on a large<br>amount of projects around the world and<br>I'm just going to show a couple of them<br>just for you to to get an idea of the<br>type of projects that we're doing this<br>for example is a hotel resort in Mexico<br>which is kind of on a floating island<br>and this is a project for the German<br>government the Green Climate Fund<br>headquarters if we've been to Germany<br>generally government buildings look a<br>little bit like that and so now it's<br>very brave of the German government to<br>take on a design like this to represent<br>Germany in 2015 as opposed to 1960 and<br>so it's a new kind of topology for an<br>office building that lets a lot of light<br>and air into the building that is based<br>on communication and on accidentally<br>meeting people in the staircase you know<br>I have traditional German office<br>building you get into the lift go to<br>your floor go out hope that nobody sees<br>you and go into your office and then<br>come out at 5:30 but this building<br>forces you to move your body go up and<br>down talk to people see light see air<br>have contact with nature and it's<br>immersed in the park so it's going to be<br>an exciting new experience and this is a<br>of this building and that gives me a<br>30-second break to have a sip of water<br>this probably sounds attached super<br>there's actually an amazing I'm always<br>surprised this is a professional and<br>rendering company and and it's amazing<br>what they can do with the information<br>that you provide them so this is like a<br>Hollywood movie based on one of our 3d<br>so the times where you could win a<br>competition with a couple of hand<br>sketches like you and also on apparently<br>with the Opera House<br>and following on from that is another<br>project in Jeju Island in Korea a<br>large-scale hotel it is kind of formed<br>like a volcano because the entire island<br>is volcanic and we thought that the only<br>way to put such a big development on to<br>such a small island is literally making<br>it part of the island and of the<br>topography but I'm just going to skip<br>through these quickly this is a project<br>in Ethiopia in North East Africa and<br>another competition that we won and<br>obviously we don't win every competition<br>in the opposite it's probably our 99 to<br>1 kind of success rate or 1 to 99<br>success rate but the ones that we do win<br>we usually have put a lot of effort in<br>and usually I find that the<br>competition's that we win<br>internationally are the ones where we<br>really try to understand the task at<br>hand and try to understand the culture<br>that we're actually designing for and<br>the economic and environmental and so on<br>framework rather than just transplanting<br>some previously designed thing onto a<br>site and so this being in North Africa<br>and in Ethiopia is obviously a<br>relatively emerging country relatively<br>poor country but has its own kind of<br>arts and culture and artifacts and<br>colors and economy and topography<br>geography and we wanted to build a very<br>low-cost Stadium and so the idea is that<br>if you sink in the grandstand into the<br>ground then you already have a natural<br>Stadium which is actually a very old<br>idea because the ancient Greek and Roman<br>stadia were built like that so this is<br>the first kind of rank then all you have<br>to build is the upper tiers to get your<br>stadium and then you wrap it into a<br>lightweight skin and if you have money<br>then you put a roof to cover the seeds<br>from the environment there was the first<br>strategy which I think was positively<br>received and the second strategy was<br>that most of the competitors put one big<br>stadium top bird nest in the center of<br>the site and said okay that's it don't<br>worry about the rest we try to<br>understand what this part of the city<br>actually means and try to incorporate<br>existing sporting facilities sports<br>academy and existing kind of athletic<br>track and try to kind of weave a sports<br>precinct into the city that includes<br>sports hotel training facilities public<br>swimming pools<br>you know tennis courts etc in a way that<br>you actually create a park that is not<br>only a stadium that is active when<br>there's a Metron but a part that is<br>really a gift to the city and the facade<br>is kind of a lightweight skin that<br>reflects the national colors that could<br>be while it's designed with contemporary<br>technologies with Rhino and grasshopper<br>and scripting it could be actually built<br>out of local fibers and local kind of<br>weaving strategies by local craftspeople<br>relatively economically and that somehow<br>resonated with local people and with the<br>local jury and thought of I don't know<br>how many entries we won the first prize<br>this is now two years ago and nothing is<br>easy and building a stadium in Africa is<br>certainly not easy there's a lot of<br>political difficulties there's the<br>president was the client originally<br>subsequently passed away after the<br>competition which didn't help and now<br>there's all sorts of political forces<br>trying to bring another stadium in<br>instead of this but it's a project that<br>is very close to her and Gregor just<br>walked in they have a number of projects<br>in Ethiopia which you would have seen<br>last week if you were here same time<br>same place<br>it's certainly interesting working in<br>Africa and it's certainly completely<br>different from working in in kind of<br>Germany and Australia so I'm just in the<br>quick projects that I want to flick<br>through this was the Michael Schumacher<br>tower that was mentioned before this was<br>one of our first projects this is what I<br>call a pre-crisis project 2007 and Dubai<br>was going berserk with a new projects<br>left right center and architecture was<br>almost becoming a branding exercise you<br>know how can you name the next tower and<br>how can you make it different from the<br>other 500 towers that are exactly on the<br>same location so Michael Schumacher the<br>Formula One driver at the time was<br>approached by a marketing company and to<br>launch<br>Michael Schumacher world championship<br>tower as a brand and so we had the<br>interesting task to translate all these<br>brand values of Michael Schumacher which<br>is like speed elegance high tech and so<br>on into into a residential tower and<br>then Marcus Schumacher came to the press<br>conference and kind of five minutes<br>before the presentations like okay so<br>tell me something about this building so<br>we hit then we kind of tried to<br>summarize it yeah and there's a mm-hmm<br>and there's penthouses and you have a<br>360-degree view how many degrees was a<br>bit like that but essentially the tower<br>was a tower I'm standing in a marina so<br>the idea was that you can park your boat<br>inside the tower and then it has this<br>continuous curvature like sculpture<br>where every year floor plan is actually<br>different and on top of these penthouses<br>and in between you have these<br>ventilation slots and balconies this is<br>where you you know if you have<br>everything in the world<br>then you need a speedboat and then you<br>need an apartment where you can park<br>your speedboat and the reason why I call<br>it pre-crisis Tower it's probably quite<br>obvious this was in 2008 the tower was<br>launched at the dubai city scape<br>exhibition along with 400 other towers<br>on on this island and about six months<br>later the crisis hit and none of these<br>towers went anywhere<br>and the project was put to bed to rest I<br>should say I talked about a FRA Otto<br>earlier and about this idea of form<br>finding and this is actually one of Frei<br>Otto's experiments when you dip to soap<br>to wires into soap film and you pull up<br>the wires and the surface that would be<br>formed between the wires it's referred<br>to as a minimal surface so it's kind of<br>a mathematical equation but you can do<br>it very playfully and everybody has<br>played with soap bubbles before but it's<br>interesting that in such playful manner<br>you would find something that is<br>stronger more efficient and lighter than<br>anything that you would have designed<br>yourself and a lot of Architects are<br>struggling with this idea where you try<br>to design something that is super cool<br>and then you're trying to build it but<br>you haven't thought about what is the<br>material part of the structure work how<br>does keep the water out and how do all<br>these things work together and this is<br>kind of thinking the other way around<br>where you think with this material what<br>can actually do and how can I find a<br>form that this material wants to be in<br>and so the father was from 1972 and<br>these are some projects that we kind of<br>did in the last ten years where we tried<br>to use this idea of minimal surface<br>computationally develop shapes in the<br>computer running scripts over them to<br>form find the ideal shape so what we<br>design is not the shape we design the<br>connection points we feed the computer<br>of the piece connection points and then<br>the shape is the mathematical equation<br>of the minimal surface this is all done<br>with the lightweight material and so<br>this entire structure for example fits<br>into a sports bag and can be carried<br>around and you can build it up overnight<br>and what's really nice about this is<br>that you know if you try to build this<br>shape out of any other material out of<br>concrete out of timber out of metal you<br>would try and force these materials into<br>the shape and with fabric it naturally<br>flows into it<br>this was the MTV Awards stage design<br>with pink and was pink and this is a<br>little project in customshouse and<br>Sydney which is a heritage building and<br>we were commissioned to transform the<br>atrium of the heritage building but we<br>weren't allowed to touch it so we<br>designed again these connection points<br>and the connection points are aluminum<br>rings that are attached with fishing<br>lines around its heritage columns so the<br>actual structure doesn't touch and if<br>this works then you see a little video<br>of how the structure then overnight<br>and everything that goes up has to come<br>down after six months but you can see<br>how the material literally fits into<br>this bag and you know and I can't<br>remember now how many cubic meters of<br>space that was but to fill an entire<br>atrium with something that fits into a<br>bag and can be carried away is really a<br>nice thought and maybe exemplifies what<br>we were talking about earlier with this<br>more with less idea and so we're trying<br>to translate this idea of lightweight<br>membranes and membrane technologies into<br>architecture and in Sydney there's this<br>wonderful building from the 60s the UTS<br>tower and I'm sure in Auckland you have<br>a couple of thoughts as well the problem<br>is that and I was speaking about<br>nineteen sixties buildings before<br>promised that at the time they were<br>completely high-tech novel you know<br>invention of the lift invention of<br>air-conditioning invention of the<br>curtain wall facade mention of body<br>tinted glass like to clad all these<br>things that are fantastic but they're<br>not contemporary necessarily anymore<br>and buildings are very aesthetic<br>elements and it's very hard to make them<br>future open and so we were thinking<br>instead of now demolishing a tower like<br>this with all the embedded energy they<br>caused the disruption of teaching within<br>UTS star would there be a way of<br>actually transforming the tower by<br>adding extra layers to it and so the<br>idea was adding an extra skin and make<br>that skin the most intelligent skin that<br>the building today can be lightweight<br>membrane that can collect solar energy<br>collector in water can at night<br>communicate to the outside world and<br>what tower would be a better project<br>than at the university tower where you<br>have all these different disciplines<br>where you have fashion design lighting<br>design engineering climate engineering<br>structure architecture and so we pretty<br>much did this to entertain ourselves at<br>the time and I shouldn't say that I got<br>to we we did it more as a research<br>project than as a paid Commission<br>but research is entertaining and<br>interestingly it kind of caught on and a<br>lot of people were interested in it so<br>all of a sudden we had engineers come to<br>our office and say hey I thought about<br>your tower and you could really use it<br>for natural ventilation and you know you<br>could switch off the aircon and we could<br>make all these windows clear glass and<br>actually then you can start opening them<br>up and then you get an updraft here and<br>so all of a sudden you would transform<br>the building not only aesthetically but<br>you would completely climatically<br>transform it all of a sudden the<br>building would have a 21st century layer<br>layer that can change over time but it's<br>still extremely lightweight and<br>extremely cost-effective we built a<br>little model for an exhibition at object<br>gallery in Sydney and then we got a<br>phone call from Rio de Janeiro that we<br>had won the rescanning award 2010 which<br>we never had heard of before<br>but it's really interesting that there<br>are words like this because the entire<br>world is thinking about you know the<br>future of the city and the future of the<br>city is related to the past of the city<br>what do you do with all these buildings<br>do you just knock down every city every<br>20 years or other ways of actually<br>transforming cities in the future and so<br>inspired by that success we then build a<br>prototype even bigger this is in 1 2 3<br>prototype of a high-rise Tower which was<br>built at the design acts exhibition in<br>Sydney so we got sponsors for the steel<br>sponsors for the facade material and<br>sponsors for the lighting and well this<br>is not 100% perfect it gives you an idea<br>of what you can actually achieve with<br>lightweight materials on real scale in<br>real environments and so far we haven't<br>pulled off this tower yet but the idea<br>is certainly there and we're certainly<br>interested in taking that to the next<br>level another little story we got<br>approached two years ago by these two<br>people who wanted to set up a Creative<br>Writing Center in Redfern Sydney so<br>there are two ex journalists and they<br>thought why don't we teach our skills of<br>writing stories to children<br>so they rented a space which was a<br>pretty rundown space I don't know if<br>your written all Redfern in Sydney it's<br>kind of it's not the best part of town<br>but it's kind of emerging and they<br>commissioned a creative agency to come<br>up with the concept that the Creative<br>Writing Center is about creativity and<br>not a school so the creative agency came<br>up with this idea that we could call it<br>the Martian Embassy so you have have an<br>ambassador and you know you get your<br>passport stamped on your journey to Mars<br>and so when the kids come in they start<br>kind of talking about interesting<br>stories rather than talking about being<br>in school so that was the brief to us<br>brief was created Marshall embassy<br>create a shop where you can sell<br>merchandise and to finance the endeavor<br>and create the school to actually teach<br>we then kind of intuitively merge these<br>three things as you do into one<br>prioritizing the school and then came up<br>with all kind of ideas of rockets and<br>you know all the big novels of our times<br>that have inspired us since childhood<br>Moby Dick time machine and then we came<br>up with this race in the concept that is<br>actually so simple that you can draw it<br>you know into sand on the beach that<br>there's these three spaces they are<br>connected into one continuous space and<br>then they're sliced like an MRI scan<br>essentially that could be easily<br>translated into a 3d model into a<br>physical model and it could be built out<br>of one single material so this is a<br>physical model and the physical model is<br>built from the same 3d model that the<br>final building or the final interior<br>most spirit from which is plywood as a<br>material and as you can see all surfaces<br>the wall of the ceiling the furniture<br>and the Sherriff storage reception desk<br>everything was made out of the same<br>material and so the 3d model was<br>essentially unwrapped onto drawing<br>sheets onto CNC cutters<br>it's that were sent to a CNC cutter this<br>is the first prototype with our builder<br>here and one-to-one and in the meantime<br>the story factory the clients made this<br>little movie for fundraising and so the<br>little movie is about an Aboriginal kid<br>that probably doesn't have the greatest<br>future on the path that it's currently<br>traveling on and what would happen if<br>you actually unleash the the kind of<br>hidden forces within these kids which is<br>creativity what have you tap into that<br>creativity teach him a few things and<br>then could prepare that kid into a<br>completely different future which is<br>really what they're trying to do with<br>the Martian Embassy that video clip<br>featured these two julia gillard and<br>tony abbott and then the media story was<br>that the Martian embassy is the only<br>thing they have agreed on which was good<br>and helped the client to raise funds<br>from all these people so this whole<br>thing is a charity so the engineers the<br>architects the Builder even the flag<br>would supply everything was donated our<br>time was donated everybody else's time<br>was donated and for the few things that<br>we had to pay for these people paid for<br>it and yeah so one day the big day came<br>the thousand 24 pieces of plywood came<br>numbered into the space it would have<br>been a bad idea if they didn't come all<br>at once but we kind of thought about<br>that afterwards office pieces like a big<br>IKEA kind of shelf to assemble and then<br>within the next kind of six weeks they<br>were all assembled one by one into one<br>gigantic kind of inside of a wire<br>spaceship Moby Dick and when the first<br>kids arrived these are the kids and the<br>children of the build up they started<br>kind of immediately climbing all over<br>the space and hey what is this I have no<br>idea but let's check it out<br>and and that really showed us how the<br>concept works we're just it's not a<br>square box it's not a school you don't<br>know what you're supposed to do because<br>you're actually not supposed to do<br>anything you're supposed to<br>to to think about what this could be and<br>then you start writing it down so the<br>building got opened the sign was changed<br>to the Martian embassy and was opened by<br>Marie Bashir and these are some photos<br>some professional photos we took after<br>the opening so you can see how this all<br>the continuous space works the only<br>thing that is not out of plywood was<br>this furniture that is because when<br>you're designed for children once you<br>tap into it's better not to even mention<br>that but once you tap into other<br>regulations what could happen if<br>children fall off the furniture<br>then then you start buying furniture<br>that exists but it's actually the end of<br>space otherwise it's made out of the<br>same material all these desks and kind<br>of storage units and shelves and so on<br>and the creative agency designed all<br>these little funny things you can buy<br>these cans they contain things like<br>gravity Martian invasion kids and you<br>can look at paraphernalia from the Mars<br>exploration you can buy a map to Mars<br>the really Lonely Planet guide you can<br>start your own crop circles and so on<br>and this is kind of the 360 degree view<br>of the space which really summarizes the<br>space best because that's kind of what<br>it makes you feel spinning around and we<br>won the Premier's award at the AIA<br>Institute which was very nice I have the<br>funny feeling that what was more for<br>fact there was a charity and children<br>and so on but obviously there also liked<br>how the brief was transformed creatively<br>and there's a book that you can buy and<br>that further kind of sponsors the Sydney<br>story Factory in Redfern<br>okay what's this this is I got through<br>this quickly just as an introduction to<br>the next project the idea behind this is<br>that in history with every new invention<br>there's always a breakthrough obviously<br>in technology and that always has an<br>expression and architecture so when you<br>think about you know when steel became<br>commercially available and you could<br>build three-dimensional structures the<br>Eiffel Tower was built then the Empire<br>State Building with electricity with the<br>curtain wall and not the curtain wall<br>facade later but with the lift the<br>Weizmann of Zeidler<br>concrete steel beams Seagram building<br>with the curtain wall facade and then in<br>the 90s and all of sudden this time came<br>with a boom time of Bilbao where all of<br>sudden everything was possible seemingly<br>possible and all of a sudden you think<br>you can build any shape that you like<br>and you have to build anything you can<br>and so the question for us was we have<br>with this all lead to and what is<br>actually the time that we are living in<br>and this project master that I want to<br>introduce next is this kind of project<br>and the talks about sustainability and<br>about health and about organization of<br>the city of the future rather than<br>individual buildings so the master plan<br>for the city is by Norman Foster and<br>it's an initiative by the UAE government<br>in Abu Dhabi to create essentially a<br>living laboratory a piece of city that<br>is 1.5 by 1.5 kilometers in size and<br>where you're ready research<br>how can organism be zero carbon zero<br>waste car free and how can be an entire<br>city built on sustainable principles<br>that cannot leave everything else behind<br>a lot of people said aya is kind of easy<br>you build laboratory in the desert you<br>know<br>all the money why can't you do it with<br>the real city and that is true but I<br>also think that the whole point of the<br>laboratory is to have confined<br>conditions because then you can actually<br>experiment and you can measure the<br>results so building something that is<br>completely separate from everything else<br>test new public transport systems new<br>energy generation systems new types of<br>spaces etc it's really an exciting<br>procedure and to do that in the Middle<br>East is is interesting because obviously<br>they are funded by oil but they're<br>thinking about the time post-oil opposed<br>to our society and what that could mean<br>for them and so the entire city is kind<br>of run by sustainable renewable energies<br>but interesting is also based on very<br>sound principles of urbanism which again<br>is kind of centrally century-old<br>principles of material of self-shading<br>of how to orientate the city to get the<br>breeze and wind directions etc etc and<br>so only then you add latest technology<br>so it comes back to what I was saying<br>earlier maybe about this relationship<br>with nature and technology that<br>technology constantly changes and it's<br>almost impossible to catch the latest<br>technology because as soon as we<br>implemented it will always already be<br>last years but the principles of nature<br>are the principles that are prevailing<br>throughout the centuries and so here's<br>some kind of gadgets this is a new<br>transportation system a magnetic<br>electric car that works like you have<br>this in high-rise towers these days with<br>destination control we have 50 people<br>waiting for the lift the lift knows<br>where you want to go and it calculates<br>what's the quickest lift to come to you<br>to bring this amount of people to these<br>different floors so on a horizontal<br>level you want to go to the cinema<br>someone else wants to go shopping third<br>person wants to leave the city and these<br>parts come to you based on what the<br>minimum distance is and the least amount<br>of energy to bring all these people to<br>their destination as opposed to what we<br>have here and in Germany too<br>per household and everybody drives to<br>where they want to drive to and if we<br>translate that to China as we said<br>earlier if 1.4 billion people have to<br>four-wheel drives and the double garage<br>then that will cause certain challenges<br>but what do we have to do with it lava<br>was invited to design in a competition<br>the center of the city and so when we<br>looked at the brief for the competition<br>there was really no real center defined<br>in the city and Norman Foster had<br>allocated this egg-shaped building in<br>the center as a conference center we<br>kind of identified idea I guess was that<br>the center of the city doesn't have to<br>be a building it doesn't need an egg<br>shape conference and then this Center<br>what it actually needs is a public space<br>so we kind of split the egg into<br>individual buildings push these<br>buildings to the side and created public<br>space okay well that sounds very simple<br>and it's kind of a novel concept for Abu<br>Dhabi so we looked at things like the<br>Piazza San Marco and if you've been to<br>Venice wherever you go in Venice you<br>will always end up on piazza san marco<br>and so in a similar way wherever you go<br>in a master city will always end up in<br>master plaza and the buildings that<br>surround the plaza<br>become kind of background there's still<br>important buildings there's a hotel<br>there's still the conference center is<br>the cinema complex this is a retail<br>complex and this is the master<br>headquarter but at the end of the day<br>the buildings do their own thing and<br>they build a backdrop for public space<br>which is really where public activity<br>can happen and in the Middle East you<br>have this problem of course that it's<br>very hot and you have to shade and so we<br>looked at nature for inspiration and<br>found this idea of sunflowers that act<br>as umbrellas that literally shade by<br>opening and closing the space so during<br>the day and they cover the plaza and at<br>night they forward up and turn into<br>lighting field and all of sudden<br>and become like an interactive element<br>so it's kind of an adaptive space while<br>most of the other competitors created<br>these big indoor structures kpf for<br>example came second with big glass<br>structures and you know if you've been<br>to the middle-east essentially what do<br>you do on the weekend you go to a<br>shopping centre because it's the only<br>space where you can kind of bear the<br>heat in this case it's an outdoor spaces<br>public space it's a community space and<br>we worked with engineers from trans Ola<br>very hard on creating what is what they<br>call a soft conditioned space so it's<br>not an air-conditioned space but it<br>works with various cooling strategies to<br>bring the temperature down to acceptable<br>levels throughout the year and at night<br>when it's cooler and in winter when it's<br>cooler you can just fold up these<br>umbrellas then you can see the Stars and<br>get fresh air through and participate in<br>nature again and that is beautiful when<br>you're in the center of a city and you<br>can see the sky and again the lighting<br>concept is that at night it becomes kind<br>of an interactive plaza where people can<br>walk through with their iPhones and<br>smartphones and smart devices and<br>interact with lighting and learn about<br>sustainability as you go I want going to<br>greater detail for the sustainable<br>strategy and and here are some shots of<br>the buildings that we did go into but it<br>never actually got to that stage this is<br>the university master city by a Norman<br>Foster<br>this is the first part essentially of<br>the city that was built this is the<br>podium where the magnetic cars roam<br>around and so it is a living laboratory<br>you can visit it people to visit you can<br>measure temperature you can measure<br>energy and the project has been slowed<br>down substantially for the same reason<br>as previous projects with<br>financial crisis but I'm still hopeful<br>that it's one of the projects that is<br>really exciting and interesting and<br>important I think for the world to<br>follow through and it was probably never<br>a good idea to build an entire city in<br>five years and if they build it in 25<br>years it's bogus to the good I thought<br>at the opening the cityscape exhibition<br>the Sheikh said one day our cities will<br>be like this and we kind of believe<br>obviously not every city will be like<br>this but if the aspiration is that<br>cities around the world can really learn<br>from the learnings of this experiment<br>then I think that's really an<br>interesting thing and if you've been to<br>Beijing and Shanghai and Manila and<br>these cities that are very polluted and<br>very congested then obviously the other<br>cities where you could apply some of<br>this wisdom so since then and these are<br>just a few last slides we've been<br>working on a number of schemes that kind<br>of tried to interpret similar ideas<br>about urbanism about nature and<br>technology and creating new environments<br>and some are very big scale this is<br>entry for the export 2017 in Kazakhstan<br>and this is residential development in<br>Xi'an in China and a lot of these<br>projects don't necessarily get built but<br>each of the projects for us is one step<br>further into the research of what is<br>possible and how we can develop<br>architecture in the future this is one<br>of the most recent ones but it's also<br>kind of feels a little bit like back in<br>2007 and pre-crisis where a company in<br>China they're appropriately named ever<br>grant in Chinese and ours are very very<br>big they're planning this island which<br>is very very big it's a couple of<br>hundred hotels shopping centers train<br>stations aquariums golf courses etc etc<br>and so we're part of this master plan<br>they invited I don't know it doesn't of<br>architect Caesar are these different<br>pieces is our project here the seven<br>star seven star hotel and a couple of UN<br>studio and coffee McClure and other<br>buildings so I don't know if this will<br>ever happen but we hope that some of<br>these projects will come through in the<br>meantime we have built some works not as<br>many as I was hoping when we started out<br>and someone very different scale you<br>know from a chair to a lamp that we did<br>for wallpaper for the furniture so this<br>is actually in Milano<br>at the Rena center you know the shopping<br>center Piazza del Duomo they<br>commissioned different architects every<br>year for their Christmas decoration for<br>their windows this is a fashion show for<br>Maya and the big J of Maya here now it's<br>a Australian biggest retailer this is a<br>pavilion project some of these stretch<br>things this is an art gallery in Sydney<br>in Paddington the master embassy Sean<br>this is more an art project an<br>architectural project was 2010 the year<br>of the tiger we designed this to<br>larger-than-life sculptures in front of<br>a public building that subsequently<br>travelled around the world they were a<br>very lightweight fitted into container<br>so they went to San Francisco to Berlin<br>to Singapore and they're currently I<br>think in Amsterdam recently we built<br>this space here which most people say it<br>looks like a rendering but I don't know<br>why that is I think it's just because<br>it's built exactly like the rendering we<br>didn't rent out the fire exit sign but<br>this is a display suite for a large<br>residential development company called<br>Greenland and it was essentially a<br>square box that we had to transform and<br>we transformed it into continuous<br>seniors face kind of flow where the<br>ceiling becomes the floor floor becomes<br>the ceiling with this lighting islands<br>and<br>free-flowing elements this timber clad<br>wall<br>lots of LED lights and and another<br>little project just in the series of big<br>projects this was a 3d model for an ice<br>rink in China and haiku Sonya Island<br>Hainan Island and so we were only<br>commissioned to do the facade we did a<br>3d model and a few lead details sent<br>them to China and then his project<br>pictures came through where they were<br>actually building the building and this<br>is the most recent picture so it's now<br>completed it's kind of a new way of<br>doing architecture where you're not<br>involved into construction into meetings<br>into costing it's just do the design and<br>they build it themselves and I have to<br>say they have done an amazing job<br>considering that we weren't that<br>involved but yeah so the world is<br>changing and I'm not saying that this is<br>the future that you only do a facade<br>design but it's part part of the job<br>maybe this is a solar refueling station<br>for electric cars in Germany in Munich<br>this is the new Philips headquarter in<br>Eindhoven in Holland and this is a<br>project for the Sydney Airport which I<br>just walked through today they're<br>rebuilding the entire duty-free shop and<br>crafts has done a couple of duty-free<br>shops with the same client and so that's<br>a very exciting project that I'm looking<br>forward to and the youth hostel in<br>Bavaria which is under construction and<br>what else you were mentioning the Saudi<br>project this is a project for our<br>laboratory and near Riyadh and it has a<br>very thick facade again for insulation<br>and for heat it has very small openings<br>to to keep the Sun out and I didn't<br>think that they were ever going to build<br>it but they have and it's now nearing<br>completion<br>and this is the Cox University master<br>plan yeah this is nothing last three<br>slides which is an entire university<br>master plan based on similar principles<br>as master City but a little bit smaller<br>and we're currently doing documentation</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
