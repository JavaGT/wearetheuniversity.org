A single protein found in cow saliva could provide the answer. <br><br>Biological scientist Professor Vic Arcus, called in the heavy machinery, a synchrotron, a huge particle accelerator, worth $250 million, housed in Melbourne to help solve the structure of the protein BSP30b, because animals with plenty of it are less susceptible to bloat. And now, able to see every atom in the protein,  Professor Arcus and scientists from AgResearch are working out just how its special characteristics work in a rumen to help prevent bloat.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>what we do is we make large amounts of<br>the protein in the lab and purify it and<br>then we shine x-rays very strong x-rays<br>at the protein and in this way we can<br>determine the structure of the protein<br>and atomic detail so what we could see<br>when we when we determine the structure<br>if we could see that the protein had a<br>tubular shape and it had a longevity<br>inside and this cavity is a place where<br>look at molecules bind so lipid<br>molecules are a little bit like oil<br>molecules they're long and they're<br>called they're called hydrophobic<br>molecules because they don't like water<br>so these long hydrophobic molecules<br>could go inside the protein and bind to<br>the protein and that way get away from<br>water and there are lots of these lipid<br>like different lipid molecules and<br>grasses so you could imagine that the<br>cow is eating large amounts of grass it<br>needs to somehow take up these lipid<br>molecules and these lipid molecules<br>would indeed bind to the protein and<br>then the protein plus the lipid would<br>get transported down into the room<br>cow's stomach and so our structure<br>immediately suggested what this protein<br>is doing in saliva and gave us clues<br>molecules which don't like water and<br>what they do if they're in large amounts<br>and water is that they'll phone they'll<br>cause foam it's just like your detergent<br>and water if you add detergent water you<br>generate foam and that's what blows has<br>bloat as a foaming of the rumen liquids<br>and our hypothesis is that if this if<br>cows have large amounts of this protein<br>then that present that helps prevent the<br>foaming by binding the lipid molecules<br>away from the water so the protein is<br>binding very particular look at<br>molecules and so we want to know now<br>exactly which lipid molecules the<br>protein is binding the second discovery<br>that we made is that we collaborated<br>with aggressive scientists graham edward<br>at grasslands and farmers to the north<br>and we could actually take rumen samples<br>so summoned samples out of the stomach<br>of the cow and we could see that our<br>protein bound to particular bacteria in<br>the room so now bacteria also a coated<br>in lipids and so now we have the<br>possibility that not only is the protein<br>carrying lipids to the rumen it's then<br>also binding to particular bacteria in<br>the rumen so these are the next<br>questions we want to find answers to<br>about the biological function of this<br>question<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
