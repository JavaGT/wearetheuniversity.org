the University this is a<br>meeting of the Council of the University<br>of Auckland at which the pro Chancellor<br>and I will confer diplomas and award<br>graduation is a time for celebrating<br>success today you will experience the<br>pomp and tradition of this ancient<br>ceremony and the recognition befitting<br>your success on your well-deserved day<br>of celebration like your family and<br>friends gathered here we are very proud<br>of all your achievements and look<br>forward to your lifelong involvement as<br>members of the University of Auckland<br>family of course graduation represents<br>much more than just a day of celebration<br>your qualification from this University<br>will have a lifetime impact on you your<br>family and the community at large<br>we know that compared to those whose<br>formal education ends in high school<br>graduates have lower unemployment rates<br>higher salaries better career prospects<br>and better health outcomes your<br>university experience and the<br>qualifications gained at university well<br>the sad real value to you and the lives<br>of those around you<br>the fact that our university can add<br>value in these ways reflects the<br>abilities and achievements of our staff<br>and students in the Faculty of science<br>professor Margaret bramble was named a<br>dame companion of the New Zealand Order<br>and May last year Dame bramble was also<br>elected a fellow of the Royal Society of<br>London for her contributions to<br>synthetic organic chemistry the first<br>new zealand-based woman scientist to<br>join the ranks of the world's oldest<br>scientific organization Professor<br>Christian Hartigan was awarded the 2019<br>Australian and New Zealand Society for<br>mass spectometry Morrison medal the<br>award reflects his pioneering research<br>into the development of organometallic<br>anti-cancer agents professor richard la<br>heron received the international<br>geographical union laureate donger 'the<br>by the international geographical union<br>commission the award was established to<br>recognize individuals who have achieved<br>particular distinction or who have<br>rendered outstanding service in the work<br>of the Union or an international<br>distinguished professor Marston condom<br>was awarded the Jones medal by the Royal<br>Society arpa-e for his lifetime<br>achievement and leadership and<br>Mathematics Marston is a world authority<br>on the mathematics of symmetry and<br>chirality in discrete structures<br>especially those with maximum possible<br>symmetry in the<br>class and associate professor Rachelle<br>Constantine was the inaugural winner of<br>the Sir Peter Blake trust environment<br>award for her work and marine research<br>and conservation who campaigned to<br>increase protection for the Hauraki Gulf<br>whale population lead to slower speeds<br>for large vessels dramatically reducing<br>the number of whales injured or killed<br>by ship stroke in order to ensure that<br>we can continue to achieve successes<br>like these and to enhance our<br>contribution to future generations of<br>graduates and to our nation the<br>university must do three things first we<br>need to attract students of high<br>academic potential and give them an<br>outstanding academic and extracurricular<br>experience in this respect we are doing<br>very well the proportion of students<br>entering in the university with a high<br>grade point average is growing each year<br>and we produce outstanding students just<br>like you second we need to attract<br>develop and retain outstanding staff<br>this we are doing is illustrated by the<br>achievements I described earlier many of<br>our staff are world leaders in their<br>fields and you will have been privileged<br>to learn from and work with them it is<br>no coincidence that in the qsr world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>university of auckland came top and new<br>zealand and 37 of the forty-one subjects<br>ranked and we don't even teach two of<br>them<br>and third we need to create the kind of<br>academic environment and facilities that<br>support and encourage excellence to this<br>end the university has been investing<br>heavily in its campus renewal program so<br>as to ensure that we do provide<br>facilities of genuinely international<br>quality many of you will graduate today<br>were the first qualification and you<br>will be rightly proud of that<br>achievement however I also want you to<br>reflect on the ongoing learning<br>opportunities and the wide range of<br>postgraduate options available to you at<br>this University you must never rest on<br>your laurels and a challenging and<br>ever-changing world but rather be<br>prepared to embrace change and new<br>technology and make the most of the<br>opportunities presented to you although<br>it may seem a daunting prospect right<br>now further study and learning is<br>inevitable for all of us as the world<br>changes around us at an<br>ever-accelerating pace whatever path you<br>follow I urge you as alumni of New<br>Zealand's leading University to never<br>forget your alma mater your University<br>we rely on our graduates for support<br>moral political and financial but today<br>is your day<br>with the focus firmly on your<br>achievement at the ceremony we honor<br>your success along with the support of<br>your family Ferno and others who have<br>sustained you through your studies I<br>congratulate you and trust that your<br>long trash the memories of your<br>it is my pleasure to welcome our guest<br>speaker today associate professor nikola<br>gaston physicist nicola gaston is at the<br>helm of one of New Zealand's most<br>influential science organizations she is<br>co-director of the MacDermid Institute<br>for Advanced Materials and<br>nanotechnology a New Zealand Centre for<br>research into excellence Nicola Gaston<br>is also an associate professor at the<br>University of Auckland's physics<br>department professor Gaston works in the<br>field of nanotechnology the science of<br>everything that is made of matter at the<br>atomic scale her work is at the leading<br>edge of science to deliver a better<br>understanding of the world around us<br>amongst her many accolades nicola was<br>awarded the computational and<br>mathematical methods and science and<br>engineering prize in 2016 for her work<br>on the properties of atomic cluster the<br>challenges facing the world today<br>climate change clean water renewable<br>energy will be solved by tomorrow<br>scientists many of whom are in this room<br>they will need new materials and<br>nanotechnology and that's the work of<br>Nicola Gaston and the country's best<br>scientists working together at the<br>McDermott Institute please welcome<br>outstanding scientists associate<br>professor Nicholas Gaston to the stage<br>in a manner in reo rangatira ma tena<br>koutou tena koutou tena tatou katoa<br>Chancellor vice-chancellor members of<br>council members of the university<br>graduates families and friends it's a<br>pleasure and a privilege to be here to<br>celebrate with you today I feel a bit<br>self-conscious actually speaking here as<br>a member of staff of this University<br>I can see a couple of graduands on my<br>way in who were students in my lectures<br>not very long ago and I feel like they<br>might have they might feel if they've<br>heard everything they want to from me<br>but I can promise I'm not going to talk<br>about quantum mechanics I'm not going to<br>talk so much about science itself<br>because I'm very conscious now of a<br>different aspect of my relationship with<br>this University because not so very long<br>ago I was sitting where you all are<br>graduating with my honours degree I have<br>to confess I don't remember anything of<br>the graduation speech the thing that<br>stands out most from that period of time<br>a few weeks earlier I quit the job at<br>the cafe I've been working at through<br>university making sandwiches and coffee<br>and the owner sort of got a bit sniffy<br>when I said oh I'm going to go do a PhD<br>I've actually got a scholarship they're<br>gonna pay me to study now and he said oh<br>no nobody makes City nobody ever makes<br>any money doing science he said this was<br>a man who'd been paying me minimum wage<br>for a couple of years<br>but when it comes down to it you know<br>data as indeed I did<br>investing in tertiary education does pay<br>off Oh a CD data suggests that there's a<br>private rate of return on your<br>investment that's around 10% in addition<br>to that there's a public return on<br>investment which is about the same<br>magnitude even more substantial and<br>significant I think though other<br>intangible benefits to society that<br>tertiary education provides and that's<br>that I'd like to sort of focus on in in<br>talking to you today if you'll bear with<br>me<br>we're here to award you degrees and it's<br>interesting to think about what that<br>that exactly means according to the<br>merriam-webster dictionary one<br>definition of a degree is one of the<br>divisions marked on the scale of a<br>measuring instrument or we could look at<br>a definition of the word graduation<br>that's the action of dividing into<br>degrees or other proportionate division<br>on a graduated scale and these are very<br>logical definitions but is the<br>university merely an instrument of<br>measurement and hopefully you can all<br>guess that I'm here to tell you<br>otherwise one of the defining<br>characteristics of a university which<br>many of you will have heard of is the<br>concept of research-led teaching it can<br>be traced back to ideas put forward by<br>wilhelm von humboldt who argued for the<br>value of combining both the arts and the<br>sciences and teaching and research<br>within a holistic enterprise within<br>which we're all able to learn from each<br>other so the collective expertise of my<br>colleagues up here on the stage is made<br>available to students through research<br>led teaching it's more than that though<br>and as a scientist I find it a model for<br>teaching that's really deeply embedded<br>in scientific ideals because it presents<br>knowledge as something that we all<br>aspire to learn through research and<br>scholarship rather than as aesthetic<br>body effects to be transmitted<br>unchallenged<br>but today I'd like to sort of invert<br>this model to think a little bit more<br>about the other side of it in this model<br>as much as our teaching is research led<br>our research is what we might call<br>teaching lid in your time at the<br>University you've contributed to the<br>creation of knowledge and every lecture<br>you've attended through every question<br>you have asked and even at times I would<br>argue if you frown at just the right<br>moment you make your lecturer think that<br>little bit more about what they're<br>saying the jury might be out a little on<br>on how video recordings fit into this<br>turning up to lectures is important but<br>we're have come to looking at the way we<br>teach and the central role that students<br>play in both the generation and<br>dissemination of knowledge is that this<br>Humboldt e'en version of the University<br>is one that centers the importance of<br>listening and of learning from the<br>experiences of others one might even say<br>and yes I am going to that the<br>University in this way is one of the<br>earliest forms of social media now this<br>might just be an analogy it may even be<br>a contentious analogy but it's one we<br>can learn quite a lot from in my opinion<br>for a start I think we can all agree<br>that a university works very poorly when<br>driven by cliques likes upvotes Patriots<br>or any other simplistic metric and as<br>we've learned from social media there<br>are challenges and keeping communication<br>balanced within the university<br>particular voices can become overly<br>dominant poorly chosen metrics can<br>exacerbate this what we teach has<br>context and just as on social media it's<br>listening to the way that information is<br>received and interpreted by others that<br>can actually lead us to interrogate what<br>we know in ways that lead to new<br>understanding it's my preferred form of<br>social media as Twitter and the reason I<br>like it is exactly this the ability to<br>learn from the experience<br>others in ways I never would in my own<br>narrow limited set of experiences<br>I'm also an unrepentant fan of emoji and<br>until recently I used to sign off and a<br>considerable number of my tweets with<br>the OK emoji I don't do that anymore I<br>don't do it not because the OK hand sign<br>is universally identified with white<br>supremacy there are a lot of us who only<br>learned that connection in the last year<br>or two but it's enough that it has that<br>symbolism to some people and I do think<br>that it's those of us who are least<br>likely to be exposed to the hate made<br>manifest and white supremacy you have<br>the greatest need and responsibility to<br>listen and to learn from the experiences<br>of others and it's this ability to learn<br>to create knowledge collectively that is<br>the greatest attribute of a university<br>and so the key message I want to leave<br>you with here is that this does not end<br>today graduation is not an end it's the<br>beginning of something new the Education<br>Act of 1989 defines what a university is<br>in New Zealand and in particular it<br>introduces the need for universities to<br>accept a role as critic and conscience<br>of society but whose conscience<br>are we the X is society<br>and so this isn't really something that<br>we can do without listening to society<br>which means those of you graduating<br>today and equally all of your family<br>members all of your friends who've come<br>here to celebrate with you<br>we need a zone a university community to<br>listen to society if we're able to<br>fulfill this role of acting as critic<br>and conscience and so as you leave this<br>building today please do so knowing that<br>this is still your university and that<br>this is not the end of you all your<br>engagement with us we will still look to<br>you for leadership and this is a<br>beginning of that not a norm I had am I<br>Nicholas thank you so much for sharing<br>that with us this is a meeting of<br>Council and convocation of the<br>university of which the Pro Chancellor<br>Cecilia Tarrant and I will be awarding<br>diplomas and conferring degrees I invite<br>the Pro Chancellor to award the diplomas<br>and confer the degrees in the first
