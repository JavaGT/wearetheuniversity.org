represents much more than<br>just a day of celebration your<br>qualification from this University will<br>have a lifetime impact on you your<br>family and the community at large<br>we know that compared to those whose<br>formal education ends in high school<br>graduates have lower unemployment rates<br>higher salaries better career prospects<br>and better health outcomes your<br>university experience and the<br>qualifications gained at university well<br>thus had real value to your lives and to<br>the lives of those around you<br>the fact that our university can add<br>value in these ways reflects the<br>abilities and achievements of our staff<br>and students in the Faculty of science<br>professor Margaret bramble was named a<br>dame Companion of the Order of the New<br>Zealand order in May last year Dame<br>bramble was also elected a fellow of the<br>Royal Society of London for her<br>contributions to synthetic organic<br>chemistry the first new zealand-based<br>woman scientist to join the ranks of the<br>world's oldest scientific organization<br>Professor Christian hanger was awarded<br>the 2019 Australian and New Zealand<br>Society for mass spectometry Morrison<br>medal the award reflects his pioneering<br>research into the development of<br>Professor Richard Leigh Hearon received<br>the international geographical union<br>laureate on earth by and by the<br>International geographical Union<br>Commission the award was established to<br>recognize individuals who have achieved<br>particular distinction or who have<br>rendered outstanding service in the work<br>of the Union or an international<br>geography and environmental research<br>distinguished professor mast and Condor<br>was awarded the Jones medal by the Royal<br>Society TR parang II for his lifetime<br>achievement and leadership and<br>Mathematics Marston is a world authority<br>on the mathematics of symmetry and the<br>sure ality of discrete structures<br>especially those with

Marines research and<br>conservation<br>her campaign to increase protection of<br>the Hauraki Gulf whale population led to<br>slower speeds for large vessels<br>dramatically reducing the number of<br>whales injured or killed by ship strike<br>in order that we can continue to achieve<br>successes like these and to enhance a<br>contribution to future generations of<br>graduates and to our nation the<br>university must do three things first we<br>need to attract students of high<br>academic potential and give them<br>outstanding academic and extracurricular<br>experience and this respect we are doing<br>very well the proportion of students<br>entering University with a high grade<br>point average is growing each year and<br>we produce outstanding graduates just<br>like you second we need to attract<br>develop and retain outstanding staff<br>this we are doing as illustrated by the<br>achievements I described earlier many of<br>our staff are world leaders in their<br>fields and you will have been privileged<br>to learn from and work with them it is<br>no coincidence that in the qsr world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>University of Auckland came top in New<br>Zealand and 35 of the 40 subjects ranked<br>in three of our disciplines archaeology<br>education and anatomy and physiology we<br>are ranked in the top 20 universities in<br>the world and third we need to create<br>the kind of academic environment and<br>facilities that support and encourage<br>excellence to this end the university<br>has been investing heavily in its campus<br>renewal program so as to ensure that we<br>do provide facilities of genuinely<br>international quality many of you will<br>graduate today were the first<br>qualification and you will be rightly<br>proud of this achievement however I also<br>want you to reflect on the ongoing<br>learning opportunities in the wide range<br>of postgraduate options available to you<br>at this university<br>you must never rest on your laurels and<br>a challenging and ever-changing world<br>but rather be prepared to embrace change<br>and new technology and make the most of<br>the opportunities presented to you<br>although it may seem like a daunting<br>prospect right now through the study and<br>learning is inevitable for us all as the<br>world changes around us at an<br>ever-accelerating pace whatever path you<br>follow<br>I urge you as alumni of New Zealand's<br>leading University to never forget your<br>alma mater your University<br>we rely on graduates for support moral<br>political and financial but today is<br>your day would the focus firmly on your<br>achievement at this ceremony we honor<br>your success along with the support of<br>your family far know and others who have<br>sustained you through your studies I<br>congratulate you and trust that your<br>long cherish the memories of your<br>it is my pleasure to welcome our guest<br>speaker today nathan talking to software<br>developer entrepreneur and strategist<br>nathan talking Tintin rightly say he is<br>one of the pioneers of the world wide<br>web he has worked in areas as diverse as<br>software development publishing and<br>educational technology and spent 10<br>years in the US on software programming<br>on the web technology is so much a part<br>of our lives that it's easy to forget<br>how recent it is and just how much<br>innovators like Nathan have contributed<br>to our world it was the end of 1990 when<br>the first web page were served on the<br>open Internet two years later Nathan<br>graduated from Victoria University with<br>a computer science degree and the<br>University snapped him up to design and<br>implement its own fledgling web site in<br>a decade in the u.s. he worked with<br>startups educational tech software<br>development for the web and built up<br>North America's largest open source<br>developer conference returning to New<br>Zealand he as a consultant and a<br>strategist working with Callaghan<br>innovation nathan has also created the<br>Kiwi food camp<br>150 people come together over two days<br>they brainstorm internet applications<br>art education business and science and<br>their collaborations will shape our<br>future<br>Nathan Torkington has perhaps more than<br>anything a designer of the future please<br>Chancellor vice-chancellor members of<br>council members of the university<br>graduates families and friends this is<br>nothing like the graduation ceremony<br>that I had when I passed out of Vic it<br>was the same time of year but it was in<br>one inton so it was cold it was wet and<br>it was miserable and I look at you warm<br>dry and very jealous<br>congratulations on that but<br>congratulations as well on making it<br>this far there must have been times<br>along the way when you thought it's<br>gotten too hard I'm never gonna make<br>this assignment I'm so tired of ramen<br>all of those things along but you<br>overcame you pushed through and you have<br>made it and I think I would like to be<br>the first to say congratulations and<br>please give yourselves a little round of<br>and I'd also like to acknowledge the<br>fact that you didn't make it alone<br>nobody makes it alone you're here with<br>your family and your supporters and if<br>your family and your supporters could<br>not be here they are still with you in<br>your heart you got here because of the<br>help of others and they're incredibly<br>proud of you at this point in time I<br>know from my experience as the first<br>from my family to graduate from<br>University they were incredibly proud of<br>me<br>please take a moment as well and with<br>your hands thank those friends and<br>family who have kept you going for so<br>long this is a great moment for you and<br>if you live your life right and I hope<br>you will this won't be the last great<br>moment so you heard about my career in<br>life and it's always interesting and<br>lovely to be introduced with the<br>biography because I've done so many<br>different weird things in my life that I<br>never know how somebody is going to be<br>able to construct a story out of it<br>because I still struggle my graduation<br>was an incredible highlight of my life<br>being there with my family and<br>succeeding and finishing but also on<br>that list wedding the birth of our<br>children both of them the publication of<br>my book that moment when I quit a job I<br>didn't like and took the course of my<br>life into my hands the success of my<br>first conference I remember I built a<br>team and that team successfully<br>delivered a very complex project and<br>that was an incredible feeling of<br>victory and an accomplishment so<br>if you like me most of your great<br>moments in your future will be with and<br>about people so I'm not gonna take this<br>opportunity to tell you how to have a<br>good career you're gonna figure that out<br>for yourself you don't really have a<br>choice that's gonna happen one way or<br>another so I'm gonna tell you instead<br>how to have a great life and you can put<br>away the pads and pins it's really<br>boring it's not rocket science and I<br>salute you rocket scientists out there<br>but it is it is not that hard it's<br>really incredibly obvious because all of<br>life's secrets turn out to be incredibly<br>obvious all you have to do is get good<br>at peopling get good at being around<br>with and a person so peopling is super<br>simple and I'm gonna break it down for<br>you right now like this is this is gold<br>right here one you have to understand<br>yourself how do you react in situations<br>what drives you you have to be able to<br>manage yourself so that knowing how you<br>react you are able to step forward in<br>the best possible light and not merely<br>with the first response that you feel<br>and then you need to have empathy for<br>others because we are all in this<br>together and the result of this is that<br>you get a superpower peopling is a<br>superpower you get to learn from<br>feedback which means you get better at<br>whatever you do you get to work better<br>in teams other people will make your<br>work better everything that was on my<br>biography and everything that will be on<br>your biography gets accomplished with<br>other people and has to be said we do<br>not live in a time this time today we do<br>not live in a time when you can be a<br>very successful Butthead<br>if you are a pain to work with if you're<br>a horrible person it doesn't matter how<br>smart you are<br>people will not protect you they will<br>not promote you they will not hire you<br>and it's silly because we're not taught<br>to work with emotions and feelings and<br>empathy and things like that in the<br>sciences we might study them if we're<br>psychologists but we're still not taught<br>how to work with them ourselves<br>and it's not like we don't have them<br>anybody who's ever received criticism<br>knows what they're feeling of an emotion<br>is like in a scientist so I want to<br>emphasize that our fields our scientific<br>fields need empathy even though we're<br>not taught it we desperately need it<br>because science is one of the few areas<br>where you have the ability to truly<br>change the world to invent something new<br>change the course of history that power<br>to invent that ability to change the<br>world is crucial to wield with empathy<br>power without empathy is tyranny so we<br>don't get exposed to it because emotions<br>and senses and feelings these are the<br>domain of the arts and the humanities<br>and we live at a time and have for a<br>long time where humanities and Sciences<br>are kept in separate buildings they're<br>separate disciplines they're separate<br>graduation ceremonies I'm angry at the<br>separation of the humanities and the<br>sciences because it causes many problems<br>both for the humanities and for Sciences<br>and I'm angry at the dismantling of the<br>humanities that has been happening<br>happened under this vice-chancellor in<br>this university tearing away the<br>libraries and the resources and the<br>Desai's of those departments that's not<br>a good thing we on the other hand have<br>the power to push forwards ourselves and<br>take action what are we taking action<br>against psychologists out there you'll<br>know about the dunning-kruger effect<br>it's the idea that if I surveyed<br>everybody in this room about how good a<br>driver they are do you do you think<br>you're in the top 50% 80% of the hands<br>are going to go up sometimes when the<br>surveys are done as many as 93 percent<br>of the hands go up 93 percent of people<br>think they're in the top 50 percent of<br>drivers I'm reasonably sure it's a<br>science fact I probably don't have to<br>explain that that's impossible the best<br>defense against these unknown flaws<br>dunning-kruger Azure effectors<br>all about wearing useless at under at<br>appreciating how bad we are at certain<br>things when we do worse we don't notice<br>so the best defense against your unknown<br>flaws is to improve your people skills<br>understand yourself apply those science<br>powers that you have humility curiosity<br>research to yourself and your own life<br>and if we'd been in the humanities we<br>might have been exposed to the<br>inscription on the temple of apollo at<br>delphi which is know thyself or socrates<br>line the unexamined life is not worth<br>living<br>Kate Hema the research operations<br>manager in Punahou matatini puts it as<br>everyone here is smart distinguish<br>yourself by being kind so now as you<br>heard I run Kiwi foo camp I bring<br>together 150 interesting people from<br>very different backgrounds and over the<br>course of a weekend we build and run a<br>conference that we want to have it's one<br>companies Research Projects people are<br>millionaires as a result of erta it's<br>great when I put that together I look<br>for pragmatic optimists I look for<br>people who are doers and not talkers I<br>look for people who create more value<br>than they capture in this world I look<br>for people who are makers and not<br>breakers and wait what do I get out of<br>this when I bring those interesting<br>people those makers together I bring<br>together people who are building a world<br>that I want to live in I've got 1,500<br>people doing that across New Zealand in<br>the world now and they're more<br>successful as a result of the work that<br>I did and I want you to note that work<br>didn't come from my computer science<br>degree it came from my peopling so my<br>challenge to you is really simple you've<br>now got super powers in the form of your<br>skills and your science use your powers<br>to make the world a better place your<br>goal should be the world is a better<br>place because you are in it and if you<br>want to succeed in this then you have to<br>understand people and you have to start<br>with yourself so I'm going to take it<br>back to this great moment you have my<br>well and congratulations for making it<br>this far and achieving what you've done<br>and I wish you<br>many more great moments and much success<br>thank you Nathan for a most interesting<br>and
