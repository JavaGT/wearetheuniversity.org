Their combined experience spans astrophysics, space start-ups, satellites, and space engineering (including a former NASA engineer). Free to the public and students. Come and join us to discuss space, and hear about the growing opportunities in this fast-moving, high-tech sector.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>started so tena koutou katoa my name is<br>Andrew Johnson I'm the manager of space<br>policy in regulatory systems at the New<br>Zealand Space Agency which is a part of<br>the Ministry of business innovation and<br>employment and sits within the science<br>innovation and international branch so a<br>very warm welcome to you all and thanks<br>very much for coming along to this Tech<br>Week event this evening it's wonderful<br>to see so many people interested in<br>participating in a conversation about<br>the future of space in New Zealand so<br>first just a couple of housekeeping<br>issues you'll see the two exits marked<br>above you at the back of the theater if<br>you follow those out and find the<br>staircase I understand this one on the<br>left and one on the right and go up both<br>those staircases in the event of an<br>emergency evacuation and the meeting<br>point is out on on Grafton Road there's<br>also a number of toilets very close to<br>the outside as well so firstly I would<br>like to extend the space agencies and<br>ministries thanks to our partners for<br>this event the university of auckland<br>auckland uni services and of course a<br>huge thank you to all our panelists who<br>have agreed to take part in tonight's<br>event with all their busy schedules and<br>come along to speak to us today New<br>Zealand is a home to innovative - an<br>innovative an already growing space<br>economy powered by highly skilled<br>workforce of pioneers researchers<br>computer scientists and engineers with<br>rocket lab having well and truly showing<br>their capability New Zealand is now a<br>major player in the small satellite<br>launch market the New Zealand Space<br>Agency is committed to supporting the<br>growth of a safe responsible and secure<br>industry that benefits all New<br>Zealanders our activity spans<br>administration of the outer space and<br>high altitude activity act past them -<br>17<br>determining New Zealand's space policy<br>is a direct result of administering that<br>act and participating in international<br>fora around the world and supporting the<br>development of the space economy the<br>benefits of the space industry can be<br>found across all aspects of our society<br>from the satellite TV that we watch at<br>home to the accuracy that GPS provides<br>our emergency services operators Earth<br>Observation data is used to improve<br>agricultural productivity and new space<br>technologies are constantly being<br>developed that have the potential to<br>improve the lives of all New Zealanders<br>some of the people developing these new<br>space technologies are on our panel<br>tonight and as my pleasure to introduce<br>each of them we have a fantastic group<br>of thought leaders innovators and<br>researchers who represent the future of<br>our space economy so firstly from the<br>auckland program for space systems we<br>have this the program's director Jim<br>Hickey we also have dr. Nicholas Redbury<br>who is the APS science lead and is also<br>a Royal Society of New Zealand rather<br>for discovery fellow we have dr. Darwin<br>mala who is a radar systems engineer<br>previously has worked at NASA's Jet<br>Propulsion Laboratory and served as the<br>first director of the reach of research<br>at the center for space science<br>technology now called zero will Harrier<br>is the business director for Zinner<br>astronautics a satellite propulsion<br>Anastasia Carew is a physics and applied<br>mathematics student and she is a team<br>member of the Kessler program which is a<br>CubeSat group here at the University of<br>Auckland and Jonathan mace is a<br>mechanical engineering student and he's<br>the team leader of the Kistler program<br>in a moment I'm going to hand you over<br>to the panel they have some time for<br>each and to introduce themselves in a<br>little bit more detail about five<br>minutes or so for each panelist and then<br>we're going to move to hopefully what be<br>a really dynamic and interactive Q&amp;A<br>a section of the event we've created an<br>interactive slide a link for you to ask<br>questions if I just try and bring that<br>up now yeah so we have a question<br>section and also a poll that we've put<br>on on that slide Oh links so the hashtag<br>is hashtag L five to seven and the<br>website if you're going through the<br>Weber's slide oh yes I do<br>and we put a poll on there so it<br>encourage you all to get involved and<br>the question is what is the most crucial<br>element to make progress on if New<br>Zealand would have become a center for<br>small satellite manufacturing and we've<br>got five options here from a skilled<br>workforce through to access research and<br>development infrastructure to finance to<br>the regulatory environment to<br>international expertise and that's just<br>something hopefully to get people<br>interested in using the tool but what<br>we'd really love to hear from is your<br>questions that we can input to the<br>panelists we can use the tool live in<br>the event and as well as having<br>microphones going around the room so the<br>first part of the event will be the<br>introductions from the panelists and in<br>the Q&amp;A session and then at the end of<br>the event there will be some free pizza<br>available so please do hang around and<br>take the opportunity to mix and mingle<br>so without further ado I will start with<br>introductions for the panelist to come<br>up and speak in a little bit more detail<br>and if it's okay well might start with<br>thank you very much Evan even heard me<br>say anything yet no class of mine ever<br>says never Kyoko Carter now makeinu a<br>kyoto couture kona barrier HoCo<br>kayak coho Eid Safari I'm gonna or<br>Tamaki Makaurau I'm the Gretton berry I<br>am a senior lecturer in the Department<br>of Physics I am an astrophysicist and my<br>training has been in the discovery of<br>extrasolar planets discovering worlds<br>outside those in our own solar system<br>but for the last two or three years I've<br>pivoted to putting my time and energy<br>towards promoting new zealand's<br>activities in space we have this<br>incredible opportunity now thanks to a<br>local industry rocket lab giving us<br>access to space frequently and<br>relatively cheaply and what we also see<br>at the same time is a change in thought<br>about how we can make use of space<br>through small satellites so the<br>technology has changed so much we now<br>are able to do meaningful and real<br>science technology missions in a small<br>form factor and so this is part of what<br>drives me is we had now have the ability<br>technologically to engage enable a wider<br>fraction of New Zealand Science and<br>Engineering and broader society into<br>doing research in space and that's<br>because we are able to package a great<br>deal of power into a small retail small<br>volume we can make small satellites<br>which can do earth observations through<br>to astronomical observations and so as a<br>scientist that's what drives me getting<br>to space we're able to do more than<br>others<br>which I'm particularly interested in<br>I've always said I want to build New<br>Zealand's first space telescope and<br>that's one of the things I want to do<br>before my career is over we'll see how<br>we get there so what I'm particularly<br>keen about emphasizing is the research<br>projects that we're doing at the<br>University of Auckland you'll hear a lot<br>about what we're doing at the<br>undergraduate level so this is programs<br>which are in designed to engage<br>undergraduate students into space<br>science engineering and across the<br>university from business law commerce<br>and the arts<br>we're here from Jim William Anastacia<br>about that so what I would like to talk<br>about is the research that we're doing<br>and we've identified a number of<br>projects research areas which are of<br>particular interest to the small<br>satellite community and one of those is<br>propulsion so when you have your settler<br>up in orbit you need to be able push it<br>around a little bit where you'd like to<br>push it around a little bit changes<br>orbit change its orientation and you<br>don't have the luxury of having a great<br>big tank repellent - to do this it's a<br>small satellite so means that you have<br>less in terms of volume and mass budget<br>so we're looking at innovative ways of<br>pushing a satellite around in orbit net<br>brings us to electric propulsion using<br>instead of combusting materials to give<br>you a rocket effect to shove basically<br>combustion products out the back end of<br>a rocket you know Allah Apollo 30 and<br>all the rest of we're using things like<br>iron thrusters using high chair highly<br>charged particles shooting out the back<br>of a little nozzle to propel the<br>spacecraft around it's not nearly as<br>glamorous is a big great big plume of<br>material coming up the back of a rocket<br>but it's certainly a lot more efficient<br>in many ways and that's suitable for<br>small satellite projects so we have in<br>the physics department and ongoing<br>plasma propulsion system design and<br>analysis program which is exciting we're<br>also looking into what can be done<br>thinking inside the box in terms of the<br>small satellite I mean small I'm talking<br>about the smallest unit that were<br>thinking about in practice anyways you<br>know 10 centimeters cubed they're very<br>small but you can stick these together<br>so you get a loaf of bread size one or<br>maybe one about this big so we're not<br>talking about things which show the size<br>of a dishwasher or a car we're talking<br>about small little satellites and rocket<br>lab is design<br>they have positioned themselves to<br>service this cube set market because<br>they designed and built their electron<br>launch vehicle to accept and deploy<br>these cube set format satellites into<br>orbit so we rock up with our satellite<br>they know it's exactly the right form<br>that they're expecting we shoved into<br>the the kick stage this is all you know<br>technical talk obviously take shove<br>launch deploy yeah there's more to it<br>than that but they've set up their their<br>business so that they can offer launch<br>services to people like me people like<br>us were doing research at universities<br>thanks to this now de facto standard for<br>small satellites the CubeSat format and<br>one another project along with the<br>propulsion project had just mentioned<br>we're looking at synthetic aperture<br>radar this is a so theories been known<br>for some decades and we're trying to<br>push that down to see what can be done<br>with smaller smaller satellites because<br>they're cheaper to launch but we have<br>improvements in signal processing<br>technology which we've got available<br>through our colleagues one of whom is<br>here there were mala and her company in<br>the States and also just the abilities<br>we have now with signal processing we're<br>able to crunch signals so that we can<br>make more of what we've got and so these<br>are the sort of projects that we're<br>looking at at the research level and I<br>think I'll given the nod now that I<br>think my time is now up<br>thank you very much and look forward to<br>the questions that you have kept I'd to<br>hurry<br>thanks very much Nicholas glass still<br>okay just for ease I'm gonna send here<br>so Tenneco tokoto my name is dawn Muller<br>so to give you a little bit of<br>background I am a I'm a payload person<br>my background is radar remote sensing<br>primarily for looking at earth and the<br>Earth's processes so that's kind of the<br>perspective I'm going to be coming from<br>is I'm like what can we do with the<br>capacity that we have to do some science<br>with it<br>and I'm the engineer that will try and<br>design that so that's there's kind of<br>the vantage point that I'll be coming<br>from so for new zealand in space you<br>know if we want to have a presence in<br>space around that earth observing type<br>of capability well there's a continuum<br>is this continuum missions that have<br>been going on for four decades and<br>advancing in all kinds of different<br>aspects so the graphic here is two kind<br>of one illustration of that and these<br>are primarily just happens to be us<br>mostly satellites that observe some<br>aspect of the water cycle so an area<br>that I've been very interested in so<br>given that there's this continuum and<br>any aspect that we're looking at where<br>can we kind of plug ourselves into that<br>to have a to be a meaningful player in<br>this arena and just a little bit more<br>perspective so this was the first<br>mission I worked on when I graduated and<br>went to JPL and it was a really cool<br>mission to work on it was a shuttle<br>mission so that was neat I got to hang<br>out with astronauts and total geek<br>heaven and mapped the globe in 11 days<br>plus or minus 60 degrees latitude it's a<br>benchmark data set that's still used<br>today but if we look at the scale of<br>this this is what Center this is why I<br>put this up here it's not just nostalgia<br>this broom here that was deployed from<br>the payload Bay once it opened up was 60<br>meters long it's huge so we have an<br>antenna at the end here and then we have<br>another<br>no bigger planner antenna and the<br>payload be here these these doors open<br>up and behind that we have a ton of<br>electronics this thing was massive it<br>was a major engineering feat but it was<br>a big scale very expensive and large so<br>now quite a few years nearly two decades<br>later this we still have those<br>large-scale missions but there's also<br>been a shift in terms of accessibility<br>to space and it's been twofold one is<br>technology advancement for more compact<br>sensors like we're talking about with<br>synthetic aperture radar for example we<br>have an example down here of this taking<br>those racks of equipment that we're<br>behind the antenna can now be in a small<br>little module like this now this except<br>for the antennas and the transmitter all<br>the digital hardware all the digital<br>processing the multiple channels can now<br>go on to these tiny units that replace<br>racks of heart what were previously<br>racks of hardware so that's significant<br>the other side of things is the<br>accessibility is to expand creasing with<br>decreasing launch and spacecraft cost<br>for smaller vehicles and of course you<br>know we've already Nick already brought<br>up rocket labs and sure we're here<br>they're named a number of times tonight<br>but there that becomes a game changer<br>and I'd like to point out also they've<br>got a 150 kg payload it's not that small<br>you can do so we can actually get some<br>really high fidelity science sensors<br>into that now by the meeting of the more<br>compact technology but also the<br>capability that's brought about that is<br>accessible to non major nations through<br>capabilities like rocket lab is offering<br>and one thing that's significant in my<br>field of work since I tend to be in<br>radar and we're active sensors so is<br>that it's now feasible to get radars on<br>small sets or Cube sets and so there are<br>some commercial if it's going along that<br>but also here at the University of<br>Auckland we have some of this hardware<br>and there's some research going on and<br>developing that capacity as well<br>so the next couple of slides I'm going<br>to just skip through because I've got<br>told I've have too much material so I'm<br>just gonna hit a high point so New<br>Zealand a New Zealand space program why<br>would we want to do that well I'm gonna<br>hit the the blue here<br>inspire and educate and and also the the<br>other aspect is you know space is<br>supposed to be about inspiration and<br>possibility so let's be bold and<br>inspirational and think about compelling<br>things we could do and right now where<br>do we stand you know in New Zealand<br>we've got the cool ride down the road<br>you know which is really really neat<br>rocket lab has inspired people we've got<br>the cool ride now what's the cool thing<br>we're going to do with that cool right<br>that's what I want to think about you<br>know so what can we do that's meaningful<br>given that we have this really cool ride<br>into space and so along those lines how<br>would we bring this together to do<br>something cool well what would we do<br>this that's really I think the key thing<br>and for me thinking in my way with my<br>background from the various space<br>agencies I think I'm mission centric<br>okay so how do we as a nation decide<br>what we would like to achieve and how we<br>fit into that continuum how do we inject<br>ourselves into that continued missions<br>in a meaningful way so I'd say New<br>Zealand needs driven these are New<br>Zealand driven but globally relevant<br>mission to form around so it's relevant<br>to our needs but we need to be globally<br>relevant to and that defines how we<br>segue into the mission continuum and<br>there's a methodology for doing that you<br>know and we're at a place right now<br>where we have capacity building and<br>capacity that we can build upon and how<br>do you transform that into actually<br>getting towards a globally a New Zealand<br>relevant but globally relevant mission<br>and there's a number of mechanisms for<br>doing that once you've identified what<br>it is you're trying to do and the<br>community then perform around that and<br>that takes a form of partnerships both<br>with international public private public<br>engagement is key is<br>if you're talking some sort of national<br>identity and also identifying key<br>enabling technologies that might be<br>relevant for New Zealand and<br>cross-cutting etc and that's kind of<br>your targeted research part of things<br>but then what comes out of that actually<br>grows the community and the community<br>well it will then expand and they'll be<br>out of that national pride national<br>identity next-generation mission so now<br>you are part of that mission continuum<br>and that space community and along those<br>lines we can then foster the idea it<br>should it be an earth observing type of<br>capacity of our role in terms of<br>fostering kaitiakitanga but at a global<br>not gonna work is it okay it looks like<br>I'm gonna be stuck back here I hate<br>being stuck behind a podium I really<br>really do sorry hello<br>yeah there's a switch what's that one<br>working no it stops working as soon as I<br>start talking is it trying to tell me<br>something is it really Nick Nick used a<br>radio mic how come Nick got to use a<br>radio mic and I don't okay<br>I'm stuck behind here whether I like it<br>or not I'm a wanderer thank you Andrew<br>my name is Jim hefty and I run the<br>Balkan program for Space Systems okay<br>I'll give that a go<br>that one's alright it loves me finally<br>okay<br>the talk tonight is the future of space<br>okay so what is the future of space well<br>we don't really know and the other thing<br>that we don't know is what the future<br>holds for our graduates so what I teach<br>I teach engineering management space is<br>kind of a hobby of mine I got lucky<br>over the years managed to turn my hobby<br>into a job all right so that's pretty<br>cool<br>what we do know for our students is that<br>the future is going to be complicated we<br>know that they're going to be asked to<br>be solving more and more complex<br>problems they're going to have to work<br>with a very diverse group of people<br>people that don't think the same way<br>that they do and they're going to<br>probably be working in an unfamiliar<br>environment and that's the future for<br>all of our engineering graduates while<br>all of our graduates full-stop really<br>particularly engineering where I teach<br>but when you think about it space is an<br>extremely good analogy for that okay so<br>we have an unfamiliar environment all<br>right generally the problems are complex<br>that they have to solve and generally<br>they're going to have to be working with<br>large groups of people that don't think<br>the same way that they do so that's<br>where the auckland program for space<br>systems is actually being used to help<br>our graduates prepare for their future<br>let's<br>a lot to do with it when you think about<br>it the satellites in low Earth orbit<br>tend to be inwards looking all right<br>they're looking down at the planet<br>they're solving problems for Humanity so<br>we need to get to humanity's involved in<br>the first instance to identify the<br>problems once those problems are<br>identified then nowadays with space<br>becoming more and more privatized we<br>have to throw a business case around<br>that alright so we get to business<br>people involved now once the business<br>people are involved the business case is<br>wrapped around it looks like it's a go<br>ahead you know let's go and do this<br>thing now the scientists come along so<br>Nick and his crowd come in and they<br>start to decide what kind of data do we<br>need what kind of sensors do we need<br>what's the actual science behind all of<br>this that we need to collect while we're<br>in space once we've got that then the<br>engineers come in and we build stuff all<br>right so the engineers build it once<br>it's built it gets launched thanks to<br>rocket lab and and people like rocket<br>lab companies like rocket lab it goes up<br>into space<br>once it's into space now the computer<br>and ICT people start to take the data<br>streams that come down from the<br>satellite so remember that the<br>satellites are only generating data<br>streams realistically that's all they're<br>doing they're sending data back down to<br>earth computer and ICT people manipulate<br>that and come up with a solution to the<br>problem that the humanities came up with<br>in the first place<br>so this is where the space program is is<br>an ideal analog to what the future holds<br>for a lot of our students shouldn't turn<br>my back on the camera should I am I'm<br>naughty that way right let's try this<br>okay so what is the a PSS<br>it's a student-led Crosse faculty<br>program and we asked them specifically<br>to identify a need to benefit society we<br>asked them to form their own team we<br>asked them to develop a solution to a<br>problem that they've come up with<br>themselves submit a formal proposal and<br>a poster and a video all right so we do<br>all of this all extracurricular the<br>students aren't actually being there's<br>no credit involved in it okay they do it<br>because they<br>want to do it and we try and mix it up<br>and make it as complex as we can for<br>them okay we don't want to make it too<br>easy do we guys know what we end up with<br>at the end of it is a lot of proposals<br>and these are some from our first year<br>but you see up there the first year that<br>we run we're in our third cycle now so<br>what we do at the end is we decide on<br>three winners and they're not based on<br>first second or third they are most<br>benefit to New Zealand most likely to<br>succeed and most ambitious which is a<br>little bit like you know you're nuts but<br>it's a really cool idea it'll never work<br>I'm the most likely to succeed is the<br>one that we go ahead and build and<br>you'll be hearing from Kessler a little<br>bit later on we are right now about to<br>deliver our first satellite to rocket<br>lab student-built<br>undergraduate and it's the first Kessler<br>who you hear from later is working on<br>the second but for us the thing to<br>remember is that for me anyway the way<br>I've set the program up space is just<br>the hook okay I'll come program for<br>space system so today it's space systems<br>if this program had been run a hundred<br>years ago we probably could have called<br>it the auckland program for steamships<br>if the ice caps continue to melt a<br>hundred years from now you know it could<br>be the auckland program for submarine<br>settlement the simple truth is that what<br>we're doing with the program at the<br>undergraduate level is challenging our<br>students and preparing them for the<br>future okay space is just a vehicle it's<br>just a hook and that's the way that<br>we're running it thank you very much<br>cool hi so I'm well from Zeno<br>astronautics and Zeno astronauts is in<br>the business of satellite propulsion so<br>our method is powerful superconducting<br>magnets that interact with the earth or<br>the geomagnetic field or other<br>satellites that allows us to do some<br>interesting things like rendezvous with<br>other satellites for repair or refueling<br>as well as the full suite of orbital<br>maneuvers so secondary insertions<br>changing our orbit in any way avoiding<br>space debris and increasing problem and<br>then end-of-life the orbiting and we<br>initially starting with cube set so<br>those are these of shoebox-sized things<br>that weigh about 4 to 10 kgs as opposed<br>to traditional satellites which are size<br>of an SUV or a school bus and weigh<br>about 4 to 6 ton so we're dudes in a<br>begun we were one of the teams in the<br>inaugural year off the auckland program<br>for space systems that's where I met max<br>and Sebastian the two founders we<br>submitted a design a mission design<br>proposal and did not win so we decided<br>to independently go out and pursue it as<br>a start-up I guess I'll talk a bit about<br>what it's like being a start-up in the<br>space community in New Zealand one of<br>the good things is that in New Zealand<br>the space industry still it's still in<br>its infancy so it's a group of people<br>that all know each other rather than<br>sort of hundreds of corporations with<br>thousands of employees each it can<br>sometimes be a bit sort of faceless I<br>think it's probably telling that<br>probably all the panelists knew each<br>other or met each other before this<br>event and going into meeting new people<br>that tends to be the rule rather than<br>the exception and in our experience the<br>community does seem to come together and<br>try to help each other out where<br>possible even globally the observe wider<br>space sort of economy is fairly sort of<br>insular it's fairly it's a lot of people<br>who transition between organisations<br>it's quite a tight-knit community for<br>one there's a sort of a vast body of<br>regulatory work space laws so we're also<br>been the same boat together regardless<br>of what country you're operating from at<br>some level I'm you know we work with<br>local research institutes as well as<br>sort of a network of<br>Global part supplies and and strategic<br>business partners and then New Zealand<br>Space Agency has been incredibly helpful<br>in fostering good relationships with<br>Europe the European Space Agency NASA as<br>well as other NASA other US regulatory<br>and commercial parties so that aids us<br>in our sort of job a lot in terms of I<br>guess the difficulties have been a<br>start-up in New Zealand and it's<br>probably three one of them has given the<br>relative infancy of space here in New<br>Zealand no University in Auckland in New<br>Zealand offers aerospace engineering so<br>that means that there's a lot of<br>self-taught after learning as a note if<br>anyone wants to learn orbital mechanics<br>just pay Kerbal space program it's a<br>great game and I'm not being paid for<br>saying that well the other thing is<br>there's sort of a maximum that is when<br>you're launching a satellite or building<br>space hardware if the paperwork doesn't<br>outweigh your rocket you're not really<br>for launch so there's you know literally<br>tons of paperwork and that means that<br>sometimes accessing relevant legal<br>counsel and space law can be quite<br>challenging here so very very few people<br>in New Zealand who know much about space<br>law lastly on the funding route so<br>critically Musil and we have a very<br>robust sort of seed and investment<br>ecosystem however space startups are<br>usually capital intensive and<br>bootstrapping is partly an option so<br>sometimes it can be a bit difficult in a<br>start-up context however two things to<br>know there one of them are these are not<br>insurmountable problems and B this will<br>likely change as the ecosystem matures<br>lastly probably to any student who's<br>think anybody really thinking about<br>setting startup some points to remember<br>one of them as that New Zealand has<br>rated the number one country in the<br>world for starting in business and<br>number five for doing business we are<br>globally very politically stable very<br>uncorrupt<br>and we have a high level of social<br>security so I guess in closing if you<br>are thinking about starting a startup if<br>you have that as a question miles would<br>hi um so I am Felix didn't obviously so<br>I work for Kistler and Jonathan will<br>tell you more about that but my primary<br>role in the team is with the electron<br>emissions so I focus on sourcing<br>designing and basically researching them<br>so it's quite cool I've been able to<br>communicate and talk to people<br>professionals in the industry and I<br>think that's an amazing opportunity<br>considering I did not come from a<br>science background besides obviously<br>physics again I didn't know much about<br>it I didn't know much about electron<br>emissions and it's been really amazing<br>working with Jonathan and everyone else<br>learning about these things it's a<br>really cool experience<br>ya don't have much else to say besides<br>it's cool and anyone can do it Anastasia<br>now Jonathan hi everyone so as Jim said<br>the real purpose about a PSS is<br>identifying a problem and society that<br>you want to solve so I'm the team lead<br>of our second cube set team cool that<br>we've caught ourselves Kistler we<br>identified the problem of space junk<br>because when you put something up in<br>space it actually stays up there for a<br>really long time on the order of decades<br>if not hundreds of years that's actually<br>really good thing well your satellites<br>still working you kind of want it to<br>stay up there but then once it stops<br>working either intentionally or<br>something goes wrong and it breaks you<br>can't talk to it you can't control it<br>and it's stuck up there you the<br>important thing is you can't control it<br>because there's a risk of it crashing<br>and two other things up in space and<br>well space is really big it does happen<br>it has what happened in 2009 a defunct<br>Russian satellite<br>with a functioning communication<br>satellite creating thousands of little<br>bits of debris and the problem is that<br>one set like collision can create<br>thousands of bits of debris they can go<br>on to create more satellite collisions<br>and more fields of debris and create a<br>snowball or a runaway effect deemed<br>Acushla<br>syndrome hence our cubes its name so we<br>wanted to focus on we wanted to focus on<br>space struck the the the infrastructure<br>that was up in space that we depend on<br>daily is immense and you probably don't<br>even notice that half the time from GPS<br>to communication satellites to make<br>planet sensing and all that sort of<br>stuff<br>its immense and if that were to go<br>because of a runaway Kistler effect the<br>events will be catastrophic so what we<br>decided to focus on is a technology<br>called electrodynamic tethers it's a<br>really long cable that stretches out<br>from a satellite and as it orbits the<br>earth the this long cable interacts with<br>the Earth's magnetic field in sort of<br>the same way that using the same<br>principle that powers electric<br>generators of electric motors we use<br>literally the entire Earth's magnetic<br>field as a way to slow down or break our<br>satellite what we want to do is we want<br>to chuck a satellite up in space deploy<br>the stever and prove that it can be used<br>to slow down a satellite if we can do<br>that then we prove then we we think that<br>it can be a viable solution to help slow<br>down and deal with satellites in the<br>future at the end of their lives so that<br>they don't stick around in space and<br>become a problem further this has<br>already been done by NASA in the past<br>they deployed a 20 kilometer long tether<br>trouble is deploying a 20 kilometer long<br>tether isn't really feasible or cheap or<br>lightweight for satellite manufacturers<br>putting it on a 1u cube set something<br>that can fit on the size of your hands<br>that is cheap that is lightweight that<br>is affordable and so by scaling it down<br>miniaturizing and proving that it can<br>work on that scale we think has really<br>good there's a really beneficial impact<br>on the entire space industry and sort of<br>our futures because our lives depend on<br>space<br>does yeah you can ask me questions about<br>what what it's like being are being on a<br>cube set team leading a cube set team<br>it's been a very interesting journey so<br>far it's gonna continue being an<br>interesting journey I've had to learn<br>how to lead a team and lead people and<br>learn how to build a satellite because<br>that's really hard and like you don't go<br>in knowing that stuff but it's<br>incredibly rewarding I get to actually<br>work on something that during my<br>university studies that actually has<br>like a real physical output by the end<br>of the day I get to make something<br>that's going into space and I don't<br>think I can say that about any of my<br>other engineering courses and also I get<br>to a chance to work on something that<br>might actually make a difference in the<br>future it's fascinating it's really cool<br>stuff anyway thanks for your time<br>okay thanks Jonathan and thanks everyone<br>for those introductions now we're going<br>to move to the exciting part of the<br>event where we get to take your<br>questions you can direct them at any<br>individual panelist member or if there's<br>a more general question that everyone<br>could respond to that's fine as well so<br>I hope we have a number of questions on<br>the slide O'Toole but perhaps we'll<br>start with if there are any questions in<br>the room that we could take and I think<br>we've got a couple of roving mics that<br>we can we can bring to people I think<br>good evening now if we look at the<br>history of the humble computer he had<br>turns machine ENIAC the cray-1<br>supercomputer desktops and laptops up<br>into the quantum computer now in your<br>particular industry compared to the<br>humble computer from 1945 to now that's<br>about 74 years now the question is a<br>rocket is a rocket no matter what it's<br>propelled by so where did the technology<br>go if you compare that to the Hubble<br>computer whether the technology go do<br>I'm not answering the question<br>which-which ah there we go I got it I<br>got it where did the technology go well<br>essentially the technology went into how<br>we manufacture the Rockets and how we<br>control them as much as anything I mean<br>the physics of rocket propulsion the<br>engineering that goes behind rocket<br>propulsion hasn't changed we can't<br>change the laws of physics and the laws<br>of science what we are doing is changing<br>the way that we're making them and if<br>you look at rocket lab they're a perfect<br>example they're 3d printing their<br>engines you know that would have been<br>unheard of sort of even you know several<br>decades ago if you look at the<br>technology that goes into the satellites<br>themselves it's getting smaller and<br>smaller to the point where we can do<br>real science now with a 10 centimeter<br>cube so where you think the technology<br>or you know the hypothesis is is the<br>technology hasn't changed what hasn't<br>changed is the laws of physics and the<br>laws of science but everything around<br>that to manufacturability of it that has<br>changed tremendously we're building<br>carbon fiber rockets with 3d printed<br>motors driven by batteries right that's<br>how far we've come great I think we had<br>another one just here just for a second<br>thanks thanks a couple of presenters of<br>sort of focused on value as being you<br>know the original driver of full of work<br>that follows is there any current value<br>analysis that looks saving and the New<br>Zealand context of what the if it goes<br>into versus the value we get out of it<br>and there might be financial value it<br>might be other sort of benefits even<br>social benefits is there any in anything<br>out there that even looks at<br>internationally<br>you know what the bang for the buck is<br>of the technology and how about scaling<br>against the t curve and what we're<br>capable of now because it seems to me if<br>we identify the value that does tend to<br>drive a lot of the activity that follows<br>and that falls into the models that<br>you're you're putting in front of us<br>who's gonna jump up for that one thanks<br>Joe<br>what basically look what I would say is<br>with any endeavor so I teach engineering<br>management<br>alright that's that's my stock in trade<br>so one of the things that I have to get<br>across to my engineering students<br>constantly is it doesn't matter how good<br>your idea is if you cannot build a<br>business case around that it will not<br>progress you know it's it's like well<br>boss boss I've got this great thing you<br>know we can build this widget yeah ok<br>who's gonna buy it oh well everybody<br>will buy it well ok well show me that<br>alright show me that people will buy it<br>and what then we'll put some money into<br>it we're doing research at the<br>University we're doing research in<br>private industry we're doing startups<br>now all of those things have to have a<br>business case around them so when we<br>apply for when Nick applies for for<br>grants ok when Williams has a start<br>business startup you know and they're<br>attracting finance they have to have a<br>business case around them so you ask<br>where's the bang for buck that has to<br>every I suppose every case has to prove<br>its value before it progresses and<br>that's just the way it is that's that's<br>the way in the world at the moment I<br>don't know whether that is the kind of<br>like that's probably the sort of thing<br>you have to ask Andrew @mb hey that's<br>more of a national I can I can offer an<br>observation at least so I'm not an<br>economist I'm a scientist or what we<br>notice is that there is a move towards<br>doing doing space smaller and with more<br>what that means is there are<br>corporations looking at for instance<br>providing global internet using a swarm<br>of small satellites and we're not<br>talking about two or three thousands so<br>they're gonna be thousands of these<br>things up in space part of the reason<br>why our students are concerned about<br>this is what are you gonna do with those<br>things when they die and so we were<br>addressing that with a real project to<br>bring them down at the end of life<br>safely as a cardiac Katonah exercise and<br>protecting a finite resource leaving<br>that aside looking towards how the world<br>is moving to defy zation of space it is<br>through these small satellites which are<br>all themselves quite powerful and so<br>when we look at it we we say okay what's<br>the value that we can we presume that<br>these companies are not doing this just<br>for the hell of it they're looking at<br>this is a viable business case for<br>providing the services they want to<br>provide and we wish to buy into that we<br>wish to invest in their we wish to<br>invest in our institutions across the<br>country so that we can get our technical<br>expertise get our scientific expertise<br>get our way of doing business in to<br>these global supply chains<br>so that wins when we build the next best<br>widget which is about yay big small<br>high-value easily transportable across<br>the world we can compete internationally<br>that's what we're aiming to do now<br>whether that's economically actually<br>couldn't actually happen I'm not the<br>economist but this is what we're<br>predicating a lot of our work on ok so<br>maybe I can put some hard numbers in<br>there because I think that's maybe what<br>you're after so each year there is an<br>annual survey around the world of return<br>on investment on various parts of the<br>economy<br>typically eros<br>bass is about eight to one for every<br>dollar you put in you expect about eight<br>dollars back as a comparison tourism is<br>about 1.03 so you know and if you look<br>at the developed countries why are they<br>developed and what areas that I choose<br>you know Japan or Germany aerospace<br>engineering is usually one of the first<br>things that gets developed yeah and if I<br>could just add to that I am an economist<br>and I would say one of the reasons that<br>the New Zealand government is interested<br>in supporting the space industry to<br>develop and new zealand is because it is<br>the high school high R&amp;D export-oriented<br>capital intensive industry that we kind<br>of need to raise our productivity<br>performance which has been a big problem<br>for the overall economy for at least the<br>last thirty years so that's that's a key<br>rationale for why the government's<br>involved I have a question to the<br>Kistler team lead you know from one<br>interested soon to another can you talk<br>to us about how your team came to be and<br>like how multidisciplinary they really<br>are so like how as a brief history we<br>actually entered about two years ago and<br>the first keep set challenge we lost<br>because I don't know our team because<br>partly our teams partly our idea in our<br>strategy it wasn't fully formed and we<br>came back and we re-entered worth more<br>people a bit of team I'd like to say<br>better management but I was the<br>management so that's and yet we won I<br>think Jim put it really well about how<br>it has definitely motivated you need the<br>humanities to give you the idea in the<br>first place when we when we won when we<br>started off we we have a personnel team<br>who like delved deep into the science we<br>got scientists to funding what we're<br>doing out we had to delve deep into the<br>science and the physics behind tears to<br>first stuff figure out if they'd work if<br>so how would they work how would we fit<br>them it was only then once we once he<br>did the research into it did the<br>did all the hard maths and he came back<br>and he told us okay it can work if you<br>do it this way or if you do it this way<br>you know me the engineer and the other<br>people coming in and they're saying okay<br>now that you've given us numbers now<br>we're trying to fit it into the space<br>that we have I think it actually what<br>I've seen it really closely follows what<br>Jim said the scientists had to tell us<br>actually here this as possible all this<br>as impossible first my advice to you is<br>the team would be make sure it works<br>prove that it works or find out how it<br>can work especially in terms of<br>convincing those people yeah prove that<br>it will work and that you can get it to<br>work hi I'm first of all thank you for<br>this opportunity of speaking to all of<br>us that came you good people my<br>questions are more along the lines of<br>dr. Miller you you mentioned how New<br>Zealand would be fitting itself into<br>this sort of continuum or into global<br>relevance has there been much talk along<br>any of the goals or future deadlines we<br>can expect to find our endeavors or our<br>accomplishments by so I don't know that<br>there's any deadlines per se but I think<br>there is an opportunity right now I'm a<br>big believer in momentum as you get<br>something going and you get people<br>behind it and and then if you can<br>continue that enthusiasm then you can<br>help help build something so we have we<br>have to start you know we've we've got a<br>lot of interest you're all here and<br>there's enthusiasm and and you know the<br>other thing about space is it captures<br>people's imagination it captures their<br>imagination it gets them excited<br>I tell people you know I work for NASA<br>I'm like yeah yeah oh my gosh you know<br>they think it's the coolest thing I give<br>them a sticker and you think that I've<br>just you know it's made of gold so that<br>child like curiosity and inspiration<br>that space brings about with it let's<br>capture that<br>you know and there's no deadline and<br>it's not going away yet we do there is<br>an opportunity here that's unique<br>because there's a lot of momentum around<br>small satellites and accessibility and<br>suddenly what seemed like it was the<br>paradigm of the large you know the<br>NASA's and the Jax's and the ESA's now<br>you've got smaller nations actually<br>engaging alongside them and being taken<br>seriously and they're part of the<br>overall human effort that brings us<br>together in terms of curiosity science<br>and exploration so we should seize that<br>opportunity so that's why and again it's<br>coming from my perspective as an<br>engineer and as a payload person so I<br>realized that I'm going to be somewhat<br>skewed by my background but in the<br>efforts that I've been involved in they<br>have formulated and kind of like what<br>Jim said we start off with our question<br>that question might be how does this<br>serve humanity or a science question but<br>then as you need to get to the point<br>that you can then communicate these<br>things to the engineers who will<br>actually build it and so in doing so in<br>kind of that cycle that Jim was alluding<br>to that focuses at n it's like okay<br>here's our question now that focuses we<br>need to know this we need to know that<br>we need to know that and here are the<br>people and the expertise and the<br>technologies that we need to engage and<br>so that becomes the thing that you<br>other questions in the room this one<br>over here this is for anyone on the<br>panel one of the cool problems of being<br>in space is the energy required to run<br>these satellites and various ventures<br>and we've talked about batteries and<br>lithium-ion and has decay problems so<br>they're not going to last and<br>differently what's what's the attitude<br>on fission and fusion many reactors or<br>different types of battery technology<br>so they've handed the microphone to the<br>physicist okay yeah all right so it<br>should actually be a measure for the<br>material science as opposed to<br>development but you're exactly right<br>there is this issue where we hand over a<br>satellite to rocket lab it sits in the<br>launch vehicle with a lithium-ion<br>battery we hope that when it gets up<br>there the solar panels will charge the<br>thing up and off or go and that all that<br>will work for a significant length of<br>the mission life yes<br>so we are npower as one of those finite<br>resources on a cube set which you have<br>to to manage very well you mean it's<br>more than just other batteries a bit<br>flat we'll just keep on going if the<br>battery is flat and the computer can't<br>run and you're not convinced that oh<br>well it Browns out and then it tries to<br>start itself again and it's not enough<br>power it can send a cell into a terrible<br>loop and you have no control over the<br>satellite so yes power is an<br>extraordinary difficult thing to manage<br>and ignore important as in terms of<br>finding different technologies for<br>powering you asked a specific question<br>fish and in fusion the fusion is a<br>little bit out of the realms of<br>possibility is sailing with a small cube<br>set until we discover some new physics<br>and get you on that in terms of fishing<br>perhaps or maybe more generally<br>radioactive decay to produce power<br>leaving aside the issues regarding<br>whether that's a good idea<br>environmentally or if indeed it's safe<br>there is a whole field of other core<br>beta voltaics which is a way of<br>producing power very tiny amounts of<br>power to out of nuclear decay products<br>and this is of an interest to me<br>personally and the question is whether<br>you can get enough essentially juice out<br>of one of these things to do anything<br>useful with it but we're also<br>contemplating going even smaller than a<br>cube set format so we're gesturing here<br>with you know with a view of our 1u cube<br>set in my hand there are missions being<br>contemplated which go in even smaller so<br>small chip sets which themselves still<br>need power but instead of you know<br>sending up a lithium battery maybe we<br>can use some of these very well these<br>new technologies for generating power so<br>yes we are thinking beyond the standard<br>solar panel plus the Thea<br>Vetri I'm also get interested in things<br>like what can you do with fuel cell<br>technologies I mean you can have a fuel<br>cell on a tiny chip can you utilize that<br>in space and any kind of meaningful way<br>I don't know the answers to there but I<br>need to talk to my friends in<br>microfluidics microfabrication and see<br>whether the sort of thing is possible<br>well since we're thinking small we can<br>also think different does that answer<br>your question in satisfactory I would<br>suspect so yes there is there's been<br>certain controversies around various<br>launches and the safety of we launched<br>them and the launch fails what happens<br>with this payload with with this you<br>know stuff falling into the ocean so<br>yeah there are just a fun little note<br>about generating power in orbit<br>electrodynamic tethers that I'm working<br>on they actually generate power orbiting<br>the Earth and you it doesn't necessarily<br>make sense and low-earth orbit because<br>you're effectively trading off your<br>orbit velocity for energy so I'll say oh<br>yeah I got energy but I D orbit it in<br>like a month but there's been some<br>fantastic research done into using a<br>tether to come into orbit around Jupiter<br>and use the teeler to slow down and<br>break and in doing that because of<br>Jupiter's intense magnetic fields you<br>generate like a megawatt of power good<br>maybe<br>this is a question I asked on the Slayer<br>thing as well but and so a rocket lab<br>big success story for New Zealand<br>I put usually don't on the space map you<br>know with apologies to all your previous<br>efforts but it's a company that's<br>headquartered in California should we<br>care about that and if we do care about<br>that what could we do to make New<br>Zealand have a fully self-sustaining<br>entrepreneurial ecosystem for space<br>which doesn't for example rely on and<br>get partially controlled by outside<br>capital might be quite a good one for<br>here from will as a start-up I'm sure<br>finance is a big part of the question<br>yeah so I'd say the I won't us answer<br>the first part the question which is<br>should we care my answer the second one<br>which is we look to the reasons why<br>rocket lab first moved well in the first<br>place<br>and Peter Beck has been pretty open<br>about he said you know funding was a big<br>component a big component of why he had<br>to move you u.s. VCS can be a bit touchy<br>around they don't like to put a massive<br>amount of money in a company that isn't<br>from the US so that would probably be<br>one of the reasons to perhaps that would<br>be an area to focus on I think apart<br>from that newzealand works quite well<br>with the US we have some sort of<br>memorandum of cooperation with the FAA<br>so that's opposed a funding is one of<br>the big sort of easy things traps<br>mitigate to keep companies here I was<br>involved in the funding of rocket lab I<br>was a provider early in the piece rocket<br>lab wouldn't be off the ground if it<br>hadn't got us funding there was nobody<br>in New Zealand that would fund it and to<br>be honest with you one of the lessons<br>you should learn is the reason Peter I<br>think has been able to continue to get<br>the funding he's got because he has good<br>quality investors to give subsequent<br>investors the confidence to actually<br>continue to Beckham so you know it's all<br>well it's all well and good to say can<br>we keep it in New Zealand all of that<br>sort of thing<br>for the entrepreneurs are trying to<br>start up their obligations to themselves<br>and what they get out of it rather than<br>necessarily the sort of New Zealand ink<br>and you're right the reason to let's be<br>honest with you the reason these in the<br>u.s. is you've got a whole lot of<br>investors who are totally comfortable<br>with a Delaware company they don't have<br>to go and get separate legal advice to<br>get them what's a New Zealand company<br>what's the New Zealand Companies Act so<br>I think that was done but also it makes<br>it easy for the investor you know I can<br>sorry just got to follow up over here<br>sorry just yeah that would fit quite<br>well to the question before question to<br>will in terms of being a start-up<br>founder in New Zealand do you mind<br>sharing maybe some lessons learned you<br>you gain within the first month or any<br>tips you can give to newcomers what you<br>wouldn't do or what do you definitely do<br>again I'd say probably that New Zealand<br>is a country that's pretty small and you<br>can probably get a meeting with almost<br>anyone so key is to probably have good<br>advisors and ask a lot of questions<br>there's a lot of people in this country<br>that are willing to give help so yeah an<br>opportunity to learn from best<br>principles is particularly easy here<br>it's probably my big advice so good for<br>asking what is a why as synthetic<br>aperture radar so important and what<br>other kind of sensors you know are going<br>to be important in the future sort of<br>you know for future applications Thanks<br>well so is a synthetic aperture radar or<br>SAR is a very powerful technique I mean<br>that's where it's been a lot of my<br>career the the real benefits and I'm not<br>you know I'm a fan of all technologies<br>because they all give you different<br>aspects of different different<br>information and so if we can pull it all<br>together you know more than if you just<br>have one in isolation<br>but the big advantages of SAR is you<br>have your own illuminator it's an active<br>sensor so you can see through clouds you<br>can see at night and a lot of the time<br>we can't see things with other senses<br>because of cloud cover and it's just a<br>simple thing that we're not getting<br>around and that for New Zealanders is<br>being heir to our is is a real problem a<br>lot of the time the other things around<br>sir is its high resolution all-weather<br>so and and you can get different aspects<br>from different frequencies and the<br>playing polarimetry and a from a tree<br>there's all kinds of advanced techniques<br>you can use in order to get different<br>aspects of whatever it is you're looking<br>for the second part of your question was<br>future<br>I think the range of senses is fairly<br>well you know kind of got a myriad of<br>you got your passive active later and<br>spectral you know optical and various<br>parts of the spectrum so it's it's more<br>advances in the sensitivities of those<br>or the ways that we can get more data<br>better data hi Reza you know let's see<br>the way that we combine the information<br>that will make the advances the other<br>thing is as the platform changes our<br>spatial temporal sampling will change<br>and that for especially for things that<br>are dynamic processes it gives us a<br>better way of viewing those and that's<br>what you know having constellations of<br>small sets really opens up a new<br>sampling space that you can't<br>necessarily get from one big satellite<br>that repeats every few days or every few<br>weeks and said you've got a a cognizance<br>that you wouldn't have before just<br>because of the platform so it's a<br>combination of the platform the sensor<br>the geometry and the spatial temporal<br>sampling<br>I'd like to hear from the young lady up<br>there if that's okay what has been the<br>biggest accomplishment and Space<br>Research in the past ten years I think<br>if you ask anyone here everyone's going<br>to have a different opinion on that so<br>gosh what got me excited in the past ten<br>years and maybe got me back to New<br>Zealand is the capability that rocket<br>lab brought not in the small sets but in<br>the fact that now space is accessible<br>for young countries like New Zealand<br>that maybe can't put up a billion-dollar<br>satellite but they can put up a<br>satellite that does something really<br>good because it's now accessible so we<br>can we can actually do something pretty<br>exciting here now anyone else I'm aware<br>that two missions I've been quite<br>excited by recently as they now retiring<br>Kepler space telescope so that<br>discovered about 3,500 exoplanets so<br>planets around other stars that's pretty<br>cool because you know a couple decades<br>ago we weren't sure as to where there<br>are many exoplanets the other one would<br>be New Horizons so as a kid we had we'd<br>not had any sort of close approach of<br>Pluto and so having seen high-resolution<br>photos come through I think was 2014 for<br>me was pretty cool hasn't really been<br>done obviously but the idea of<br>colonizing other planets I think that's<br>quite a cool idea a while ago I was I<br>did a competition for how much money<br>would it take to colonize the moon and I<br>found that was really interesting and<br>you look at all the natural materials<br>and what you could do to do that and I<br>thought that was really cool it was<br>something out it's really interested in<br>yeah I mean obviously my answers<br>somewhat bias but I think the<br>introduction of cube sets and small sets<br>but if it weren't for that like there<br>was no way I would have the opportunity<br>at least all being from New Zeeland<br>to actually build something that would<br>go into space I'd have to go I'd have to<br>try and go overseas not that the US<br>would let someone not from the US work<br>on a satellite and try and work on a<br>multi-billion dollar company and maybe<br>get a sell maybe have a small role on<br>building a satellite but here I get to<br>actually be in charge of a team doing it<br>and it's incredible and ridiculous that<br>that's actually a thing that I can do<br>it's incredible<br>they do let people from New Zealand do<br>that how ok I think it's my questions<br>around now what are we doing here in New<br>Zealand in terms of democratizing access<br>to space resources and space data<br>particularly relevant to applicable to<br>our GDP sectors and so agriculture data<br>environmental data of observation data<br>what are we doing here to democratize<br>access to that government official for<br>an answer<br>I think we're it's fair to say that<br>comes at the start of a journey of<br>understanding how we can be bitter<br>raising awareness not only within the<br>government but the wider New Zealand<br>society about what the applications of<br>Earth Observation data could be and how<br>it could be smarter about acquiring data<br>when we do make the decision to do that<br>but it's certainly something that the<br>government's interested in seeing if we<br>can do a lot more efficiently than we<br>have in the past I just might add to<br>that that one of the things that's<br>happening in space now is it's becoming<br>privatized so the availability of data<br>it's it's just simply a matter of buying<br>it it doesn't need to be democratized so<br>much anymore it's now commercial<br>industry and that commercial industry<br>like like everything else is available<br>for sale you know we don't have to go<br>behind the Iron Curtain or behind the US<br>curtain or whatever it happens to be<br>anymore you know and and also along<br>those lines is there's really a thought<br>along that data has to be bought there's<br>an awful lot of freely available data so<br>I come from my background as NASA that's<br>where most of my career has been all<br>NASA data is free and it's<br>available globally and so and that's the<br>case with the number of their satellites<br>and number the space agencies up there<br>so there is a lot of data available and<br>people don't realize that it is but it's<br>it's there and it's accessible for<br>everybody let's chip you sorry<br>I'm I put this question on the slider<br>thing but yeah so is New Zealand's<br>geographical isolation a significant<br>problem in terms of importing<br>specialized components and if so how do<br>we solve this this is directed at<br>so the question was this is our<br>isolation a problem for obtaining the<br>the hardware and componentry that we<br>need look I I buy a lot of stuff on<br>Aliexpress it's never been a problem for<br>me I don't think it's an isolation<br>anymore you know I think it's I think<br>it's just business as usual now I have<br>an amusing comment yes you can be the<br>judge so one of the interesting things<br>about trying to build a satellite and<br>trying to come up with a program like<br>this out of whole cloth starting from<br>scratch and you don't have decades of<br>space engineering behind you like at JPL<br>like at NASA where these people have<br>wrestled with these problems over<br>decades are the little things that you<br>don't expect to really be a problem<br>space glue who knew there was such a<br>thing but it makes complete sense so<br>when you build a satellite you well<br>certainly four satellites that we're<br>building you need to glue the things<br>together once you figured out yep I'm<br>happy that that goes there that goes<br>there because these are all put together<br>you know right now basically you dip it<br>all in glue or rather you have you a fix<br>everything properly so that doesn't<br>shake apart during launch now there are<br>only a few types of glue which are space<br>rated you can't just glue it together<br>with you know you who or you know<br>whatever super glue you find in the<br>drawer you have to make sure you have to<br>you have to be able to tell rocket lab<br>about everything that is going into<br>their launch vehicle down to the glue<br>that we used and if we don't use the<br>right glue they might say we're here my<br>stuff's not space rated it could<br>suddenly start to evaporate out gas<br>boils stuff might it might behave very<br>strangely under you know cold<br>temperatures or vacuum so they want to<br>know what glue did you use and if that<br>glue is not on the list of space rate of<br>material then they could quite<br>reasonably say sorry we're not going to<br>launch because it might might damage our<br>spacecraft and all the other missions<br>that fly with you<br>we are on the hunt for space glue that<br>fell into my desk which was an<br>interesting exercise because it was like<br>glue okay where do I buy space glue from<br>and importantly how do I get it into the<br>country<br>it is the particular glues that we're<br>looking at where particulate epoxy so it<br>you know I'm not a glue expert but it<br>was I learned a lot they were very they<br>are very dangerous to transport and so I<br>was calling Air New Zealand saying how<br>do I get this stuff into the country I<br>need to build a satellite how much do<br>you need litres no I need how much oh<br>very difficult so those little things<br>you know take up an extraordinary amount<br>of time it isn't the big questions like<br>you know what should we observe that<br>nets that's fun that's the fun part the<br>hard part space glue and it's kept a lot<br>more fun than the paperwork you have to<br>do which is it allows you've been<br>falling on Jim's shoulders and others in<br>the university but just to give you an<br>idea of it sounds very glamorous and it<br>sounds very exciting in the same way<br>that discovering planets sounds very<br>glamorous and exciting but the reality<br>is you spend a lot of your time in front<br>of a computer wondering why your code is<br>not working and it's all falling over in<br>the same way building a satellite<br>here my question relates to a PSS and<br>time management I was wondering if the<br>students could perhaps talk to how well<br>how well you've managed to keep a track<br>of doing studies and and maintaining a<br>good a good balance between doing such a<br>time demanding extracurricular activity<br>and also maintaining the best academic<br>achievements that you can what social<br>life it's not it's not easy just like it<br>is a I've owned like I manage it but<br>it's difficult I manage it because I've<br>spent a lot of time trying to learn how<br>to do it in my second year I was on the<br>Formula SAE team and I had to juggle<br>that and university and it wasn't easy<br>but I'd slowly learnt just simply by<br>sort of like a trial by fire jumping in<br>the DP and<br>I solely learned how best to actually<br>manage my time and it's not easy you can<br>find a thousand different ways on how to<br>do it and beat procrastination and<br>organize your life I've got a secret<br>tips for you unfortunately you just<br>genuinely have to jump in there<br>believing in what I'm doing helps like I<br>actually want to dedicate a significant<br>portion of my time to what I'm doing<br>which does actually help a lot sorry if<br>I have really helped it's not an easy<br>question to answer is there a sense of<br>just how much time it's too much well to<br>be fair I'm the leader of the team so I<br>put on far too much I said I have to I<br>could quantify it but like 15 20 hours a<br>week for me personally I don't expect<br>that of my team members I sort of take<br>what they can get I mean so for me I<br>have two jobs outside of uni and Kistler<br>so if we're quiet for long but when you<br>find something that you really love it's<br>really easy to find time for it one of<br>my biggest point is I don't have enough<br>time to give as much time as I want to<br>kiss ah the workload can vary so<br>sometimes you're just waiting and you<br>just have nothing to do other times it<br>depends I guess<br>but finding schedules I've used<br>schedules to maintain my time and just<br>outside of life itself<br>making lists lists are really useful<br>just as a sort of follow-up as well to<br>Jim on the other side of that do you<br>find it beneficial that your students<br>have sort of split focus because it kind<br>of it it Wiens out the ones that are<br>there one's been more likely to be<br>successful other ones that can handle my<br>time demands like that or would you have<br>you put in any anything to sort of<br>reduce workload to try and yeah combat<br>that if I put anything in place to<br>reduce the workload for the students now<br>look to be perfectly honest with you as<br>in it and as with anything in life you<br>know the successful ones are driven<br>the successful ones of the high<br>achievers if you if you're not ambitious<br>you won't last at it it really is that<br>simple and that that's the same with<br>anything that's the same with a degree<br>that's the same with learning how to ski<br>that's the same with anything in life<br>really the students that we get involved<br>do tend to be quite high achievers I<br>mean I'm I'm always just blown away with<br>what they can achieve you know when<br>they're left to their own devices and we<br>very much leave them to their own<br>devices and that's in part deliberate<br>that's part of the experience that I try<br>and give them I mean I'm an old fellow<br>the reason that I do this is because I<br>like to mess with the minds of the next<br>generation and and that's basically what<br>we do we give them an opportunity to<br>stretch and expand a quick question<br>about the competitiveness of the space<br>industry how does New Zealand compete<br>with other nations for international<br>investment and how do we keep that<br>investment so what is our competitive<br>advantage or at least our comparative<br>advantage in this industry as we go<br>forward anybody it's New Zealand so one<br>thing we've identified internally is our<br>unfair advantage would be how small<br>butts of the New Zealand Space Agency is<br>I'm a group of three engineers would<br>never have a meeting with probably<br>anybody from NASA particularly sort of<br>higher up the NASA<br>and chain we could turn up to them and<br>using the Space Agency's usually fairly<br>friendly to us also New Zealand is<br>probably unique and that it has a very<br>friendly relationship with both the<br>Europe the European Space Agency and<br>NASA which is probably unusual compared<br>to a lot of countries so yeah I think<br>that we're actually well positioned to<br>probably remain globally competitive in<br>this industry I suppose for me one of<br>the things that I want to do too part of<br>the APS S is encouraging startups I come<br>from an industry background not an<br>academic one and you know will and the<br>xeno team are<br>shining example but one of the things<br>we're good at in New Zealand and I say<br>we might talk funny but I've been here<br>more than half my life now is is doing<br>small things particularly well so niche<br>market so we're you know rocket lab is I<br>don't really want to say an exception<br>you know we could have several rocket<br>labs but we're very good at doing small<br>things extremely well so niche markets<br>and I think that's possibly a very good<br>place for us to hit okay I think<br>unfortunately we're going to have to<br>wrap it up there but there was a<br>fantastic to see all those questions<br>coming in and we had a number also on<br>the slider tool as well I didn't go to<br>there just because there was so many<br>coming in from people who have come here<br>today so so thanks so much for all the<br>questions I think we just obviously need<br>to say a special thank you to our<br>panelists who've come along to today and<br>shared their expertise and insights and<br>and also thank you again to our partners<br>the University of Auckland in Auckland<br>uni services for helping make this event<br>possible and what I think has been a<br>great success and if just a final note<br>if you are interested in what the space<br>agency is doing then I encourage you to<br>visit MBS website WWWE MBI eGov TN z4 /<br>Space Agency and check out what we're<br>doing we're very keen to hear from<br>people who have interesting ideas who<br>are interested in making this sector<br>develop and grow here in in New Zealand<br>so do get in touch we ask for and we can<br>respond relatively quickly I think<br>especially compared to some of the the<br>behemoth agencies from overseas and so I<br>think you're right we'll to identify<br>that it's an advantage so and we'd<br>really love to hear from you we think<br>this is a thick that that's got a really<br>exciting future and one that I think has<br>greater relevance to the broader<br>economic development of the country so<br>thanks again everyone for coming along<br>and do please stay in touch with what<br>happens in the sector thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a
