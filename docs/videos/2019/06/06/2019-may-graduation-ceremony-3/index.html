successes<br>like these and to enhance a contribution<br>to future generations of graduates<br>graduates and our nation the university<br>must do three things first we need to<br>attract students of high academic<br>potential<br>and give them an outstanding academic<br>and extracurricular experience and this<br>respect we are doing very well the<br>proportion of students entering the<br>University with a high grade point<br>average is growing each year and we<br>produce outstanding graduates just like<br>you second<br>we need to attract develop and retain<br>outstanding staff this we are doing is<br>illustrated by the achievements I<br>described earlier many of our staff are<br>world leaders in their fields and you<br>will have been privileged to learn from<br>and work with them it is no coincidence<br>that in the curious world rankings of<br>university subjects the University of<br>Auckland came top in New Zealand in 37<br>of the 41 subjects ranked and in the new<br>times higher education impact rankings<br>which measure each universities<br>performance against the United Nations<br>sustainable development goals we were<br>ranked first in the world both overall<br>and for health and well-being and third<br>we need to create the kind of academic<br>environment and facilities that support<br>and encourage excellence to this end the<br>university has been investing heavily in<br>its campus renewal program so as to<br>ensure that we do provide facilities of<br>genuinely international quality many of<br>you will graduate today with the first<br>qualification and you will be rightly<br>proud of that achievement however I also<br>want you to reflect on the ongoing<br>learning opportunities and the wide<br>range of postgraduate options available<br>for you at this University you must<br>never rest on your laurels and a<br>challenging and ever-changing world but<br>rather be prepared to embrace change and<br>new technology and make

her contribution to the<br>success of New Zealand businesses is<br>ongoing please welcome to the stage<br>Bridgette Coates Chancellor<br>vice-chancellor members of council<br>members of the university graduates far<br>now and friends I'm so delighted to be<br>invited to address you today and share<br>this great occasion with you the energy<br>and enthusiasm in this room is just so<br>palpable it's a time to celebrate to<br>take great pride in your achievements<br>and to congratulate yourself after all<br>the years of hard work and dedication<br>it's perhaps also a time to reflect and<br>express gratitude to those who've helped<br>you on your path especially your<br>families and friends and your business<br>school lecturers and advisers as I look<br>out across the audience I can see myself<br>seated there among you a few years ago<br>at that time I was experiencing some<br>conflicting feelings nervous but also<br>very excited about the opportunities<br>that were ahead of me<br>I was graduating with a degree in<br>economics and finance and I started as<br>an equity analyst working for<br>stockbrokers jardín &amp; Co in 1986 just as<br>this stock market started melting around<br>us what a baptism of fire that was<br>nothing like a global financial crisis<br>to bring you up to speed very quickly<br>since those early days I have been<br>fortunate as Scott was kind enough to<br>say to have had a highly diverse and<br>very interesting career I've been very<br>lucky and held executive roles and run<br>companies and various director positions<br>I've been involved in businesses from<br>nutrition to apples to appliances<br>finance and investment central banking<br>and many others but today I thought I<br>would share two experiences which really<br>stand out for me during that time the<br>first is my role as an inaugural<br>guardian of<br>New Zealand superannuation fund when it<br>was launched in 2002 our primary task at<br>the time as Guardians was to decide the<br>asset allocation of the fund which was<br>starting from zero how are we going to<br>invest two billion dollars a year to<br>achieve the long-term returns that the<br>fund was seeking an assistant protecting<br>the retirement income of all New<br>Zealanders we identified a number of<br>global funds with a multi-generational<br>mandate similar to the super funds a<br>couple of these were university large<br>university endowments so we traveled to<br>Harvard Yale and Stanford and we also<br>visited some of the other global<br>sovereign funds to see how these<br>organizations were thinking about their<br>asset allocation with this advice and<br>knowledge we set up the basic parameters<br>for the super fund which have stood the<br>test of time over the intervening years<br>I'm so proud now of the fund and I'm<br>sure we all are and of its contribution<br>to the welfare of all New Zealanders the<br>second experience to share is something<br>that Scott mentioned and it's my role in<br>co-founding the Icehouse when I was<br>working at the University and to that<br>the year 2000 innovation and<br>entrepreneurship were really not well<br>understood at that time and to change<br>this we established the incubator and<br>the education programs which have been<br>instrumental in the success of many of<br>our high-growth businesses since it's<br>amusing to think back to the inventive<br>approach as we had to take in those very<br>early bootstrapping days we found that<br>very large white double-sided<br>refrigerator panels with the cheapest<br>way of setting up the office and so<br>hence the name the ice house was born<br>again I'm very proud of its history and<br>of the important contribution the ice<br>house has made to the entrepreneurial<br>ecosystem in New Zealand so what lessons<br>can I share with you that I've learned<br>from my career to date above everything<br>else I've learnt that changes the<br>constant and that skills and adapting<br>and learning from change or about the<br>most valuable skills that you can<br>develop<br>disruption is everywhere in our world at<br>the moment I spend a lot of time in the<br>US and it's it's amazing how much change<br>is happening up there new business<br>models new consumer preferences new ways<br>of working new environmental challenges<br>that are testing us all and our<br>prevailing global narrative and our<br>current global structures are not<br>adapting particularly well to this<br>change and they're not always helping us<br>move in a sustainable direction for the<br>future you might rightly ask those in<br>power a few fundamental questions here<br>are four of the more important how do we<br>make sure that economic growth is<br>inclusive and provides a fair living for<br>all how can we be more careful and<br>respectful of our environment rather<br>than just generating more and more<br>output how can we all become conscious<br>consumers so that we think before we buy<br>products with with poor nutritional<br>values or wasteful plastic packaging and<br>how can we invest more carefully and<br>make sure that our savings are not being<br>used for weapons manufacturer and mining<br>and are having a negative impact on our<br>environment that's all pretty daunting<br>list so many challenges to address but<br>fortunately when we look at our own<br>small nation the narrative is much more<br>positive I believe we have some very<br>strong advantages relative to our global<br>peers we have an outstanding leader<br>who's showing the way in inclusiveness<br>and empathy we have a highly conscious<br>population who generally care about the<br>environment and care about intelligent<br>public policy and also care about the<br>health and welfare of our of our fellow<br>citizens and most importantly we have a<br>world which really needs our high<br>quality food which is produced with<br>attention to our sustainability<br>principles as well as wanting creative<br>and innovative solutions from our on<br>emerging entrepreneurial companies and<br>above all we have an emerging version of<br>ourselves as a principled nation one<br>would our shared hope and positivity and<br>a strong sense of our future potential<br>I think we in New Zealand are showing<br>that we can lead the world and<br>thoughtful and creative and intelligent<br>responses to global challenges in Barack<br>Obama's world every generation has the<br>opportunity to remake the Barack Obama's<br>words every generation has the<br>opportunity to remake the world despite<br>all these problems we face currently I<br>can see young people everywhere re<br>everywhere around me who care so<br>passionately and who are prepared to<br>raise their voices and work with real<br>determination on finding a better way<br>and I believe we are part of a country<br>which approaches challenges creatively<br>and positively one which was committed<br>to building a positive outcome for all<br>there is no doubt that you can design<br>your future one that is true to your own<br>values and your own experiences and then<br>that way contribute actively and<br>enthusiastically to the future of our<br>country you as our emerging leaders will<br>lead our country and time to come and I<br>have the greatest confidence that you<br>will rise to this challenge thank you<br>all and good luck<br>Thank You Bridget for sharing those<br>insights with us this is a meeting of<br>Council and convocation of the<br>University at which the Pro
