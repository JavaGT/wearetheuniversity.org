universities performance against<br>the United Nations sustainability goals<br>we were ranked first in the world both<br>overall and for health and well-being<br>and third we need to create the kind

a<br>privilege<br>a heartfelt and warm congratulations to<br>you all<br>much of the introduction is about what I<br>have done but it's also important for<br>you graduates to understand who I am<br>so please bear with me for a couple of<br>minutes I am a son of Sam war and the<br>land of my birth my home village of Tsar<br>to him a loofah loofah<br>in 1942 was taken by the colonial powers<br>to build an airport which is now the<br>airport and saw more sirtuin little<br>foofy<br>acts as an enclave within the<br>independent nation of Samoa v of your<br>traditional lands creates a Tsar to Eva<br>belly is streaked some may say I'm a<br>patriot of Altair or New Zealand the<br>land of my achievements my mother was<br>muddled longer a nurse for 35 years a<br>most tremendous and wonderful profession<br>like all mothers she is the front of my<br>kindness my r-ohio my intuition my<br>father factory worker 40 years here's<br>the source of my discipline confidence<br>in my logic I'm a conservative Catholic<br>however it's punctuated with vectors of<br>Baptist ministers within my family three<br>three of them<br>I'm the oldest of five children the<br>first of my generation to attend<br>University heir to that the traits of an<br>Aries you have a mix of responsibility<br>in patience sometimes arrogance and<br>action over theory all these traits have<br>been to the fore and every role I've had<br>throughout my period career so therefore<br>I know who I am before that that is what<br>drives what I do it has been 16 years<br>since I last set where you were to be<br>honest with you I can't remember much of<br>the day not because of the occasion but<br>because I came up from Wellington the<br>day before and I had a catch up with<br>mates the night before this lifts me<br>let's focus on who the speaker was where<br>I was seated wondering whether I paid my<br>overdue library books and wondering<br>whether I actually got a ticket for my<br>girlfriend at the time what I do<br>remember from the Graduate speaker was<br>that he was giving us advice on our<br>futures I won't give you advice I will<br>provide you some information that I've<br>learned since leaving this great<br>institution leave up to you as to<br>whether it's worthwhile as you celebrate<br>your family and friends tonight so here<br>we go the piece the first piece of<br>information is this know where you come<br>from I've recruited many staff over the<br>years especially in manager level the<br>first question I ask them is to tell me<br>about who they are and where they come<br>from many here in Auckland say they're<br>from pare Muir or great learn or or taro<br>or mongery but I asked them to go<br>through the back where does your family<br>name come from tell me about your<br>Scottish or Irish ancestry<br>who was your mother who was your father<br>what is your hub ooh what is your Erie<br>who was your anger who is your family<br>what is it that they have passed on to<br>you that you will seek to pass on to<br>your children<br>who are you<br>as either part of this university with<br>degree in hand and towards my future<br>I've never forgotten would have come<br>from it is the reason why I always<br>introduced myself that I come from<br>Sartori middle fluffy that is my village<br>and that is the font of all who I am<br>you have your own rich family history<br>and legacy therefore I ask you seek to<br>add your own chapter my diverse career<br>has provided me with significant<br>opportunities whether it be representing<br>your country as a diplomat negotiating<br>trade agreements on behalf of our<br>farming community or establishing a<br>crown company I have been truly blessed<br>and I am grateful so do it as a second<br>piece of information be truly grateful I<br>know you are as you sit there some will<br>say that you're grateful for the<br>opportunity to study at this prestigious<br>university others will say thank you for<br>the job I'm about to start after<br>graduation<br>over time though I have become more<br>grateful for the little things I am<br>grateful there I wake up in a warm bed<br>I'm grateful for the options of food<br>that I can provide my children I'm<br>grateful in weather such as this my<br>children leave dressed and warm<br>appropriately for school I'm grateful<br>that at my age I can still go for van<br>I'm grateful for the laughter of others<br>at a park or or cafe I have a blended<br>family of six children between the ages<br>of 11 and 4 four boys and two girls and<br>their household I understand that they<br>will be protected and prepared and all<br>really good at navigating life's<br>important issues for them how much time<br>they have on the Xbox how many stars do<br>they get and their reward chart and how<br>many books can they convince their<br>parents to read at bedtime<br>however they were into a world that is<br>very different from the world that I<br>entered I am truly grateful that I have<br>the opportunity the skill set the<br>experience to use all of that to<br>contribute positively to a world to<br>which they are about to enter I am<br>grateful for the opportunity to add a<br>chapter to my family legacy I have been<br>blessed by many mentors over the years I<br>love learning<br>I love the opportunity to hear stories<br>from others about their own experiences<br>I'm fortunate that I've climbed the<br>ladder of a spur a ladder of aspiration<br>along the way I've had a lot of help in<br>hands who have helped me to the next one<br>I've had doors how it opened for me by<br>Mentors so here's another piece of<br>information for you never forget to<br>leave the door open and the ladder down<br>I do believe in here people inherently<br>want to help others sometimes we<br>underestimate the effect that we can<br>have remember to leave the ladder down<br>for the next person there will be hard<br>times personal tragedies were impact for<br>some of you that experience has occurred<br>junior time at university I've had many<br>failures along my professional personal<br>journey your resilience stocks will be<br>high I've learned from my failures not<br>my not from successes but I have<br>certainly celebrated the successes so<br>here's another piece of information<br>times will get tough review - those<br>results - the resilient stocks that have<br>built up over time and do it often there<br>will be cracks in your professional and<br>personal life however does through the<br>cracks that the light will shine through<br>to their end look after yourself find<br>the comfort the space the bliss where<br>you can do whatever that you may wish to<br>do look after your self first and<br>foremost because that is love<br>here's a piece of information that I<br>learned from my father the factory<br>worker when he lost his job in 1990 he<br>said this to me in Psalm 1 I worked at<br>the factory for 80 years the first time<br>I met my big boss was he was when he<br>gave me this letter to tell me I have no<br>job in his world the boss picks and<br>chooses who they interact with and<br>assign one world you choose to engage<br>with everyone make every interaction<br>count don't it the first time with your<br>worker be the time you let them go son<br>so here it is make every interaction<br>counter I'm not talking here about a<br>customer experience journey that many<br>organizations and come<br>these were undertake I'm talking about<br>the ability to truly listen to<br>comprehend to dedicate yourself to<br>understanding the different viewpoint an<br>interaction where the people are made to<br>feel they are part of something bigger I<br>know you was aspire and achieve great<br>things but I ask this of you achieve<br>great but do good<br>find your TrueNorth learn what it is and<br>never deviate from it it is that Coco<br>Papa that will be your vada during those<br>stormy waters I cannot do justice to<br>this point before if you bear with me I<br>offer you a snippet of one of my<br>favorite speeches in 1966 Robert if<br>Kennedy was invited to speak at Cape<br>Town in a country where partite was at<br>full flight in his own country a civil<br>rights movement was under attack if I<br>fell in love with his words he spoke of<br>the need to provide a voice to those who<br>have no voice to stand up for the little<br>things because it's as in the little<br>things that the big things are one in<br>his own words each time someone stands<br>up for an ideal or acts to improve the<br>lot of others or strikes out against<br>injustice he sends forth a tiny ripple<br>of hope and crossing each other from a<br>million different centers of energy and<br>daring those ripples build a current<br>which can sweep down the mightiest walls<br>of oppression and resistance the Greek<br>playwright and poet Achilles said being<br>a person of good mister tame the<br>savageness of man and make jeans for the<br>life of this world as he go forth<br>graduates into the world and with your<br>degree in one hand an all-conquering<br>mind set in your mind the compassion and<br>the love for
