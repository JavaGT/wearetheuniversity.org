Welcome to my first Vlog! I hope you enjoyed finding out about me and my life.<br><br>I’m Hazel, but my friends call me Haze. I’m 22, and I’m in my last year of my bachelor of Design, exciting stuff. I grew up right here in Hillcrest, Hamilton. I love all things creative, you’ll often find my fringe and I hanging out around boutique art galleries and op shops. I live for a good cup of peppermint tea and I’ll do just about anything for a cheeky jar of gherkins. Apart from being an art weirdo, I play hockey in the Varsity Premier team with a bunch of awesome chicks. My Sunday nights usually consist of hot tea, slow music, incense and my oh so precious poetry journal. I’m an extrovert through and through, I like to think I’m super funny, spicy food really gets me going and I really enjoy socialising with pals. Sunset is the best time of day, I’m a dog person and late night roadies with friends feed my soul.<br><br>Follow me on Instagram @hazel_mayannase<br>Subscribe to my blog https://hazel-burroughs.wixsite.com/hazelsmayannase<br><br>https://blog.waikato.ac.nz/student-vlog/</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>hi guys welcome to my little vlog here<br>I'm hazel mayonnaise I am a third year<br>design tuned at the University of<br>Waikato I am majored in the<br>communication design and media design<br>there are a lot of fun I drop a pebble<br>time here just weekly Hillcrest High<br>School as well which was pretty cool<br>aside from uni I am a hobby fire I play<br>for the varsity premier women's team we<br>actually just won the championship<br>pretty excited about that growing up<br>through high school and even into my uni<br>years I played for the Midlands under-21<br>the Midlands under 18 and the Midlands<br>NHL team as well which is pretty cool<br>I even at one stage the selected to the<br>juniors Black Sticks goalkeeping so I<br>which is a pretty cool achievement I'm<br>an astrology kid I love all things<br>astrology I myself am a Pisces so if<br>you're in the water sign or so we gonna<br>get along Wow<br>I am a huge lover of all things creative<br>and artistic you will often find me down<br>checking out the new exhibitions and I<br>go easier on him I enjoy going seeing as<br>my friend a lot of fun go check him out<br>if you want to see some cool-ass growing<br>up i was actually trying to bash alot of<br>most of my childhood my dad<br>a dojo which is pretty cool medicine let<br>have a bite to see my style comes in<br>very handy sometimes in town I really<br>love this whole thing terrible and go to<br>sleep<br>it's actually kind of funny because we<br>think we have a ghost enough at the<br>moment we're not at the moment we think<br>he's been here the whole time<br>but I can get into that I might make a<br>video about actually it's pretty fun<br>spooky people probably think I'm a<br>weirdo that I believe in that kind of<br>stuff and then they talk about it but I<br>like it and I believe that it's all<br>about a talk about um I have a really<br>weird obsession with gherkins and olives<br>I will sit down and finish a whole<br>entire jar of them and I am allowed to<br>or if I get the opportunity I actually<br>take them a sec little road trips and to<br>the movies I have two phobias the first<br>one I'm scared of almonds medical<br>needles not my free and the feisty<br>needles and things like that come out of<br>people I will fight last nut fan yeah<br>gross<br>the second one is very rational and it's<br>kind of funny cool trick phobia and it's<br>a fear a small little tiny hole so I<br>hate crumpets literally at once put in<br>front of me I will get really sweet home<br>my heart rate will race and I'll go<br>really pale it's not like my binder skin<br>a bit and it's my body and just<br>no don't do it my favorite thing about<br>my degree is the fact that I'm getting<br>the opportunity to combine my creative<br>side and my cure these skills with<br>problem solving and turning them into<br>things that you can use every single day<br>in your life that can make your life<br>better<br>which is pretty cool my goal for when I<br>graduate uni because I'm at they're just<br>you know graduate the end of this year<br>my goal for when I graduate is to become<br>a UX designer which is a user experience<br>of owner<br>so essentially what they do is things<br>like Facebook like mobile apps and<br>things like that they decide how the<br>user actually interacts with it and they<br>design it interfaces it -
