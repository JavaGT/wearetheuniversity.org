This semester we continue our focus on the question: How can we do medium density well? This series is proudly supported by GIBÂ®.<br><br>Gerald Blunt, Experiences in Urban Design<br><br>Gerald Blunt is Principal Advisor Design Strategy at Wellington City Council. He project managed the Medium Density Housing Programme for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and instigated a new design review process at the Hobsonville Point development. In this presentation, Blunt will discuss urban development issues and the potential of medium-density housing. He will also examine the development of high-quality housing and urban environments as New Zealand struggles with solutions to its housing crisis.<br><br>--<br><br>For more information about our

and<br>brightly in the mid 18th century he was<br>also a writer including of numerous<br>letters and anna letter dated 28th of<br>january 1754 he recounted what he called<br>a silly little fairy tale it was a<br>persian fairy tale called the three<br>princes of Serendip Serendip thing the<br>Persian name fish sri lanka the hero of<br>this fable were three princes always<br>making discoveries by accidents and<br>sagacity of things they were not in<br>quest of their father the King had<br>searched out the best possible tutors<br>when the tutors were pleased with the<br>excellent progress that the three<br>princes made and the arts and sciences<br>they reported it to the king he however<br>still doubted their training and<br>summoned each didn't in turn and<br>declares he will retire to a<br>contemplative life leaving them as King<br>each plate politely declines affirming<br>the father's superior wisdom and fitness<br>to rule the King is pleased but fearing<br>his son's education may have been too<br>sheltered and privileged fiends anger at<br>them for refusing the throne and sends<br>them away the story goes that in a<br>faraway land princes came upon a farmer<br>who asked if they had seen his lost<br>camel the princes said is the camel<br>blind in his right eye is it missing a<br>tooth on the left side of its mouth is<br>it lame in one leg and is it carrying<br>honey on one side a butter on the other<br>to stop the astonished farmer at once<br>accused them of stealing the camel not<br>certain why and takes them to the<br>Emperor of the land and demands they be<br>punished the Emperor of the land asks<br>how are they able to give such an<br>accurate description of the camel if<br>they have never seen it it is clear from<br>the princes replies that they have been<br>they have used small clues to infer<br>cleverly the nature of the camel grass<br>had been eaten from the side of the road<br>where it was less green so the princess<br>had inferred that the camel was blind on<br>one side because they were lumps of<br>chewed grass on the road that there were<br>size of the camels too<br>they inferred that they had fallen<br>through the gap left by a missing tooth<br>the track showed the prints of only<br>three feet the fourth being dragged<br>indicating that the animal was lame the<br>butter was carried on one side of the<br>camel honey on the other was evident<br>because the ants had been attracted to<br>melted butter on one side and flies on<br>the other way the honey was I'd suggest<br>that there are a number of take outs<br>from this story working with unexpected<br>observations being able to turn this<br>into some sort of value needing to<br>needing the context to connect the<br>various observations being able to make<br>a collaborative response the story is<br>recognized as the source of walk walk<br>walpole used to coin the word<br>serendipity and the shorter oxford<br>english dictionary has the definition of<br>serendipity as the Faculty of making<br>happy and an unexpected and discoveries<br>by accident I'll come back to this idea<br>of serendipity but just as an aside a<br>bit of serendipity when I was putting<br>this together I googled blind camel and<br>came up with bling camel which is what<br>this is so Bill's already sort of<br>introduced Who I am and why I'm here I<br>suppose just as a as an architect an<br>urban designer I really worked to<br>improve our cities and as the Danish<br>urban designer yarn Gail said cities are<br>for people as part of this discussion we<br>do need to focus more on people and how<br>we can improve our communities the<br>discussion can't be just about the<br>bricks and mortar and so as bill said I<br>spent a year in 2016 seconded to Mb from<br>Wellington City Council in the half time<br>position the purpose of which was to run<br>their medium density housing program a<br>program at that time that that didn't<br>fit in that wasn't a good fit with the<br>ministry's work agenda at that stage I<br>completed a report and a lot of thinking<br>in this presentation comes from that<br>report they weren't very interested in<br>the report when I completed it and we<br>live in interesting times the unit the<br>New York Philip Philip romp they develop<br>at Jonathan rose in his best-selling<br>book from 2016 the well-tempered<br>City talks about the need to be<br>considering our city planning in an<br>uncertain future he uses the management<br>speak acronym VUCA to describe this<br>condition volatility uncertainty<br>complexity and ambiguity and I just like<br>to acknowledge the terrible events that<br>happen in Christchurch last Friday which<br>sort of epitomized this condition in<br>this presentation I want to consider the<br>bigger urban issues consider issues<br>around housing and the New Zealand<br>context look up medium density housing<br>why I think it's a good solution what<br>are the issues around medium density<br>housing and ideas about how we could do<br>better and the urbanism New Zealand<br>conference held last April was open by<br>Phil Twyford with the statement if we<br>grasp the opportunity we have the chance<br>to change the way this country thinks<br>about our built environments our homes<br>the public and private realms and our<br>towns and cities an important<br>consideration of the conference was to<br>help was to keep this dialogue going<br>post the conference and I'll touch on<br>that again at a workshop at the end of<br>the conference 26 academic local<br>government central government and<br>consultant urban designers developed a<br>statement of New Zealand urbanism cities<br>and towns in New Zealand do not match<br>the quality of our famed natural<br>landscapes was in that statement and six<br>issues were identified our cities and<br>towns are becoming increasingly<br>unaffordable causing multi-generational<br>problems for housing health and<br>productivity our cities and towns are<br>becoming increasingly vulnerable to<br>shocks from weather earthquakes impacts<br>of climate change<br>growth pressures economic changes and<br>energy shortages our cities and towns<br>are unhealthy poor planning and urban<br>design is increasing the number of<br>deaths from traffic accidents and<br>obesity related illnesses costs the<br>economy increasing through inefficient<br>public transport systems subsidized<br>infrastructure on greenfield sites and<br>lost productivity owing to longer travel<br>times there is a loss of sense a place<br>and destruction of heritage our planning<br>systems are complex and have become<br>dependent on legalistic language<br>housing is important part of the<br>solution Justin Trudeau had this to say<br>we have to think of housing not as a<br>problem but as a solution it's one of<br>the best tools to help address some<br>significant challenges whether that's<br>poor health crime or unemployment he<br>said to deliver good housing there is<br>what I would suggest five determinants<br>to bring her out about good outcomes<br>which are often the screen the right<br>location in the wider urban context how<br>the housing connects into the local<br>infrastructure the appropriate building<br>typology for a site which in turn<br>directs the shaping of the site and the<br>mass of the building the relationship<br>between building and external spaces<br>both private and public the<br>functionality and quality of the<br>building and the process of delivery for<br>housing and lifecycle costs and those<br>sort of determinants were some of the<br>work that we were doing when we were<br>setting up the ADM in terms of of sort<br>of putting a sort of structure and into<br>the ADM the Auckland design manual<br>housing New Zealand has changed here's<br>some stats which are quite interesting<br>dwelling size 1900 130 square metres<br>average 2010 205 square metres people<br>her dwelling 1905 people per dwelling in<br>2010 2.7 and the New Zealand populations<br>obviously increased a little bit from<br>just short of a million in nineteen<br>hundred to four point three seven<br>hundred and ten years later interesting<br>just those sort of rural urban splits<br>but sort of 50% 57% rural in 1915<br>percent rural in 2010 and the the urban<br>dwellings number have increased from 83<br>thousand two to 1.3 an interesting<br>observation if we were to keep five<br>people put well and Welling we would<br>only be needing 870 4000 dwellings in<br>2010 about 66 percent of the housing is<br>detached and those are just the building<br>consent figures month by month from<br>2015 to the beginning of 2017 and really<br>the point there was that and about 66<br>percent of housing built in New Zealand<br>still is detached housing this has come<br>down from 70 percent in the last five<br>years and interestingly in Australia the<br>comparison was up until 2010 70 percent<br>of the housing was detached and this has<br>dropped to about 57 percent what are the<br>important issues for people when they're<br>considering housing choice affordability<br>is the obvious one and I won't<br>necessarily go through this slide but<br>just some of the factors that actually<br>should be considered and as part of<br>affordability but there are also a range<br>of qualities that people are looking for<br>in their homes it was a really good<br>piece of work done in late 2015 by the<br>Victorian Government that did an<br>in-depth Public Engagement exercise<br>asking people what they saw as a as<br>important this is an apartment so and<br>the key qualities were ranked as such so<br>just wanted to focus on the top four and<br>I'll come back to them so daylight space<br>natural ventilation and noise and this<br>current government has an agenda to<br>deliver thriving accessible quality<br>urban communities but also asking for<br>help as to how this is to happen and<br>they have set up the Ministry of Housing<br>and Urban Development as you know and as<br>well the Treasury is undertaking a<br>project to raise living standards for<br>New Zealanders and to achieve this<br>Treasury proposes that we need to<br>consider the country's human social<br>natural financial and physical capitals<br>and the proposal is to build a wellbeing<br>framework a well-being framework and<br>Treasury notes at the OECD has<br>identified a range of measures and for<br>wellbeing which they're now sort of<br>working their way through and there's<br>some quite interesting information on<br>the Treasury whets website if you're<br>interested and the Secretary to the<br>Treasury had this to say in late 2017<br>the New Zealand treasure has always<br>recognized the diversity of outcomes but<br>like many other government organizations<br>tends to silo its policy advice thus and<br>treasure analysis economic policy advice<br>focuses on increased incomes in a<br>separated from demo departmental<br>expectations and expenditures that have<br>a wider well-being objective so again<br>this was interesting that treasurer<br>who's been again beginning to understand<br>that it's more important than just<br>focusing on the economic drivers but<br>there is further work and I just want to<br>touch a little bit about the and<br>following that theme of well-being and<br>considering it in respect to the<br>regulatory environment so the building<br>act has as its part of its purpose<br>buildings have attributes that<br>contribute appropriately to health<br>physical independence and well-being of<br>the people using the building so just<br>returning to that Victoria government<br>engagement survey the four top qualities<br>are daylight space natural ventilation<br>and noise and the most direct New<br>Zealand regulatory link is the building<br>code where the clauses G for ventilation<br>g5 interior environment g6 airborne and<br>impact sound and g7 natural light now<br>that building code has been enforced<br>since or the building Act and came into<br>force in 1991 and there's been extensive<br>work around all the whole range of<br>clauses that are focused focusing on<br>health and safety rather than the wider<br>well-being for example as you would all<br>well know things like external moisture<br>and clauses around fire and structural<br>issues and MB is sort of currently<br>undertaken consultation to update a<br>number of acceptable solutions and<br>verification methods and but looking at<br>structure b1 b2 durability external<br>moisture g2g force or e to external<br>moisture G for ventilation G 12 water<br>supplies ng 13th hour water so good to<br>see that the ventilation is in there but<br>what they actually look<br>as mechanical ventilation and that<br>impacts on obviously bathrooms and<br>kitchens now turning to the other<br>regulatory contributor to the housing<br>outcomes as the RMA the purpose of the<br>RMA talks about sustainable management<br>it then goes on and talks about other<br>matters that must have regard to<br>including the in maintenance and<br>enhancement of amenity values amenity is<br>also defined in the building code so<br>there's some confusion between what each<br>of those acts are doing in around the<br>idea of amenity I'd suggest that there's<br>a lack of synergy between the RMA and<br>the building act to focus on the outcome<br>of what we're trying to achieve good<br>quality housing of the right typology<br>and in the right location so just going<br>back to those five determinants of the<br>wider urban context and sight in the<br>mass of building building external<br>spaces and you look on the the<br>right-hand side and all of the<br>respective sort of regulations that you<br>have to go through to get your outcome<br>of equality sort of building so and then<br>and from my area of urban design you get<br>a lot of things falling between the gaps<br>between the RMA and and that the the<br>building act there needs to be clarity<br>as to what is the outcome that is trying<br>to be achieved and what aspects need to<br>be regulated what other respective roles<br>as roles of the RMA in the building act<br>to deliver the outcome of quality<br>housing what is the gap between two<br>statutes how does amenity values as<br>defined in the RMA interconnect with the<br>amenity as defined in the Building Code<br>are there tensions I don't have the<br>answers I'm just giving you the<br>questions so let's just turn to medium<br>density housing so and given all the<br>conversations around medium density<br>housing and but is the solution for<br>housing in New Zealand that best fits<br>our landscape and infrastructure<br>capacities I would suggest the right<br>location and good design of medium<br>density housing needs to be undertaken<br>to provide for a quality of living that<br>allows future inhabitants to call these<br>places home homes that their residents<br>so what is medium density housing this<br>is a little diagram that came out of<br>America and often people talk about and<br>the missing middle again probably would<br>be sort of very aware of it so we've got<br>sort of the high density mid rise so my<br>very loose definition of medium density<br>because it's it's between high density<br>and low density I'm taking a broad<br>approach to the definition of medium<br>density housing and some measures 35 to<br>70 dwellings per hectare or six storeys<br>or below this is part of Auckland as you<br>can see Ponsonby that's medium density<br>housing so those are smaller houses on<br>Lots<br>up to 285 square meters brands as a<br>whole and I won't go through all of<br>these so sorry another example of medium<br>density housing so the Stevens Lawson<br>squadron terraces out in Hobsonville so<br>brands has given a whole sort of lust<br>I've tried to sort of categorize for<br>what medium density housing seems to<br>make it firm to complicated so why is<br>medium density housing a good solution<br>in New Zealand medium density housing is<br>a good solution for housing<br>affordability in the New Zealand context<br>and because it makes for more efficient<br>use of land and infrastructure it is a<br>more sustainable urban form to cope with<br>ongoing growth I mean there's a good fit<br>with the New Zealand landscape a<br>critical construct of the New Zealand<br>psyche it makes our cities more livable<br>injecting vitality diversity and greater<br>social connectedness into our<br>communities type as a typology provides<br>a good solution for the affordability<br>issue it can better phyllis facilitate<br>strong community cohesion there is an<br>opportunity for good connection between<br>indoor and outdoor living so that's a<br>lot of the<br>urban design assessment that we do both<br>when I was here at Auckland and<br>Wellington City is because our the<br>unitary plant in our district Wellington<br>city's district plan and talked a lot<br>about that sort of connection between<br>indoor and outdoor and so whether that's<br>private so the district plans are more<br>appropriate for private less useful<br>around directing things like communal or<br>public spaces provides for a diversity<br>of housing products and benefits with<br>our busy lives medium density housing<br>will make our cities more livable<br>injecting vitality diversity and greater<br>social connectedness it is a more<br>sustainable urban form to cope with<br>ongoing growth so but there are issues<br>around medium density housing and it's<br>not well delivered as complex typology<br>is the characteristics of a large<br>proportion of medium density housing<br>shared walls floors between multiple<br>dwellings mean design build ability<br>privacy maintenance regimes and<br>different legal tenures and more complex<br>added to this as a range of people<br>living in close proximity within one<br>building envelope as well there they<br>sort of interesting complex<br>interrelationships of stakeholders and<br>and their various sort of roles in terms<br>of of what happens to deliver housing<br>and that often for an unknown inhabitant<br>and who wants a home a comfortable<br>private right location for a realistic<br>price so so and a lot of the a lot of<br>the stakeholders that part that the the<br>development and the design and the<br>building pass-through are there to make<br>some sort of return on their money some<br>and this was just a piece of work that<br>we did at @mb where we were just trying<br>to map what we called the ecosystem so<br>all of the different and sort of players<br>and people that were involved in sort of<br>delivering medium density housing and<br>sort of the the main groups that then<br>all the the subgroup so you know that<br>the banks in this case you can't read<br>this banks they're the offshore<br>investors the insurance companies so<br>there's a whole lot of people that are<br>sort of involved in that and other<br>issues poor understanding of what is<br>good medium density housing both from<br>the end-user and industry perspective so<br>there's a low demand for medium density<br>housing that the current preference<br>still of the New Zealand market is<br>detached housing delivery of detached<br>housing is easier and then the<br>developers and the builders want to stay<br>with that model because they know that's<br>a they know the product they can stick<br>to what they know and the volume home<br>builders as I said that's what the<br>market is sort of interested in is an<br>unclear understanding of the different<br>demographic requirements that people<br>want from their houses now existing<br>communities not wanting change so the<br>whole not in my backyard issue and the<br>barriers for lending and insurance<br>industry as becoming and particularly<br>you might have seen the news in<br>Wellington that a couple of the big<br>insurance companies are pulling out of<br>insuring and Wellington and that's sort<br>of likely to become more and more of an<br>issue lack of high quality technical<br>solutions the right designer for the<br>right task lack of integrated solutions<br>for urban intensification so the<br>difficulty of accessing land supply on<br>the right location sort of market<br>deliveries meant the market delivers for<br>the short term rather than the long term<br>so that's sort of understanding that the<br>whole of life of costs conflicting<br>council agendas and lack of clarity<br>around that regulation which i've<br>already<br>them sort of talked about so just a few<br>little issues so how can we do better in<br>delivery of medium density housing and<br>it's all about design in my view and<br>returning to that statement of urbanism<br>that was written up post the urbanism<br>conference all built places and I quote<br>all built places and spaces have come<br>about through some form of design<br>process however current development<br>practices and poor design are negatively<br>affecting the natural environment the<br>economy and public health tens of<br>billions of dollars are going to be<br>spent on housing infrastructure public<br>amenities and coming decades as a<br>country we need to ensure this money is<br>spent in an intelligent manner to<br>deliver the best possible outcomes good<br>design adds value and is the key to<br>creating healthy and vibrant places<br>value has maximized through processes of<br>collective and careful decision making<br>involving the right professionals<br>communities at the right time city<br>making professionals such as architects<br>landscape architects planners urban<br>designers and other associated<br>disciplines can make vital contribution<br>to realizing the enormous potential of<br>new zealand towns and cities fill<br>Twyford and has addressed to the<br>conference said there was a need to unli<br>unleash the power of great design and I<br>quote it is time so this is from Phil<br>Twyford it is a time for a qualitative<br>shift in how we design our cities good<br>design is not some nice to have there's<br>not some pretty veneer good designers<br>stuff that works and because form<br>follows function stuff that works is<br>much better which is much more likely to<br>please the sensors we need he must have<br>a good speechwriter we need good design<br>to help build houses that are affordable<br>warm and dry without compromising<br>livability and giving people great<br>spaces to live in we can draw<br>inspiration from the successful efforts<br>of the first Labour government to lift<br>the standard of the housing stock<br>through its mass housing building<br>program and in the decades that followed<br>a tradition of modernist New Zealand<br>architecture now is the time to apply<br>that tradition to housing for all of us<br>just high-end bespoke architecture so as<br>a quote from Phil Triffids speech and<br>the role of design is often overlooked I<br>would suggest the advantage of a good<br>design process and what it can bring to<br>a project is often marginalized and sort<br>of gloom and doom I just sort of run<br>through some what I think of a range of<br>sort of interesting different topologies<br>different types of of good design and<br>medium density housing so quite an old<br>project in Wellington out at sea tune<br>this courtyard housing which i think is<br>sort of a really interesting model and<br>all of you probably would be aware of<br>the vinegar Lane development behind<br>poncy be behind the countdown<br>supermarket and that the West State<br>precedent from that for for Amsterdam so<br>that's the site Ponsonby Road at the top<br>the supermarket the big square vinegar<br>Lane and again probably most of you<br>aware of it different architects<br>involved in designing different<br>buildings in that vinegar Lane and sort<br>of so again we're sort of a different<br>model you know is that worth further<br>exploration and then I think this is<br>sort of quite interesting so again this<br>is probably more but the I think what's<br>sort of interesting is that you can add<br>and change your building sort of over<br>over time so again quite an interesting<br>solution so you can see on the top left<br>the original housing how its originally<br>built by the volume builders and then<br>how individuals have sort of filled in<br>that the second part of the house but<br>just remembering Roger Walker's quote<br>when it comes to who's going to design<br>it make sure you consider the<br>alternative<br>and all your options so I want to go on<br>and I called the this presentation<br>interconnectedness and as part of the<br>design process we do need to get better<br>improving our interconnectedness to get<br>good outcomes the housing issue is part<br>of a wider set of systemic issues it is<br>a complex system the discussion should<br>be at a wider level when what makes for<br>good cities and towns what makes for<br>good cities and towns in the New Zealand<br>context a small island country in the<br>South Pacific the simple solution is to<br>deal with a complex system is to<br>compartmentalize compartmentalize the<br>issues but you miss the opportunity to<br>leverage off from the interconnectedness<br>the opportunity cost cities are complex<br>organisms they are messy<br>the management needs careful thinking<br>it's one of sort of jumped to urban some<br>some urban design thinking I've sort of<br>done over the years and I suppose that<br>from an urban design perspective and<br>we're always trying to consider there's<br>some often competing tensions and we're<br>always trying to consider how we do a<br>balanced response say so between these<br>sort of respective and sort of ideas and<br>there is something that needs to say<br>what standards we need to set and the<br>performance criteria or heritage in<br>contemporary but and between the<br>buildings between and those sort of<br>different sort of determinants and I<br>think for me the the quality of urban<br>design thinking is how you map your way<br>through this for a particular project or<br>all sort of programme of work I want to<br>just talk a little bit about and there<br>that so just give a little example<br>around an order an incident so I'm sure<br>many of you will be aware of Jane Jacobs<br>book the Deaf life great American<br>studies published in 1961 where she was<br>an observer of the community in her<br>home city of New York and in her battles<br>she took on this man Robert Moses who<br>was the city engineer for New York City<br>and he brave new world the the bottom<br>left were some of his sort of proposals<br>around sort of big modernist housing<br>mainly sort of social housing in in New<br>York and as part of that was the<br>embracing cars that the building of the<br>big freeways across sort of Manhattan<br>and Jane Jacobs took him on and and one<br>if you like and I suppose just that sort<br>of an example if you like of of the<br>incident of daily life versus the the<br>order of what am sort of Moses was sort<br>of proclaiming and I'm not for the<br>purposes of this trying to argue one or<br>the other but it's actually how you<br>provide some sort of balanced response<br>between those two two ideas and I think<br>this piece of work that came out of the<br>UK in 1999 towards an urban Renaissance<br>which was a building on a white paper in<br>terms of a brave new future about sort<br>of that integrated or interconnected<br>thinking about the theme in this case<br>the importance of settlements and<br>looking at all the range of different<br>types of uses and necessarily be able to<br>read greens you know so the idea that<br>you're creating this community for all<br>people in your in your community<br>Hobsonville point and again you probably<br>all very aware of that but in in the New<br>Zealand context I think a very good<br>and the idea of sort of farmers markets<br>say again that sort of I suppose sort of<br>interconnected sort of thinking and we<br>did an piece of work when I was at<br>Auckland Council we were asked by<br>Auckland Transport to do some work on<br>the Amity project<br>and a huge sort of missed opportunity we<br>did some quite detailed work so when you<br>cut these wide and the the corridor for<br>public transport and cycling and you<br>ended up with this sort of leftover land<br>and we did quite a detailed study in<br>terms of how you could actually bring<br>these sites back into and provide<br>housing but a team wasn't interested so<br>you know that was their sort of proposal<br>we'll just put a little bit of fluffy<br>landscape along there and that you know<br>under sort of under utilization of that<br>land so a missed opportunity and some<br>good work that's come out of New South<br>Wales they from a couple of years ago<br>medium density design guy and again sort<br>of sort of themed to what I was sort of<br>talking about in terms of those sort of<br>determinants and some quite sort of<br>detail and those sort of design guides<br>in terms about dwelling sizes the<br>private open space how you deal with car<br>and bicycle parking how you might sort<br>of master plan communities and sort of<br>scenarios about how you might sort of do<br>those developments on the on the block<br>so I want to go back to those<br>determinants that I talked about before<br>the wider urban environment and just<br>reasonably quickly just go through<br>looking at each of those and those sort<br>of levels and this is a point about thee<br>and the interconnectedness that I don't<br>that I was sort of talking about so you<br>know the wider urban context the land<br>you know how does the development fit<br>into that landscape sort of<br>understanding waterways ecosystems and<br>obviously it has to fit in and work with<br>the and the movement systems the<br>infrastructure and and how do you<br>leverage off that or yeah and some<br>making sure that that your development<br>is within range of some of the sort of<br>infrastructure and thinking about<br>community facilities and activities so<br>in<br>it's that social content about what<br>makes these places so it's not just<br>about the the bricks and mortars<br>thinking about the overall sort of<br>spatial structure and how development<br>responds and Hart enhances the<br>surrounding urban grain but also the the<br>the grain of of of that particular piece<br>of land again in this case I'm sort of<br>Hobsonville identity or sense of place<br>and which is something that I think is<br>sort of really really important so you<br>know how and see it's not necessarily<br>saying that we have to wrap everything<br>from the past in aspect but it's<br>actually how how we're creating a new<br>identity or new sense of place when<br>we're doing these doing these changes<br>how you design the site so the use frame<br>of christchurch so that how it<br>reinforces the form landscape you know<br>issues around microclimate placing the<br>building on the site all good stuff that<br>as architects are sort of well-known<br>around the now looking at the site and<br>and massing in terms of the sort of<br>built built form so how does the built<br>form how does that relate to either the<br>neighborhood the landscape or other sort<br>of spaces around again from an urban<br>design perspective that really important<br>component of how you relate the building<br>and that that street to the front door<br>absolutely critical outdoor spaces so<br>this is the Beaumont development and<br>some really creative uses of different<br>grades of sort of spaces so the private<br>open spaces and the more sort of<br>communal open spaces and that big issue<br>that we all have to sort of deal with<br>accommodating the car so if you're sort<br>of planning these sites how do you<br>actually because as you can see in this<br>sort of diagram<br>the amount of space that you need for<br>that that sort of vehicles location and<br>that's sort of interesting in itself so<br>we're about to review our district plan<br>and Wellington and currently we require<br>car parks on site I think there'll be a<br>strong move that we will actually take<br>that away so we won't have to provide so<br>you won't have to provide car parking on<br>site which causes other issues of course<br>coherent design again not telling you<br>you guys sort of anything in terms of<br>the the importance about that but the<br>raishin the buildings the open spaces so<br>how you might do additions and all of<br>those sort of things and the building<br>itself sort of the interior the interior<br>space is that the environment the light<br>the outlook all of those sort of things<br>that that you are that it's a safe place<br>to be that you feel comfortable in there<br>issues around sort of process the idea<br>of sustainable design and something that<br>we're doing a lot more work on and I<br>think and in Auckland Council has been<br>doing a lot of work in terms of<br>integrating things like the tearing of<br>design principles I think you know from<br>a from a Mari perspective some really<br>clever understanding and thinking about<br>how we relate to the land and the<br>importance of land and and communities<br>and what-have-you so interesting and<br>again I'm doing a little bit of thinking<br>around this in terms of how we take some<br>of these concepts and ideas and might be<br>able to drop them into our district plan<br>review and of course we're doing it for<br>the people provide comfortable<br>unattractive homes for future<br>inhabitants so it's just a bit of a<br>snapshot sort of showing all those sort<br>of different sort of aspects that that<br>sort of interconnectedness and that I<br>believe sort of needs to be and thought<br>about sort of finally I want to go back<br>to the concept of serendipity and and<br>the definition of serendipity is the<br>Faculty of making happy and unexpected<br>discoveries by accident most of you will<br>probably know that an Olli plan from<br>Rome mid 18th century does Rome have<br>qualities of good city would you expect<br>to make happy and unexpected discoveries<br>by accident the definition of<br>serendipity let's explore that a bit<br>more and most of you will know the<br>following potted history of 20th century<br>development so sort of bare with me<br>amazing or book that I've lost my copy<br>so if anyone's got a copy that wants to<br>give it to me<br>structure of the ordinary by Habra<br>conned for thousands of years built<br>environments of great richness and<br>complexity arose and formally and<br>endured knowledge about how to make<br>ordinary environment was ubiquity Bic WA<br>tests innately manifest and the everyday<br>interactions are builders patrons and<br>users built environments aroused from<br>implicit structures based on common<br>understanding built environments arose<br>from implicit structures based on common<br>understanding the vernacular you build<br>for local conditions to resolve issues<br>of that place where you want to live<br>this is no longer the case especially<br>when communities and places get out of<br>balance and I suppose just this is a bit<br>of history and going back to the<br>Industrial Revolution the perceived<br>solution was some form of top-down<br>directive the idea of social engineering<br>and maybe and we're still working with<br>this as a sort of a Victorian paternal<br>mindset maybe one could ask are we are<br>these principles laudable so Hume in in<br>central Manchester an interesting photo<br>life in the mid fifties in in Hume and<br>all of those terrace houses where there<br>were sort of communities and we're all<br>demolished and Hume was sort of<br>redeveloped and I suppose that was sort<br>of and the the the theory or the<br>principle about the redevelopment of<br>course and Luca Busia and that sort of<br>modernist approach in terms of how you<br>do development so this was Hume when it<br>was finished in 1972 and the<br>characteristic of these huge and sort of<br>Crescent so you can<br>where all of those terrace houses have<br>have been demolished and it sort of<br>doesn't stop there so interesting three<br>different plans of how human was before<br>1965 before demolition started hundred<br>and fifty dwellings per hectare the<br>Crescent they only lasted less than<br>twenty years seven dwellings per hectare<br>the new model of the redevelopment of<br>Hume seventy five to eighty eighty seven<br>so and can not even getting back to<br>those sort of Victorian dwelling type<br>densities and as well as this of course<br>the other so sort of the modernist the<br>the Luca bustier high-rise sort of<br>approach and and I suppose the other<br>theory around the Garden City movement<br>ever newsy urban Iza Howard and both<br>both ideas I mean I daresay it's but<br>like political systems in their purest<br>sense and they all have sort of great<br>virtues that's when they get sort of<br>corrupted that they they sort of fall<br>apart so you know the idea of the Garden<br>City you know this is what this is how<br>you live your suburban life you know mum<br>and dad and and the kids and you know<br>sort of this is what it looks like so<br>you know you know so these are these<br>sort of systems you know have have got<br>got sort of corrupted and but they've<br>all sort of come down from this big sort<br>of top-down you know sort of we know<br>best in terms of how we sort of grow our<br>cities and and and and communities sort<br>of an odd image but really the reason I<br>just put this in the vestiges of these<br>ideas are still incorporated into our<br>regulatory systems top-down directives<br>that are disconnected with our places<br>pictorially here are the range of<br>statutes in New Zealand and the areas<br>that they they directly involved so<br>things like the Local Government Act<br>Land Transport Mont Management Act<br>Building Act RMA you're looking at an<br>image of a place and you're getting all<br>of this sort of big top-down<br>and lack of interconnection so why might<br>another great urbanist Sparrow cost off<br>an architectural historian based and was<br>based in University of California and he<br>wrote two books the city shaped in the<br>city assembled he had this quote the<br>cities are live changing things not hard<br>artifacts in need of prettification and<br>calculated revision cities are never<br>still they resist efforts to make neat<br>sense of them we need to respect their<br>rhythms and to recognize that the life<br>of city form might must lie loosely<br>somewhere between total control and<br>total freedom of action between<br>conservation and process process must<br>have the final word and the end urban<br>truth is in the flow this idea of<br>fluidity and changes in the city would<br>suggest the need for an exploration of<br>new ideas innovation creativity mark<br>Durand<br>leading ethnographer Cambridge<br>University wrote a piece in the Harvard<br>Business Review make serendipity work<br>for you where he suggests to reinforce<br>the innovation process there are six<br>serendipity is a close relative of a<br>creativity serendipity benefits not just<br>from scarcity forcing people to be<br>creative but from a degree of sloppiness<br>tenacity and dissent attempts to dictate<br>serendipity stifling and impractical<br>history matters innovation is as much<br>about looking at the past as it is about<br>anticipating the future it can mean<br>pairing today's observations with those<br>made previously and often quite<br>different contexts socializing matters<br>was very unlikely that James Watson and<br>Francis Crick would have been as<br>efficient and elucidating the structure<br>of DNA without the benefit of those that<br>shared their offices and interests with<br>them so they were discussing and and<br>sort of came up and and sort of evolved<br>how DNA sort of works and diversity<br>matters and as John Stuart Mill foresaw<br>is hardly possible to overrate the value<br>of placing human beings in contact with<br>persons<br>of dissimilar to themselves and with the<br>modes of thoughts and actions unlike<br>those with which they are familiar such<br>communication has always been and is and<br>is peculiar in the present age one of<br>the primary sources of progress and<br>finally tinkering does matter Doron goes<br>on to suggest if serendipity is the<br>capability then how is it developed<br>protected and sustained why are some<br>organizations luckier than others and<br>how do they acquire the skill given that<br>serendipity relies on loafing and svet<br>and savoring the moment of wandering and<br>loitering and directionless activity of<br>all sorts is there an optimal degree of<br>wastefulness to be tolerated even in<br>economically tight times like these the<br>idea of serendipity has been further<br>picked up as a management tool by Nancy<br>Napier in an article serendipity is a<br>strategic advantage when they suggested<br>characteristics of serendipity that<br>include unsought unexpected<br>unintentional unanticipated event or<br>information out of the ordinary<br>surprising inconsistent with existing<br>thought findings or theory an alertness<br>of capability to notice what others do<br>not to recognize to consider and to<br>connect previously disparate or discrete<br>pieces of information to solve a problem<br>so where does this all take us in<br>Wellington a medium density housing<br>development that has become known as<br>Davos corner 560 square meter site on<br>the corner of Brahm and Pyrrha Street<br>and mount Victoria one Street it's level<br>and the other street slopes away mount<br>Victoria has a strong character overlay<br>and the district plan pre 1930s<br>character is considered important as a<br>starting point you have to get a<br>resource consent to demolish a pre 1930<br>structure and justify why that building<br>can't be kept an onerous requirement the<br>site had an existing villa the owners<br>siblings who had been brought up in that<br>house they were in the project for the<br>long haul a memory of the family they<br>want to demolish and build six<br>townhouses the original proposal was<br>three story standalone townhouses<br>side-by-side ground-floor garage<br>two levels above this proposal<br>effectively met the statutory urban<br>design guide requirements in the<br>district plan facing the street all of<br>that sort of stuff<br>providing the open spaces of the back<br>but obviously a lot of garage doors<br>facing the streets issues with traffic<br>adjacent to the intersection was an<br>issue the applicant client went through<br>a very long and protracted resource<br>consent process I think it would be safe<br>to say that the architect Gerald Parsons<br>would describe it as sheer hell however<br>through the design process the unsought<br>unexpected unintentional unanticipated<br>resource consent process and out of the<br>previously disparate and discrete design<br>process used to solve the problem of how<br>you put housing an opportunity was found<br>and has come about a well-considered<br>design response that the architect has<br>described as a Rubik cube of apartments<br>fitted around the staircase the original<br>proposal was for six townhouses there's<br>now eight Apartments on the site and you<br>can't read the plans very well but to<br>say different sort of arrangement of our<br>floors over in a top and around and so<br>quite a sort of a complex interaction<br>and then open spaces and parking on site<br>was a big issue but rather than outcome<br>being consigned to the individual units<br>the parking became a single proposition<br>for the development the laundries and<br>bathrooms and some extent the kitchens<br>are modular the cladding is<br>predominantly corrugated steel the<br>outcome I believe is a very positive<br>medium density housing exemplar so in<br>conclusion is so easy to get lost in the<br>detail we need to have a more holistic<br>focus on the issues we need to change<br>the notion of house to home house a<br>building for human habitation this<br>dictionary oxford again defines it home<br>the place where one lives especially as<br>a member of a family or household and so<br>an emphasis about the people people have<br>a right to good quality of comfortable<br>homes of the right type in the right<br>location there is not a simple solution<br>it's complex we need to be creative we<br>need to think outside the box<br>Phil Twyford has agreed to host a series<br>of workshops over coming months to<br>explore better design influenced<br>thinking and strategy to deliver quality<br>built out environments and sustainable<br>communities to unleash the power of<br>design there is a need to provide a<br>coordinated voice lovely little book<br>drawn up by Stewart Houghton from a<br>landscape architect and designer from<br>Bothell miss Cole and a hundred days a<br>hundred ideas for a better Auckland this<br>one number 99 what if there was a New<br>Zealand egg approach to urban issues in<br>this country so it wasn't just about<br>Auckland it wasn't just about Wellington<br>but how do we actually think about and<br>the country as a whole<br>radical power of design competitions<br>again something that we don't do a lot<br>and unfortunately this didn't get built<br>for a whole lot of reasons but this is<br>the brief design competition in in<br>Christchurch as part of the the East<br>frame so that was the winning entry and<br>that was Roger Walker's design for the<br>same I do have a challenge to designers<br>as well as the duty of care to their<br>clients and that goes without saying of<br>course there must be a duty of care to<br>the wider community<br>designers are shaping the future of our<br>cities our future communities there is a<br>need to challenge clients but introduce<br>introducing greater awareness of the<br>context designers should also be getting<br>involved with their communities and<br>local councils to set direction I've<br>worked at councils for both Wellington<br>and Auckland for close on 20 years and<br>and we never see designers and<br>architects coming to Council with good<br>ideas we only see them when they're<br>coming for a resource consents and they<br>are trying to beat us up as officers to<br>say and you know my design is wonderful<br>and when I'm often in a resource consent<br>application and looking at a design I<br>know the architect it's like they're a<br>good architect there's crap on the table<br>and I started speaking out and what I<br>was finding is the architects were<br>thanking me because they had said the<br>same message to the client<br>but the client had said just get on and<br>you know design that so some interesting<br>sort of gameplays I suppose but I<br>suppose my point is that designers<br>should get involved with their<br>communities and local councils to set<br>the direction the council is there to<br>set policy policy for the community it's<br>not our policy we are setting policy for<br>the Auckland community or the Wellington<br>community and to shape the urban<br>environment and that the classic is<br>development of a district plan which<br>Wellington is about to start<br>start with Wellington City Council has a<br>set of values and I think one sums it<br>all up<br>he tongue at her he tongue at her here<br>tongue attack we put people at the heart<br>of what we do here end of us less and<br>camels and house and can be well<br>integrated thank you<br>a talk today on a brief history of<br>housing in New Zealand for second year<br>students and I was struck as well<br>because we've all got something at the<br>back of our minds at the moment the time<br>lag between people moving to New Zealand<br>and the point of which we kind of<br>accommodate that we realize their<br>accommodation needs might be different<br>from a lot of the more your eccentric<br>stuff that we see and having spent a lot<br>of time and for instance specific people<br>coming to Auckland 50% of Aucklanders<br>come from somewhere else whether it's<br>from New Zealand or from abroad Pacific<br>people coming here in the big wave in<br>the 70s but it wasn't helping New<br>Zealand I was like produced kind of<br>guidelines on housing for them and 30<br>years later in the game<br>we have a lot of people coming from<br>different nations now you may want to<br>live together closer in communities<br>because they share some of foods<br>practices community facilities that sort<br>of thing how easy is that to accommodate<br>diversity and medium density as opposed<br>to the suburbs where you can kind of do<br>something with a blue cap out the back<br>another thing yeah and it's that sort of<br>the building typology I mean I I do know<br>that housing New Zealand over the years<br>have explored sort of different<br>opportunities and sort of models in<br>terms of how communities sort of come<br>together and I'm having brain fade but<br>the area adjacent to Glen Innes about 20<br>years ago sort of building larger houses<br>for and sort of you know well<br>families that have sort of many many<br>sort of people and there was some other<br>work that housing New Zealand have done<br>in terms of looking at sort of providing<br>those sort of community sort of space<br>and so that you know you can gather<br>outside I mean I think that sort of it<br>is you know there's always that tension<br>isn't there between the built<br>environment and what we do as architects<br>which of course you know we're not<br>social scientists we're not sociologists<br>and you know how you'd do the bricks and<br>mortar that are robust enough or<br>adaptable and I suppose maybe sort of is<br>there something in that Chilean example<br>in terms of you know how you might be<br>able to adapt and grow so it's not about<br>having everything sort of absolutely you<br>know sort of rigid and things can sort<br>of change and grow and I think that the<br>topologies also there are potentials<br>with naked housing we you basically<br>create the whole show and then people<br>can fit it out themselves and then do it<br>yourself you know with flat packs and<br>that sort of thing rather than probably<br>there are questions<br>questions<br>well Auckland Council definitely and it<br>goes back to Auckland City Council where<br>they've had a strong sort of process<br>around sort of urban design panels I<br>think you know the the and it does focus<br>on well it should focus on just urban<br>design and I think what you might be<br>raising or some other issues that<br>potentially sort of could be considered<br>I've worked with a lot of colleagues<br>from Britain and they they express a<br>frustration from our planning system<br>which the RMA as effects pay so my my<br>belief I don't think the issue is the<br>RMA I think it's actually how we you<br>know practice whether in terms of how we<br>set it up but say but the principle is<br>around the effects of something on the<br>you know the environment or sort of<br>other sort of social and sort of<br>conditions say there's a lot more sort<br>of discretion I understand in the UK<br>sort of systems and I suppose what we<br>try and through our district plans as<br>try and and give some certainty but if<br>you look at the Auckland Council<br>struggled in terms of the delivery of<br>the unitary plan in terms of you know<br>the certainty it's still a very sort of<br>complex sort of interaction of<br>objectives and policies and rules and<br>standards and assessment criteria and<br>whatever else do you want to pull out of<br>that your question that I think the so<br>again the resource so if Fe and you'd be<br>aware that a if if if there's issues<br>with a particular consent then that gets<br>notified and then that sort of starts<br>the discussion that you can have with<br>the neighbors or what have you you know<br>it's not I but but I think there's also<br>you know people have rights to do should<br>have rights to do stuff on their own bit<br>of land and the tensioners you know how<br>far do you take that this is you know<br>how does that fit into the to the wider<br>community I mean I think<br>sort of from a sort of again a sort of a<br>general observation I think it's a sus<br>Society we've got selfish so it's more<br>about me myself and I and probably maybe<br>the pendulum is too far over protecting<br>the private property rights and how this<br>sort of whatever it is fits in to the<br>wider community<br>somebody just dance that last one first<br>our had interesting conversation with a<br>someone who's involved in commercial<br>property and in the Wellington case the<br>issues around insurance and this notion<br>of self insurance and I gather according<br>to this person himself insurance was<br>quite common in places lost like Los<br>Angeles and Tokyo other sized mentally<br>challenged cities like like Wellington<br>and but the observation out of those<br>places is that the the quality of<br>building is a lot higher because if<br>you're going to self-insure you want to<br>know that you've got a you know a<br>reasonably you know strong building or<br>structure or whatever so sort of<br>interesting but again there's sort of<br>the complexities of showing what's<br>influencing our sort of decision-making<br>because I think going back to the you<br>know four to six story three to six<br>story type apartment buildings and I<br>mean probably the only developer that's<br>akhom Mark Todd that sort of really sort<br>of pushing that as a as a model which is<br>interesting but again this sort of<br>issues around getting finance mortgages<br>and what-have-you in terms of apartments<br>so again the sort of another level of<br>complexity I mean it's sort of<br>interesting and I when I go to Australia<br>and you look at the likes of Sydney and<br>Melbourne<br>you know you've go back into the 60s and<br>50s they seem to have a history of<br>building those some small apartment<br>buildings and something that's never<br>really happened in New Zealand whether<br>with a few exceptions so you know you<br>you right I mean and maybe it's housing<br>New Zealand it needs to take you know<br>sort of a lead and but the we're just<br>trying to do a look at a little<br>development and Wellington sort of four<br>storeys and you know what's potentially<br>killing it as the build costs you know<br>in terms of the structure if you you<br>know in go to townhouses give or take<br>you know you're not far away from<br>you know nzs 3604 in terms of you know<br>how you you know do that say yes I think<br>one thing that needs to be done is a you<br>know a standard for you know sort of<br>bigger bigger buildings possibly yeah<br>yeah awesome yeah there is there's a<br>real you know people are used to<br>building two-storied terrace houses two<br>three stories and there's a real<br>building code stick change yes mother's<br>ability that's left's this crane you<br>know it just sort of just becomes a lot<br>more complicated and a lot of mediate<br>well some some medium density housing is<br>still being built by sort of mom-and-pop<br>type developer rather than you know more<br>yeah you know that guy can be killers<br>I<br>and I think another date well I think<br>that was sort of in you know I got a<br>friend who lives and stuck out and you<br>know they've just they rent and you know<br>they have lifetime occupancy you know so<br>you know and they've got no desire and<br>in a lot of sort of European models you<br>know you don't buy you know your your<br>your dwelling so I think you you know<br>and those original so the the the<br>ownership models I think need to be you<br>know sort of considered because then you<br>know if you're investing in that<br>building for the long-term then maybe<br>you can build the better quality<br>building that last 150 years or whatever<br>or whatever and but you don't<br>necessarily have to buy and if we had<br>different legislation about our sort of<br>rental and sort of conditions you know<br>so I think we I think we're not very we<br>haven't be very sophisticated in terms<br>of of our and again I suppose I come<br>back to that interconnectedness we're<br>not thinking through all of the<br>unforeseen consequence and most people<br>still want to live in their house on<br>their single house on their piece of<br>land to last questions all right it's<br>the observation of communities and and<br>just an experience out of gives from the<br>particular Valley where there was a<br>whole community of people with houses<br>and schools and originally shop and<br>stuff like that it's all gone<br>and people drive an hour you know to go<br>to their work every day on a farm so you<br>know they're you know so that they're<br>living urbanely in Gisborne and driving<br>up to so their work and it's just work<br>up on a on a farm whereas you know<br>and I think we get the gross now because<br>I think and you know you've got the a<br>lot of issues here and all got all kind<br>and it's about that it's about the size<br>and the density of development and you<br>know getting a lot of stories about<br>people sort of moving to Hawke's Bay or<br>Taranaki or where others for you know<br>you can get a more for your dollar some<br>of these other places and those values<br>so you know sort of coming up and quite<br>quickly so I think particularly around<br>IT that people do make that make that<br>that change I mean I won't go on about<br>my some view of size of cities of<br>Wellington and an Auckland but I think<br>there's something about well income<br>being a smaller place that you know<br>everything is a lot more sort of<br>accessible II and it's got some other<br>reasons why it's successful you know<br>it's got fog rafi that's very<br>constraining and stuff but you know it's<br>sort of your day to day life seems to be<br>a little bit easier in terms of how you<br>can access things and you know where you<br>can go and where you can take your kids<br>and you know all that kind of stuff<br>whereas you know as an example when I<br>was up here sort of staying in Devonport<br>and every time you had to leave<br>Devonport down one road you know<br>depending on the time of day it could be<br>anywhere going you know just<br>everything's a lot harder and then you<br>go to London I was remember in London<br>you know if you wanted to go anyway you<br>had to allow yourself an hour pretty<br>much to you know<br>to get this why not go living shiranai -<br>you're got the opportunity of living in<br>Hawke's Bay or we've got a penultimate<br>question here and then a last question<br>at frontier throwing you an idea I don't<br>know I don't have all of the the answers<br>I suppose what I and and again what the<br>there seems to be some literature around<br>sort of management systems and the use<br>of serendipity and particularly for and<br>firms I and I haven't done an exhaustive<br>piece of academic research but I I'm not<br>really seeing anything around this idea<br>of serendipity and how that might impact<br>into sort of urban planning or design or<br>what-have-you but when I sort of started<br>thinking about it that za vos corner was<br>quite an interesting you know sort of<br>sort of case but I think that and again<br>I think it's probably a scale thing<br>about you know I suppose what you sort<br>of touching on in terms of that sort of<br>regularity of sort of development and<br>stuff you know must be are there other<br>ways of sort of doing you know how can<br>we be more creative and I think the<br>point about being creative is if you've<br>got the more constraints you have that<br>allows you to be more creative so you<br>know if you've just if you've got a<br>client as an architect and you've got a<br>client and they've got an empty paddock<br>and they say design me a house you know<br>where do you start but you know if<br>you've got 150 square meters and you've<br>got this and that that you can do and<br>you know it becomes a lot more you know<br>you've got to be more creative in terms<br>of how to resolve there and sort of a<br>set of issues so you know so I don't<br>think this idea of serendipity is<br>instead of you know the rules and stuff<br>you know the rules of their - well you<br>know for interpretation and the other<br>thing about district plans and I'm not a<br>planner so I get myself very sort of<br>wound up in terms of you know things<br>like objectives and policies and rules<br>and and but you know I think we need to<br>do more thinking or more discussion<br>around what what is the objective that<br>we're we're trying to achieve that's<br>articulated in the in the unitary plan<br>example you know there's something<br>called the RPS regional policy statement<br>and then they're in the regional policy<br>statement there's some stuff about<br>quality built environment it gets to<br>that loss but you know we did a lot of<br>work to try and get that grounded at<br>that sort of high level so you know just<br>bring back to some of - that rather than<br>you know because you'll never win the<br>argument about your sunlight access<br>playing pro panes or your or your<br>parking numbers or whatever or whatever<br>unless you have that you know discussion<br>from that objective might you but then<br>you'll go to the resource consent<br>planner and they'll probably look at you<br>because they look they themselves<br>probably haven't looked at the objective<br>so they they've got their series of but<br>you know so maybe there's some self<br>Spencer over lady and not all of these a<br>sort of New Zealand examples obviously<br>but I think I mean from a from an<br>architectural perspective I mean you<br>know we do have to consider our sort of<br>sort of modern sort of building systems<br>and you know this is not my area because<br>I I'm not sort of usually working at<br>deal detail but you know and I I think I<br>think again having sort of done a bit of<br>teaching at architecture school in<br>Wellington and I was doing a third year<br>studio last year and I was slightly<br>horrified by the students relying on<br>Pinterest in terms of taking their you<br>know some of their clues for their sort<br>of design sect and I kept sort of saying<br>you know you have a library downstairs<br>of books and magazines you know and<br>learn from history so your question I<br>think it's sort of it's probably more of<br>a global I sort of approach in terms of<br>you know how some of this stuff is sort<br>of happening although it was quite<br>interesting and you know we need some<br>sort of academics to really because it's<br>still quite interesting when you look at<br>a set of buildings say in New Zealand<br>versus Australia you can quite often<br>what is about those sort of those<br>buildings but again I suppose going back<br>to that sort of an Acula point that I<br>sort of made and many years ago being in<br>Darwin and the little bungalows there<br>with their heat pumps on on the site you<br>know they've built exactly the same as<br>that as whether it was in Melbourne or<br>you know concrete slab some sort of mono<br>clad system with a sort of a deck<br>romantic roof for the heat pump and<br>Darwin you know it's quite a an<br>interesting sort of environment to you<br>know to work in so you know what what<br>are the clues from you know from that<br>some of those yeah I think some of those<br>ones I think something like that gets a<br>little bit more interesting probably<br>those top ones that one's an interesting<br>one that won't happen anywhere else in<br>the world Greece since you're a sport<br>same good when it's not specifically<br>there but I mean sort of I suppose<br>cohousing is the is representing well<br>it's representing I mean there's I<br>suppose there's different cohousing sort<br>of models so you know the nightingale<br>model out of out of Melbourne is trying<br>to take the developer out of the the<br>equation so as part of that cohousing<br>are you there as the developer I mean a<br>lot of the causing you there as the<br>future resident so you're you're you're<br>sort of making decisions so yeah I mean<br>know whether that's another bubble or<br>but I think that you'd probably those<br>people would could sit on a number of<br>different things because I got some<br>cohousing models that you know<br>potentially you can go share out<br>but but then again I think like a lot of<br>things you know we you know we want more<br>for less so you know there are some<br>expense and some of you know the the<br>developer driven and there's probably<br>not a lot of examples up there but you<br>know<br>the the systems the building systems the<br>the way that the developer can set that<br>up without you know you can sort of<br>gives that can get that on the market at<br>a reasonable price point you get I'm and<br>again us was what I didn't really think<br>about or sort of show is that you know<br>we're just getting more and more<br>specialists and every specialist sort of<br>you know takes takes they're they're<br>they're cut okay I can't resist pointing<br>out that from next year's there won't be<br>a library down seas but okay one taste<br>again futures to free education and some<br>institutions Minds is a beanbag in the<br>smartphone</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are
