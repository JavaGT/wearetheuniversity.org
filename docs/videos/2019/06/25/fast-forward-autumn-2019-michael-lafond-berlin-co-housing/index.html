This semester we continue our focus on the question: How can we do medium density well? This series is proudly supported by GIB®.<br><br>Michael LaFond (Berlin), Co-Housing<br><br>Berlin-based architect Michael LaFond is one of the world’s leading thinkers on collective urban housing. He has decades of international experience as both an architect and a developer. LaFond argues that collective forms of land and property ownership hold the key to solving New Zealand’s abysmal housing situation - with skyrocketing rents, out of reach house prices, and off-the-scale building costs. Drawing on evidence from overseas, LaFond makes a case for rethinking property development away from an extractive profit-driven exercise and towards the provision of public infrastructure and integrated communities. He argues for government, local councils and community groups to work together to develop collective ownership and management models for housing. In New Zealand, collective approaches through iwi Māori, such as papakainga, fit well with the paradigm shift LaFond says is necessary.<br><br>--<br><br>For more information about our architecture,

the lovely introduction<br>and thanks to Robyn for the introduction<br>to earth song and in advance for being<br>able to enjoy the earth song community<br>in the next couple of days here and you<br>said thank you to a few people but<br>that's always important at the beginning<br>of anything is to say thanks thanks to<br>mark South come wellington with Victoria<br>University for setting this New Zealand<br>tour up I met mark in 2016 a few others<br>I've I've met up there in Berlin and<br>I've met quite a few others over the<br>last couple of weeks in New Zealand and<br>yeah that's that's what this tour is<br>about is exchanging experiences and<br>ideas<br>comparing approaches introducing some<br>ideas and experiences coming from<br>so yeah I'll launch into this<br>presentation I've got a few slides to<br>show and then I'm happy to yeah discuss<br>with people here this evening um so you<br>can see on the screens that seems to be<br>working there and people are talking<br>about cohousing so what does cohousing<br>talking with with Robyn on the way over<br>this evening as I often say it's not<br>what I'm doing but what a lot of us are<br>doing we were in the process of defining<br>cohousing it's an emerging practice it's<br>an emerging idea emergent movement so<br>we're part of that defining from my own<br>perspective my own my own experience is<br>as you can see from this first slide I<br>very much like to put cohousing into a<br>larger context first of all I've talked<br>about co-production so co-production<br>I mean people working together in in<br>developing and shaping and managing our<br>local environments I'm particularly<br>interested in urban environments being<br>in Berlin and working with other<br>European cities I talked about<br>co-production of of the city or of the<br>urban environment and I like to put that<br>into the context of an even larger idea<br>of commenting a verb that's starting to<br>get more attention I think who can say<br>we're in our own ways in our different<br>cities somewhere on the path of<br>reclaiming this idea of the Commons and<br>the verb main comedy that means creating<br>common spaces places that are there for<br>the larger of good and for the benefit<br>of a number of people so we're all about<br>working to redefine or create new<br>definitions for these sorts of things so<br>again now coming from Berlin it's called<br>the Institute for creative<br>sustainability I helped to create this<br>nonprofit organization about almost 20<br>years ago now I'll be showing you<br>information ideas especially from Berlin<br>to start with this is part of my own<br>background and the way I look at housing<br>and cohousing is in the context of<br>sustainability and what do I mean with<br>sustainability I don't start with the<br>technical side or even the environmental<br>side I put the emphasis on the cultural<br>the cultural dimension so I'd like to<br>say sustainability is about cultural<br>challenges and opportunities this really<br>emphasizes the way that we live together<br>work together the way that ways that we<br>deal with each other practices and<br>traditions and housing as one of the<br>most important things in this world of<br>again I see this as a cultural challenge<br>full of challenges but also<br>opportunities if we're talking about<br>cultures and traditions from this place<br>then I'm quite new to the New Zealand<br>islands but from what I know already<br>there are different traditions one of<br>them coming from traditional people here<br>my aura cultures and yeah the idea of<br>pop I Ganga is something that has been<br>introduced to me so something to look<br>into but also definitely to be<br>complimented by housing cultures and<br>traditions coming from Europe so I'm<br>something of a European American<br>Scottish English Irish German and the<br>idea of the conference is something that<br>we know it goes back not just a few<br>years but but sensories and again I<br>think we're about rediscovering that my<br>own organization were architects<br>planners geographers sociologists<br>sometimes artists and educators we are<br>very much working with cohousing<br>and we do that in different ways one of<br>them is communications and networking so<br>we've been managing this online platform<br>for quite a few years now helping to<br>connect people that develop projects<br>with people looking for projects we also<br>organize a lot of events do publications<br>this bill was mentioned at the beginning<br>one of the publications this is the more<br>recent one the Coe house and inclusive<br>out of this book we've developed the<br>exhibition which can be seen in<br>christchurch right now so yeah the first<br>book emphasizing the cultural approach<br>the second one emphasizing opportunities<br>for inclusion and cohousing projects and<br>that's something I'll be emphasizing<br>over the next minutes now taking a step<br>back but housing it into into a larger<br>context so in which world are we are we<br>practicing it doesn't matter for an<br>Auckland or in Berlin or in other cities<br>I think we can agree that we have seen<br>some challenges around us and indeed<br>very large problems and I would refer to<br>them as crises and then look at these<br>either with the ecological perspective<br>or the social one but I think they are<br>there a few of them I would identify as<br>leading to a discussion on cohousing<br>atomization I mean without a an extreme<br>individualization of our societies to<br>the point that there's very little<br>community left individualized societies<br>where people are encouraged or trained<br>to see themselves as being at odds with<br>each other all in competition and trying<br>to do things for themselves make money<br>save money build a home and so on<br>polarization I mean rich moving away<br>from the poor rate inequalities in any<br>case we can see we in New Zealand as in<br>Germany and as in most of our<br>post-industrial societies we have a<br>crisis of house and affordability and<br>this is particularly impacting the<br>younger generations<br>so even well-educated people coming out<br>of school will find themselves in a very<br>hard hard place in terms of finding<br>decent housing or attractive thousand<br>if we look at the ecological problems<br>and won't go through those but again I<br>think we can agree that the challenges<br>are really the most severe for the<br>coming generations who are being left to<br>dealt with problems that the older<br>people are leaving them with anyway some<br>some severe challenge that I think need<br>more attention and my question is really<br>what what does go house and have to do<br>without it or in what ways can we look<br>at go housing now that's something<br>that's going to take care of all the<br>problems what what can go house and do<br>what can our housing projects do in<br>terms of dealing with social and<br>ecological challenges what is going on<br>since oh my my own definition I say<br>first of all it should be in some way<br>self-organized<br>and when I say that I mean it's not just<br>a weak version of participation where<br>people are invited to comment on an<br>architect's drawings or on some plans<br>presented by the government or by some<br>investors it means to people being<br>empowered to in some way get on with<br>realizing their own I would say dreams<br>of living together community-led so a<br>strong idea of community you can say<br>community based community oriented but I<br>think community lattice is quite a good<br>term meaning community a group of people<br>should indeed play a strong role on the<br>projects in fact a stronger role than<br>architects the developers or others I at<br>least encourage cohousing projects to be<br>ambitious in seeing themselves that has<br>some way being sustainable or perhaps<br>getting on with what could be called<br>regenerative developments this means<br>taking on a range of issues and seeing<br>what can be done at the local level<br>cohousing quite often at least say on<br>average what I know if go has some<br>processes if they demonstrate innovation<br>something that's desperately needed in<br>all of our cities we'll come back to<br>that perhaps at a larger level we're<br>talking about systemic change and I<br>think we really need to be getting to<br>that point of not just making small<br>changes but talking about more dramatic<br>change that amounts to a paradigm shift<br>of the way we live or the way we've<br>developed a managed house in the<br>empowerment I've talked about that<br>giving people a stronger role than they<br>would have otherwise had so looking to<br>people gnosis just as consumers goad us<br>people who in fact have something should<br>have something to say with their local<br>world the idea of inclusion I'll come<br>back to that if that's an important<br>challenge of our time<br>so cohousing Europe talking about<br>motivation so why do people look it up<br>coming out in a bit more from the<br>personal side or the individual side to<br>begin with I think bill mentioned out in<br>the beginning<br>our cities are expressing that Berlin we<br>have Berlin in terms of being<br>individualized in the city of Berlin<br>more than half of the people live alone<br>our singles what I understand from New<br>Zealand it might be 25 percent I don't<br>know I'm sorry but let's say it's an<br>increasing part of the population that<br>adds up to not just extreme competition<br>and consumption but a lot of loneliness<br>I which yeah is can be seen as a<br>sickness or something that people<br>actually die early from an important<br>point is that the markets so the housing<br>market or housing developers builders<br>are not meeting the needs of the<br>interests of people the point is there<br>with demographic change the way people<br>are living and working meaning we're<br>talking about family structure the need<br>to be mobile they need to be flexible<br>just the way people are are living<br>housing is it's not addressing that<br>meaning people are living in housing<br>apartments or homes that don't reflect<br>the particular family structure or our<br>white people are would rather be living<br>so how soon can can help us develop<br>nouvelles and topologies and spaces and<br>ways to bring people together developing<br>Co housing projects definitely has an<br>economic dimension it can be should be<br>more affordable not everybody working<br>with their own particular lot and garage<br>and and washing machine and everything I<br>think quite importantly and for me this<br>connects to the cultural dimension I<br>said I if we take housing seriously if<br>it's a home it's where people are living<br>and spending a lot of time in their life<br>and it's not just a roof over their<br>heads but if it works well it's an<br>expression of who we are it's an<br>expression of a person's identity very<br>important place to recover and to say<br>for an increasing number of people this<br>is not the way they're living they don't<br>have this opportunity finally last but<br>not least definitely it's a search for<br>community replacing something that's<br>been lost in many people's lives not<br>just having good neighbors but perhaps<br>even going beyond that people who you<br>can share things with so good about<br>Berlin<br>there was mention it this at the<br>beginning just a few turns yeah we can<br>come back to this in the discussion but<br>I'll just run through this what are we<br>talking about so the housing cooperative<br>one dog an awesome shop it's it's it's a<br>practice that goes back more than 120<br>130 years more than 10% of the housing<br>in Berlin as well as the country of<br>Germany is developed and managed by<br>housing cooperatives that's a it's a<br>legal economic structure people become<br>members if they buy shares they don't<br>buy the unit there's a democratic<br>structure that's there to develop and<br>maintain affordable housing this idea of<br>cohousing we're close to Scandinavia so<br>we look at cities like Stockholm and<br>Denmark<br>highly organized societies and people<br>that have a lot of experience and<br>in sharing and while the inspiration<br>come from Denmark especially for the<br>idea of Co house and in fact where the<br>term cohousing<br>which picked up on American architects<br>in the eighties give an inspiration like<br>Robin people like myself going back 30<br>years now and in Berlin a lot of other<br>things that have come up over the last<br>few decades ways of living together<br>alternatives sometimes experiments yeah<br>at the commune yeah the squat Oh has<br>been a big thing in Berlin in the<br>eighties and nineties especially and the<br>idea of a shared flat or that is called<br>the the vague year the WG so most<br>students know about sharing apartments<br>and sharing kitchens so there are<br>different things that inform and<br>influence what we call Co house and<br>today in Berlin a couple of the more<br>recent things coming up over the last 25<br>years the next one it's more difficult<br>to say in German the neat sonorous<br>Endicott apartment building syndicate<br>about 120 125 projects around Germany<br>right now explicitly anti speculative so<br>the whole idea was to take property from<br>the speculative housing market and to<br>keep it from ever being privatized again<br>so there was this this line of thinking<br>radical position compared to what I was<br>saying New Zealand thinking of related<br>regarding housing but that's influencing<br>community housing the projects belong to<br>a network self-organized self-managed<br>and with a certain legal structure that<br>prevents the people from<br>from ever selling their units or their<br>buildings the idea of the bobbin<br>mineshafter the bow Koopa that I know<br>that's the term that's made its way over<br>to to New Zealand and Australia<br>just to come in on that with couple of<br>sentences the bow grouper that really<br>translate this building group the Belka<br>mineshaft is building community about<br>blue book can be lets say a<br>cost-effective or an economical way of<br>developing house and meaning people save<br>money primarily because there's no<br>external investor and people who are<br>building in the project become the risk<br>takers and move in but perhaps let's say<br>for most of these about new projects<br>there's not very much community it's<br>more economical in developing wine-shop<br>bit more community community spaces<br>perhaps community gardens but in both of<br>these about Cooper with about one shaft<br>it usually means you compare us into the<br>housing cooperative private property<br>model I think something comparable to<br>your body corporate here<br>and finally the coal living project or<br>the cool living idea I'll just say a<br>couple words about that it's talking<br>with with Romney again just on their way<br>into town and it's important to say you<br>know as we're all about defining Co<br>house and what we think it is what we<br>think it isn't and I find myself<br>increasingly saying that what I mean by<br>Co house and it's not go living coal<br>living I don't know if you have Co<br>living projects defined themselves as<br>such in Auckland yeah we have them in<br>larger European and North American<br>cities and some other countries it's<br>really an investor driven model and I<br>would put it quite crudely to say that<br>the ideas maximizing the profit but<br>usually young people so-called digital<br>nomads<br>get very small units micro units and<br>they have some community spaces like a<br>kitchen or living room and some sort of<br>a community manager to help animate<br>things but they're they're paying quite<br>a bit of money and I I find it quite<br>often anyways to be in abuse of the term<br>Co so a lot of things are emerging that<br>use the word Co no surprise in response<br>to needs and response to economic<br>pressures and social pressures but it's<br>good to look closer at what people<br>really mean by that if we look at Berlin<br>or Germany we don't have any exact<br>numbers but yeah I would say if we have<br>hundreds of projects in Berlin and at<br>least quite a few thousand around<br>Germany that are pretty close to what<br>we're talking about here this evening<br>I'm not going to show you four projects<br>I'm just going to show you two the first<br>one is the Springfield that I have been<br>a part of I've been living here for the<br>last five years and working there and<br>part of its development going back to<br>2011 some of you have already been there<br>this is what it look like during the<br>planning phase the three buildings so<br>it's it's in fact a new neighborhood<br>that's a lot of what makes it<br>interesting is that it's being developed<br>at a scale so we're talking about<br>increase in density it's it's enough<br>density and enough stuff going on that<br>makes a number of things possible so<br>what are those things possible well in<br>terms of being part of the construction<br>or a part of the planning that's part of<br>every Co housing project I would expect<br>this is us during the building phase<br>that was between 2012 and 2014 this is<br>what what it looks like from the air I<br>think this goes way back to 2014 or so<br>but those who are three buildings on the<br>you could see an attractive location<br>it's always nice to be close to the<br>water we were fortunate that we started<br>this project in 2010 because we wouldn't<br>be able to do it today<br>Mississippi Berlin is gentrifying every<br>minute as you turn around a couple of<br>times and the land values will have gone<br>up and some opportunities will have been<br>gone so this we were quite lucky to have<br>done that at that time nobody wanted to<br>live in that neighborhood or nobody had<br>really tried doing a housing project it<br>was sort of a wasteland<br>close to the former wall with a lot of<br>factory wants here we are in the<br>interior courtyard space so again what I<br>think one of the things I think that<br>makes this quite special it's the<br>mixed-use idea that comes with a higher<br>density the first two half levels grew<br>at the ground level on the next we call<br>it the mezzanine are either commercial<br>spaces community spaces or some sort of<br>educational behind this is the daycare<br>so 25 children are there every day come<br>and go usually for what most of the kids<br>are coming from other neighborhoods<br>that's part of the idea of inclusion<br>it's we have a location that is there<br>for the people who are living there but<br>also for the neighborhood as we look at<br>it but also a number of office spaces<br>commercial spaces used by my<br>organization but quite a few others<br>including architects but a lot of other<br>small companies and organizations are<br>renting space it looks like co-working<br>community spaces we call them option<br>spaces we use the term option because<br>the spaces are designed to be flexible<br>that means in terms of the use so people<br>who live and work in the community but<br>others that means we rent them out and<br>make them available for people that want<br>to organize needing have a party show a<br>otherwise well commenting on earth song<br>impressive landscape unit and greening<br>and that's quite it but an important<br>part of our project as well and a bit<br>more of an urban context but but be part<br>of us being there is is this is a<br>positive development of the landscape we<br>did that by having though no car parking<br>spaces on the site which allows us to<br>green it and we'd like to use the words<br>developing edible or productive<br>landscape so this means green plants but<br>part of a movement I think anyway so we<br>are interested in seeing how that's<br>possible around housing projects even in<br>urban locations it's an educational<br>thing it's people like to do and beyond<br>that part of a movement of recovering<br>land and at least in the small-scale<br>growing some food a very big part of it<br>this is in my particular community group<br>cooking and eating together this is an<br>idea which is largely coming from<br>Denmark and Sweden it hasn't been really<br>strong German practice either but it's<br>gaining more attention it doesn't look<br>like that every evening but on a regular<br>basis<br>I'm part of what could be called a sub<br>project which i think is expressing<br>inside you have to go housing where we<br>have smaller than average private spaces<br>in this case and fairly high density<br>urban situation where we have apartments<br>that are next to each other open onto<br>community spaces or larger larger<br>hallways and<br>shir kitchen a living room and in the<br>building shared washing machines and<br>shared cars down below so some of the<br>innovations so yeah I emphasize the idea<br>with the possibility that with Co<br>housing we can innovate in a way that's<br>interesting for ourselves so we do<br>process for ourselves but in a way<br>that's interesting for the larger<br>population Springfield the cooperative<br>ownership it's a democratic idea but<br>again I think it's quite significant or<br>becoming more significant if we're<br>interested in not just building<br>affordable housing but maintaining that<br>over time it means largely taking it or<br>keeping it from a speculative market<br>involving people in helping to plan but<br>also make things and manage things the<br>idea of being car free it's a<br>possibility in Berlin we're not required<br>by the city to build new car parking<br>spaces<br>yeah the passive architecture again<br>impressed with Earth's song you've<br>actually gone farther and we have in<br>terms of ecological architecture we've<br>gone pretty far with the energy system<br>smaller energy geothermal and<br>cogeneration we're interested there in<br>experimenting or demonstrating systems<br>that work it at a neighborhood level if<br>you become efficient when you have well<br>like we do 130 people and all of this<br>commercial space as well we can we can<br>develop really our own energy and eating<br>the idea of inclusion so emphasizing<br>that we're part of a city and there are<br>connections between our project and<br>people<br>around us let's go on to the next cross<br>well I'll go through this one much<br>faster it's interesting for some other<br>reasons the word all-talk means everyday<br>everyday live the thing that's quite a<br>bit different about this from the screen<br>for the most most cohousing projects is<br>that we have architects and developers<br>who are developing housing not for<br>themselves but for other people so if<br>you have Co housing yeah what does it<br>mean so I used the term self-organized<br>and community without a community based<br>this sort of thing is also emerging or<br>it exists in some places the idea that<br>something like Co housing or community<br>oriented housing can be therefore I<br>would use the word needs groups so<br>people who are marginalized on the<br>housing market who really can't compete<br>we see this in our boku housing<br>inclusive in the book we're looking at a<br>few different needs groups so we say<br>people with less money refugees or<br>people with handicaps for example who<br>otherwise for a difficult time of<br>getting any decent apartment and so<br>we're looking at development of housing<br>projects that are that work very much<br>like cohousing meaning people have small<br>private spaces they have community<br>spaces yeah opportunities well they can<br>retreat into the private space they can<br>go into the community spaces and very<br>similar to our spray felt project and<br>some of the things are quite similar no<br>surprise the architects are the same<br>ones from ours grateful project in this<br>one you have a mixed view so you have<br>more public community space that the<br>ground level which means a cafe for<br>example classic opportunity for bringing<br>people together so people that live in<br>the building can spend time in the cafe<br>I need people from the neighborhood I<br>have but of course people can also go<br>out out into the public space which is<br>like a public square which is what's<br>really public or people from the<br>surrounding neighborhoods are invited to<br>walk through a few things about that one<br>that I think are innovative again it's<br>it's not driven by the future residents<br>and I'm not just doing that to be<br>provocative but I think there's really<br>something going on here if we're talking<br>about cohousing then I think it's<br>similar in newzealand acid house but in<br>Berlin in recent years that so much<br>attention has gone to the construction<br>phase that people have have been<br>thinking hardly at all about the<br>residential figures look what happens<br>when people move in and who's taking<br>care of that and how do people work<br>together so this project is is it's an<br>attempt to shift that and say it's<br>developed in a different way and a lot<br>of attention they're given to them to<br>the residential imaginal phase this<br>project is it's really significant for<br>another reason and I think it could be<br>an interesting thing for the local<br>government here in Auckland or other New<br>Zealand cities isn't it one of the huge<br>challenges we have is to if we try to do<br>everything then to build in a way that<br>is sustainable and affordable so usually<br>when we say we've built more sustainably<br>it costs more so who can afford to do<br>that while people with more money so how<br>do we get on with with exploring and<br>demonstrating affordable architecture<br>that is also sustainable well that's a<br>huge risk to take and I think it's not<br>fair to expect cohousing projects to try<br>to do everything song you were<br>successful it took 10 years to do it a<br>lot of people don't have the nerves<br>patience whenever our skill get to bring<br>it through that way so the local<br>government in Berlin in a technology<br>that came up with a cop<br>and in the end gave subsidies to about<br>nine projects and the one I just showed<br>is one of them and again the expectation<br>from the government was okay show us<br>what you can do<br>show us some homes that are built it<br>might mean that they're there they're<br>there they're using one of new ways of<br>they're using new environmental<br>technologies and they're considering<br>some of the social dimension meaning<br>yeah architecture or space that is<br>encouraging of community and they're<br>required to keep the cost down so it's a<br>huge challenge that means doing a bit of<br>research and really looking around and<br>being very creative with builders so<br>yeah I think things like that need to<br>happen more so that we don't stress the<br>cohousing projects too much yeah yeah we<br>lock oh housing projects to do what's<br>possible and and look for other ways<br>with larger institutional partners to<br>move things along so connecting up with<br>universities of local government to<br>really do some of the thinking so let's<br>let's go on what I see in Berlin and<br>starting to to summarize things is that<br>and I can see this again and again I I'm<br>reminded especially by younger<br>generations<br>what I see in Berlin and other cities<br>that we've got problems I see young<br>people going into the streets and<br>demonstrating and so I'm reminded that<br>there's a certain urgency both socially<br>and ecologically speaking and I really<br>believe that that there was an urgency<br>and at that time the new opportunities<br>for emergent so I there is a clear<br>connection there that people are looking<br>for innovation that we need to look for<br>innovation opportunities how do we<br>respond to these to these housing<br>challenges and the things that have come<br>up<br>in Berlin and Germany over the last<br>years and maybe last decades the<br>co-operative is one of them I think it's<br>it's quite a significant development<br>that's something that the specific<br>projects really can't be expected to do<br>it's a structural thing it has to do<br>with policy it has to do with tax<br>incentives economic situations so that<br>we need people working on that at the<br>larger level city housing companies so<br>what can a local government do that a<br>small cone housing project can't in<br>terms of mobilizing resources in land a<br>lot of really interesting cooperations<br>have developed not just in Berlin but I<br>think about cities like Vienna or<br>Stockholm cooperations between archer<br>house and companies and cohousing groups<br>so you get a large housing developer or<br>provider to do something that really<br>amounts to cohousing small people small<br>groups don't have to worry about all of<br>the financing for example the<br>possibility of the long-term land lease<br>I think is quite significant it often<br>comes down or usually comes down to land<br>access to land and property and Qasim<br>groups are more and more priced out of<br>it it can't compete with larger<br>investors and developers they don't have<br>the time you get a group together that<br>maybe they just can't come up with the<br>financing of the banks or not is to work<br>with them so one way to do that is to<br>separate the land from the buildings and<br>that usually means then somebody owns<br>the land it can be a government Church<br>perhaps a nonprofit foundation or a<br>community - trust connect the land more<br>affordable so people don't have to do by<br>a big part of the the success story in<br>Berlin over the last years is that what<br>I'm calling your ethical banks and<br>foundations have developed if the coals<br>and projects they're about architecture<br>and space and people but there's no<br>question that it comes down to resources<br>and financing as much as a lot of people<br>a lot of idealists don't want to deal<br>with that so yeah they either you're<br>gonna have to move your banks along or<br>people are gonna have to develop some<br>other ones some new ones that will work<br>on more more more intentionally with<br>ideas of sustainability or with<br>community projects the idea that you<br>minute lands for us I've become a<br>believer of that one over the last<br>couple of years it's definitely<br>something to look into<br>over the last week I got to know one of<br>the projects in Christchurch which I'm<br>impressed with the Peterborough project<br>which has a Land Trust interestingly<br>enough since in 1980s<br>so the Land Trust is actually on the<br>land and now they're in the process of<br>rebuilding their homes which were<br>damaged or destroyed in the earthquake<br>and people have the opportunity either<br>to buy into or through a restricted<br>retail or people will have the<br>opportunity to rent from it so yeah the<br>idea of the Land Trust and I put in a<br>demonstration there at the end yeah I<br>I'm not saying everybody has to go out<br>into the street tomorrow but I think<br>some people do need to be involved in<br>politics and however it comes about<br>people need to work for change so look<br>look for the connections between house<br>and Alison and cohousing there are<br>connections there<br>terms of you know how writers are dealt<br>with and you know tax laws tax<br>incentives and so on how thinks of<br>Finance we need to demonstrate in the<br>positive way meaning new projects but we<br>also need to demonstrate that things<br>need to change and yeah that's what I<br>was saying earlier that I my assumption<br>is a lot of that's going to be left to<br>the upcoming generation who are mostly<br>frustrated and disappointed with what<br>they're finding so if you give that some<br>attention as well not everybody can do<br>everything but some of us need to be<br>doing the practical things of design and<br>announcing these projects and others<br>need to be as I would say working on the<br>political or policy so I think that<br>brings us to the end of the presentation<br>parts yeah thanks for your attention so<br>yeah so for the Springfield we've got<br>it's just about 10% is what we call<br>commercial space that means it's<br>rendered out and that's we talk about<br>that a bit today in another discussion<br>but the idea of them excuse is part of<br>being or it's part of like okay you know<br>maximizing use particular area the idea<br>of people working and living in a<br>particular area so reducing<br>transportation for the long term it's<br>part of the economic idea of the project<br>itself the the rents of these commercial<br>units are are really or the total cost<br>of these commercial spaces are being<br>paid for by the people renting them<br>that means the co-operative had to make<br>them happen but the cost of being picked<br>up<br>that means overtime and and and the<br>Germany we're talking about longer-term<br>loans so at least after 20 years they<br>were thinking long term there it's it's<br>an income source and otherwise we have a<br>fair amount of community space again<br>there's a combination of the social<br>interest for ourselves and we have<br>places to meet and do things but there's<br>the economic dimension that they're<br>pretty generously sized and that means<br>we rent them out so that means you know<br>week week weekend it's not a source of<br>income but that pays for the cost of the<br>yeah good question so um if you look at<br>one of our two books girls and cultures<br>across and inclusive what I can talk<br>about it there are projects out there in<br>Berlin and in Vienna and in London I<br>know in particular and these are<br>projects that are that are really<br>consciously designed by women for women<br>not meaning that they exclude that from<br>living there but they're clearly women's<br>projects and some of them are based on<br>longer your European traditions of<br>women's housing which go back hundreds<br>of years interestingly enough called the<br>beginning the ETI<br>and see how that kind of thing has<br>emerged and it's been an interest of<br>mine and that's why I also used the term<br>cohousing inclusive and and one reason<br>why I think cohousing can be so<br>significant is that and I'm repeating<br>myself a bit but the market is not<br>providing a wide range of housing forms<br>or topologies and that's just one<br>example so what does that mean right I<br>mean what what what what why women see<br>as as their particular needs are<br>interests so want to get together and do<br>it and figure that out for themselves so<br>those kinds of things have been explored<br>there are a whole bunch of other the<br>kinds of houses where people are<br>designing for particular groups but yeah<br>that's I think one thing that makes it<br>interesting so that's that's a user<br>orientation and and definitely that<br>comes about when architects and<br>developers are working with people in<br>advance to ask okay what do you want<br>what do you need how can we design that<br>so that's the question is what's what's<br>an ideal size for a qu Allison project<br>and I would say there is no perfect size<br>it depends on the location the people<br>the financing and so on but for a<br>particular project I would say this<br>typical ku housing projects<br>15 to 30 units<br>what what what seems to work is that you<br>need a group that sends commands itself<br>people can sit around the table and make<br>decisions people can look at each other<br>get to know each other it has to be sort<br>of a feasible working group if you it's<br>possible to combine projects and I<br>started to talk about that with project<br>I want to call this great fell that<br>means we have the larger neighborhood<br>level which is a kind of a community in<br>itself like a neighborhood or a village<br>it's not a tight community people can<br>share our space but they don't all have<br>to like each other<br>and we have smaller projects like they<br>want to live it in where another kind of<br>community is expected so for the small<br>project I mean we've got 23 people on<br>about 12 units and that allows for much<br>in a kind of community work we can cook<br>and eat together on a regular basis so<br>yeah it's possible to piece together<br>smaller groups in a larger neighborhood<br>project it depends again what we want<br>and what we mean I would say that there<br>are there's this idea of a strong kind<br>of cohousing which means a community<br>people get to know each other they share<br>things to trust each other and there's a<br>much looser version of that where people<br>are good neighbors it really depends<br>what people are looking for<br>I think it's I think it's a really<br>important discussion that's good to be<br>clear about that<br>so architects developers and also people<br>who are looking for cohousing a lot of<br>people really don't know exactly what<br>they're looking for and you can say well<br>I'm giving you cohousing they say great<br>how much does the cost you know where<br>can I sign up and they get something and<br>that's what they think it is but without<br>having gone through a long discussion<br>without have a look at the projects say<br>oh it could be that it could be that it<br>could be that am i interested in go<br>could and eating together am i<br>interested in sure in part of my life<br>with people am i interested in this kind<br>so you're talking about like in the City<br>of Oakland to do a project and you mean<br>how could it be successful with respect<br>what my guess is people in Oakland are<br>also looking for some different things<br>so it's hard to say that there's one<br>type to everybody but both the obvious<br>things right off at least for most<br>people that needs to be affordable it<br>needs to be doable and that could mean<br>different things to different people to<br>sort of take two years of their life or<br>people are looking for different things<br>when I say housing if it works well it's<br>an expression of ourselves so people<br>have something different in mind like a<br>particular identity it should be really<br>a collage well maybe some people are<br>looking for more of an architectural<br>statement actually that that's also out<br>there when people say they need an<br>identity then the architecture can be<br>quite important for them a lot of people<br>looking for a particular location I mean<br>I know from other cities that people<br>really want to live in a particular<br>neighborhood and that they're really<br>happy if they can stay in a certain area<br>because that's what they have their<br>in terms of being successful though the<br>greatest challenges with every project<br>are gonna be getting access to land<br>getting the financing otherwise nothing<br>else really happens so that's that's<br>kind of help them to start with that's a<br>complicated question oh I'm sorry I<br>so the the the model is first and<br>foremost a cooperative structure people<br>bought the property they decided to turn<br>it into a housing cooperative which<br>meant that the land and the buildings<br>went into the property of the<br>co-operative and so that meant people<br>had to become members of the<br>co-operative and then had to buy shares<br>that would correspond to the size of<br>their particular private space the basic<br>idea there we can go into more detail<br>but this guy Dean of the co-operative is<br>people acquire these shares when they<br>leave they get that money back in<br>addition to those shares and for the<br>spree felt that map we were expected in<br>the end to finance about 50% of the<br>original costs of that particular space<br>and above and beyond that we pay<br>something like a rent we call the news<br>feed and we have a noose agreement which<br>is really good for our lifetime that's<br>that you have the co-operative very<br>secure rent those loans will be paid off<br>some of them are individual loans in<br>some of them are that 50% are taken out<br>taking on by the co-operative altogether<br>but the main idea of the co-operative<br>again it's democratic and over time the<br>rents should become more and more<br>affordable as compared to the<br>surrounding housing market those the two<br>real driving forces of it and again like<br>more than ten percent of the housing<br>Berlin is cooperative so it's it's not a<br>real strange model that's something that<br>and spaces the way they're actually used<br>it's a good question um so some of the<br>larger spaces we call them these option<br>spaces and one of them so there are one<br>in each building one of them started off<br>as a wood workshop which was great for<br>the first few years a lot of people were<br>interested in making furniture or things<br>for their own space or also for the<br>commercial spaces and it's transitioning<br>now into an Oakland or a neighborhood<br>workshop workshop we found like a<br>non-profit to take that over so that's<br>continuing as a wood workshop you have a<br>couple of spaces we had ideas for them<br>in the beginning we call them Hopsin<br>spaces and that was actually a good<br>approach because in fact they are<br>flexible and they're really robust big<br>spaces it will be that we're built very<br>affordably meaning they're also<br>affordable to use for us and for other<br>people and and that seems to work quite<br>well a lot of different things can go on<br>in those spaces it's hard for people to<br>damage them they can spill things on the<br>floor you book and have a party in and<br>it you know it looks the same the next<br>day it's been cleaned up we have some<br>smaller community spaces which are not<br>used by the public which is why people<br>who live there and in fact those things<br>have changed the uses we've been<br>surprised by that in fact two of them<br>really smaller to a smallest community<br>spaces a year in the being there the<br>proposal was made by somebody in the<br>group they said hey we're not using<br>these spaces very much we have a lot of<br>refugees a hundred thousand came to<br>Berlin between 2015 and 2016 and she<br>said what about converting those into<br>space for refugee families and then we<br>debated that for a few months and<br>finally made that decision we said okay<br>yeah let's do that<br>that won't hurt us we're not really<br>using these spaces very much and at<br>least from some longer period of time we<br>said okay and yeah so for three or four<br>years now there have been people live in<br>their step that's been really nice to<br>see you as well and there again I say<br>that that's the nice thing about a<br>larger project next use with it some<br>different spaces a bit ambitious in in<br>the planning because somebody's got to<br>finance it and somehow it has to work<br>out but that's given us the flexibility<br>to to change the use on a couple of<br>things so yeah I think our project for<br>the number of others is real in and some<br>other European cities that have<br>emphasized what some are called the<br>process orientation made a big deal out<br>of that this evening but that means<br>architects can never know everything<br>about a project they just can't know<br>exactly how things are gonna be used<br>there will be a lot of surprises and<br>going about that a bit intentionally and<br>saying okay let's allow some things to<br>happen which is a bit risky again in<br>terms planning and financing but it's<br>worked out well in our case that was it<br>okay that's great we have some some<br>maybe one of the points it's an<br>important one of kind of going on there<br>but the in terms of being risky with the<br>planning so we had this big community<br>spaces and in the planning phase we said<br>okay we've got these big spaces and<br>we've got a few scenarios aid everything<br>can go well the building costs won't<br>explode we will be able to use these<br>like we think we want to and allow them<br>to be used meaning affordably and we're<br>really lucky two things went well but we<br>had Plan B which said if the costs go up<br>we're gonna have to rent those out for<br>more money they would be turned into<br>commercial spaces so that that's just a<br>possibility for planning a project is to<br>build in some buffer or some kind of<br>like backup<br>things can go well perfectly and then<br>everybody's really happy fine be people<br>can still be happy with that but the<br>yeah so the question is to what extent<br>has local government when the government<br>had all been involved in supporting<br>cohousing and they have in Vaasa for<br>example that you've supported my work my<br>work in the sense of organizing events<br>to a certain extent to win the<br>publication's a communications and<br>networking which is also quite critical<br>people need information any best<br>practices they need to know that things<br>are possible just the networking helping<br>architects and developers find the<br>people they need to do that the city<br>Berlin for example over the last year<br>solved last 10 years has financed<br>another organization which has been<br>advising and consulting the government<br>is helped in a number of cases with<br>allocating land and we always think it<br>should be more but anyway they have<br>provided a number of pieces of property<br>and they often do that with the<br>competition and they asked for you know<br>for the best project or the best concept<br>so that's going on occasionally there<br>have been subsidies or like I showed<br>with the competition the government<br>comes up with the plan and says ok well<br>fund<br>demonstrations that show us what<br>sustainable and affordable architecture<br>Perales and can look like so yeah there<br>are they have been supporting it in the<br>coming years we have a lot of<br>discussions because Berlin is growing<br>quite rapidly and Berlin is is planning<br>some large new neighborhoods on the<br>edges of the city ten or fifteen larger<br>neighborhoods and the discussion is that<br>between cooperative housing and<br>cohousing that we should be developing<br>20 or 25% of that new housing so it's<br>taken seriously in that way and the the<br>idea is that for the future healthy<br>sustainable city we need a circle mix<br>the ownership models provider models<br>different structures and that co house<br>and won't be everything the co-operative<br>element be everything but it can<br>certainly be anywhere from 10 to 25<br>percent of the house and so we're on our<br>way to making that happen and kind of<br>yeah<br>all right so the question if I<br>understand it is yeah<br>when what well in certain certain cases<br>there are cooperation with the<br>government subsidies funding<br>competitions most of what I know to be<br>co house and is it's clearly clearly<br>civil society initiated mean it's coming<br>from people architects developers but<br>it's clearly coming from as I would say<br>from below the combination of people<br>architects and developers have these<br>ideas and they do what they can with or<br>without government assistance if you<br>look around the different cities you'll<br>find or different countries you'll find<br>different levels of cooperation and<br>assistance but the idea of go house and<br>as I know it has never been about<br>waiting for the government it does mean<br>in some ways trying to to get the<br>government to be involved and to support<br>or to subsidize and the government is<br>more likely to be interested to the<br>extent that we can convince the<br>government that we're doing something I<br>would say not just for ourselves but for<br>the larger community I mean it's a<br>learning project its its demonstrating<br>that's innovative there might be some<br>commercial spaces that can be used by a<br>school or you know there's some kind of<br>service of infrastructure which is<br>interesting for the neighbor and that<br>would help to convince the government to<br>support that project maybe they're<br>including some really affordable<br>apartments anyway there other ways of<br>doing that you pick the big change over<br>the recent years in Berlin maybe some<br>other cities is that it's getting more<br>difficult in Berlin because things are<br>more expensive more competition that<br>it's it's getting to be virtually<br>impossible for people just to do it on<br>their own at least in the downtown<br>people can leave the city right but<br>people want to stay in the city<br>and it's virtually impossible without<br>some kind of support I'm an<br>institutional support ya from banks and<br>foundations but likely from the<br>government about because again it's a<br>crystal and and who can do that anyway<br>it's a really good question and this<br>this kind of thing is being tested in<br>Berlin and other cities so to what<br>extent can it be top down menu coming<br>from a housing company or a developer or<br>or from the government to be honest um<br>I'm skeptical that larger companies or<br>government institutions can do it well<br>mean some of the examples are well I<br>showed one what's work which is an<br>attempt to do that<br>coming from architects and developers<br>without involved in the future residents<br>so in some cases that's maybe even<br>necessary because these people don't<br>have any money in and it will be a kind<br>of a temporary housing for them it's a<br>question what you know where are we<br>stretching the line of cohousing but in<br>fact in Germany and other other European<br>countries these kinds of things have<br>been done or are being done I've seen it<br>work quite well where you have let's say<br>a housing company working with a known<br>group of people who are saying yes we<br>know we want to live this way and you<br>can build this and we will tell you what<br>we have in mind and they figure out a<br>good way to do that so I've seen that<br>work especially in Sweden but also I've<br>seen things in in in Vienna and some<br>things like that are starting to come<br>out and in Berlin so there aren't there<br>are ways of doing that and the the<br>again so I come back to this thing about<br>inclusion it's cohousing just for people<br>who have time and money in education or<br>is there a way to open it up a bit more<br>and I think that does mean bringing in<br>larger partners they have resources<br>money access to land how can you get<br>these institutional partners to do<br>good things meaning really sensitive<br>architecture and so they need a lot of<br>input I think it can work if a group of<br>people is really brought together with<br>them I don't think it's gonna work if<br>you just said a large institutional<br>loose and say do what what do you think<br>is cohousing sorry Michael's got some so<br>we need to bring it to a close but by<br>all means come and have a quick word and<br>so again I'd like to thank very much<br>Michael</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
