This semester we continue our focus on the question: How can we do medium density well? This series is proudly supported by GIB®.<br><br>Tiny Houses: Making the Most of Backyards<br><br>Tiny houses may not be everyone’s idea of medium density but internationally they are becoming a very popular and affordable housing alternative, and a means of exploiting small and difficult sites such as household backyards. With a tiny footprint, they cut down on construction costs and environmental impacts. What’s more, you can put them on wheels or on the back of a truck making them fully transportable. However, they often come with Building Code and council planning compliance issues. Presenters with hands-on experience will discuss their adventures with tiny housing:<br>• Alan Syxomexune and Helen Jarvis who are building a dwelling on wheels in a grandmother’s side yard <br>• Piet Ubels and Alan Johnson of Build Up, who designed and built a prototype tiny house on council land intended as emergency housing<br>• Tommy Honey who is the mastermind behind a social enterprise called SLIMBY – Shared Living in My Back Yard (an innovative housing solution where clients can lease a backyard for their tiny home). Honey will also provide an overview and critique of PrefabNZ’s recent SNUG competition that explored tiny housing.<br><br>--<br><br>For more information about our architecture, urban planning and

time<br>something good about myself the<br>residential department we do we're<br>looking into alternative housing sector<br>and at the moment we're doing a couple<br>of long-term regional projects one is<br>under construction now in Sandringham<br>and one in a my CEO time I'd like to<br>other stuff outside of Jays mix and<br>woodland yeah this is tiny outset you<br>designed it for my brother in this<br>batman and i thought i'd name it another<br>tiny house because you you sort of get<br>one of two reactions from people and<br>that's all a quarter you doing your tiny<br>house that's awesome how big how small<br>was it so I let you yes a little bit and<br>sort of pick up on where Andrew Maynard<br>was talking about with them ever series<br>on housing end as a culture how we view<br>it and primarily in Western culture<br>review housing as a commodity and we go<br>back to how this come to arise it's<br>through politics and we've had 30 to 40<br>years of the neoliberal agenda of<br>viewing housing as a commodity and the<br>separation of housing not being too<br>little delivered or part of the<br>government and as really is open to the<br>market and it's really important to note<br>that the market has never solved<br>a housing problem if you look at<br>countries overseas and Scandinavia<br>France and Switzerland they have<br>fantastic alternative models where for<br>example nearly 50 percent regime you<br>rinse and they leave the scene of zero<br>its population living<br>a cooperative housing model so and and<br>really this means that we live in a<br>society where as I fix we are clients of<br>developers and you the bottom line is<br>how many how many housing how many units<br>we get in one building and and that is<br>the two people on that model primarily<br>and you end up with a triple tree and<br>disorientated Kota sex and yeah and also<br>you we look we know we know about the<br>homelessness and this is what this is<br>one of the outcomes are viewing housing<br>like that's and it's also we have we<br>live in a society where there's now the<br>working poor where we live in a low wage<br>economy and there's this desire to get<br>on the property ladder but you can't<br>afford to pay your mortgage and you've<br>got two or three kids and one wants to<br>stay at home apparently so it's all<br>pretty grim my brother this is Sean on<br>the left<br>he lived in Japan for almost three years<br>and I went over to see him a couple of<br>times and took him on a tour of my<br>favorite projects by so Fujimoto and<br>sauna and takemitsu azuma this is his<br>tower house which is a beautiful example<br>of a in the footprint as 20 square<br>meters as fast there is high that's<br>where he worked and he lived with his<br>wife and daughter so beautiful examples<br>like this of really intense micro<br>housing which is just designed for your<br>needs and any image in the photo is this<br>apartment which is sort of a typical<br>check our apartment where I think it's<br>25 30 square meters and you you would<br>have to hang up as much hanging over as<br>beard and yeah you just want to adapt<br>but Andrew may know it's in yeah it is<br>sort of an humane to cram people it's<br>these tiny houses because and he's<br>writers to a degree we do we have to we<br>have to live smaller we have to stop<br>building this mess of McMansions and<br>tiny housing isn't prevalent and there's<br>definitely cases where Tony housing<br>hasn't which everyone that's in the<br>media so it's important to yeah think<br>hard about what you what you really need<br>and what you don't need and yeah<br>building within your means so it's<br>really sad to think about its at<br>sketching volume is incredibly important<br>and one thing that kind of arose out of<br>them doing these sketches is that you<br>taking the idea that you could um you're<br>sleeping end living could be sort of one<br>space not too dissimilar to have a have<br>they lived in Tokyo and so the top plan<br>is I guess I guess the ground level<br>which is the kitchen dining area with<br>the bathroom at the back and then you go<br>up to oh yeah sorry there's some storage<br>cells which above that as he the pitch<br>room and the idea that you would later<br>they would fold up the beard a futon bed<br>and that then transforms into an<br>extended living space which is shown in<br>and then above that is a small resident<br>user named and storage space which could<br>also be another hangout zone as well so<br>it's sort of you to do it win cool house<br>diagram to get compartmentalize the<br>different programs so it is about it is<br>about maximizing your volume and the<br>volume is your biggest immunity if<br>you're going to look small so a little<br>bit more detail on the construction<br>there's two ways you can build a tiny<br>house and that is within the two point<br>five meter width which is that's all to<br>care about dimensions and if you go past<br>that so the next time you go to point<br>one meters wide<br>that's thing classified as a live load<br>and it means that you have to take the<br>tiny house has to be able to be taken<br>off the trailer<br>woodie's and this actually works and in<br>fact because you can take house off and<br>then put it on piles in the future and<br>often the way it'll be done is this is<br>done is by building a second fully<br>galvanized steel trailer which is gonna<br>add your costume it also slightly it<br>does raise the level of the house so you<br>know Steve that further into it so<br>actually a friend of mine at Wellington<br>has like this where that top deck is<br>so so 190 joists India all individually<br>bolted to the trailer so of course it's<br>a little bit cumbersome when it comes<br>around to taking the tiny house off the<br>trailer go around them involved every<br>single one but yeah we save money and<br>it's lighter too so there's a three and<br>a half ton weight limit to the tiny<br>husband's you go beyond this and you<br>need to get it towed by a larger vehicle<br>so then we filled in the gaps with one<br>stone for an installation that's agreed<br>and then over the plywood dick over<br>there to which we then used to sit out<br>the framing the wall framing and just<br>one by one building them on the deck and<br>then directing them and then the frames<br>are tied a lot of legs are tied down<br>just bolted through the top take you and<br>they go that didn't quite realize that<br>we needed more bracing so we went<br>through and added a whole lot of dragon<br>ties and a lot more logging and in the<br>building grab on scaffolders your<br>different gonna need to step up if you<br>don't have somewhere to yeah you've got<br>a cabbage seed or something yeah it's<br>really really helpful<br>I mean joy health and safety wise as<br>well so there we are cutting getting the<br>courgette without any EMS and yeah and<br>adding way too much yes it is heal<br>rather wonders and yeah so we did the<br>cladding and the window joinery that's<br>all it was all Clara corrugated steel<br>and we try to we team to do this all<br>ourselves with and so during the process<br>I definitely have a<br>that was stated for middle rivers and<br>it's a real craft actually and you<br>realize that there's a number of tools<br>that you need which you just you can't<br>back out from your dad's garage so the<br>left-hander you ever lived and image is<br>yeah I guess the wall must have had a<br>result of weed requestor cladding it and<br>then we had one the guys come around<br>that was measuring up the flashings and<br>he took a bit of a look at our flesh he<br>said it's Tiffany not waterproof men so<br>we yeah yeah start from the scratch<br>where she we hired some contractors to<br>come in and finish the cladding to great<br>expense but it's important listen and<br>you did account now drew that everything<br>by yourself even even if you're trying<br>to save money so there's a classic a<br>particular relationship I would see my<br>dad these these sketches and glanced<br>over it quite literally and take out as<br>big Tim but now it and just start<br>working the frame to get it squared but<br>the lesson is that you really do need to<br>seek out a few if you're not sure it's<br>it's it's really important to know to<br>seek the people the right people for<br>advice and then yes so on the left hand<br>side was something yes Riddler's edited<br>for my brother in Scotland and on the<br>right hand side of course the house<br>looking at the moment so we've just had<br>the literate stone and the plumbing done<br>thanks Liam Liam McRoberts and so I'm<br>just escape this and then our next our<br>next speakers Helen Jarvis and Ellen see<br>although everyone um my name is Helen<br>and this is Alan and give you a little<br>bit of background information on us um I<br>graduated great with a graphic design<br>degree from Unitec and in 2013 about six<br>months after that we started a digital<br>fabrication studio together on K Road<br>called Mike shop we do laser cutting<br>large format printing CNC 3d printing<br>that sort of thing we started with a<br>student base because we've just<br>graduated and we knew a lot of students<br>and for most of our customers and then<br>we slowly merged into architectural<br>firms coming in artists and you know<br>hey everyone my name is Alan so I<br>studied a batch of picture and masses<br>here and oh hi Nene then I graduated in<br>2016 so the reason why we're here today<br>to talk to you guys is because we had<br>going tiny we're going to go to tiny<br>house and the reason why we're going to<br>build a tiny house was bigger Sam allows<br>us to have creative control over the<br>design and also it allows us gives us<br>opportunity to build it ourselves which<br>we are and also it's also affordable<br>solution to the prices of housings these<br>days so that's why and um so just<br>running just want to see a show of hands<br>for anyone who is currently building or<br>interested in learning designing a tiny<br>house just saw that hi cope with this<br>awesome so hopefully I'll talk here<br>today will be on insightful about<br>legalities in our design you know and<br>also inspiring so I just handed back to<br>Helena she'll be talking about the<br>legalities cool so I'm going to run you<br>through legalities of tiny houses and<br>then Ellen's going to speak to you about<br>our design so just to put the legalities<br>and context because I will be speaking<br>about legalities within the content<br>of all design um this is a little line<br>about tiny house and this is the slide<br>for our tiny house so this site is my<br>grandma's front garden you know and so<br>we can afford some land a pivot in<br>Auckland so we're back from the road<br>it's a great little site it's very<br>private<br>although we do have five neighbors who<br>we have been very nice to alright so the<br>three main things I'm going to be<br>talking to you about is results concerns<br>building consent and Road legal vehicles<br>so I'm going to talk to you about the<br>legalities that surround this it's<br>really just like a springboard for you<br>guys to go out and do research if you're<br>interested in doing a tiny house or<br>these are gonna provide you with some<br>helpful insights into what you might<br>need to look into so it's not what<br>results consumed so resource consent is<br>the official commission to carry out an<br>operation that has environmental impact<br>so when you're putting a tiny house on a<br>site you most likely will require<br>results consent or that you may need to<br>approach the council about resource<br>consent would you just fly under the<br>radar but um so resource consent in<br>terms of a tiny house is dependent on<br>many factors so this zoning of your site<br>and these things like coastal erosion if<br>you near the closed or you know these<br>specific things like just how much room<br>you need outside your front window so<br>and the best place to start is the<br>unitary plan if you have a site in mind<br>you can look it up on the unitary plan<br>on the mmm but basically this shows you<br>what zone your site will be in and each<br>of these zone has zones have different<br>requirements or they tell you how many<br>dwellings you can have per site that<br>sort of thing so is a few different<br>zones we're in the next house Suburbans<br>are okay and just to be clear so within<br>the resource consent and the unitary<br>plan a tiny house is considered to be a<br>building or dwellings so results consent<br>and building consent have two different<br>definitions of what a building is<br>with in resource consent your tiny house<br>is considered to be a building so these<br>are some of the considerations from the<br>unitary plan that we have had to<br>consider with an outside things like<br>building height and relation to boundary<br>outlook space yeah that controls length<br>hip area so these are some of the<br>regulations that are set out to make<br>sure that the space on your site is used<br>correctly and that your neighbors are<br>not getting you know shadowing or<br>anything from your building um other<br>things that were considered in our<br>resource consent when we talked to the<br>council were things like flood plains<br>land instability coastal storm water<br>areas and so this this is our actual<br>actual result from the council and they<br>said that basically we do not need a<br>resource consent which was very good so<br>this is our site with the considerations<br>of the unitary plan so we have a height<br>in relation to boundary area which is<br>about two metres from all of the fences<br>our outlook space which is 6 meters by 4<br>meters outside our main I mean living<br>here in and then we've got three minutes<br>or three minutes outside our main<br>bedroom area all right so building<br>consents this is the evil but I know<br>houses so building can send us the<br>formal provo granted by a building<br>consent authority for building works and<br>it basically means that your building<br>must meet the code building regulations<br>and the New Zealand Building Act and so<br>this is a great area in terms of tiny<br>houses mostly because the council and<br>church interprets the boating act quite<br>differently from how we tiny house<br>builders interpret it so to be clear and<br>this this area gets a bit confusing so<br>I'll go into in more detail but<br>according to the building act 2004 a<br>vehicle is a building if it meets both<br>of the following criteria that it is a<br>movable and occupied by people on a<br>permanent or long-term basis so if it<br>does not meet both of those criteria as<br>many tiny houses<br>it is also considered to be a building<br>and therefore it will be exempt from the<br>building code building consents and<br>development contributions which is what<br>we want all right so this is a<br>determination this is a this is a<br>diagram from determination and a<br>determination is a final kind of ruling<br>on whether or not a tiny house as a<br>vehicle or building you can access<br>determinations online basically if the<br>council comes to you and they say this<br>tiny house is a building you say no it's<br>a vehicle you can go to this Authority<br>which will grant you a determination to<br>determine whether or not it is a vehicle<br>or building so the first thing to<br>consider is is it a vehicle in terms of<br>most tiny houses they are built on<br>trailers they're on wheels they can move<br>the drone or propelled by mechanical<br>power so majority of tiny houses yes<br>they are a vehicle if it is a vehicle<br>then you need to consider two criteria<br>and section 8 1 b3 of the building act<br>which is is it a moveable and is it<br>occupied by people on a long-term basis<br>so basically for it to be considered a<br>building it needs to meet both of these<br>criteria if it already meets one of<br>these criteria and it is not considered<br>a building and therefore it is exempt<br>from the Building Code and all of the<br>costs associated with building consents<br>and etc the biggest things a joke and<br>best advice I can give you if you are<br>building a tiny house or if you're<br>thinking about it just love your<br>neighbor bake them cookies get to know<br>them talk to them about what you're<br>doing because these are the people<br>around you that are most likely to call<br>the council and complain and so you<br>really want to be on the good side um<br>serve Road legal vehicles all right<br>these are defined by the New Zealand<br>Transport Agency and basically tiny<br>houses are often built either on a light<br>trailer or they're built on a light<br>trailer with it<br>a dimension load all right so light<br>trailers these are the easiest to define<br>as vehicles if you are fighting on the<br>council this is the route you want to<br>take what do you think you might have a<br>nasty neighbor so basically a light<br>trailer has maximum what's up 2.5 5<br>meters maximum links of 12.5 maximum<br>height of 4.3 and in maximum weight of<br>3.5 tons through grant functions is the<br>clincher for tiny houses because it is<br>very hard to stay within that weight<br>limit so some people want to go a little<br>wider than the 2.5 by because you know<br>you just want a bit of extra what<br>doesn't feel like a car door and so the<br>beast width to go to after that is up to<br>3.1 wife so this requires no pilot<br>vehicle and no permit basically you're<br>able to do this if likely and see if it<br>is considered a load on a trailer so it<br>must be detachable from the trailer all<br>right so if you are interested in doing<br>a tiny house or building or looking at a<br>site that you are potentially interested<br>in putting a tiny house on I would<br>recommend probably take a photo of this<br>and go to all these websites to do a<br>little bit more digging so check your<br>zone and the resource consent<br>considerations for your specific site<br>familiarize yourself with the wording of<br>section 8 one of the building act 2004<br>check previous determinations by the<br>mbae so basically just search vehicle in<br>the determination section and you'll get<br>a heap of determinations some with<br>positive outcomes some with negative<br>outcomes I'm looking for the limitations<br>of trailers and loads fact sheet 13 D in<br>53 a on the New Zealand Transport<br>agency's website and establish a good<br>relationship with your neighbors all<br>right<br>so for the design about tiny house we<br>wanted to push the boundaries of<br>standard tiny house aesthetic through a<br>form and materiality so for our trailer<br>we went with a three by nine removable<br>deck trailer so it's actually built so<br>the deck is removable so we went with<br>this size because we've actually stayed<br>in a few tiny houses for sure roughly<br>about two point five by seven meters and<br>um personally we thought that was a bit<br>too small for us so that's why I went<br>with three by nine and this trailer in<br>particular weighs about one ton total<br>and so you can probably tell that<br>keeping to that 3.5 time limit was a<br>tiny house build on a lightweight<br>trailer it's going to be quite<br>challenging but so technically our<br>trailer has three axles but this photo<br>showed on this image shows any two so I<br>can actually support up to four point<br>five times but we're going to trial<br>Pearce this day to the three point five<br>time limit which is um sit by the NZTA<br>the news and Transport Agency and as<br>you're probably aware that the limited<br>was not intended to accommodate the<br>weight of the house world so we're going<br>to be building our tiny house out of<br>structurally insulated panels sandwich<br>panels or set panels for short so step<br>panel has consists of a core which is a<br>foam typically EPS or PU sandwiched<br>between two bits of wood or metal in our<br>case we're going to go with some<br>aluminium skin set panels because<br>they're the lightest option because we<br>go on 3 by 9 we have to be quite<br>strategic with the materials were used<br>because that could get quite heavy<br>pretty quickly<br>and also you can see it on the bottom<br>there that shows that the weight of like<br>a traditional timber frame building was<br>cladding compared to having inset panel<br>building at size 10 point 8 by 3 meters<br>by 3.5 is roughly like five times wider<br>than it in a typical semi frame hospital<br>so for our design we wanted to in theory<br>we want to keep saying minimal and<br>effective to allow it to feel spacious<br>while still being quite practical as a<br>living space so Ontario and consists of<br>very few very few boat elements so you<br>see there's not much much built elements<br>inside and so we created that utility<br>hub which tells us the fridge the pantry<br>the kitchen storage the bathroom<br>cupboard and a back door sort room and<br>because this utility cupboard is not<br>full height it also doubles as a like a<br>floor serving high space beside them<br>user name date and sport accessing the<br>wardrobe and underfloor storage and it's<br>also kind of like a changing area and<br>for the mezzanine we've raised the floor<br>to achieve a second bit to integrate and<br>some underfloor storage because in a<br>tiny house nice space is quite key so<br>you want to utilize the spaces like just<br>evening as possible and effective as<br>possible and you can see that moving<br>between floors we have chose to go with<br>stairs as opposed to let us put some<br>because of practicality also because we<br>go on fire three metres wide we had the<br>space to do it comfortably we also<br>designed the stairs to be<br>multifunctional so you can see them with<br>ergonomic Lee tweaked the stairs between<br>the mid floor and the mezzanine<br>so also be like a reading or course<br>space to sit and just use your laptop<br>and also this stairs has built-in<br>storage so that then again the site may<br>being fitted with the space you have and<br>so living our kitchen flows into the<br>living living area which is all<br>double-height space and you can see in<br>the back there there's a bit of<br>screening there which sippers right so<br>zones what still allows the space to<br>feel open and connected so with them<br>with the roof design we went quite<br>unconventional we enjoy this take over<br>gable roof but we like that practicality<br>to a flat roof so after a few iterations<br>you can see there we managed to come up<br>with a hybrid<br>roofline which satisfies three minimum<br>degrees runoff which starts as a cable<br>at the double high end but merges and<br>graduates to a flattening at the<br>mezzanine end so yeah with the brook<br>being homogeneous layer you can get the<br>same language inside with the ceiling so<br>you get this sort of beautiful<br>undulating quality of geometric facets<br>which we hope will create an intriguing<br>and intriguing an interesting space to<br>be living in inside the tiny house so in<br>terms of the spatial arrangement we have<br>double height space with the living<br>areas we want to be open and facilitate<br>social gatherings and is a social<br>interaction space but as you move<br>towards the back that recedes to a more<br>quiet and intimate how could this kind<br>of space for the Beecher<br>so yeah that's our tiny house design and<br>hopefully we provided some helens and<br>provide us some insightful information<br>and inspired some of you to think of<br>tiny houses as a viable option option<br>and as for housing and we're going to be<br>documented documenting the whole process<br>so yeah if you're interested feel free<br>to like follow us on Instagram and<br>maintains it yeah thanks and yeah feel<br>so thank you you're Helen and hello and<br>the spring so our next speaker is the<br>one helpfully labeled fast-forward<br>presentation all right<br>baccarat cubic Otto katoa my name is<br>peeps and like the last two I built a<br>tiny house we do and but before I get<br>into that story<br>I needed a sort of reframe need to tell<br>another story just to sort of frame the<br>problem now everyone knows about the<br>homelessness crisis that's going on<br>through New Zealand I mean it's been<br>through in the media for the last couple<br>of years and but the degree of that is<br>probably not so clear to runner out and<br>the homelessness we have currently 1% of<br>our population is homeless and that's<br>increasing between 2006 and 2013 and<br>these old population grew by 5% that the<br>homelessness population grew by 25% and<br>and the the current rate of homelessness<br>in New Zealand is the worst that we've<br>seen since World War two in those days<br>they set up a tenth village and the<br>domain to deal with it because it was an<br>emergency and we've kind of a similar<br>situation it's not getting better and<br>but like that the wider housing problem<br>there are many factors to deal with<br>different ways that we need to sort of<br>work out various social and health<br>problems etc and and the government sort<br>of working away<br>to deal with it and well would like to<br>thank and but they've just announced the<br>only last week 200 million to contribute<br>towards dealing with this epidemic we<br>have and which is amazing because it is<br>actually the single largest investment<br>and homelessness that we've ever seen in<br>this country and that's great and and<br>then we look talking council and I mean<br>they're there but they're relying more<br>on the there hasn't been a situation<br>which was actually set up by government<br>and the housing first policy their<br>housing first model it's it's great it's<br>good it's sort of really just in giving<br>people off the streets of it but even<br>they agree that leaders failings and the<br>main failings they don't have enough<br>houses and it's like the rest of us like<br>key we build then we can't build them<br>fast enough we don't have enough houses<br>and we need houses to put these homes<br>people into so we took matters into our<br>house and we go to house ourselves on<br>it started with a small group of us and<br>working with the Oakland Housing<br>Association and we got together to<br>design and build a house and and we use<br>palm tree labor we started building in<br>in Austin junior college using the air<br>workshop we prefabricated all the walls<br>and set it all up and then we transport<br>it to a vacant piece of council land<br>which is conveniently located right next<br>to the medical police station and and we<br>got about 50 skill I mean over a couple<br>days he had about 50 skilled and<br>unskilled volunteers he came in and<br>helped us build I think he's at least<br>one of the volunteers currently in here<br>today and and it was it was a great time<br>great community to ever see here we came<br>together we sort of make together we<br>laugh together it was it was good and<br>and so the whole idea was was conceived<br>to show that we can address the<br>homelessness crisis through community<br>and innovative solutions we can actually<br>come together this is our problem we can<br>solve it together and so we we work<br>together and and so just moving to the<br>design of it okay and it was a tweeted<br>in square meter house and which<br>unfortunately we couldn't do because of<br>the nature of the tenants and the people<br>living and the homeless people we<br>couldn't really they didn't really have<br>a huge amount of storage but we also can<br>use the innovative sort of storing<br>solutions that just wouldn't work with<br>the type of people that going through<br>there they would they're not know the be<br>state of mind at that stage in their<br>life and but we we have 27 square meter<br>building which is designed as a<br>temporary solution people it's just it's<br>the same location for people to come off<br>the streets get them back on their feet<br>and then get out into the the proper<br>housing market and you'll find that it<br>will be different tenants coming through<br>that we and it young women teenagers who<br>have come up straight to a mother and a<br>couple kids to a couple and it can house<br>a quite a range of people and the you<br>can see we're going to<br>which is allowed for reconfiguration a<br>kitchen dining bathroom and an exterior<br>storage exterior services sir corner<br>which is designed so that the people<br>managing the tenants I can also manage<br>and deal with all the services because<br>it's actually reading your high tech and<br>the house is portable on chassis big<br>warm wheels although perks like that she<br>wasn't and and we we used a lot of<br>single tick to try to and trying to make<br>their houses autonomous as possible and<br>the the idea was to being that if it was<br>moved around if it was sort of if it<br>needs to be a good shuffle everywhere<br>it's not dependent on the grid it's not<br>dependent on connecting into things it<br>can run off the solar panels and the gas<br>calif on Sarah and we also we built with<br>the tenants in mind<br>unfortunately we built with fly<br>interiors but that was in case things<br>get damaged we also gave configuration<br>for people to be able to read modify it<br>to make it take a bit more ownership of<br>it prior to the house and we've got<br>furniture from understand English the<br>students book furniture and we did this<br>all with a budget of 50 K and the idea<br>is that it serves as an example of<br>prefabrication techniques of sustainable<br>technologies of community coming<br>together to solve the problem and and as<br>I said that the house is just a<br>temporary solution it's a stopgap but<br>it's the air as a five year solution to<br>be the brunt of the worst of the crisis<br>going on at the moment while other<br>social factors Gibbs though you resolved<br>just to get people off the street as<br>much as we can and so the house was<br>originally conceived as a demonstration<br>demanding more from our governments and<br>be it local or central to address the<br>situation and so what that means we had<br>we had three calls to the dream that<br>three goals first one was to build a<br>house and we were successful that it was<br>a house that can<br>actually housed homeless people and it<br>is buildable by other local communities<br>by far now all across the country it's a<br>reasonably easy copy and paste sort of<br>situation sure you have to alter to deal<br>with coastal areas and so forth which<br>previous presenters pointed out but<br>there is a lot of things you can just<br>sort of reconfigure and we the second<br>goal was we wanted to counsel the come<br>to the table this is the big one we<br>needed the key one the key areas with<br>housing in Oakland is land and all<br>through our city there's a whole lot of<br>land there Oakland council iron spear<br>through different out to be able can<br>transport Pinnochio etc that is<br>currently being not used it's zoned for<br>for future developments for future<br>project transport projects but it's not<br>currently being used at the moment and<br>and some of it doesn't even have a<br>future a future designation and so we're<br>asking look can we just put down houses<br>on there for a couple of years they can<br>be shipped away can we sort of house<br>people bit can we can you come to the<br>table and help us and we were also<br>asking council to who also come to the<br>table with some of the consenting and<br>connection issues and but these<br>different ways of getting around there<br>and the third thing is we wanted to<br>inspire inspire working people to sort<br>of have a run at us themselves and and<br>be innovative to work out solutions and<br>and you can see was the tiny houses<br>we've got here it said on display<br>tonight people are trying to think of<br>solutions to their housing crisis and<br>these are the things that we want Alice<br>just show you the market is Liam pointed<br>out isn't solving the crisis we kind of<br>need to come together as individuals and<br>do it as well and so what's happened<br>since and we moved the house to<br>tepui Amaro and where they're using it<br>to the house famous people they're going<br>to set up at a moment with simmer into<br>cottages that they've got government<br>funding for and I don't know if you guys<br>know about them but they were quite<br>vocal and quite big advocates a couple<br>years back about the homeless situation<br>where they were literally taken down<br>and housing because it's the accurate<br>app community and that said you did to<br>do so it's alright<br>and so we've given it to them we've<br>donated like we we don't give it to<br>Mookie finished it's it's taking a bit<br>of work with a lot of volunteers just<br>finishing it up at the last stages and<br>you can see me sort of shoveling very<br>gracefully and but it needs to be done<br>and and so this was our prototype and it<br>was a proven success that it worked and<br>we are looking to scale up we were<br>looking for a teen in the first year and<br>moving up to the program and we accepted<br>a hundred or so a year if required and<br>now the the Oakland homeless survey that<br>was undertaken last year found there<br>were eight hundred rough sleepers on the<br>streets at the moment and the scale<br>which is actually worse but that's just<br>what's in the on the streets and now if<br>we if we had even a dozen of these units<br>slowly circulating through those numbers<br>we make a significant dent pretty<br>quickly<br>and so that's all the text it just needs<br>to get these people off the streets and<br>and so we got this house the government<br>we talked to them I had good phone calls<br>with Dave Parker and Twyford and so<br>forth and they were very excited they<br>liked the idea there's this risk going<br>we've talked to people underneath them<br>they're excited and and so we we move<br>forward and we we tended we found the<br>contractor who could build these things<br>with on budget pre consented and they<br>also I couldn't scale it up to us<br>because we need it they also used person<br>workers to go to upskill them to get<br>them at rate when they leave prison<br>which is a win-win it was working out<br>that way and we had a project management<br>firm lined up we had engineers light up<br>everyone was sitting there almost it<br>sort of girl on us they're all it was<br>all budget it and likewise were in place<br>to manage the tenants when they come<br>through everything's going and and we<br>wrote our business cases in at the<br>government and of that 200 million that<br>I spoke earlier about a hundred and oh<br>one million of that was the unite Pross<br>through you<br>housing mystery of Housing and Urban<br>Development we got our money we got the<br>budget we can build the houses<br>everything was ready to go for the<br>houses to be rolled out in time for the<br>winter but but remember when I talked<br>about our open capsule despite a lot of<br>meetings our council and a couple of<br>conscience meetings of ask rossabi and<br>so forth<br>unfortunately there was the response the<br>final answer there kind of got them it<br>doesn't fall within their strategic aim<br>you know you're not being brave to sort<br>of try to work with us on this and I<br>mean council with its own planning<br>meeting on the on the 5th of March they<br>he the you know they voted in the<br>meeting to intervene and lead and the<br>hostess situation they're currently I<br>don't know they're doing it and and so<br>we're asking for a political leadership<br>from them and to fulfill a role in the<br>build up proposal I mean we've been<br>working with them and but we just want<br>leadership and and if it was if it was a<br>budgetary issue I would understand their<br>reluctance I mean but they're not<br>providing money they just need a sort of<br>come to the table it doesn't cost them<br>anything and so at the moment it's just<br>about where political leaders put the<br>emphasis what what their priorities are<br>and so look we can address the homeless<br>crisis with innovation with different<br>solutions we can do it but where does<br>that leave us now we'll all be white do<br>we go back to the demonstrating and<br>demanding more Arab leaders and I think<br>that's a good thing we should always do<br>that and or do we go back to the<br>building houses on council that and<br>doing it illegally because if I had my<br>way again I would list know me longer<br>Thank You Pete local government election<br>high I might sit out home tonight to the<br>pages hi I'm tom hi I'm Tommy honey we<br>go mean it's great to be here this<br>evening and as you can see I hate tiny<br>houses but more about that later let's<br>start with the granny flat particularly<br>the confluence of semantics and<br>regulation granny flat is the term for<br>an accessory building placed on a<br>homeowner's site usually to accommodate<br>one of the owners parents or<br>grandparents their children hence the<br>use of the word granny its first known<br>use was in 1965 prior to that we kept<br>our parents closer to us and allowed<br>them inside the house the rise of the<br>nuclear family post-war led to the<br>stratification of generations and the<br>presence of grandparents in the house<br>was a trick to the nucleus at the same<br>time planners such as they were and<br>politicians feared intensification and<br>the idea that people might profit from<br>their land the thought of a second<br>dwelling on a site threatened the<br>quarter-acre dream of one site one house<br>the planning solution was to create<br>regulations for an accessory building so<br>constrained that no reasonable person<br>would want to rip one<br>but we will have no complexion housing<br>our parents in one fortunately we are<br>more compassionate towards older people<br>now perhaps we've moved them out of the<br>house and how we moved out of the<br>backyard into retirement homes which are<br>really just a collection of granny flats<br>dead together with the talk so janky<br>behaviour drove need which led to<br>regulation designed not to permit these<br>behaviors and needs but constrain and<br>control them so it was and still is<br>regulation lags behind social change and<br>lingers like a big fish on a summer's<br>day and we gone oh I may need the tiny<br>house movement as a reaction to these<br>lingering regulations and it looks for a<br>loophole big enough to drive a house<br>truck through and lands literally on<br>wheels to avoid compliance with council<br>rules and regulations as we've heard<br>already you put your tiny house on<br>wheels which defines it as relocatable<br>or removable but critical consequence of<br>this wheeled independence is the impact<br>it has on the design of the house<br>particularly its width given that<br>they're designed to move on rows they're<br>usually constraint or width of less than<br>three meters after as we've heard and<br>for me this gives rise to spatial<br>solutions that their owners claim our<br>compact but I think our reality just<br>foolish the layout of the rooms or<br>activities become linear and difficult<br>to navigate or traverse for millennia<br>our domestic architecture has taught us<br>that rooms should be designed around<br>people in their interactions tiny houses<br>are designed around the width of a row<br>a floor plan of sits by seven meters is<br>habitable I say 1/3 by 15 is not play me<br>houses in the house trucks of the new<br>millennium for people who can't afford<br>to live in a potato for me I'm not<br>interested in tiny houses that do an end<br>run around regulation and create a<br>roll-on/roll-off off-grid solution in<br>the middle of the grid of the city if<br>that's you go to your life compost your<br> to your heart's content<br>mine's headed down a pipe to a service<br>prompt I am interested in living small I<br>am interested in backyards and I love<br>prevail I'm also curious about why<br>there's been no real disruption in<br>housing and I'm concerned about the<br>rising cost of land and the housing<br>equation so how can we disrupt housing<br>Luther makes use of an underutilized<br>asset a guy on the couch for the county<br>Gary Airbnb makes use of an<br>underutilized room in your house where<br>is the underutilized land in the city<br>apart from golf courses backyards every<br>home has one how can we access this land<br>without pilot we lease it slim B stands<br>for shared living in my backyard slumpy<br>places a prefabricated house on land at<br>least from a homeowner the hosts<br>funded by an external investor and<br>tenants with a suitable tenant the<br>resident and this is how it works<br>slowy connects the potential users users<br>and manages the process of delivering<br>the prefab the host and investor have a<br>commercial lease the investor and the<br>resident have a residential lease<br>well then what's the problem here it is<br>the solution the high cost of land is<br>mitigated through a flexible lease<br>process that prevents the source from<br>established off-site manufacturers in<br>New Zealand last year prepared means it<br>held the snug competition competition<br>for a prepare that could go on a back<br>yard in Auckland there were 86 entries<br>12 finalists and six winners you can see<br>all profiles on the snack website and<br>they're great is a fantastic innovative<br>designs here because the challenge of<br>building small and slim B is no<br>exception is the dead weight of<br>regulation can get pointy-headed here<br>now there are two development fees if<br>you're building permanently under sight<br>nor on wheels that you have to take into<br>account and all that for all new bills<br>water care charges an infrastructure<br>growth charge the ITC in the<br>metropolitan area this is a flat fee of<br>a livin thousand six hundred and eighty<br>dollars reduced by a third if your<br>dwelling is less than 65 square metres<br>so I'm looking here at two houses one<br>that could be a million dollar<br>development or once $100,000 so ten<br>times different so if you've got a<br>million-dollar house the fee is about<br>1.2 percent of the cost of your house<br>but if you've got a hundred K prefab<br>under 65 square metres that will be<br>seven thousand eight hundred or seven<br>point eight percent of the cost of your<br>house that only drops fire theory you<br>must also pay a development contribution<br>to Auckland Council Council which is on<br>a step scale for a million dollar houses<br>is around 28 thousand or 2.8 percent and<br>so if you're a hundred K grief ad it's<br>about half that thirteen thousand or<br>thirteen percent so the total<br>development fees for you million dollar<br>house is about three pin point eight<br>percent of your cost but if you want to<br>build small before you're out of the<br>gate you're up to $21,000 seventeen<br>percent of the cost of your house of<br>your project Sippi for the right to<br>build even before resource or building<br>consents<br>it's such a perverse disincentive to<br>build small<br>but slippy the project business I had<br>that money actually has to be paid by<br>either the homeowner or the investor and<br>then recovered from the tenant which<br>pushes the rent up and that's not the<br>goal<br>so what we're addressing these<br>challenges with slum B we're exploring I<br>just the scratch you can actually see<br>the difference in the the scale of those<br>development fees on the lift the million<br>dollar on the right the hundred K one so<br>let's let me we're exploring other ideas<br>that we might be able to spin off I call<br>them the slum be descendants this moves<br>the idea it's a slightly different<br>territory forget the one prefab on a<br>backyard why can't I put two or three<br>well regulation and Sonia of course but<br>it might be a way to do this civil war<br>find a zone where it could happen but<br>and doing this I've become really<br>interested and what I call micro<br>cohousing of about three to six dwelling<br>units now Co house English than very<br>well served by the speaker series<br>usually involves twelve to twenty<br>growlings<br>and it's often on new or cleared land<br>but if you use a site with an existing<br>house and just add a few small units the<br>proposition becomes much much more<br>interesting so what could you do<br>is that my time what could you do<br>intergenerational housing and this is<br>something I think that we're going to<br>start to see a lot more off you install<br>your ed up children and prefabs on your<br>backyard<br>the first one to have a family gets the<br>big house and the parents move into the<br>pre-game you could stretch the idea<br>further and have four prefabs catering<br>to extended family what I call the kind<br>of a suburban public hanging out but<br>what about and I've said this is my<br>favorite idea a DIY retirement village<br>it's a Boomer of an idea<br>sorry I only smoke less in the room now<br>the minimum number of units required by<br>legislation for a retirement village is<br>- yes so you could put one PDF in your<br>backyard call both of them a retirement<br>village and adhere to that legislation<br>and you're on your way<br>but what if you take four couples<br>approaching retirement they sell their<br>houses find a suitable property with a<br>modest existing house and a big backyard<br>I'm looking at you Ani hanger and build<br>for prefabs to live in each with their<br>own facilities the existing house is<br>confirmed to have a kitchen and dining<br>area for shared meals a library for the<br>collected books a screening room a spare<br>bedroom for grandchildren and other<br>visitors<br>Koen grandchildren and other visitors<br>we've gone this idea is so revolutionary<br>even Microsoft this might exceed four<br>minutes<br>we're drinking we're just going straight<br>due to 214 do you think document<br>McCaffrey my next kick-start of us about<br>how to solve this thing we if we let you<br>go to this happens I'm just going to<br>tell you the idea so I haven't got much<br>left anyway I'm really the air so and<br>the last room you'd have the medical<br>room in this this this house that you're<br>refitting and and in that someone who's<br>and look at him out of the prefabs who<br>might be greater care attention because<br>there Olga can get that on site without<br>having to go to a rest home or a hospice<br>or some other place and and to be able<br>to do that on site with in with living<br>close to the people that they have share<br>in the shared property is a huge value<br>you could you could even do two sites<br>together with two houses that puts six<br>prefabs on and enrich them the only<br>thing that stands between us and doing<br>yeah that's fine that's fine<br>the only thing stays between us is the<br>regulations that lag behind the social<br>change and urban designers and planners<br>great at following rules they're a<br>little nervous about changing them but<br>that's what we do come election time so<br>what we have to do is think about one of<br>the ways that we want to live and tell<br>the council and tell planners whatever<br>we want to do this and not that they<br>don't need to be scared of the changes<br>that we that we want to deliver so let's<br>stop giving our savings to rhymin and<br>MetLife here and instead give them to<br>each other let's change the world one<br>backyard at a time<br>we don't need wheels we need ideas<br>imagination innovation and intent thank<br>you<br>some so sorry you it doesn't live I<br>feel I feel I have weekend symposium<br>coming on in relation to not just tiny<br>houses but you know everything we've got<br>the government that is committed to<br>doing things at the moment<br>and they are doing good things but I<br>hope you'll have this secret very<br>stimulating in the sense that we need to<br>we couldn't get the barbecue player for<br>some reason so it's gonna be pretty big<br>in that might be offset and so we've got<br>time for a few questions for five<br>thank you very much so the question is<br>about what's happened if you don't<br>qualify to be poor enough as a homeless<br>or if you are not wealthy enough to buy<br>land and you are determined not to pay<br>rent personally I believe in two things<br>I bought an ambulance and the campervan<br>one is my dining room the other one is<br>my bedroom waiting for the right time to<br>come what I believe is an occupation and<br>determination but if anyone believes you<br>know that kind of activities or any<br>other solution I guess it's probably<br>going to me but the homeless that is a<br>hard solution I I can't even counsel in<br>terms of how they managed it but I would<br>say I mean you have to demand more I<br>mean if this is a this is the thing that<br>we we have it you've reiterated and a<br>few of our speeches<br>you could have demand more out of<br>Council in us and for what is possible<br>your honor you're in a tie bubble you're<br>in a middle ground here where you're not<br>poor enough to be on the street figure<br>you're not wealthy enough to field your<br>own house and this is a financial<br>situation I'm sure there are sort of<br>ways of going about this but I don't<br>know I'm not sure the solution there<br>let's get out there and actually build a<br>yes hi Tommy<br>could you elaborate a bit on the<br>arrangement that involves the commercial<br>reason there is an intial Reese and how<br>that is what advantages that has in<br>terms of regulations or otherwise sure<br>so the slim D model is slimmer global<br>essentially I discovered that if you<br>have a landlord has a million-dollar<br>house in Auckland and you rent it only<br>$200,000 that that is the house and if<br>you're the tenant your pain 80% of your<br>rent goes to that land and so I'm<br>interested in the rental situation so<br>the cost of land which goes back to<br>actually our previous speaker that's one<br>of the biggest barriers whether it's<br>land supply or regulation whatever it's<br>driving land cost up when you're when<br>your CV goes up it's not the house<br>that's increasing in value it's the land<br>so how do you mitigate that you lease it<br>so they've got to work out how to do<br>that so if you're gonna lease off<br>someone's backyard you only want a<br>portion of it you've got to define what<br>that is so the homeowner has a<br>commercial lease as you might remember I<br>think it's a maximum 35 years can lease<br>that land so that the only relationship<br>they have is about this commercial lease<br>for that land the investor becomes a<br>landlord and master outside peanut is<br>gonna live in that must be it comes<br>under the residential tenancy act you<br>cannot escape that unless it's a<br>retirement village so so the idea is<br>that the the ecosystem of slumpy are<br>both three parties so the tenant would<br>actually pay money to the slumpy website<br>within distributes it to the homeowner<br>and a lease cost they get a return on<br>their piece of land and the investor<br>gets a return on their money so that the<br>challenge is that the weekly tenants<br>rent has to cover both of those and that<br>investors money has to cover the cost of<br>the box so that's the picture of the way<br>it works and that's why the two leases<br>but the issues go in a slightly<br>different direction the regulatory ones<br>are there because of those compliance<br>costs before consents there are issues<br>around that banks get concerned about<br>having a second building on the property<br>and if the homeowner goes belly-up<br>they're gonna try and take that box away<br>that belongs to someone else so they're<br>you know let lawyers love this issue<br>because all they can see is disaster so<br>the bankers all they can see is an<br>opportunity so but but I don't want to<br>let them get in the middle of a great<br>idea okay<br>can I go back to the question over there<br>for a second um so in terms of the cost<br>of land you're talking about and you<br>don't want to rent necessarily and so<br>there have been some tiny hospitals that<br>are in New Zealand that have been very<br>low cost I think about $25,000 which I<br>mean it does seem like a lot but it's an<br>affordable amount compared to other<br>situations also talking to a lot of<br>people online they've been able to find<br>places to park their tiny house where<br>they don't actually have to pay at lease<br>or rent to park it on the land they just<br>do chores around the house so they keep<br>the maintenance of the land or they are<br>stock watches for cattle so basically<br>you can find cheapest solutions but it's<br>you just have to kind of put yourself<br>out there and ask around in those<br>community groups land or cut it in<br>see it as well this and cheaper rates on<br>there yeah so look into those stupid<br>solutions<br>and these are great projects if perhaps<br>there are not too many of them I just<br>wondered what would happen if it really<br>really took off as an idea about the<br>balance between green space and<br>impermeable surfaces if we're getting<br>rid of lots of gardens or indeed council<br>parkland how do you think about that and<br>why does the Peugeot where does the<br>Peugeot how does the plumbing work mines<br>it upon to answer your second point<br>mine was a it's chemical toilet and but<br>I agree that tiny houses aren't the<br>solution to our housing crisis we<br>shouldn't be sitting there panting tiny<br>houses on every backyard and every<br>possible solution I mean I agree with<br>like you're saying to me but it's not a<br>one solution for it's all there needs to<br>begin to needs to be other sort of<br>situations ours is an emergency<br>my project is is an emergency situation<br>it's it's five years just going in there<br>taking off the brunt of it clearing<br>their way we've got this land free and<br>these aren't I'm not saying put these<br>houses in the middle of the plain I mean<br>I'm not saying that there's is plenty of<br>little sort of Lots in the middle of<br>Kohler sex or next to railways or so<br>forth that are being used and you can<br>have like a community of sort of four or<br>five houses in an area that's safe and<br>easy yeah and yeah we've got a my<br>brother's got a compost in his so you<br>can check it on your video page but<br>Tommy has had it on my head where it's<br>crazy that we're building these tiny<br>houses we're building a part vehicle<br>part Welling just to get around these<br>rules and we do have to intensify and we<br>have juntines fire so intensely that we<br>have to live we're gonna be a little<br>closer together but these models where<br>we if we can bring together long term<br>tenure and safety of tenure a kept rent<br>as well which is a very real possibility<br>and it will be part of our the solution<br>to New Zealand housing surely just just<br>on the waste issue the composting<br>toilets wit for poo but there's a bigger<br>issue with gray water your sink your<br>shower the hand basin actually can<br>produce a lot more water to deal with<br>and you can't just pull that onto the<br>ground outside because it's either got<br>to go finding its way into the the<br>drainage system or you've got to have a<br>solution for that and that's often<br>overlooked and you might be okay if<br>you're in an area that is much less<br>populated but within an intensive urban<br>area you're actually more likely to get<br>tripped up on that then any of the other<br>issues you've solved I have a two-part<br>question both around cleaning loopholes<br>in Auckland specifically so my first<br>question is to only kids to answer it am<br>I correct and interpreting the<br>presentation as meaning that if one<br>meets the light trailer vehicle<br>requirement when can put a tiny house<br>pretty much anywhere one likes and my<br>second question is is our temporary<br>buildings also a loophole can I get<br>around<br>the plating restrictions by picking<br>one's building up every two years and<br>moving at 3 feet to speak to the tiny<br>houses specifically the ones that are on<br>wheels and you can move around you can<br>put them a lot of places but you do need<br>to adhere to the unitary plans so you do<br>have to have all those considerations I<br>mean people who park them in a driveway<br>in not adhering to the unitary plan and<br>if the council was to approach you and<br>say hey this is not working you're going<br>to need resource consent and you're not<br>working to the unitary plan and<br>personally I think it's better just to<br>work to what the regulations are so you<br>can't really pack it anywhere but you<br>can think about where you park it and<br>you can look at what the regulations are<br>to make sure that you know you know<br>yeah and it does depend some councils in<br>New Zealanders are telling it for<br>example is really conservative and<br>they've been up you know one with the<br>tiny house I've given them eviction<br>notices and finding them 350 a day sort<br>of thing so you yeah you've been to this<br>to um you could build executor like you<br>care of it<br>and it's exactly you can remove it as<br>you anytime you like<br>and also well with it's not exactly<br>built like a house as well so there's an<br>argument there where you haven't<br>followed through 604 and you followed<br>the caravan build guide and it's good<br>also to look at determinations so they<br>have been a lot of cases where people<br>have had a temporary building or you<br>know a removable structure but it's not<br>necessarily a vehicle before it's deemed<br>a boding and then you would need to work<br>to all of the consents so yeah have a<br>look at the determinations to see where<br>people have gone down the path where<br>there's no return and what has been<br>accepted</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
