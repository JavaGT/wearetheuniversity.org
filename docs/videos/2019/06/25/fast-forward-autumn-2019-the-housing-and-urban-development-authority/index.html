This semester we continue our focus on the question: How can we do medium density well? This series is proudly supported by GIB®.<br><br>The Housing and Urban Development Authority<br><br>Overseas, public urban development authorities have been prominent in the development of new city fringe housing areas and inner city ‘brownfield’ sites. The closest we have to this in Auckland is the Hobsonville Point development located on former air force land. Urban design agencies differ from private developments. They bear a stronger focus on the provision of affordable and social housing, as well as extra public spaces and a broader range of community facilities, such as schools. In 2018 the government announced the creation of the Housing and Urban Development Authority (HUDA). This initiative could become an essential game-changer for cities struggling to cope with housing shortages. Significantly, HUDA will have the capacity to: acquire land under the Public Works Act, override the Resource Management Act, council plans and processes, and consent its own projects.<br><br>--<br><br>For more information about our architecture, urban planning and urban design study options, visit our website: http://bit.ly/SoAPstudy<br><br>--<br><br>*Warning: this talk

together a bit of<br>an introduction and Hooda have supplied<br>a video it's a bit ropey but it's and<br>it's ten minutes long so you will see<br>okay so this is what we would have just<br>introduced so I think that the housing<br>and the urban design authority and as<br>well here shortly and they do have them<br>as close as Australia I think it's got<br>the potential to be a game-changer it<br>talks about working at scale and the<br>pace but what would that mean in terms<br>of establishing quality particularly<br>when we've got an environment where we<br>have a short term of government and<br>we've got a government that will be very<br>keen to get some runs on the board in<br>terms of housing so we have as most of<br>you know we have a new ministry and<br>Ministry of Housing and Urban<br>Development and within that ministry<br>we've got Kiwi build we've got housing<br>New Zealand and we will have the Housing<br>and Urban Development Authority so the<br>government's priorities for that<br>ministry you can see here and that's<br>worth having a look at the couple of<br>them building building affordable<br>housing through Kiwi built<br>establishing huda an urban development<br>agency increasing housing supply ending<br>homelessness progressing that urban<br>growth agenda to drive changes to the<br>urban land infrastructure planning<br>systems and that's signalling I think<br>that there's a bit more going on here<br>then just spoke a focus on housing in<br>the word Housing and Urban Development<br>Authority and we'll come back to that in<br>a map I should finish off that less<br>modernizing residential tenancy rules<br>that are will over true<br>when we were between houses my wife and<br>I rented for a year just the year before<br>last and it was amazing how many ways<br>you are made to feel like a second-class<br>citizen and then we have achieving<br>equitable outcomes for Mary etc and<br>monitoring demand for housing through<br>changes to text settings and we've seen<br>how that's worked in the past couple of<br>weeks so there is also an advisory group<br>for the minister and I thought you'd be<br>interesting and seeing who's on that so<br>this is an advisory group to the<br>ministry not necessarily who that<br>so Tina Hale Pennington who's CEO of the<br>Institute of Architects<br>she's also cheer Shama be or equal will<br>know an economist ro Hoskins runs his<br>partner and design tribe firm of<br>Architects urban designers Papa co-ed<br>designers and he also teaches at unique<br>school of architecture David Kelly CEO<br>Master Builders Andrew King New Zealand<br>property investors Federation someone<br>needs to help me here with the first<br>night loin a anyone know Li Li Li Li Oh<br>Lu - chief executive of that housing<br>trust pnina with a Pacific people's<br>focus Angela Maynard attendance<br>Protection Association mark Todd will<br>nod behind<br>akhom quite a successful medium rice<br>firm of developers Scott fergan Shore<br>community housing area raw and k7 Smith<br>from Center for Research evaluations<br>social assessment so there's a whole lot<br>of them of information out there there<br>are a couple of fact sheets and one<br>thing that lipped out there that we'll<br>talk about a little bit later as as I<br>mentioned before it may not just be<br>housing that whoo there focuses on so<br>you can see here types of projects on<br>which the Urban Development Authority<br>could focus include areas of regional or<br>national importance<br>so what could that mean could that could<br>mean almost anything areas where the<br>public owns significant land holdings<br>such as suburbs with a lot of housing<br>New Zealand land in there so that's<br>amalgamation of properties etc areas<br>where the government's investing<br>significantly in public services or<br>amenities<br>so that's health or educational<br>institutions so you know the hospitals<br>the stalls the politics the universities<br>all those spring to mind with the<br>Polytech merger I'd be interested to see<br>was what happens with a lot of land<br>there and and whether we get a repeat of<br>what's happened on the Unitec site we're<br>unique head virtually the whole site and<br>they've contracted down to a new<br>building in the center thus freeing up<br>areas for mixed use and for housing and<br>then in the city areas along new or<br>revitalized transport corridors etc<br>could that mean commercial development<br>as opposed to housing development in the<br>city brownfield areas underutilized<br>commercial and residential neighborhoods<br>and this is one of the big push areas<br>the brownfields working on those and of<br>course although who there has the power<br>to override plans such as the unitary<br>plan Auckland and most other studies<br>have been pushing have historically<br>grown by pushing out into green fields<br>and creating suburbs and sprawl and then<br>them underutilized areas where there's<br>potential for urban transformation so<br>I'll just come out and and then there is<br>a PDF that I've loaded up on here and<br>that's a bit more of a user friendly<br>Factory and I'll leave that we'll run<br>the video now that they've supplied and<br>then we'll come back to that in case we<br>want to just settle on the page or two<br>because there's a flowchart for health<br>development<br>work under there so I'll just escape<br>there and run this video for 9 minutes<br>and 15 seconds and you will notice that<br>9 minutes of 50 seconds so you can count<br>them down I have one too it's got a<br>slightly ropey voiceover you'll find out<br>but we're buying you all a drink at the<br>final session next week to make up for<br>that ok drinks and nibbles after tiny<br>houses right here we go I November 2018<br>the government announced it is<br>establishing the Housing and Urban<br>Development Authority or hodor hodor is<br>going to be a powerful new project with<br>a focus on contributing to thriving<br>resilient communities and axis jobs<br>transport nodes in green spaces they<br>need Toto have two key roles will be a<br>public housing landlord and it will need<br>urban development projects of all sizes<br>to create the hodor housing New Zealand<br>and its developments of Surrey a Chelsea<br>will be disestablished and their<br>functions and assets put into Hooda and<br>kiwi build functions and air seats will<br>also transfer from the Ministry of<br>Housing and Urban Development and Jared<br>oh why is the government establishing<br>Hodor the government wants me Zealanders<br>to love and well design people-focused<br>urban areas that are really for the<br>future and it is doing this by taking on<br>a hands-on approach to tackling key<br>challenges such as homelessness and<br>unaffordable housing that wants to<br>ensure much-needed<br>Urban Development housing infrastructure<br>is discuss is delivered at scale and<br>pace it also wants to make sure their<br>state housing tenants<br>to have world class services New<br>Zealand's urban areas are aging and<br>growing and more people are living in<br>our cities than ever before as a result<br>there's pressure on our housing sector<br>and this is undermining our ability to<br>sue state tenants with permanent<br>accommodation and also a traditional<br>model of expansion which has been<br>turning rural areas into housing is not<br>sustainable in the long term also some<br>overseas urban development authorities<br>are transforming urban areas and doing<br>key regeneration projects some prominent<br>examples are in Sydney and London<br>Docklands which includes the Canary<br>Wharf redevelopment the hooter will take<br>the current development master-planned<br>development<br>bought a new form of development to new<br>zealand we've also seen the transiently<br>developments at Newland and the<br>listeners with rune from The Temper Kiwi<br>generation we were technically very<br>large<br>over the extended period of time about<br>20 years but will the housing the Newman<br>Development Authority achieved well the<br>main objectives are to ban coordination<br>scale and pace government participation<br>land assembly then degraded anything who<br>will either intubated landlord to<br>development social housing in New<br>Zealand coordination and Stalin pace and<br>the participation of government and the<br>requirements to have a single really

shortly any more business<br>diffusion developments smaller average<br>mcgantry specify development projects<br>what are they what they will be large<br>and complex they will provide the access<br>to

pro quo of having access to the war<br>in neighboring statutory powers and will<br>be developed around strategic objectives<br>said early in the process at the time<br>the development project was first set up<br>and their strategic strategic objectives<br>will guide the planning process and<br>their delivery throughout the life of<br>the project they will be based around<br>their comprehensive development plan<br>that will be developed through a public<br>consultation process which includes a<br>the name of development powers provide<br>for shortened paintings or sealing<br>processes they will provide for the<br>delivery of infrastructure both inside<br>and outside the specified development<br>area they would provide funding<br>mechanisms for the infrastructure and<br>they will provide

working<br>with Maori Erie and Maori groups<br>particularly around urban development<br>projects and heard a water partner with<br>infrastructure providers through<br>infrastructure and cost sharing<br>agreements several key milestones in<br>terms of establishing houda were reached<br>in November last year when the minister<br>announced that it would be being<br>established in the disestablishment of<br>housing New Zealand a first bill to<br>establish holder will be introduced at<br>mid 2019 in pass this year and that will<br>enable holder to be up and running by<br>the end of the year and a second though<br>to empower who will be introduced in<br>late 2019 to be passed in 2020 and this<br>second bowl will look at things like the<br>specified development projects in a more<br>quite a long nine minutes 50 seconds so<br>now I'd like to call up professor of<br>architecture then it's 40 seconds that<br>we had here you can find the same thing<br>on the website if you google up just<br>like a couple of comments from me just<br>to provoke have some comic back from you<br>and that's something for the also to<br>respond to the first difficulty I had<br>with this document when I looked at it<br>this afternoon is that it talks about<br>who done I know has been a development<br>agency that's going to be modeled on<br>various things so the two examples given<br>in here is the one in Sydney the Banger<br>Barangaroo you may well know it and the<br>Canary Wharf so two difficulty Canary<br>Wharf of course is probably 20-30 years<br>old by now and it's delivered<br>I've asked alienated piece of London<br>that's disconnected from the rest of the<br>city but sure how good of an example<br>that is and Barangaroo for those who<br>have wandered around there recently is<br>not that much better so I have a problem<br>with the examples of that they have<br>chosen however the idea of using<br>development agencies<br>Drive urban development is not<br>necessarily a bad idea and indeed there<br>are some good examples from Australia<br>land calm development New South Wales<br>then call various state development<br>agencies that have been established now<br>it's just a couple of observations<br>around that Hobsonville point so often<br>comes up as an example being pointed to<br>as something that development agencies<br>can do well it's also been seen to be on<br>the fringe of the city fringe area<br>however if one looks at what's happening<br>art in the wastes at the moment it is<br>very far from being on the fringe<br>anymore there's going to be eleven<br>thousand people in Hopson for point<br>itself there's ten thousand just next<br>door in Scott point that's over 20,000<br>you throw in four new PI Red Hills<br>Kumi you within ten years they could be<br>something on the order of 50 60 70<br>thousand people living in the north west<br>of Auckland so it's not a remote fringe<br>area the other thing that we know is<br>that in the school we've just published<br>one at the first of our research reports<br>living at density and Hopson for point<br>Auckland and what their demonstrates and<br>these are the resident perceptions and<br>getting resident perceptions of living<br>in Auckland what their demonstrates is a<br>very high level of satisfaction being<br>expressed by people living there and all<br>sorts of different dimensions so the<br>kind of question that came to my mind is<br>if you take the development agency that<br>sat behind that a Chelsea which is a<br>subsidiary of housing New Zealand and<br>you reshape that into bring that into<br>this new government<br>agency hood up it raises a number of<br>questions the idea of a development<br>agency i seduce is not a bad idea but my<br>worry is if you take an agency that has<br>been successful in delivering reasonably<br>good housing outcomes from an<br>architectural point of view there's<br>probably more houses designed by<br>architects per square meter and Hopson<br>four point than any other place in<br>Auckland just to give one example but<br>will it be subsumed into the government<br>bureaucracy will it become top-down will<br>it exclude the interventions of local<br>authorities taking key initiatives and<br>urban development of the four pointer<br>you lend the examples that are given<br>there have been local government<br>initiatives that have driven those<br>things through all those be<br>bureaucratized and this effective well<br>though them waters be muddied by Kiwi<br>belt that is yet to produce an effective<br>outcome so these are my kind of worries<br>about the establishment of this agency<br>and although we can see all the aims and<br>pretty good ones here my big question<br>are three letters that make up one word<br>which is how how are they going to do<br>all the things they are setting out to<br>think thanks you know I pretty much<br>agree with most of that I mean I think<br>the concepts and first of all as I say<br>I'm a bit of a ring in as well I'll be<br>perfectly honest about that for this but<br>the first thing I would say is that the<br>geography or the concept of an urban<br>development authority is good the<br>questions you could have asked yourself<br>a suite minister from this and how we go<br>about doing it I totally agree with you<br>and there's all our critique about some<br>of these redevelopment projects in<br>Australia the UK America us about who<br>actually benefits from these things<br>especially when lands<br>taken from certain parties and<br>amalgamating the way it's done I totally<br>agree with Bangaru if anyone knows the<br>history of that that's quite a long and<br>involved process that's going through<br>many iterations to the iteration that<br>you've just seen there and the last part<br>of it's that tall building that's just<br>coming out at the end so I don't know if<br>that's the actual model you'd want to<br>follow that was run by the Metropolitan<br>Harbor whatever that quango they said it<br>was cool but I do think the idea of a<br>land assembly is a really good concept<br>because that's reported a lot of<br>development and I think most people in<br>the room who've been involved in the<br>development issue will know that we've<br>all seen scenarios where if we'd<br>actually amalgamated the land parcels go<br>I've heard it all those kids we would<br>have actually got a far better sort of<br>outcome so I think that's a really good<br>question a really good point I also<br>think the thing that sort of got skipped<br>over there was the whole idea of land<br>value capture I think that's a very very<br>powerful toy and if we're going to go<br>down this road we've got to see that we<br>get some value for this and that comes<br>back to my point about who benefits from<br>this process the last thing I'd say<br>because I think it's really good that we<br>have an open discussion is what does<br>that say especially in our context here<br>in Auckland to all the effort that we<br>put into the open you tree plan the<br>entry plan provides for a lot of<br>development opportunities there's no<br>doubts about that it's just a question<br>of people exercising those rights so<br>what does it also say if we're going to<br>start undermining that process about the<br>whole process we mean from constructing<br>this huge plan the whole buying whether<br>we did or we didn't of that thing and I<br>also think it's a bit harsh on the<br>council to say that they don't process<br>things that quickly I think Aaron's<br>points were made it's the practices that<br>go with it it's the people do we have<br>the right type of people the right type<br>of skill sets to actually deliver these<br>types of things in an efficient and<br>effective way so on the whole I think<br>it's a really good idea but I think<br>there's other questions that need to be<br>thought through about how it plays out<br>about who benefits and what's a<br>relationship with the council and how<br>that plays out with the democratic<br>there are<br>I was just wondering if they've allowed<br>for any opportunities for peer reviews<br>so things like Hobsonville point had the<br>urban design panels with Arctic's and I<br>think now council representatives on it<br>to make suggestions and help it out are<br>they going to do anything similar or are<br>they just gonna assume they've got all<br>the experts on board and won't need a<br>external source of what that sort of<br>comes back I don't I don't think<br>universe only answer that question but<br>that comes to the point I'm saying is it<br>comes back to the skill sets of the<br>people you've got in the organization<br>doesn't it<br>I mean Auckland Council has its own<br>urban design panel I'd like myself and<br>others sit on that panel I think we add<br>value to the process but not everything<br>goes to the urban design panel you know<br>and then if you look at Hobsonville you<br>did go through a three full five<br>whatever stage process it went through<br>but there was all of costs associated<br>with that and a lot of time associated<br>there and that sort of to get a quality<br>outcome sometimes it does take time so I<br>think there's a whole range of issues<br>that you raised there I'm in the central<br>the main pal the council's power we only<br>see around about 60 to 70 developers a<br>year and the council does 18,000<br>percents a year so it's only a really<br>small fraction of stuff that comes in<br>I'm not really a question but unless you<br>guys know the art they're working there<br>we go okay then it struck me that the<br>the urban design Authority seems to be<br>quite similar in concept to special<br>housing areas so I don't know what the<br>status of those is in relation to this<br>whether it's just replacing it and my<br>second comment was that there's quite a<br>lot of reference to Auckland in this<br>presentation and I was just wondering if<br>anyone knows the answer though I<br>certainly don't have the answer to that<br>but I share that concern which is that<br>for me things that work best is where<br>there's some kind of local control if<br>you're going to move that down to<br>Wellington it's going to be remote and<br>that's the same issue for me that you've<br>raised about quality control through<br>relation to design panels for example<br>how on earth would you manage an urban<br>design panel from Wellington for a<br>project up here in Auckland<br>so it's raises those sort of questions<br>the other problem I have just looking at<br>the image that Bill's put up here is<br>that this is an incredibly optimistic<br>kind of view of how a development works<br>you start on the left-hand corner over<br>there and you just progress bum bum bum<br>bum bum until you pop out with this so<br>much curious-looking diagram over here<br>development is nothing like that it's<br>and goes and starts and goes backwards<br>and things collapse and things recover<br>development is never like that so that's<br>a highly optimistic diagram to me and<br>so to me it seems that sir compulsory<br>land acquisition is pretty important but<br>it seems a bit draconian at the same<br>time but I think pivotal in that whole<br>process is the transfer of land to third<br>parties I think that's the key mechanism<br>if that isn't sorted somehow fairly or<br>properly I think it's the pivotal<br>question and it doesn't seem to have<br>been answered and I think that comes<br>back to the point I was saying is it who<br>benefits from this who benefits from<br>this you know and if you start Wall<br>Street pouring land like we are if you<br>if they're going to who benefits from<br>this and how people compensate and all<br>those types of things come into play<br>that's why predominately in the past<br>comments been quite reluctant to go down<br>this road but having said there I do<br>think it's a good idea it's a task which<br>we could have the right checks and<br>balances in place to make sure the that<br>the right the benefits do could flow and<br>people aren't dislocated from their land<br>I think they have to understand though<br>that HRC has got quite a different role<br>in the new metal mount Ross : North<br>Dakota and a lot of the acquisition is<br>going to be very useful there because<br>the examples in earnest with the<br>sell-off of individual sort of get teeth<br>if you like in the 90s stymied all of<br>but also much of Glen Innes because it<br>was not a master plan to exercise as an<br>in full a whole lot of you know a<br>hundred or so in for projects and and<br>with at least with housing New Zealand<br>they have lost stuff and gaps that have<br>been sold off and those other suburbs at<br>least they now have a mechanism because<br>they can't do it at the moment so they<br>got in full projects the same problem<br>that HRC is running - Russell South it<br>can't do all the things that wants to do<br>because it hasn't got access to the it's<br>illogical to put a road with you but you<br>have to go through people's properties<br>just like you say and the same sort of<br>thing applies there doesn't it also<br>interesting to say they won't the public<br>consultation<br>they're almost voluntarily equivalent to<br>a publicly notified area where does the<br>RMA sit on all this it's quite silent<br>and I'm not sure what happens are you<br>just overriding it but but I think I<br>think that points well-made is cuz your<br>city in context of the RMA phase 1 phase<br>2 reforms that are coming forward and<br>there are going to be changes to the MPs<br>is you know the national policy<br>statements about urban development<br>they're going to try and address and<br>support some of these things so I think<br>there is a package of other work that<br>needs to be done around those issues and<br>I think is what I know has been done<br>two weeks ago we came here and we were<br>talked by the Nightingale men from<br>Melbourne and I'm just thinking I got<br>the impression that the way they<br>controlled they had some controls over<br>designing and buying and selling or<br>something although he talked very fast<br>and I'm just wondering if there's any<br>connection between what might happen<br>here and what they are playing with over<br>there which seem to be very very<br>positive it's so um that's what I'm<br>wondering<br>Kurata I'm just interested in like some<br>of the imagery that was used before and<br>correct me if I'm wrong it was looked a<br>little bit 1950s old-school town<br>planning so obviously you know Lee and<br>Errol you literally have a better<br>knowledge of that but I mean it does<br>seem to me a little bit concerning are<br>we are we sort of looking at a trakone<br>Ian's old school planning regime enacted<br>to sort of give more power and yes we've<br>got issues that need to be dealt with in<br>these merits around the urban<br>development authority for that for that<br>reason but you know with our cultural<br>diversity reflected in that legislation<br>and and Takano Mari aspects or you know<br>that responding to their new and<br>changing needs of climate change for<br>example it doesn't seem to be reflected<br>to any great degree in an inspiring<br>manner in the presentation they provided<br>certainly the issue I have is to be it<br>lacks clarity of what the purpose of IDA<br>is if the problem that were seeing was<br>an inability for New Zealand to produce<br>affordable housing which we know has<br>been the issue and debate over the past<br>ten years the big question is how will<br>this agency make that better<br>and certainly if you take Kiwi bold it<br>doesn't leave too much confidence but a<br>government intervention of that kind<br>necessarily is going to solve their<br>problem yet alone address the kind of<br>issues that you're raising so I do worry<br>about the intentions meeting the actual<br>outcomes that<br>I hope to achieve well the real housing<br>issues are missing on this diagram<br>behind us if we take homelessness and we<br>take social housing and the enormous<br>needs in this country for those two<br>things that doesn't appear anywhere on<br>this diagram up here at all so I'm not<br>quite sure where that fits in to the<br>I wonder if I could put a contrary point<br>okay right<br>don't touch the button okay there's a<br>Tina to almost all the remarks to date<br>I've but people are running around as if<br>the sky is about to fall in our heads<br>we're getting hooter because our<br>planning processes have not been up to<br>scratch we have not got a system in<br>place that will allow us to build at<br>scale and at quality and at reasonable<br>price scale quality reasonable price<br>they all have to be in men yes of course<br>the see there are lots of details to be<br>worked out about how things have done<br>different projects are going to have<br>different ratios of what kind of housing<br>in the Meseta etc etc of course all<br>those things are true but the bigger<br>question here is that when it was<br>Auckland Council we were failed over and<br>over and over and the government's come<br>in and said we can't leave it to the<br>council because the council is not<br>strong enough it doesn't have though the<br>robustness and the vision in its<br>consenting Department it doesn't have<br>the politicians who can drive it well it<br>doesn't have the sense in the cut<br>throughout the council that we are<br>trying to resolve big crisis so the<br>government has stepped in rather than<br>going I don't see how this plan is<br>really going to work which is really<br>what just about everybody's been saying<br>why are we not turning that round and<br>saying okay how do we make this make it<br>work how do we make it better how do we<br>make it stronger how do we make it<br>resilient how do we make sure that the<br>government won't fail in this because it<br>doesn't get the support from the people<br>it desperately needs and that is each<br>one and everybody in this room and the<br>hundreds of people behind you because it<br>does need the support of the industry or<br>I think we I think what you're saying is<br>true I think we've all had frustrations<br>I've had one yesterday or two days ago<br>was on the I do about considering the<br>council I think with all of those<br>frustrations but I think if we look at<br>what's really causing how what you've<br>talked about I don't think it's a it's a<br>zoning problem anymore<br>how much par the city's own Terrace and<br>apartment buildings owned how much of<br>the city is now zoned for metropolitan<br>center I don't I don't accept that<br>I accept that what's causing these<br>problems I mean it's partly part of<br>problems and that comes back to skill<br>sets as well saying you could have the<br>right people and it doesn't matter if<br>they're in the council or in some<br>government agency but why are<br>constructors cost so high you know why<br>does it costs forty percent more to<br>build a house here in Auckland and it<br>doesn't Sydney you know why is health<br>and safety I was talking to a won't say<br>which company to a director of a<br>well-established company housing compute<br>ami in the last five years ten perceive<br>your housing cost has no health and<br>safety you know let's talk about these<br>real costs and real and barriers what<br>why does it cost so much no one has ever<br>been able to tell me why it costs forty<br>percent more to build here than it does<br>in Sydney and that to me I think it's<br>the real issue I'm not downplaying what<br>you're saying I totally agree that I've<br>told you your frustrations resume with<br>the council but why aren't we talking<br>about there why are we talking about the<br>scale of our industries why aren't we<br>talking about the costs of construction<br>why aren't we talking about all those<br>types of things why do you always come<br>back to consenting which the end of the<br>day is just a small part in a much<br>yeah yeah we talked about Jesus sea for<br>a couple of hours anyone who's<br>interested in doing development I<br>strongly advise you get good advice from<br>a tax lawyer because it's it's not<br>always easy to get the money back<br>I'm just here the back but you're not<br>paying for it when yourself and so you<br>can ya winning loose the these urban<br>development authorities that pretty<br>common overseas and they can be very<br>very successful it really comes down to<br>who is in the Development Authority who<br>the actors are and how skilled they are<br>is something something we often say is<br>the public service is all about it the<br>core business the public service is<br>politics and then its policy in its<br>procedure and in its process the core<br>business of the private sector is Pro is<br>profit so it's about progress product<br>and profit and on a good day the public<br>sectors about people in poverty and on a<br>bad day it's about pitting us and<br>procrastination so the problem with this<br>Development Authority maybe just say it<br>has too many bureaucrats and I don't<br>know who's a bureaucrat in the room and<br>who's a planner and who's an architect<br>I'd better be careful<br>but for these things succeed you need<br>one a lot of creativity a lot of daring<br>encourage a lot imagination be able to<br>analyze risk mitigator and go for it<br>there's a lot to win and there's a lot<br>to lose and so you need people who are<br>really going to give it a good go at it<br>the tragic irony is often in the public<br>sector they don't pay enough to this<br>three attract the people at the right<br>the creativity during encourage and so<br>these organizations can succeed or fail<br>depending on who he steps up to the<br>plate to be involved with that they yeah<br>they all have you know successes and<br>failures you can look at the London<br>Development Authority through the 80s<br>did some fantastic things but it's<br>professor haha sprinted out it became<br>very homogeneous and it's you might<br>argue still Arlen places but at least<br>something happened although there's<br>always a place that's all buildings have<br>dull corporate you know organizations<br>and people will say you got a problem<br>somewhere so in some ways you're better<br>off making a Parkington right there and<br>it's a bit like Omaha but you know we<br>often say that says Arctic Zoo and<br>there's a certain sort of people who<br>love to live in Omaha and there's other<br>people who just wouldn't and so there<br>has to be a place to everybody in a<br>healthy City as we all know but I I<br>think it could succeed it may come down<br>to what's of salaries they're paying and<br>what kind of latitude and what I thought<br>mandate is given to the organization and<br>it'll be early days but if it ends up<br>being run by planners and you know who's<br>a planner in the room anybody I mean<br>excellent in all on the state most<br>planners can be very two-dimensional you<br>know in other who's an architect in the<br>room probably the other half the room<br>but I fixed me very creative bag be too<br>creative but you need a real mix there<br>has to be a really good a social mix<br>people or stuff in the man but what one<br>that I know intimately is the mid-water<br>project and there was there was a very<br>intense level of debate for about two or<br>three years over that project yet the<br>right mix and so I think the successes<br>that project if you don't know it's up<br>by Arriva about three thousand houses<br>linked sort of five schools hidden rugby<br>fields warehouse countdown etcetera if<br>the success is there were due to a<br>really robust debate over the long term<br>and I think the success Hobbs forward<br>two things one<br>the head time on their hands all three<br>things their time on their hands this<br>bill you pointed out it was the one<br>govern agency take mind off another so<br>as it didn't they didn't have the land<br>holding costs that can kill a project if<br>it drags out too long<br>and the third reason was I've forgotten<br>what was a third reason they say housing<br>they could be it yeah they didn't have a<br>robust design process there's a theater<br>on what was it it was the tongue here in<br>sort of cameo Sophia thanks if I can<br>segue with what Vince said I think skill<br>sets key I mean it's got to be diverse<br>it's got to be from industry and<br>research and policy making the other<br>thing is setting the performance<br>criteria in capturing those metrics so<br>we've got you know the government are<br>doing work around the Wellness idea<br>there I said a competitive University<br>has been doing a lot of research around<br>shared prosperity indexes what are the<br>metrics against this will be evaluated<br>in terms of success you know most of us<br>in the room of probably building<br>industry professionals and therefore<br>we'll pitch it at built outcomes but I<br>think the opportunity is to capture<br>those other broader social and wellness<br>metrics and in actually a central<br>government agency that can join the dots<br>and link the silos that are dealing with<br>health and well-being and education and<br>all those other areas can also drive<br>good outcomes as well so skills end<br>setting setting targets above and beyond<br>the built environment I just perhaps to<br>add to that last comment I would agree<br>that there is a potential real advantage<br>they could come from an organization<br>like this not only around centralizing<br>collecting metrics and making sure that<br>is<br>distributed to those who need to know<br>but I think there's also different<br>attitude that's coming through the<br>articulation of this hider idea<br>particularly from the Minister concerned<br>for the first time I can remember for<br>what a long period we've got a minister<br>talking about the quality of the urban<br>environment talking about the need for<br>proper professionals to be involved in<br>designing the places and spaces that<br>people live in talking about urban<br>design of design policies so there is a<br>bit of a shift of culture that certainly<br>is coming from the minister and from the<br>idea that sits behind the establishment<br>of this dedicated agency within a<br>ministry that's focused on urban<br>development so I think there is a real<br>positive move there where some of the<br>worries come is how that ministry at the<br>end of the day will be staffed do they<br>get the right kind of people they can<br>deliver outcomes around that kind of<br>culture of understanding good design<br>there's an indication at the moment for<br>anyone who was involved in two workshops<br>that the minister organized in<br>Wellington a couple of weeks ago Lee and<br>I went to some of those there was just a<br>worry that the way in which it was<br>organized by the people in the ministry<br>didn't demonstrate that they had a good<br>understanding and grounding about what a<br>open design is should be<br>although the minister seems to speak<br>very comfortably about that so these are<br>a bit of a worry there one of the<br>examples that have been given in<br>relation to getting kind of powerful<br>voices into government agencies is the<br>state the Australian States<br>idea of a state architect and<br>State architects office that are quite<br>powerful in the context of the<br>Australian States but there's no talk<br>yet of a similar kind of voice being<br>embedded into hood of so I think it's<br>really good structure to good move I<br>think collectively what we all got to do<br>is find ways in which we can influence<br>the development of those things to make<br>sure they get the right kind of people<br>hey just dumb<br>another quick positive word around one<br>thing I'm slightly hardened by the<br>potential integration for things like<br>trip I note in the infrastructure part<br>that says it will have the same powers<br>as all can transport now that's a really<br>interesting little note there how<br>exactly that all work will be really<br>interesting but I hear um ends up going<br>as far as somewhere like Copenhagen<br>which is said that all of its new<br>development has to be with them end of a<br>rapid transit station and whether that's<br>the kind of alignment we'll see out of<br>this will be really interesting so yet<br>really positive overall and positive to<br>see that integration and I think that's<br>a really powerful point and I think<br>that's I totally take your point ago I<br>agree with that and I think if we go<br>back and look at a lot of the models we<br>run these transit aren't aid models but<br>we don't deliver the transit we don't<br>deliver the employment and that's what<br>we don't do we just deliver housing and<br>it really it really stresses me out that<br>we just deliver housing and we don't<br>deliver community but it's supposed to<br>be about community building is supposed<br>to be paid places where people live work<br>and play and Hobson tours fantastic<br>they're my biggest critique about hub's<br>abilities its it was supposed to be<br>transit oriented development and there<br>isn't no employment there and there<br>isn't the transit I mean it's really<br>nice to catch the ferry and all that but<br>you can pick on anywhere in Oakland<br>let's look at South Auckland what we're<br>doing in injury South and let's just<br>stop there but the same problems are<br>coming forward so I think that's a<br>really powerful thing and I pick up the<br>point before is yeah that's the problem<br>we need to have this type of integration<br>and I think one of the worst things we<br>ever did one repair to Auckland Council<br>was we created Auckland Transport what<br>why don't we do that for I mean all we<br>did I mean we created Auckland Council<br>let's be asked about because the 78th<br>and the Regional Council couldn't get on<br>that's really why we did I mean there's<br>all of other reasons but that was one of<br>the reasons wasn't it and now all we did<br>was cry other set of bureaucracies<br>between Auckland Transport like why does<br>all come transfer is only urban design<br>department like Auckland Council does<br>and they're now suburban Auckland<br>hazards<br>I don't understand this and I think if<br>this is what we're trying to get over<br>well yeah I'm really for it for this<br>integrated idea of integrating transport<br>employment and actually creating some<br>sort of livable communities and just not<br>talking about it so I didn't want to<br>seem like I've maybe I've come across a<br>big negative I actually think this is a<br>really good idea because just all the<br>critiques we have to work through but if<br>we can actually start delivering on this<br>promise of urban intensification in a<br>meaningful way that's got to be a good<br>thing hi I just wanted to reiterate on<br>arrows points of you know or design<br>professionals while most of us here and<br>yet we have a tendency to talk among<br>ourselves and a internalized bubble this<br>is an opportunity for us to actually get<br>out there and actually make a difference<br>some real influence you know we're not<br>just working on one side we're working<br>on the development of wider size a<br>larger strategy and I think we should<br>all advocate for actually having our<br>voices heard and those circles and in<br>this rather large bureaucratic snake<br>that we're about to get so yeah it's all<br>get out there and that doing things and<br>be positive about it because otherwise<br>we'll be shut out like a lot of things<br>because what struck me about these<br>crying<br>because designers design to use their<br>food and things scale by the way of the<br>scale and so really what what I was<br>going to say what also Zek what you said<br>and as Arctic's we're perfectly placed<br>to get involved the sort of thing and<br>make a real difference but the silly<br>building the work it has to be designed<br>lead there it's not designed ly that<br>becomes policy lead or becomes dollar<br>lead or becomes project lead or<br>something but when it's designed it'll<br>be successful so I mean if anyone in the<br>room is a dwelling budding so not just<br>even design ever even developer I'd yeah<br>and say just go for it because acting's<br>have perfectly trained to make these<br>things succeed sorry I just have to say<br>fun around what Lee said that is if the<br>architects are focused on the people you<br>know people first communities first<br>their needs first you know design in</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
