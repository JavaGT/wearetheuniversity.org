This semester we continue our focus on the question: How can we do medium density well? This series is proudly supported by GIB®.<br><br>Co-Housing Catch-Up<br><br>Architect Thom Gill will provide an update on the ground-breaking Grey Lynn project, Cohaus. Thom will share the progress of the 20-unit apartment project and explain how particular projects have been managed. Greer O’Donnell of The Urban Advisory will also discuss their involvement with this and other co-housing schemes. Tim Gummer of Cohousing NZ will also be here to talk about further national co-housing projects and February’s CoHoHui Co-housing Symposium in Wellington.<br><br>--<br><br>For more information about

a<br>sort of a panel session here we will<br>have all three speakers down here myself<br>just controlling the questions from the<br>floor and that can go over twenty<br>minutes we'll see how we go but I think<br>we'll just kick off with a few term and<br>start with you for 15-20 minutes and<br>then we'll go from there hi together as<br>you heard I started co-hosting a talk<br>some time ago<br>the orc in there is a little bit<br>aspirational it really implies nonprofit<br>more than anything else and maybe grey<br>later tonight might be able to speak a<br>bit more on the org side of things for<br>this kind of space in terms of<br>definitions which is a fraught area in<br>itself cohousing in terms of what we<br>profile on the site is has a fairly<br>broad definition you you can talk about<br>pure cohousing or various models that<br>are simiiar related they're clearly<br>related to each other and and and so<br>what essentially we're doing is it's<br>mostly just profiling car housing so<br>that people can see it in one place kind<br>of get a little bit of a snapshot in<br>actual fact it's not really a complete<br>snapshot it's um you know there's a lot<br>of stuff happening under the radar as we<br>speak but eventually it turns up and so<br>if people are searching for all all<br>manner of things like community housing<br>or housing or whatever they're liable to<br>find this and it's also a way for people<br>who are initiating projects to be able<br>to simply put them up there and<br>have people express interest and connect<br>with other people I will say I would<br>love to be doing less on content and<br>more on developing the site so it can do<br>more for people and so if anyone wants<br>to volunteer to have a front a front<br>seat on the cohousing scene and that<br>would be great I should move on okay<br>that's me Tim Gummer design that's what<br>I do I'm not running a cohousing or<br>coordinating encouraging project I'm a<br>web designer and I just started this<br>because it's it's something that I<br>really wanted to support the site as I<br>say has news and profiles different<br>communities both ones in formation and<br>established so who in Wellington bill<br>asked me to speak to this a little bit<br>I'll speak pretty generally because a<br>lot of the presentations and so forth it<br>just recently been published who he was<br>I I think it's a real milestone actually<br>it didn't really set out a lot of clear<br>objectives in and of itself but the<br>amount of activity into in the cohousing<br>space I'm assuming everyone<br>fundamentally knows what causing is here<br>has just it's just exploded in the last<br>year so this was really the first coming<br>together of people working in the<br>cohousing and related you know community<br>housing space there was the agony and<br>the ecstasy and and there were some<br>large group sessions covering a number<br>of areas and then breaking out into<br>smaller groups to cover things like<br>legal frameworks the ohoo model with<br>where that they've got a kind of crowd<br>crowd funding approach it's then there<br>and I think one of the things that's<br>really positive about<br>I think surprised a few people was that<br>actually demographically this was not<br>people my age this is this is there was<br>really a broad range of people including<br>you know a lot of younger people who<br>really not happy about the state of<br>housing in New Zealand and but actually<br>pretty fired up to do something to<br>change that and so now where we are and<br>out of that I should have just jumped<br>here's the another consequence of the of<br>the curvy and Grier can speak to this<br>later is is the establishment of a trust<br>- that's going to work on speaking for<br>cohousing on coordinating and so forth<br>and so you know as we start to kind of<br>get our act together you know we're<br>going to need to be able to speak with<br>one voice like other interest groups do<br>and so that's a really positive thing as<br>I say Gribble I'm sure speak more on<br>that the question I mentioned of what is<br>cohousing what does it include I think<br>we are gonna have to get our brand right<br>I think that really is one of the big<br>questions that we face we're going to<br>have to be able to speak about this<br>thing is it cohousing is a cooperative<br>housing collabora whatever you want to<br>call it we there has to get worked out<br>and it needs to at the moment I think<br>I'm just going to venture a personal<br>opinion here that people aren't the word<br>cohousing is probably the biggest out<br>there and people understand it and they<br>search for that even if what they're<br>looking for is a little bit more general<br>so this this whole question of not only<br>coming together and having an effective<br>organization to speak for cohousing and<br>related forms of housing is is something<br>I'm getting backwards okay right<br>forwards thank you right so to try and<br>get a little bit more of a snapshot<br>about where we're at at this point and<br>we're really now at a point where it is<br>there are an enormous number of projects<br>they're happening in spite of immense<br>hurdles it's taken a staggeringly long<br>time for this donating cohousing<br>development to get up and running but it<br>is co-housed who will speak later today<br>suffered insane barriers from the very<br>city that they are trying to offer<br>something to fortunately is that I'm<br>sure they'll they'll mention the city<br>about faced at the last possible moment<br>and they're in their legal hearings but<br>but that's you know amidst all the<br>activity that's going on it's still way<br>too hard to start cohousing and again<br>organizing connecting and solving bigger<br>problems together as a broader<br>communities where I'm sure a lot of that<br>we've got the backdrop of the housing<br>situation in New Zealand and there's a<br>substantive the one of the kind of<br>elephants that doesn't really get<br>addressed because we're all really<br>thinking about just trying to get some<br>projects that we can we can make happen<br>for ourselves happen but nonetheless<br>there's going to be an enormous amount<br>of building happening across our tiara<br>in the coming decade and beyond and I<br>would say that this presents if an<br>enormous opportunity cost if if we don't<br>if there isn't some grasping of the<br>opportunities that that are provided by<br>this when you're<br>about to build a whole lot of houses if<br>you if there is no social cohesion in<br>those places that's a cost if social<br>isolation is equivalent to smoking<br>smoking 30 cigarettes a day and you<br>don't design to counter socialized<br>socialized isolation you're missing an<br>enormous opportunity as a as a<br>government as a community as a country<br>so it would be really interesting to see<br>whether we whether we've managed to move<br>on from there<br>this is cheery it's a social housing<br>community in in Milan Italy it's social<br>housing it's it's not it's not pure<br>housing but it's informed by cohousing<br>principles in fact the project manager<br>runs a co housing project of her own and<br>a spare time she look very tired I will<br>tell you but this is a substantial<br>development it's 240 apartments the<br>people who live there really proud of<br>them they're modern they're clean<br>they're remarkably affordable now I<br>didn't mention affordability I should<br>have it's one of the tricky areas that<br>we're facing in terms of progressing<br>with cohousing<br>and this it's a muddy area as a country<br>as we are trying to as we're staring<br>down an affordability crisis we you know<br>we're asking ourselves does cohousing<br>have anything to bring to affordability<br>not necessarily out of the box but I<br>think one of the things that was quite<br>encouraging about the carajo a event is<br>that out of that there were a number of<br>people who really were working on on<br>steering down the affordability problem<br>and in that I include<br>number of people there now at least two<br>developments are know of to develop tiny<br>house villages and I know one of them is<br>looking I think at about 300k aside so<br>that's very different from sort of<br>chipping away maybe 50k off the top of a<br>$800,000 home you know it's a completely<br>different bracket that is as you know<br>being a village it's going to provide<br>social cohesion and and and it's<br>affordable so there are a number of<br>people in the space trying to work at<br>affordability that's it housing you know<br>itself it's not it adds value it tends<br>to add value rather than lowering costs<br>for people in some countries such as<br>Germany with the PAL Griffin there there<br>are a number of text breaks and a lot of<br>incentives given because government<br>recognizes that Co housing has a lot of<br>social benefits and so cooperative<br>housing is cheaper than it otherwise<br>would be but it's not innately cheaper<br>of itself it's cheaper because because<br>of the regime that they are operating in<br>so social housing is is again it's a<br>it's an opportunity waiting for us if<br>we're just about to build a whole lot of<br>homes I don't think that a lot of us are<br>able to think in those terms at this<br>point but as Co housing becomes more<br>confident as we start to deal with the<br>kind of barriers that stopping people in<br>the private sector as it were and in<br>communities and intentional communities<br>developing coercing then social housing<br>may well come within frame so another<br>aspect opportunity cost is around<br>transport shared cashier is something<br>that it's beginning to be experimented<br>with in cohousing situations overseas<br>and a lot of people locally are talking<br>about that so if we are looking ahead to<br>building a lot of houses and we're still<br>expecting that everyone's going to owe<br>in their own car etc etc we're missing<br>out on an opportunity ultimately as I<br>said a lack of social connectedness it's<br>an enormous ly costly to our health the<br>converse is as you would find in the<br>Blue Zones<br>in places like Sardinia and in our own<br>places where there are very socially<br>connected communities where generations<br>are quite integrated with is a very good<br>social contract people tint a little<br>very long time and they're quite well so<br>and in this and specifically a lot of<br>people live over 100 so that's the kind<br>of those are literally the very kind of<br>tangible benefits that car housing is is<br>able to offer potentially if we can get<br>in touch with those kinds of you know<br>age-old principles about how we live<br>together and how we connect then we have<br>a lot to to look forward to and I think<br>I think hi everyone thanks for coming to<br>this talk and this is an update on a<br>talk we gave a year ago and I'm afraid<br>I've probably presuppose that people<br>came to that first also there's not a<br>lot of pretty picture than this one I'm<br>sorry let's not get into it we when we<br>when we presented last year we were<br>partway through a resource consent<br>application and finding it quite tough<br>going<br>we've since been through and come out<br>the other end of that process and it<br>went to a hearing and I'm just gonna<br>hand over straight away to Isla who's a<br>member of the group also a senior town<br>planner to give their perspective on on<br>the resource concede thanks Tom so my<br>name's aiyla daniels I'm a represent a<br>household in town house my husband Tim<br>my daughter tease in San Henry will be<br>in one of the units we are on sorry<br>block yes we met block currently mid<br>fall we are really excited about being<br>part of the community and it's shared by<br>the whole family including our oldest<br>daughter dear sue and its really excited<br>about living here so I was as Tom's<br>outlined we achieved a resource consent<br>last year and I didn't actually realize<br>he was gonna be here Lee was actually on<br>the hearing so<br>if I misinterpret anything you said or<br>yes yeah so achieving that consent last<br>year was a mess of achievement for the<br>group obviously it's only one part of<br>the process towards actually delivering<br>co-housed but it's a pretty essential<br>one and it was I suppose I'm gonna take<br>you for an abridged version so I'll try<br>and not dwell on too much and keep it<br>flowing but I'm sure Tom wall we need it<br>so we launched the consent last March<br>and there was price lodgement we were<br>about six months in the making<br>in terms of discussions with council<br>design iterations obviously working as a<br>group together in terms of the design as<br>well so we lodged in March and it took<br>nine months for us to get a decision so<br>18 months in total from inception if you<br>like fruit to getting a piece of sign<br>paper at the end in this that<br>consensually I think was very early<br>stressful for a lot of the group I<br>didn't find it pierced me as much<br>stressful I think because I was so<br>certain of myself that we would obtain<br>it I think a story for cohousing and the<br>detail in consideration that's gotten<br>into the design and the proposal was my<br>mind so compelling and easily fitted<br>within the unitary plan framework but<br>for many in the group it was really<br>stressful last year we settled on the<br>site in July at the same time we're<br>having to spend money on lawyers sign<br>agreements see that truss and there was<br>a potential that it was just going to be<br>an option for a pipe dream that wouldn't<br>actually follow through so it was really<br>yeah a stressful time for a lot of<br>people in the group and it was also a<br>really extensive time the consent costs<br>were upward of $200,000 that put<br>householders between twin and 20,000<br>that is incorporated into the cost of<br>our unit was just for getting this piece<br>of paper to enable us to<br>seed with this version so in terms of I<br>suppose one of the most important their<br>steps and the resource consent as you<br>probably all know I mentioned there's<br>some planners here tonight as<br>notification so we actually lodged our<br>resource consent numbers have notified<br>we had a couple of neighbors approval as<br>achieved at that point which is great we<br>actually secured another one through the<br>process as well in terms of neighbors it<br>actually ended up being anyway yeah<br>and ended up being notified to 150<br>people so you could argue if it really<br>was limited or if it was really just<br>quasi public to notification which I'll<br>talk to her a little bit later as well<br>I'm total we only received 17<br>submissions from those 155 households<br>that were formerly able to engage in the<br>process 11 in opposition six and support<br>and so in my mind I think you can safely<br>say that there wasn't a groundswell of<br>opposition to what we were wanting to do<br>and I think we had always been one of<br>the rule as those strong focuses of the<br>group was to really engage and consult<br>with neighbors we were at farmers<br>markets we were having open daughter<br>have conversation with all sorts of<br>different people be the resident<br>stakeholders anyone that was interested<br>in having a conversation so I think that<br>is reflected in those numbers like<br>actually after those 155 were notified<br>which she did public meeting down at<br>braylin RSA I don't think we actually<br>had a huge amount of people doing that<br>which was yeah which I think again shows<br>that if people were really upset and<br>with what we're wanting to do that they<br>would have sought to engage in that<br>though that said we sought to respond to<br>those submitters and we made a number of<br>design amendments particularly to one of<br>the blocks the courtyard block in terms<br>of lowing lowering the height of that<br>trying to respond to some of the<br>concerns okay so I suppose what would<br>what did the consent I suppose were the<br>key focuses or what do it sort of turn<br>on in my mind probably special character<br>which some of you may have been involved<br>with in terms of what that is for them<br>the unitary playing and parking good old<br>parking I suppose firstly in terms of<br>special character overlay I'd say that<br>in my experience quite often they're<br>treated like pseudo Heritage Areas or<br>almost like they're scheduled but then<br>arch that's not the intention of the<br>unitary plan to do that I think it<br>probably was pretty clear in the piece<br>in terms of engagement the council that<br>we probably weren't going to get council<br>heritage support for the scheme so we<br>had to decide they I suppose they were<br>clear that they didn't support the<br>height in particular sorry block at<br>three storeys they didn't support the<br>asymmetrical roof form that we were<br>trying to do on the courtyard block they<br>didn't support the materials we were<br>looking to use they also didn't support<br>a lot of the works we were doing to the<br>villa so we had to decide as a group or<br>how are we going to manage that risk<br>when you we had no appeal rights past<br>the hearing so we actually ended up<br>engaging three top of their field and<br>dependent heritage and urban design<br>specialists to support our case to guide<br>us through the hearing process did this<br>attribute to our high consenting costs<br>yes did it give us certainty in terms of<br>guiding us through that process yes<br>so I suppose we wanted to make it easy<br>as possible for the commissioners to be<br>able to side with our position and to<br>manage that risk and that's what we<br>ultimately decided to do in terms of<br>parking and there old chestnut it's<br>something which I think people get<br>really passionate about on either side<br>and I think during their hearing there<br>was probably<br>the council process generally that was a<br>bit of an obsession with parking<br>standards and I think how experienced is<br>that it's quite often used as an<br>objection to progressive schemes like<br>like what we are seeking to do look at<br>Daisy that's carefree and look at the<br>nightingale projects in Melbourne<br>they've always had car angst for all<br>their projects so I don't think yeah I<br>think that's probably just yeah maybe<br>telling I'm not sure however the energy<br>plan actually sits have a framework that<br>seeking to encourage a mode shift and<br>that were the future by our planning and<br>traffic specialists and ultimately the<br>commissioners and we suppose this kind<br>of segues into the release of the first<br>council recommendation just prior to the<br>hearing we get got I should with the<br>council officer recommendations and I<br>think at this stage as a group we<br>thought we'd really put our best foot<br>forward in terms of all matters<br>particularly with parking we've done a<br>number of passing surveys which showed<br>there was really good<br>availability at both peak and non-peak<br>times and again we're talking about a<br>nine space shortfall if you consider the<br>existing new strikes of the previous<br>care facility it's actually only I think<br>four spaces yeah yeah so we're not<br>talking big numbers here also the zoning<br>around the site we kind of sat in a<br>little pocket of all these other zones<br>that had no pass and controls but then<br>on our side of the road you did we had<br>really good public transport and I think<br>most importantly we had a community that<br>was committed to wanting to lead at<br>least at least had a dependent life<br>style in a location that actually<br>supports their intention it's not we're<br>not wanting to do that and living way<br>out and nowhere where we're living so<br>close to the city that walkable is it<br>was really achievable so as those when<br>we got the original officer<br>recommendation to decline I think we're<br>really surprised that we didn't have<br>that support for the project<br>particularly when the unitary plan with<br>what was providing a clear direction<br>that it was appropriate in this instance<br>so that got picked up in the media was<br>on spin off the<br>stuff or greater Auckland ran quite a<br>few pieces and I think one of the most<br>telling things I remember at the time<br>was there was this quote and I might<br>misquote it I'm not sure the person who<br>treated it as in the room but basically<br>said they counsel cares more about cars<br>houses for cars than houses for people<br>and I think that really resonated with<br>the growth in particular it's just at<br>the stage we decided to actually engage<br>another traffic engineer to give<br>evidence we actually prepared a travel<br>plan which i think is one of the first<br>in New Zealand for a residential scheme<br>even though point out we already had the<br>best traffic engineer in Auckland yeah<br>we employed and we had to get another<br>one yeah and on the tribal plan there<br>actually I'm to be honest pretty<br>standard overseas for essential schemes<br>like I've worked in London for seven<br>years and it's like an information<br>requirement to actually logic and see<br>and say but we did that and actually<br>after submitting our evidence to the<br>hearing and the council you actually<br>submit that about a week before council<br>actually to the credit ended up changing<br>the recommendation to approval with a<br>new recommendation for juice I think I<br>should I think that is important to<br>acknowledge because it's not very often<br>that you see that happen<br>and I can't think of a huge amount of<br>examples where that's occurred counts<br>which you've got a lot of criticism at<br>the hearing by the submitters opposing<br>the scheme in terms of that change which<br>is obviously uncomfortable for the ember<br>day I definitely think it was the right<br>position for them to take given the<br>evidence that we had presented I'm not<br>sure if everyone's read the decision and<br>some lie and you're able to do that if<br>you want I suppose the key takeaways<br>from the decision for me and there may<br>be others as well but for me they were<br>that in terms of that character overlay<br>you actually need to assess it<br>contextually in assists in a take a<br>wider lens when actually doing that<br>which i think is I think most people<br>would agree is a pretty<br>sound approach to it in terms of design<br>101 materials you need to actually just<br>complement the overlay you shouldn't be<br>trying to replicate stuff at the past<br>and then to actually do a quote from it<br>on the breach of a actual rule than the<br>plan this was in respect of building<br>coverage and the commissioners actually<br>see it in our view the character of an<br>area is typically defined by the<br>existing characteristics and not by a<br>district camera which I think was<br>actually one of my favorite quotes from<br>the decision packing the decision agreed<br>with our arguments about the framework<br>they did I think want to acknowledge and<br>give comfort to the submitters who had<br>thought to engage in the process and<br>there are a number of conditions that<br>will have to abide by going forward in<br>terms of monitoring of packing use the<br>use of our travel plan in the like and<br>obviously we we have no problem in doing<br>that I think also the commissioners<br>rightly acknowledge the positive<br>benefits of this game at the end of the<br>decision which was great in terms of<br>learnings for other cohousing projects<br>or development generally I think they<br>would be have a really good team of<br>specialists around you early to guide<br>you through that process your design as<br>I think everyone would be looking to do<br>needs to respond positively to your site<br>and constraints and then I think you<br>just need to really consider your<br>consenting strategy early and in<br>particular your approach to notification<br>in my opinion in hindsight and I think<br>it may have been better for the project<br>to have just requested public<br>notification Beckham March and there may<br>be some people that don't agree with<br>that but my reasoning for that would be<br>and because of that no decision actually<br>or assessment needs to be made by<br>counsel and that decision just gets just<br>needs to go through the admin of that in<br>our case we always knew we were going to<br>be notified we had lodged limited<br>notified and we ended up having 150<br>dwellings notified in any events it<br>wasn't that just a form of public<br>notification in any event we've no<br>appeal rights given the RMA so we always<br>knew we had to go on with our<br>a game if you like and we had astrally<br>strong and well considered design that<br>responded to the local context we were<br>supported by a really great group of<br>very experienced specialists and<br>professionals and the main immunity<br>concerns were just where boundary issues<br>in terms of privacy shadowing dominance<br>local views from single properties the<br>likelihood of additional issues being<br>raised by public notification where in<br>my mind lo given it was a residential<br>scheme we're talking about 20 units is<br>only certainly things that you can raise<br>and we would have been able to have<br>responses to those and I think it's<br>likely<br>I think it's significantly likely<br>actually that if we had publicly<br>notified we would have got even more<br>support for the scheme given the<br>feedback and engagement we were getting<br>from other people in terms of groups and<br>stakeholders and I think we potentially<br>could have got the decision earlier and<br>possibly at a lower cost maybe not and<br>then my final bit of advice would just<br>be to engage with your neighbors early<br>in the piece that's what we did I think<br>it was really strong for us to do that I<br>think that's unparalleled to see that<br>have it developers never do that and I<br>think I always think it's best to try<br>and bring the community on this journey<br>with you especially in our case they're<br>all gonna be our neighbors and we want<br>maybe the few architects were going oh<br>my god what's all that but I think and<br>that was very detailed but what is<br>interesting for designers is which I<br>have learned a lot in this process is<br>that all of that background and all of<br>the interplay of forces in the planning<br>process which are incredibly<br>contradictory to be frank like you'll<br>get there are motivate there impetuses<br>from some parties to do this and other<br>parties to do this in<br>that makes any sense a lot of the time<br>but they physically shape what this is<br>to a really high degree like everything<br>about it has been shaped by dealing with<br>and interacting with those forces so in<br>and that will be and this is really<br>pertinent to projects like collaborative<br>housing projects and alternative housing<br>projects which will bump up against the<br>boundaries of what people consider to be<br>normal and acceptable so you need to<br>understand the planning context quite<br>intimately and this is this was some<br>rendering reproduced very late in the<br>piece to show what our cast acres looked<br>like what our vehicle crossing looked<br>like and you know it was quite detailed<br>what we were you know what we were being<br>asked for in terms of the urban the<br>urban design of the environment and then<br>we had to also say I'm sure what it<br>looked like after five years because of<br>the concerns about the the density of<br>the project that concerns about the the<br>parking area and and all that you know<br>comes back to the way that neighbors<br>perceive us and in the zoning in the in<br>the zoning is around so you really have<br>to get down to the nitty-gritty quite<br>early on since when he received the<br>consent with been through a developed<br>design process with the group and<br>because the the building is it's fairly<br>it's fairly asymmetric and complicated<br>because of the site so even though we<br>tried to achieve repetition where we<br>could we have quite a lot of units that<br>are unique and we also have 20<br>households on board and we've had to<br>develop and do a process of dealing with<br>them all as clients and we can't bespoke<br>every apartment we've been clear about<br>that from the beginning but what we've<br>learned is that every single person in<br>one of these<br>Jiggs they are an individual and you<br>actually have to treat them all as<br>individuals you can't just design you<br>know an apartment for four of them and<br>then issue that out and say please<br>confirm because it will leave it'll<br>never work<br>you actually have to have a streamlined<br>process for individually as an architect<br>treating them all as clients and and<br>that took us a while to work out and we<br>in the systems around that to manage the<br>information to manage the design has<br>been one of the interesting parts of of<br>the process so these are three of the<br>terraces and on the end here we actually<br>have stacked one bitters and then those<br>are two bit terraces C 2 and C 3 and we<br>sort of produce material like this in<br>order to get to the point where people<br>could be could know enough about their<br>apartment or the unit be happy enough<br>about how it could work we didn't we<br>haven't gone into finishers or colors or<br>all of this sort of pretty stuff that<br>you normally bring in to sell a design<br>but we needed to get far enough so that<br>people could get a decent picture of<br>and at the same time because we were<br>hitting floor and I had a contractor<br>negotiation and building consent we're<br>working on the exteriors and the more<br>communal within the communal aesthetics<br>of the building as a whole trying to<br>maintain that sense of openness and<br>simplicity that we come here and the<br>resource consent design so this is the<br>main block with the the decks being<br>developed<br>CLT sled fire rated outdoor balconies<br>brickwork and aluminum and important to<br>us is that we're not dividing these<br>and we're also one thing the last power<br>of the project at which the last part of<br>the jigsaw puzzle were trying to send in<br>this develop which is up here which we<br>are still trying to find a household for<br>and it's interesting we've found it as<br>the process has gone through that<br>getting people into the group early on<br>is relatively easy it's all very<br>exciting<br>that this you know lots of play and and<br>the unit's probably the best units are<br>available at that point or the ones that<br>make the most sense and then the last<br>two or three are really hard like people<br>I think part of it is that and this is<br>this will be common to all these sorts<br>of projects part of it is that there's<br>an established community and established<br>group that people started working<br>together and trying to come into that<br>it's just difficult but also because<br>people are wondering about the value of<br>it and it's something interesting so<br>we're still working through this one and<br>that is actually develop from the front<br>which we we want to keep within<br>co-housed as a as a unit that has all<br>the benefits of the other units but is<br>more like a heritage building like the<br>rest of the street so that's a<br>three-bedroom house for somebody which<br>we touched on the first talk on the<br>legal and financial frameworks and I put<br>up this diagram which way we're now over<br>halfway through so we completed the<br>development agreement which is actually<br>called the DFA development funding<br>agreements and that was a that was the<br>first written commitment of the group<br>members and it was a truly difficult and<br>stressful process for everybody we<br>didn't quite know what we're getting<br>ourselves in for we ended up with five<br>lawyers which I don't where we got<br>through it<br>everyone signed up it cost us too much<br>but we are now concluding the second<br>main agreement the group agreements<br>we've learned our lessons we've only got<br>one lawyer and we have a an independent<br>peer review lawyer who's from oh yes<br>sorry I'll say that yes we've we were<br>going to ohoo and they're fantastic so I<br>can recommend them can trick them into<br>highly enough and following that<br>there'll be a further agreement called<br>the unit allocation agreement which will<br>be when we're actually signing with the<br>contractor which will specify costs unit<br>sizes and other parts of the property so<br>I thought just I just wind that by also<br>updating I suppose what we see out there<br>challenges facing our project at the<br>moment and for the interests of everyone<br>who's wondering how these things<br>actually proceed we are now go to<br>starting negotiation with a preferred<br>contractor which will come up against<br>the huge issue of construction cost and<br>we will see how our our detailed design<br>in our budgets how they match<br>and what we have to do to get them to<br>match and that is a huge huge unknown<br>and a risk which could quite easily mean<br>project papacy if we are more than 10%<br>apart then will be very difficult for us<br>to bring things together and it's very<br>hard to know how that would go<br>we are most of the way through with the<br>legal process of doing this cohousing<br>project and it's quite quite a marathon<br>for groups that are contemplating it you<br>don't start off knowing where it's going<br>to end up and I think that that is quite<br>a valuable thing for people to<br>understand that they need stamina to get<br>through from starting to form a group<br>finishing up with legal units we have<br>just had a valuation prepared which the<br>bank requires in order to approve<br>funding and that's been rather poor<br>that's the valuation and this is by<br>commercial value is who value everything<br>developers projects office buildings<br>whatever and our valuation is some way<br>about what it will cost to build but not<br>as much as it should be and we've been<br>arguing with the values over and what we<br>see is<br>it's the truth value of of this project<br>and there's a lot of things that they<br>don't ascribe value to in projects like<br>this they don't believe for example that<br>the exterior courtyard open space is<br>worth very much compared to a backyard<br>on an attached house they Korea might<br>mention this but there is clearly a lack<br>of breeds in these parts of the the<br>chain in valuation in financing where<br>there's just no experience of it here so<br>the methodologies don't accommodate it<br>and we end up with you know answers that<br>make it quite difficult for us so we're<br>hoping that that's not going to be too<br>much of an issue because we have quite a<br>good equity position unlike some<br>projects but it might lead to higher<br>borrowing costs with the bank we don't<br>know and being just that leads into<br>funding and we're also getting feedback<br>on and the bank's a couple of things so<br>far have been quite positive but we do<br>have a lot of equity in the project<br>already and we've taken a lot of the<br>risk already we've bought the site<br>outright we have consent we have a<br>hundred percent presale about 95 percent<br>pre-sales and then also residents are<br>lining up their mortgages which they<br>will draw down when they actually buy<br>the units and there have been some<br>interesting conversations there we're<br>actually you probably know that better<br>than I do<br>just different terminology like we don't<br>have a standard purse sell and purchase<br>agreement it's going to be a unit<br>allocation agreement it's gonna say this<br>is very similar things but it's just not<br>gonna standard template that everyone<br>sees is their bread and butter so as<br>soon as something's different<br>I suppose people raise questions even<br>though in terms of at the end we're very<br>vanilla we're a standard unit title of<br>128 share of the land of a standard body<br>core so it's settlement we're just like<br>any if you like any other apartment<br>scheme and in my mind of it just because<br>it's different terminology and some of<br>our documents it seems to make some<br>people I suppose could lean not to know<br>if the process and what we're seeking to<br>do just the same to question what we're<br>doing yeah yeah so they just needs to be<br>more coherent projects so these<br>organizations can develop models around<br>them and get precedence and comparators<br>we just think more let's let's the<br>cool so that's a really good segue it<br>was about final points I'm her co-host<br>fan into what I'm going to talk that<br>which is an overview of the various<br>different types of models that sometimes<br>I'll get London to cohabit and then an<br>initiative that we see that which was<br>referred to before it's stared which is<br>ironic<br>what is the Society protune of having<br>development and how you can what they<br>were doing how you doing buffed if you<br>want to so why are we here we're not<br>going to need to go over all of the<br>philosophy and the ideology behind car<br>housing because I'm assuming that you're<br>here because you already know a lot<br>about that but all around the world<br>we're seeing a shift in the way that<br>people are providing housing for<br>themselves and the emergence of a whole<br>lot of new models and it's part of a<br>larger movement within the urban<br>development space around actually<br>creating more sustainable more socially<br>cohesive environments for people to live<br>work and play which is everyone's<br>favorite little catchphrase but the key<br>to them is that that citizen-driven and<br>they are community and they involve the<br>community so it's about we are a group<br>get together and they provide a solution<br>for themselves that is fit for purpose<br>and it we want to use the normal markets<br>think it's a product that they actually<br>want and that's better for beam-in for<br>the environment usually so I'm depending<br>all of them as visitor involvement<br>affordability connectivity accessibility<br>community in quality again we're not<br>gonna go into a room today often you see<br>a mixture of living and playing and this<br>concept of what you have access to this<br>is what you have ownership over and so a<br>range of the different various<br>components that can be<br>these projects that compliment the<br>resident dwellings are at makers<br>workshops co-working spaces wellness<br>spaces libraries laundry shared<br>centralized laundries games rooms car<br>parking that's shared so it starts to<br>broaden our understanding of what our<br>own individual dwelling us and that's<br>kind of really key when you start<br>thinking about the challenges that you<br>have around valuations for example<br>because all of a sudden how we value<br>houses needs to be rethought and as Tom<br>pointed out for our industry this is an<br>emerging sector and the entire pipeline<br>including architects valuers lawyers<br>accountants government AIA D councils<br>Citra need to be educated on the<br>difference in these types of models and<br>how they can enable them by changing the<br>way that we currently view housing is a<br>product in a commodity but that's real<br>change so it's gonna take some time and<br>so in the meantime we have to sort of<br>bite it off project by project which is<br>what our pioneers different today<br>so the range of models cohousing<br>obviously is probably the most commonly<br>understood we've talked about a lot this<br>property collectives or more commonly<br>seen in our market adjoint futures<br>there's housing and land cooperatives<br>and so that's cooperatives not in the<br>form of just collectively getting<br>together but actually using a<br>cooperative company structure to own and<br>to govern your legal interest so you<br>don't own a unit title you own an<br>interest or a shareholding in a<br>cooperative company there's equity<br>crowdfunded mixed-use commercial and<br>residential which is they you might have<br>heard of the coolest corner which is the<br>offerings that I heard developing and I<br>was proud of the group that see that all<br>who develop that so it's always really<br>nice to hear that people are using them<br>and that they are doing great stuff like<br>prevailing with legal services because<br>that was the intention<br>socially minded building so for a lot of<br>you and have<br>participate in our existing industry<br>Bukovina is very bubbling away and<br>there's lots of projects that are coming<br>up we've got Julie here down the front<br>who's doing a very community-minded<br>voter in so instead of just building for<br>people that building with the intention<br>of enabling most people who live there<br>to actively participate in the<br>governance and operation and the<br>management so that they get greater<br>buy-in to to their apartment and it's<br>not just perceived as as a kind of<br>rental like we do most commonly in New<br>Zealand public higher are obviously huge<br>movement their betters that is<br>essentially a cohousing model I mean I'm<br>not an experiment and go into it but she<br>is a lot of the same principles and<br>underlying values and they have the same<br>challenges around getting the<br>traditional finances to acknowledge they<br>having an interest that's not a freehold<br>title it's the leasehold title and so<br>they are actually paving the way in<br>terms of creating models that can the<br>usual can be replicated all those<br>slightly changed so if there's a lot of<br>learning we can we can get from that<br>model land trusts Community Land Trust<br>and particularly be really popular<br>around the world and a movement in New<br>Zealand and Hamilton and particularly to<br>set one up but again we haven't yet<br>successfully done it as after-hour which<br>I apologize for their pronunciation but<br>that's sort of a nice in-between model<br>we you master plan a space and you<br>cohesively design within a community and<br>then you get the economies of scale by<br>building it to maybe get the same<br>contractor to build all four of them<br>closely packed together but they're all<br>still very individually designed um<br>incident actually it does get model so<br>comment all of them in and tend to touch<br>on this before is that there is a<br>actually cost savings whether that's<br>cost savings because you get greater<br>value or whether there is actually cost<br>savings because of the way that the<br>building is designed and you share some<br>paced spaces in here<br>smaller private space but you actually<br>have a collectively shared area so you<br>all split the cost of it how that<br>actually transpires into a ind number is<br>still a different it's different between<br>it to the project so Nitin now for<br>example will tell you that you'll save<br>about fifteen percent and there's a<br>property collectives model in Australia<br>and they say between fifteen and twenty<br>percent savings from buying at the open<br>market and obviously that comes down to<br>and there's no developer personal<br>development margin but there are a<br>number of other customs which will touch<br>on the later side governance management<br>and operations so when you collectively<br>designing you're pulling together a lot<br>of people and and Tom touched on you've<br>got a lot of people's own opinions and<br>it's their home so they obviously are<br>very like emotionally attached to the<br>outcome and they want that to be a good<br>one a good outcome so how you<br>collectively make decisions how you<br>arrange the finances how you have even<br>group meetings and there's lots of<br>different you know decision-making<br>processes that people go through<br>then there's the management and the<br>operation of the actual half in dwelling<br>and development itself and most commonly<br>we see things like your body Court preps<br>and residents associations which are<br>another set of rules than legal<br>documents this essentially set out how<br>you're gonna live and collegially dwelve<br>Anna Morgan in a closer kind of a<br>environment than you would in a<br>traditional standalone dweller<br>alternative financing and legal<br>arrangements so if any of you have<br>actually started a project you'll you'll<br>realize there's Tom point to that that<br>the current system is just makes it<br>really hard because they don't<br>fundamentally understand the principles<br>behind what we're doing and that doesn't<br>fit into our existing legal documents so<br>every time you say something to Al it to<br>a lawyer that doesn't go under to a<br>template it's gonna cost you about four<br>times as much and so every time you try<br>and talk to them about what you're<br>trying to achieve the layering on<br>while they try and work it out<br>themselves<br>and while they you know look into<br>precedents and they price in the risk of<br>writing bespoke documents and while they<br>try to make sure that each of the<br>individual residents is giving their own<br>legal opinions about stuff so that they<br>are all protected from each other so<br>basically our our entire legal in<br>financing structures just incentivizing<br>this kind of development and making it<br>really hard and suddenly not making it<br>easy to scale very quickly so that's<br>yeah and the different motivations and<br>end outcomes as I guess what underpins<br>all of these projects and what the<br>current industry needs to be educated on<br>so I'm not gonna run through all of<br>these because I kind of did it in the<br>other side but just so you can kind of<br>see a physical layout of the difference<br>this is what we call usually a property<br>cooperative or joint venture or a<br>partnership model and basically it's<br>just where you get together and you<br>build townhouses side-by-side and the<br>one interesting does the development and<br>and they all split off and you meet<br>individually own your own house and you<br>can have a fence up next to each other<br>and you couldn't even see each other<br>ever again if you don't want to so<br>that's kind of closest to the to a<br>normal sort of townhouse development you<br>just do it by yourself without a<br>developer and use your own money but<br>there's not as many of the housing<br>principles that underpin it then you get<br>a little bit further along the spectrum<br>and you get to this connected community<br>living which and if song was probably<br>something that you've all project you've<br>all heard about or Dahlia village and in<br>Whanganui where you have a common space<br>that you all live on that you saw an<br>individually owned your own titles and<br>you have a one shear one proportionate<br>share in the common spaces<br>there's various different aspects in<br>terms of how much community living and<br>you do in some of them have residents<br>associations or embody corporates for<br>fish that govern the shared spaces and<br>some of them don't - some of them just<br>you live in your own house that you're a<br>part of a wider community and you may<br>have maybe got some cost savings because<br>of of the design and being more<br>affordable from having economies of<br>scale when they built the buildings<br>themselves that cohousing this the most<br>common wine obviously Tom um has gone<br>through this and that's just a sort of<br>same vision of his legal in the<br>financing structure behind it usually<br>apartment style and so I guess from a<br>design point of view and when you start<br>thinking about this collective<br>development models there's heaps and<br>heaps and heaps of different design<br>considerations and it really depends on<br>what your group is trying to achieve in<br>terms of which of these models is<br>actually beast and a lot of people don't<br>realize that you can so we're working<br>with a group at the moment who we're<br>about to subdivide and so before that<br>even thought about what they were trying<br>to achieve in terms of a dwelling<br>outcome and so there's a lot of sort of<br>thinking that needs to go on upfront and<br>work with groups around what is it that<br>you actually are wanting to achieve is<br>it your dwelling like what do you want<br>to do with your dwelling and then what's<br>the best model in terms of how you might<br>legally go about coming together to<br>develop that so they kind of actually do<br>significantly impact each other I said<br>this was there how do you eat there cost<br>savings so a common to a lot of these<br>projects and this is actually the<br>Nightingale costings and for the first<br>project so it's obviously not directly<br>applicable to all projects but there's<br>no marketing teams don't advertising<br>pays you know displace rate no real<br>estate agents no basement car packing no<br>second bathrooms not individual hundreds<br>no services individual services so<br>there's just some very tangible is<br>around how they become<br>affordable and because of the way that<br>you obviously get a group of people<br>together and you have co.design and<br>there's to various different degrees<br>sometimes we call it framing the freedom<br>because we don't have everybody with all<br>of their ideas co designing the whole<br>project or you'd never get anywhere but<br>because you've got a group of people who<br>you generally you've solved your<br>pre-sales and you you know what you<br>product you're building and you're not<br>speculating it market all of a sudden<br>all of these layers of cost that are a<br>part of traditional development are no<br>longer required and these sorts of<br>projects so property cooperatives that<br>this is am probably the next step that<br>we're about to see emerge in new zealand<br>so we're working with a group in<br>kitty-kitty now close to developments<br>and they committed to setting up the<br>first property cooperative using the<br>co-operative Companies Act so in this<br>model you don't actually own a unit<br>title you still have exclusive right to<br>your dwelling that you own an interest<br>or a shareholding within the<br>co-operative Companies Act and you buy<br>in with a equivalent to a deposit which<br>is roughly around 6:15 today so<br>depending final numbers and you pay<br>what's essentially just a rental but you<br>have perpetual rights to that area so<br>you can't be kicked out to your dwelling<br>you have the ability to excellent to<br>sell enter still receive a part of what<br>we would know as the capital gain or the<br>uplift in value although not this not<br>the complete entirety of the of that if<br>you were selling it a normal drawing out<br>individually it market you have against<br>the Malheur body corporate residents<br>association to a structure structures<br>around how you actually<br>in development when it's finished but<br>you also have a a cooperative board and<br>for want of a better word which has<br>often external parties to the actual<br>residents that live there and they're<br>often professionals and they help assist<br>with the development of these projects<br>in the first place and then they help<br>people to actually keep themselves stood<br>up and established so this model it's<br>well supported in European countries and<br>they actually have the government or<br>councils who involved in the<br>establishment of cooperatives and they<br>see that specific funds and make land<br>available within the public read<br>Holdings to enable cooperative housing<br>developments because they are a more<br>scalable model for creating virtually<br>affordable housing and Tim touched on<br>the affordable housing space and his<br>fetch a lot of these Co housing models<br>like we know them to traditional Co<br>housing models that we see emerging here<br>they're not necessarily that scalable in<br>that that's still quite unaffordable for<br>a large majority of people what property<br>cooperatives have the potential to do is<br>to unlock their affordability and there<br>is good progress being made with<br>organizations I HRC so homes in the<br>community around giving them committed<br>to setting aside about 20 to 30 percent<br>of their land holdings for supporting<br>other development that's not large<br>scales be killer those market lead<br>development and so by working out this<br>model and it requires a whole new legal<br>framework in a whole new way of the<br>bank's understanding your legal interest<br>and the value is value in the property<br>the way that its surveyed exeter exeter<br>what these models what this model will<br>do and it will be open sourced by closer<br>development so and once figured it out<br>as it actually provides new zealand with<br>a chance to like switzerland take a step<br>towards providing more<br>affordable housing options that are<br>using a model that is is resident lead<br>it creates autonomy it integrates other<br>aspects of living not just homes but<br>schools education workshops libraries<br>all the other immunity and so it's put<br>so it's essentially creating a new part<br>of it what we currently have in our<br>housing spectrum from you know like<br>emergency has been social housing<br>affordable housing but they're<br>speculative development having<br>essentially creating an entire new part<br>of the market that provides higher<br>quality sustainable socially cohesive<br>and having options for for people and<br>then the underlying ownership of these<br>so some of those can be resistant lead<br>so you you don't need an independent<br>agency and then when you get to sort of<br>the most socialist or progressive I'm in<br>the picture a lot of the land and<br>cooperatives in Zurich and particularly<br>is actually put as put into a Community<br>Land Trust which means that the land<br>aspect is taken out of the equation and<br>therefore you're only buying and selling<br>the housing and the dwelling on top of<br>the land and the land is particularly<br>interest for perpetuity which means that<br>it can never be impacted by the ups and<br>downs of the market and therefore you<br>keep housing in an affordable mutually<br>affordable right and forever<br>there is a whole science behind these<br>and again we won't go into that right<br>because where you're architects and very<br>dry as it is um so what are we doing<br>about all this so we've set up an<br>incorporated society and we so I am a<br>partner at a company called the urban<br>advisory and we are a group we're part<br>of a group of organizations that are<br>working in the space of the alternative<br>development models over was mentioned<br>before there's a number of other<br>organizations that are position<br>selves to help facilitate and offer<br>services to these sorts of projects but<br>aside from that there's a whole bunch of<br>people who really keen to enable and to<br>remove the barriers that we're seeing to<br>these these projects that will so we<br>decided they would see that been<br>incorporated society so that is going to<br>advocate government in council that's<br>going to be an educator it's going to<br>inform people of the options and it's<br>going to provide information in the<br>forms of templates or legal documents<br>that people would like to be shared and<br>open sourced and it will also bring<br>community create community by hosting<br>events and bringing people who are<br>interested and being a part of these<br>projects and then also help people stick<br>to the process of going okay well if<br>we're going to co-develop<br>how do we do that Tommen pointed out<br>there's many complications to doing that<br>so the purposes of society won't read<br>through those but it's about creating<br>connection and forming promoting these<br>alternative housing rules removing the<br>barriers and that will require for us to<br>be able to scale these projects of all<br>Crowley to sort of change and then<br>actually encourage or support neighbors<br>to do this to do these projects who is<br>it for residents industry capsule and<br>government so we're going to take a<br>three-pronged approach and because to<br>actually enable these projects all three<br>parts of the puzzle need to sort of<br>understand someone mentioned before that<br>there was the issue around use of<br>language so there's a whole piece around<br>actually when we talk about what<br>cohousing is and when we use a certain<br>language making it really clear what we<br>mean and that will actually help us to<br>navigate through some of the issues that<br>we were experiencing with gangs and<br>finances in the worst situation so the<br>principles of the society much like for<br>housing themselves is that it's around<br>and we're Co designing it in the<br>this in the priorities and so we want to<br>make sure that's really relevant to<br>everybody for its members and<br>particularly so the most I'm probably<br>comparative was society is prefab indeed<br>so they went through some of the process<br>that we're going through now at the<br>beginning and it since shifted slightly<br>but if you think about what prefab was<br>to our industry you know five years even<br>five years ago and and how far we've<br>come as an industry and responding to<br>that and we have the same aspirations<br>for the society for alternative<br>development obviously there's democratic<br>elections and committee members can be<br>but and transparency and openness to<br>information and so that anyone who wants<br>to be involved<br>I'm is welcome to be involved as you can<br>see there was a lot of power<br>he's chap did I said to cut her hey so<br>this is a summary of that again all this<br>information is made available online but<br>basic claim that this is your building<br>off the good work but term has started<br>in terms of providing a platform for<br>education and moving right through to<br>the legislative changes is it this end<br>goal you can join us without dollars or<br>you can actually just follow along<br>website which we have not yet so lots<br>going on apologies for that the more<br>Lego governance oriented part of used to<br>be a lawyer that yeah for now if you are<br>interested and you can see me anymore<br>you can check me later and I think these<br>so we put some microphones here that<br>we're gonna Rove around Karstens gonna<br>take the round and do them so any<br>questions of any of our three presenters<br>any ones for the question come on don't<br>be shy<br>I haven't you sir so just just for the<br>benefit of this because we're podcasters<br>he's the minister Twyford interested in<br>this that was your question sir so one<br>of the drivers behind sitting out the<br>incorporated Society actually it was<br>because we'd had several conversation<br>informal conversations with the minister<br>about and this seeker and he said that<br>yeah they were thinking about it but<br>there wasn't really a unified voice that<br>was creating the urgency on the other<br>end and that they weren't hearing that<br>they needed to put dedicated results<br>towards enabling these products so<br>actually that was one of the reasons why<br>we decided to set up a formal entity to<br>okay for the grayling development I was<br>interested in knowing how it started for<br>example who owned the land<br>and how big is the piece of land and<br>then was it all interested parties and<br>friends that wanted to live together and<br>do something you know the very very<br>creation it was started by two families<br>and and we knew about half a dozen other<br>people who were vaguely interested in<br>the idea and then we went about looking<br>for land but nothing happens until<br>you've actually got an accepted offer on<br>a piece of land but that's a big step<br>because you've got to decide how big is<br>the land I mean that's 2,400 square<br>meters it's a very big site for Center<br>orphans we were looking for smaller<br>sites different zone sites but I mean<br>there is deciding what what the land<br>what sort of land you want determines<br>how much money how many units and we're<br>going to be pretty much everything so<br>that might take you quite a while just<br>units on that side cont you I'm afraid<br>not<br>I think if you ask any planners they'll<br>say we've really got quite a few on<br>already thank you we'll just go hello<br>and going back to the project in Milan<br>was that led by the council or national<br>government and in theory could it be led<br>by counsel the project I didn't speak so<br>well on that one but to expand a little<br>it was funded by a non-profit fund<br>basically and I'm not quite it wasn't<br>council it was it basically wasn't us it<br>was it wasn't the state was not involved<br>put it that way but it is social housing<br>so that in Europe that's that's not that<br>unusual but they have quite a quite a<br>big non<br>profit finance sector in Italy compared<br>with here that's for sure<br>yeah does that answer your question I I<br>don't see personally I mean that's open<br>to speculation a little bit I mean I<br>think there are other examples of<br>similar kinds of housing in Europe that<br>I'm less aware of but possibly Austria I<br>I don't see why not in the sense that<br>council already and and national<br>government already contracts people to<br>help build communities and nurture<br>communities so there's no this I don't<br>see any issue any particular barrier to<br>that happening I'm you know it might<br>well have to contract out for specialist<br>services but but would still be the<br>state acting why not serve back to use<br>just figure the microphone please sir<br>and people get to know about it<br>then it'll be you will attract in<br>like-minded people which is actually a<br>very positive thing because you'll have<br>the models started and you've obviously<br>something's happening in Europe and that<br>is a really big thing to attract it's<br>just like people are attracted into<br>different areas of the city because I<br>think one's trendy and the other one is<br>sort of just to expand on that previous<br>question well we wait for someone else's<br>question I'm use your points are very<br>valid and we're already are creating<br>that groundswell of interest and just by<br>some of the projects that are going in<br>here and is we're hosting a<br>co-development 101c should on the 25th<br>of March and it sold out in four hours<br>so that was um just demonstrates the<br>demands that seventy-five tickets<br>and that back to the council could<br>cancel facilitate those very much so and<br>so actually there's a project in the c40<br>competition that pinoke is running and a<br>Dan Henderson in one of the consulate in<br>that competition are actually proposing<br>a similar model and so what we really<br>need the council's in the government in<br>a Chelsea and panocha and these sorts of<br>organizations to do is to understand how<br>they incentivize and support the<br>initiation of these larger scale<br>communities of what is essentially<br>affordable housing but as a very<br>different spin on affordable housing as<br>term mentioned before is sort of Vina<br>has majority of people live in social<br>housing but these social housing is not<br>what we would consider social housing<br>and so it's it's about completely<br>changing how we think about housing in<br>New Zealand and especially with rental<br>and Awakening everybody to the broad<br>array of options that actually are out<br>there in a prevalent all through Europe<br>and they're only just becoming an issue<br>for New Zealand because we were only<br>just starting to realize that we are<br>having we're becoming an urban<br>environment and we have pressures on<br>housing surprisingly just one thing to<br>add in terms of the estate in<br>Milan they have a specific role called a<br>social administrator which sounds<br>terrible it's like it sounds like<br>someone who's gonna organize a party or<br>something but it's it's really someone<br>who's a community builder so that's an<br>ongoing role so that's a way in which<br>you know if we think about traditional<br>cohousing it's it's a model where there<br>is co.design and this is an intentional<br>community formed well ahead of building<br>but if you're in a situation where<br>you've essentially already built the<br>the estate the the structure it's built<br>being built for people or designed for<br>people that rather than buy them then<br>there are other mechanisms and the<br>social administrator in that situation<br>is the role that assists with community<br>building as I say much in the same way<br>that agencies already do here with<br>community building all right one more<br>last question we'll just finish off you<br>sir thank you<br>taking the the grayling development as<br>an example how well do you have in place<br>rules about people subsequently renting<br>out the units that they've been funded<br>and built and I suppose that the bigger<br>question is with the the cohousing idea<br>in general how do you you stop the<br>normal free market forces taking the<br>idea removing the affordability going<br>forwards of those developments and also<br>the social cohesion that comes with I<br>guess owners and people that have<br>invested time into that against people<br>just kind of moving in and out as<br>tenants I we we're not an affordable<br>development wink we we say they're<br>reasonably affordable where with the<br>location is too good<br>the lands too expensive and so on we in<br>terms of the philosophy of a development<br>being soured our view is that when the<br>way these things are set up they will<br>self select who goes into them so<br>because you have to bump up against your<br>neighbor more than as normal you have to<br>engage with people you can't be a loan<br>associate path in one of these<br>developments you just won't want to be<br>there you won't be there she's got a for<br>director you won't be there you've got<br>Tim canoes you won't be there if you've<br>got a you know all the sorts of people<br>who are unlikely to you know who would<br>spoil let's figure probably won't be<br>there in the first place we are<br>addressing quite a lot as issues around<br>resale tenancy in our group agreement at<br>the moment interesting process we have<br>decided as a group that we are not<br>against renting we're actually against<br>because there are people I mean this is<br>just our development it's not<br>necessarily applicable but everyone who<br>comes in who ends up with the unit will<br>have invested a lot of energy time as<br>well as money in it and people we know<br>that people want to hang on to it even<br>if for some reason they can't they can't<br>continue to live there if someone gets a<br>job overseas they want to go away for<br>two years and come back we want to make<br>sure that it can happen but we want<br>renters to be treated well so with we're<br>going to have rules around around rental<br>ten years around tenants being every bit<br>as much as the community as people who<br>own when I say rules I mean you can you<br>know dictate that stuff but we want to<br>make setup the conditions for that to<br>happen you can perhaps talk about<br>affordability<br>all right I think first of all I think</p></main><footer
