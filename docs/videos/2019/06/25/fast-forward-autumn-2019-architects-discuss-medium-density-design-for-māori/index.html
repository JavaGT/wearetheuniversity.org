This semester we continue our focus on the question: How can we do medium density well? This series is proudly supported by GIB®.<br><br>Architects Discuss Medium Density Design for Māori<br><br>Iwi are increasingly finding their own solutions for their people. In this talk, we will hear from three architectural practices that have worked on projects with local iwi and hapū: Cheshire Architects and TOA. These presentations will look at completed and in-progress projects as well as those on the drawing board, followed by a panel and audience discussion.<br><br>--<br><br>For more information about our

to<br>again with a karakia in we find it<br>useful and and and in this kind of<br>context but also in our day-to-day<br>business at war because recognizing the<br>everyone's had a busy day at work or at<br>uni has been stuck in traffic so the<br>idea is to kind of say some words to<br>kind of bring us into the room bring us<br>a present they kind of wait all the<br>day-to-day stuff washing away in so you<br>can absorb what we're about to tell you<br>today so if we'd all like to just it's<br>and when I say Hermia who year they want<br>sate IKEA at the end of it we Rotter are<br>aware aware

8<br>years ago so tall it's Marty for<br>strength bravery and cutting new ground<br>and we're made up of a collective of 19<br>individuals from many different cultures<br>and we embrace culture and it's not<br>we're going to speak speak about medium<br>density and also the ideas that we've<br>got in terms of the housing realm and<br>addressing the problems and issues that<br>we think that our city and nation sort<br>of hold so marine modular housing this<br>is something that kind of came across<br>I'm not sure if many of you remember the<br>Walker for the Walker Molly the big<br>exhibition spaces down on the waterfront<br>in 2011 realtor Blair brother of Nate<br>Amelia came and saw me one day and his<br>he's got this whole team called either<br>town events and they assemble stages so<br>the likes of you - all the stages that<br>at the various concert venues these guys<br>fed enable and they assemble these<br>stages and a very short amount of time<br>and we we put together basically a 700<br>square meter facility and 11 days and he<br>came and saw me and he said look I've<br>got all of these guys when they're not<br>putting together a stage actually just<br>sort of sitting there so they're not<br>trained builders but actually they've<br>got skills to offer they're willingly<br>able in there willing to go so he said<br>I'm looking at this little patch of land<br>and middle I can we do a house that's<br>kind of the of<br>similar kind of elk and I just sort of<br>thought well it sort of makes sense and<br>we've done a number of partnerships or<br>explorations X lam CLT approached us and<br>asked us to design low-cost housing for<br>to fully tour and we found that each of<br>the products so whether it's EPS or CLT<br>they all hits in here in strengths but<br>actually because they're so busy<br>guarding there the one little patch they<br>didn't realize that it wasn't the best<br>for everything so therefore CLT is by<br>far from our understanding there be the<br>flooring system that you can get because<br>it's a I think cam this is the diagram<br>here just of a simple diagram but<br>essentially you can lay 200 square<br>meters of it in two hours so we<br>understood that the CRT was the was<br>unstoppable in terms of a floor system<br>but casita systems for the walls<br>actually needed to come from others<br>other places so with our particular the<br>modular muddy house where we've got a<br>number of set designs and that's been a<br>really interesting sort of process<br>because we basically go from a a service<br>provider whose architects to supplying a<br>product to the market so you know the<br>whole idea of a we kind of almost the<br>sales process everything and so so<br>you're going from basically doing<br>drawings and charging for a building<br>consent to a crowd of people that<br>basically don't see the value in that<br>they just want a house so that's been<br>quite an eye opener and ambition start<br>to do a thousand of these by and the you<br>know next year<br>good luck but we've done the the first<br>one is coming together and Hawke's Bay<br>and I'm very proud to say I think that<br>some girl from a little bit of a<br>political range here that I think one of<br>the fundamental mistakes that the<br>government made was announcing a a an<br>affordability about 650 I don't know who<br>they asked who they thought was what who<br>thought 650 was an affordable number<br>about what what they've done is<br>particular if you go to the industry<br>as part of the problem in terms of<br>escalating costs and we all know why<br>it's complicated sort of sector but we<br>were like won't you flip that on its<br>head and go how do you create something<br>that's like a product and so you know we<br>came up with this idea so the first<br>one's going and Napier and it is for a<br>solid dad and his daughter and so<br>$450,000 for his house including the<br>land purchase as well so we we're<br>working with the property group to work<br>out what the payback vectors are and I<br>think what we're finding not<br>surprisingly is that the rent the rent<br>that well almost most of us are paying<br>you can actually be paying your own<br>mortgage so it's been quite a<br>interesting process so we've got a<br>number of designs and we've just sort of<br>set these renders up and different<br>locations through three old Seattle and<br>we're working with a number of Erie to<br>deliver these so and we also working<br>with a number of individuals so the idea<br>is that essentially the the flat-pack<br>floor Tunes up we work at the moment<br>were three different wall suppliers but<br>essentially our concision is the main<br>supplier and they do a 12 minutes cos<br>it's from cladding through the electrics<br>right through to the interior lining and<br>the windows 12 meters and 55 minutes so<br>they literally can put out five of these<br>houses per day and we're not saying it's<br>the answer to everything but I think<br>there we are in crisis mode and I think<br>actually some big disruptions have to<br>yes so we've just come up with a number<br>of different arrangements and designs<br>including the two two-story the<br>patterning on the front this one here we<br>actually want to make region-specific so<br>we've got some artists in house that are<br>working on different designs that are<br>respondent to the end of the jaw areas<br>and Ciardi actually seems to me on the<br>before we got here and we set this thing<br>off and he said to me am i said what's<br>the package look like and he said I'm<br>not sure does the muddy modular house<br>button today and I thought the privates<br>about me you know but I'm effectively<br>its R&amp;D for stack versions because we<br>all know an Auckland especially that<br>land you know the house and building<br>cost alone isn't actually the<br>fundamental problem but you put that<br>live the house the house and the land<br>cost and it becomes truly unaffordable<br>so again we're working with the property<br>group to work out the feasibility for<br>these but we can effectively do a three<br>or four story the bottom level has to do<br>there has to be a concrete slab but<br>effectively it brings the price right<br>down and I think we can assemble each<br>house on site I think it's 13 weeks as<br>opposed to 13 months for a completed<br>sort of unit so we're very very proud of<br>that our calling a whole I'm gonna take<br>up for a moment here in hand over 30 rd<br>but this was we approached by Auckland<br>idea thanksful and to to create a set of<br>muddy design principles on non muddy<br>length and obviously charity will give<br>you his version of things but I found<br>this an incredible experience first of<br>all Fogler said stop drawing<br>architecture that put the pins down and<br>let's talk about values let's talk about<br>processes you know already you know<br>these things that occur in traditional<br>Maori life like what does that how do we<br>translate that into a modern world<br>context and I think that by the end of<br>this process and Chad you'll walk you<br>through this particular scheme that we<br>came up with it wasn't a seen trick<br>there's so many things that we've<br>fundamentally believed even that Somali<br>design principle was actually good for<br>everyone a breeze community it creates<br>somewhere that I think you know I'd be<br>proud to you know bring my child up in<br>and so yeah it's something that we feel<br>really passionate about so Oh hand of<br>yeah and I would like to acknowledge and<br>fill in Olivia at open counsel also<br>motto idiot so you're kind of as<br>necklacee me we've really focused on the<br>design principles and and and getting<br>the values right before we actually put<br>pen to paper of an actual design and<br>then we had so once we started the<br>design process we had this set of<br>principles that we could check a check<br>back with what we were designing you<br>know are we on the right path you know<br>is it achieve all the things that all<br>the you know aspirational design things<br>that we were wanting and so that became<br>a real strength to set you know like we<br>can look at it or look at the other type<br>of confident to know that it is you know<br>doing what we wanted it to do because of<br>those the strength of those values and<br>principles in something as we like to do<br>a torch and in line with the idea I'm<br>having strong design principles there's<br>also use of a narrative and so drawing<br>and drawing a story from from the local<br>area but also it captures the essence of<br>the of the cocoa part of the project so<br>and we kind of run that use it<br>throughout the design process is this<br>like guiding light that kind of helps us<br>navigate you know the construction and<br>design pathway and link to the you know<br>the building that we probably hopefully<br>get it's not so the the this housing<br>project was located on Glen Innes and<br>the old the moldy name for Glen Innes is<br>Vitoria which means that the stacking of<br>what along the beach line there on the<br>inlet and so we kind of thought well<br>this work what does this Walker thing so<br>but you know what you do Terrace housing<br>to kind of bring the cost of the land<br>down<br>so the more numbers we could stack up as<br>far as terraced housing we could bring<br>the cost down so again bring it to the<br>affordable level so we thought well<br>those tiers houses are like the fast<br>Walker in the professional families you<br>know the other single health worker but<br>and one of the other kopo kopo was was<br>to bring in this idea of<br>intergenerational housing and for that<br>well we took on the the content of the<br>horse or the double canoe sibling we<br>look at it that our ancestors traveled<br>from the islands to New Zealand and you<br>could imagine in those days you would<br>have you know grandma and granddad on<br>the Walker mum and day but also the<br>grandkids so you kind of got like all<br>the finer on the Walker and so there was<br>kind of a concert for the<br>intergenerational house so kind of like<br>two two houses that kind of can function<br>as one or can function separately but<br>they had this large living Dickens space<br>outdoor space which is kind of like<br>they're connected between the two and we<br>there was being most of the day-to-day<br>life so this is my concepts kitchen and<br>I kind of someone see I draw like a<br>ten-year-old but I think if the<br>ten-year-old can understand the drawing<br>from a communication point of view the<br>ending you know most people will and and<br>when you're pitching to go metoya<br>or children or adults you know you want<br>you want to be on the same page and<br>understand what you're doing so from a<br>communication point of view I think it's<br>successful so is it then the thought you<br>might be able to read it but those are<br>the principles and the next kind of<br>us-china state how we've achieved the<br>principle through through the design in<br>so we've gone from the sketch to a<br>diagram to kind of ease into the<br>architectural plans because not<br>everyone's an architect not everyone can<br>read plans<br>but you can see one of one of the big<br>differences and this plane is is no car<br>parking so we prioritized people and so<br>we've brought people in through the<br>center and so who's the the the Moldy<br>welcome the porphyry ritual to kind of<br>describe how their experience how people<br>will move through the space into a<br>larger gathering area so if we go back<br>to the the concept of the Emily you know<br>people were like what is and they're<br>coming through like the water and then<br>they will rest in the pond ER and you<br>see the two that the housing there the<br>terraced housing lined up and then at<br>the back of the site is these kind of<br>waka hourua<br>kind of coil it's kind of semi courtyard<br>house tiles with a range of communal<br>areas throughout the site to bring<br>people together so to solve the car<br>parking thing with created a podium and<br>input car parking underneath so not not<br>a full underground car park but a half<br>level so it allows us to hide the car<br>parking but it also becomes a a cupboard<br>space that you know you could have your<br>CrossFit and you know basketball or<br>something maybe you know you're like so<br>kids can play on the view also and then<br>yeah that's just showing how the these<br>intergenerational houses can work and I<br>do is there they they can function as<br>one home as I see it with one larger one<br>would have a larger living area where<br>all the finer can congregate but it's<br>bono grown the kids move out you need<br>these huge rooms you can kind of cope<br>you know locate yourself from one of<br>those one of the wings and either rent<br>or sell the other so<br>gives you the ability when when your<br>kids move back home because they've got<br>kids they can come back and start to<br>inhabit the other wing so kind of its<br>prominent from an intergenerational<br>point of view allows you to kind of have<br>that flexibility with living this is the<br>X on a metric you can and one of the<br>little sneaky things is we kind of had<br>this loft space so we thought this put<br>anything up there so it can be habited<br>but it's not really for area you know so<br>you can put beanbags and/or mattress and<br>crash out the I stayed in a hotel and<br>Berlin and they had something like that<br>so that's kind of like I thought this is<br>such a great idea and there's just some<br>images of how we conceptualized it and<br>the idea that you know really valuing<br>this idea of people coming together in a<br>you know city you know a seat out on the<br>pathway so that you know some an elderly<br>person can kind of take a risk as they<br>walk to their house and so it's better<br>sitting on your property so it's like<br>you're giving back to the community and<br>also I look at in cleanliness and<br>something I noticed when I walked to<br>workers as well the parents sit on those<br>steps and they wave to the kids as they<br>go to school and and I think that those<br>kids look like they're rock stars you<br>know on their way to school and I<br>thought that's such a great way to start<br>their day and so I thought you know I<br>would like that to kind of happen in<br>there's a school just across the road<br>from this site it was like one of the<br>good guys at work to do that we glue the<br>Rangers here but so we put a bit more<br>work into it and just yeah the idea of<br>just it ones involved but you also have<br>your private your own private courtyard<br>as well so kind of like having layers of<br>communal Gardens and communal<br>playgrounds and I'm definitely out works<br>and stuff yeah and like an amphitheater<br>just for for gathering and communal<br>activities light sabers and my daddy<br>keep festivals and so my heat ah he is<br>like another quite cool project it with<br>joiners with maintains a mental health<br>provider during housing for people were<br>you know minor levels of mental health<br>but it for a lot of some of these people<br>they they they'll have a job and in a<br>day to day life but they might have an<br>episode and in need need here so they<br>might go into a mental health unit for<br>for care for a couple months come out<br>and they're fine but they've lost the<br>accommodation and they lost a job and<br>from there their lives just spiraled<br>down and can become worse than when they<br>started so mine say he wants her to<br>create a residential facility where they<br>would have where these people would not<br>lose their homes no matter what so they<br>could go in to get care for themselves<br>come back in there they're not their<br>lives haven't changed and they've<br>they've got a community of support that<br>that's there to reprimand them and and<br>be there for them and so again we use<br>the kind of that day the idea that<br>narrative so we looked at the the story<br>of what allows us is the ancestor Damo<br>nuku some say was a twenty fire in the<br>harbor and the story of Turku pinger or<br>taro minor coup which is the safety net<br>so when you're out peddling your walker<br>as you do you don't did the story is you<br>don't stop peddling if you're crossing<br>the same bar you got to keep going until<br>you reach the cupola outside of my new<br>coup which is a safe path and the harbor<br>and so we thought well let's take that<br>idea of a safety<br>and for the resonance so the residential<br>wings or two weddings of residential to<br>workers and in between it is this idea<br>of the safety near the the communal<br>areas but how they what keeps them<br>protected and supported and that's just<br>yes the landscape heading over the fish<br>especially taro minor crew and the to<br>residential wings as well as a communal<br>facilities down the bottom near with<br>communal Gardens and what mental health<br>which is something we're doing quite a<br>bit of work in we talk about four Modi<br>it's a lot of issues that come from<br>their disconnects disconnection and so<br>the three things that I sort of focus on<br>a connection to health sorry connection<br>to to the veena WA connection to the<br>lane in that environment connection to<br>cultures or poplar and our<br>stories and also connection to ourselves<br>and our own personal identity in<br>community gardens is just a great way to<br>just keep get in touch with the lanes<br>and as well as grow more gardens and<br>stuff so here's a window with Donna you<br>can see that the two Walker<br>so you so that Walker prowess and it's<br>forming we call it a while all but you<br>know you might not recognize that as a<br>war but the idea is that a few<br>intentions are good<br>you're welcome to enter but if your<br>intentions are bad they're those two<br>forms kind of look ominous and it might<br>thanks Ari apartments so everyone heard<br>of vinegar Lane and the pond smoothie so<br>it's been quite interesting so it's the<br>side of the old vinegar factory do I see<br>of any effect she that was there for<br>some 80 years I think and a number of<br>developers sort of tried some stuff it<br>was a big hole there sometime which they<br>fooled in and half the site was a<br>commercial development of the second run<br>from progressive I think they did<br>rhubarb Lane before that so it's quite<br>an incredible development and the fact<br>that they're all freehold titles so the<br>smaller site that we got to deal with<br>was I think eighty eight square meters<br>so in an urban context that's quite<br>fascinating right because you kind of<br>get these really kind of complex sites<br>and so we've got three sites and vinegar<br>laying two have been completed this is<br>one of them and this is on the biggest<br>site that we dealt with was 376<br>screenreader footprint so the size of a<br>half other site and Ponsonby but we've<br>got 20 units on it and which was quite a<br>quite a number and I think what was<br>interesting about that process is really<br>was a design panel and I wish Brady was<br>here actually so I think another stick<br>and we kind of got challenged on the<br>fact that we were trying to make these<br>affordable and I don't think it was the<br>fact that it was that they were kind of<br>below 500 thousand that was the panel's<br>problem but a lot of the the other<br>apartment that we did across the way was<br>276 square meters in there was only four<br>apartments but that's what that<br>particular developer wanted and he sort<br>of the Airbnb and they kind of largely<br>empty from what I understand and we<br>don't want that and we just thought it<br>was quite a curious thing that the<br>design panel was really encouraging for<br>bigger footprints which mean you know<br>there were<br>leaving some kind of standard I wasn't<br>really kind of sure but we were really<br>kind of challenging that and we want<br>them to be affordable the first one that<br>was solved was admittedly by a student's<br>father bought it for his son<br>it's hot money but it is actually full<br>of younger people so when you go I'm<br>really proud every time we go there you<br>see sort of someone on a singlet just<br>you know early 20s rocking up there in<br>living there and that was a big<br>conscious move on our part and and the<br>developers part as well so we're very<br>fortunate than that so one of the things<br>that we are really trying to explore it<br>towards the idea of vertical public<br>liner and so what does that look like<br>and so the idea of a public owner we<br>work there we played there we trained<br>for warfare you had you did everything<br>and you're your home rocky in some<br>somehow that whole message has been<br>confused and we kind of and I know<br>because I stood on the motorway every<br>day for an hour and kind of you know get<br>to work<br>but the idea of kind of looking back is<br>I think again a good thing for everyone<br>so this has got retail on the bottom and<br>then obviously a number of the other<br>sites also have activities that create<br>employment so you can kind of live<br>upstairs work downstairs is a coffee<br>shop down the road and then obviously<br>Ponsonby is right there so you've got<br>everything at your at your doorstep so<br>from again drawing on a a muddy design<br>thing of old is the tonic or and this<br>particular pattern is the part for key<br>so the idea is even though they're<br>individual apartments that for this one<br>that is to a kind of cleaner which is<br>older brother younger brother so this is<br>kind of the corner site and in so it's<br>kind of the one of the more prominent<br>sites I'm gonna go lane so we like the<br>idea that it actually is looking over<br>everyone that's one part and the second<br>part even though they're individual<br>units the idea it mean littered together<br>at least usually by this kind of this<br>you know really objected marty pattin<br>there's something that we're really<br>proud of my Gruffalo in a little country<br>town called mum ok so you often see a<br>lot of our projects and sports and we<br>call that some really shiny materials<br>but also going for some rustic and more<br>cultural Wednesday we've done galvanized<br>bellows trains view here is a light well<br>to the north side which was was being it<br>was being quite interesting and it's<br>open here so unfortunately those vines<br>aren't real plants but it's another<br>story the e and all that yeah killer<br>right today and I'm just going to talk<br>about one project here and this is a<br>project a mohawk<br>and it's some project that current<br>stages and resource consent and we were<br>approached about two years ago maybe<br>more free years ago to discuss the<br>nature of land development with the CEO<br>of the trust and so in that conversation<br>I had learned what I understood to be<br>strategies for the development prices so<br>that stage they had little experience of<br>housing and so I was one of many voices<br>I think that they approached and spoke<br>to so we got a brief that was reasonably<br>specific about the land so the land I'll<br>show you an aerial photograph in a<br>moment was land that was part of a by<br>Tony's settlement and was somewhat<br>disputed and I don't understand the full<br>extent of that it was land that was part<br>of the settlement was an economic<br>settlement rather than of traditional<br>land or the<br>again I can't I don't really understand<br>the pullback story that's been faring<br>out of toeing frying with the number of<br>alien in the cell so I you can read<br>these things without me<br>talking about it but what's interesting<br>it seems to me is that they were not at<br>all interested in subdivision they were<br>interested in holding the land as a<br>single title and so there were kind of<br>two goals one was to produce a range of<br>housing that would be attractive to a<br>wide spread of people on a rental or<br>leasehold arrangement and on the other<br>to be able to clear the site in the<br>force of time and so the site is this<br>little triangular bit up here so it's<br>bounded by state highway 20<br>and great South Road southern motorway<br>up here the event center here monocle<br>city over the road a bridge over the<br>freeway that sort of grinds to a halt of<br>mud and water that infrastructure of<br>motorcar city train rail shopping and so<br>forth and the other thing that's not<br>shown in this photograph is that it's on<br>the approach path for Margaret Airport<br>and so their expectation was that the<br>zoning or is that the zoning of that<br>land may well change that at the moment<br>is controlled by a relatively low rise<br>height control and density control but<br>the feeling is that it's I did sitter<br>for a taller building we were just<br>talking before I came in about your<br>quoted up here I guess or SS<br>yeah and also there's another bigger<br>project up in here as well so you know<br>that area is undergoing significant<br>change as it should do you know with the<br>rail link and the bus link and the<br>retail commercial center and also that<br>focus of a huge population so this is<br>the territory here on the far right as<br>part of this larger length of land and<br>as I said there was some to and fro as<br>to how much land tomorrow would have<br>control over at present time the project<br>of the far right to rope honor is the<br>protein I'm going to talk about so it's<br>considered pretty much as a discrete<br>lump of land and so in sight whereas<br>these other developments here being done<br>by housing use and and I think through<br>Hobsonville land company as well or like<br>standard we created and they are<br>essentially subdivisions of the land but<br>as I said tomorrow the view that that<br>land will be rezoned should be reserved<br>and so whatever's down there has got a<br>relatively short life<br>this is society looking from there's the<br>bridge to nowhere at the moment so<br>crossing say highway 20 Monica on our<br>left and you can see the ravine Center<br>and so the first thing it was<br>interesting that Eric talked about cars<br>and how one deals with cars and of<br>course whenever you start getting into<br>any sort of density you ship cars kind<br>of reasons here almost immediately and I<br>saw is quite sort of taken with this<br>notion here that the cars were just kind<br>of there in the streets of where the<br>action was but we don't actually know<br>who's going to<br>in these houses and there is to say<br>could the focus is not to tomorrow it<br>could be to anyone with a unique and so<br>they're able to present housing that<br>they describe ironically as what one<br>might build a Mission Bay which is<br>ironic because I have terrible success<br>right anywhere east of Queen Street so<br>but you know what they were talking<br>about is short hair was a qualitative<br>standard that this was came to be good<br>quality housing and even though it had a<br>relatively short life span they wanted<br>to make sure that it was something that<br>was desirable and by implication would<br>be looked after and predicted that was<br>the Eggman so this was very early<br>diagrams do you see I thought well the<br>cars down the middle are going to be a<br>bit of liability given the sort of<br>density number of people the fact they<br>don't know each other all that well and<br>probably quite a high churn rate of<br>occupants and so seems maybe we need to<br>get the cars out of there that would be<br>a bit safer and try and wind up what I'm<br>called here the Commons you know that<br>there is some open space now running<br>through the core of it and then thinking<br>about different densities of buildings<br>but lower on the freeway side we've been<br>hired down in the south and a number of<br>this way through staggering number of<br>iterations and I'd like to really like<br>to acknowledge changed things<br>assistance here my wild scratches and<br>intemperate commentary and so this is a<br>sort of generalization off the idea of<br>cars heading off around the image that<br>we would access the site from here<br>there's pedestrian link on great South<br>state highway 1 that sort of t-bones<br>great South Road at that point and so it<br>was very clear that we really couldn't<br>get vehicle access off there and we<br>really didn't want to it was clear that<br>tomorrow very keen that this be<br>considered a finite kind of domain or<br>enclosure if you like without sort of<br>through traffic it was fine to have<br>pedestrians drifting through here and<br>connections over to the city into<br>adjacent housing and community<br>facilities that are provided within<br>there was quite important but the worst<br>that could happen with cars barreling<br>through there as a shortcut and so at an<br>early stage this kind of took some sort<br>of crude form as I was trying to figure<br>out how many apartments or how many<br>buildings might fit on there and you<br>know what sort of size say where and<br>what it roads look like and all that<br>sort of stuff but I was very taken with<br>the drawing that Gary showed a gain of<br>the walkway through the middle that if<br>we have this kind of Commons and here<br>was a reasonably dense development then<br>I was very keen that as much circulation<br>as possible who was on this street so<br>that this would be the place of meeting<br>and colliding so you would force people<br>into each other they would dump the cars<br>out on the perimeter and in the<br>distribution would happen through the<br>gutter of the site and this is a sketch<br>of James just starting to think about<br>these sort of interfaces between if you<br>like private space semi private and in<br>public space and just how is that<br>mediated by by built form or by<br>landscape elements and so forth and also<br>some ideas about materials again climate<br>were very interested in a kind of<br>industrial aesthetic and so the metals<br>and<br>so I'm entered into the conversations<br>pretty early on in the piece yeah just<br>thinking about that kind of common space<br>and this is lifted out of one of those<br>books about tiny villages it's called<br>tiny villages book anyway about the<br>density of occupation you can get in<br>very tight areas again I we were and we<br>are uncertain about the defines the<br>bonds between occupants they may be from<br>every corner of Auckland City from every<br>ethnicity and so forth and so we cannot<br>assume a kind of overlay of cultural<br>tribal whatever connection but tomorrow<br>who are very interested in having a act<br>of hand within the development and so<br>there will be tomorrow present living or<br>living on site and a number of the<br>pragmatic issues you know rubbish<br>disposal all that sort of stuff have<br>been worked through to offer something<br>that you know engagement from from the<br>tribe and so the landscape plan here<br>probably shows where we got to really<br>this very low rice stuffing on the end<br>some little ten are like structures as I<br>did at the street barreling through<br>there that connects back into the<br>development next door and then from<br>there provides pastry and path the<br>Manukau and then join me out and hitting<br>off to great self at the other end cars<br>are parked around the perimeter there<br>are rain water gardens and so forth<br>along the edge to deal with that from<br>then this central section here trying to<br>crank that up this is a resource consent<br>landscape plan it's it's dichromat who<br>is slightly beyond the stage of<br>diagrammatic but it does indicate this<br>of seeking and playground<br>and so forth and so the the projects<br>developed so these four-story tower<br>structures four-story walk-ups and so<br>two apartments per level and connected<br>by an open breezeway like stair and so<br>here we're just looking across that<br>commons area one of the things i looked<br>at earlier on was the housing projects<br>that have been done by Hobsonville main<br>company these are really Thompson's from<br>Northcote and I was just interested in<br>the way so quite cunning planning here<br>that one can go in the door and hit off<br>upstairs to a self-contained element or<br>go into the body of the house down below<br>and so there are some strategies like<br>that that I'd like to think influence<br>the planning although again they're<br>modified by some other programmatic<br>things that arise out of this ability to<br>move the buildings so this is the<br>reverse of the street side and so this<br>is the North Face facing on to or over<br>State Highway 280 towards rainbows in a<br>world to end as we stir court people<br>when I first went to the site they<br>seemed to be about being here before and<br>I you know for the first two years of<br>mostly Chooch I spent our entire time at<br>rainbows then designing the<br>roller-coaster in the mountain and all<br>that kind of stuff so and so you know<br>anyway what we're talking about here is<br>private open outdoor space here letting<br>out downstairs bedroom here there's a<br>mix of one and two story projects and<br>they're pretty well predicated on what<br>you can lift up and drag down a freeway<br>without shutting the shutting the entire<br>street and they planted cells out here<br>with this little single-story job single<br>bedroom job these hips<br>Regus representing code requirements<br>very basic gable forms and then there's<br>a two-story version of it here with this<br>pop drop above the street running on<br>over pedestrian street here and in<br>private space out the back the towers<br>were a kind of an interesting thing we<br>cast around looking at how one might<br>deal with metal and how I might Clanton<br>and really this love to think was a<br>photograph of or a render of something<br>we ended up with but it's not it's<br>somewhere in France is that it shows<br>pretty much a sort of messing where<br>we've ended up and that is these two<br>towers with this screened stairway so<br>this is external space grunions way up<br>there and I've been on the one side to<br>the cars and the pedestrian and bike<br>stores and on this side into the coven's<br>and there are really very simple tubular<br>forms just with minor pitch degrees at a<br>tipping every direction two triangles a<br>bit of energy and then being skewed and<br>planned to provide a little greater<br>privacy little more sunshine and to<br>liven up the streetscape I mean one of<br>the projects that I worked a long ago it<br>was rhubarb Maine which you mentioned<br>and and the criteria there was he had to<br>be able to find the apartment if he came<br>home drunk and and it seems a cruel<br>thing to say to the users here but the<br>point we were trying to find something<br>that was discreetly identifiable and if<br>with an incredibly limited range of<br>stuff so it was just by skewing by<br>one of the programs that's run<br>concurrently through this is the desire<br>to use this material called Meg Rock<br>which is a sandwich of a kind<br>really robust sheet of magnesium oxide<br>and polystyrene core with a kind of<br>timber element that runs around the<br>outside of it and it's relatively<br>straightforward for single or double<br>storey buildings and I went down there's<br>a factory in Christchurch and that<br>popped up quite a few houses down there<br>and they're very the practice works<br>pleadingly for one or two storeys the<br>trick they always wanted to do that over<br>four storeys and then to be able to<br>demountable and so they the smaller<br>units of one or two stories one could<br>hoist up and put on a truck and hit off<br>down the highway and but the four story<br>was a bit more of a challenge and you<br>ended up with some redundant elements<br>you know that you have a roof and then a<br>floor because these things have to be<br>stable when you and train them and<br>unbolt them and so there was quite a lot<br>of discussion about that and you know I<br>would present these joists the engineers<br>on that smurt and snigger for a while<br>but it did inform this idea of the fact<br>that there were discrete objects that<br>would be craned into place and then<br>untrained in fullness of time and say<br>thanks though that concern really drove<br>the dimensions of the towers themselves<br>so that they would be each apartment<br>would be split into two and then able to<br>be lifted down and so what I'm just<br>illustrating here is that this is a big<br>rock stuff and here<br>there's some cleats in there and some<br>external structural of bolts the whole<br>thing together stop to flapping around<br>in the wind or earthquake and then the<br>whole thing is covered by a rain screen<br>that I'd fondly hoped might be timber so<br>I had a tough email from the fire<br>engineer<br>and so this is how they organized this<br>open stair tower in the middle here just<br>viewed as I said to get a bit of life in<br>this or energy there's one and two<br>bedroom units and on the lower floor one<br>if not two of them would give it over to<br>two communal activities so in saying<br>that I said community at the moment we<br>say laundry but each of the houses has<br>got its laundry facilities so for that<br>we're anticipating some sort of focus of<br>social activity but that sort of program<br>has been shaping out at the moment as I<br>said there will be continuous lemarchal<br>presence on the site and so we hope that<br>that will be a catalyst for the<br>utilization of that area and its own<br>section you can see the massing of the<br>towers and low-rise stuff on the on the<br>left and you'll see this try you know<br>trying to get as much leverage as I can<br>out of money pitch ruse and that's it<br>that's where we're at at the moment<br>buried and resource consent four pages<br>of detailed questions and critiques that<br>okay so straight into some questions<br>from the audience and I'll just repeat<br>are you thinking the construction waste<br>or occupational either a price is for<br>the beaver stop was the it still so I<br>can't speak to pups project specifically<br>that we've just had one of our team<br>members leave us to start a company on<br>only waste so I think he's starting with<br>two products Paula styrene painting in<br>there but yet the building crates in so<br>yeah it's been quite interesting but I<br>think I mean that was the thing with the<br>modular housing work we were just like<br>really precise in terms of what would<br>the module for the for the for the<br>products itself and so the whole idea is<br>that there is waste minimization and in<br>terms of how they are sort of put<br>my question is to the high school tour<br>you know the modular buildings he showed<br>to start was one of them looked like it<br>was set Tyler you know I'm I got a<br>couple so the one that Moody why I'm<br>interested in what the cost per square<br>mirrors for are those modular or prefab<br>buildings and also do you actually<br>manufacture them do you have a factory<br>or do you outsource all of it um yeah<br>it's been one of those things that we've<br>we we take budgets really seriously and<br>we kind of we don't do a lot of high-end<br>sort of houses but we got a lot of kind<br>of middle of the range in so with these<br>particular houses we we had<br>conversations right from beginning we<br>part with my crea homes because they<br>have big buying paths a lot of the<br>materials are lower than what you know<br>an ordinary builder would be able to get<br>and so we and then all of the other<br>people like XBMC or t-midi builders the<br>roofing system the wall systems it's<br>always said that this is going to be<br>about volume you're not going to make<br>big margins on the whole sort of price<br>so the was really interesting mean that<br>sort of ditching the one-bedroom because<br>basically the kitchen and bathroom is<br>kind of one of the most expensive parts<br>of the houses so one bedrooms were<br>actually just not really kind of with<br>with pursuing but the three visions the<br>best value and it's 99 square meters and<br>it's three hundred and ten thousand<br>including GST for a completed house<br>so it's about three thousand square<br>meter but I think one of the other major<br>wins for us is that basically it's 12<br>weeks from you put a deposit down that<br>houses or onto site and completed and I<br>think their actual on-site times about a<br>month so you know carrying the mortgage<br>mortgage is a lot smaller as well so<br>yeah their whole idea of values been<br>something that we've been really pushing<br>and driving and reminding all the<br>suppliers at the same time this isn't<br>about you getting rich buddy and I'm<br>looking at this site where the community<br>can afford to pay about two thousand a<br>square meter so just try to find some<br>prefabs or modular buildings that would<br>fit that slide you know that their<br>budget basically yes understand we<br>started with an ambition there early<br>toes and it I think<br>the first probably the first 50 are<br>gonna be you know there's a bit of risk<br>factor built into them but I think that<br>the the ambitions are to get the price<br>down I think as they build volume all<br>that their charm in there that becomes<br>much more possible and there was another<br>reason the game for pairing with a big<br>with a big contractor because one<br>they've got the you know the means to<br>support it yeah so chemists Seattle in<br>and they're guys for the projects you<br>guys have done Auckland<br>do you guys feel that the unitary plan<br>has helped you or hindered you with<br>doing more of the medium density stuff<br>and compared to maybe some of the stuff<br>you've done in the past I think it<br>certainly helped our project and the<br>freedom from cars is a great relief I<br>have to say it's incredibly hard to was<br>hard to emphasize too much it wasn't<br>impact they have you know I mean it was<br>the first drawing I did was what are you<br>gonna do with the cast and yet you know<br>they you know here we were any like<br>terms of meters from a multiple transit<br>systems and yet you've become obsessed<br>with turning radii cap acts and stuff<br>like that so I think not having<br>there's probably the biggest thing for<br>me really the densities of Occupation<br>have helped as well yeah I think that<br>it's unlocked a lot of you know we're<br>getting a lot of them for projects that<br>come through in sort of you know for the<br>square meter site that you can get for<br>units on now and you kind of like wow<br>what does that look like but time so I<br>think that's sort of there's been a lot<br>of freedom with that and I think that<br>it's it's good and it's necessary you<br>know but hoping this would you know we<br>need to to be the city that we at this<br>the way we need to get more dense so I<br>think it has been helpful I think can<br>still go a little further but I think<br>it's a step in the right direction for<br>sure<br>i christen for just fascinated when you<br>mentioned Mack rock and look looking at<br>what it might be able to do but so at<br>Google too quickly and it says Mack rock<br>and liquidation so have you persistent<br>sorry C mag rock in liquidation so and<br>also your cladding you'd you'd hope to<br>do timber and obviously you can't for<br>the Hyder building now but what have you<br>come up with what is that but we're<br>seeing on the photo oh that's a metal<br>cladding yeah the cameras I was really<br>lost as a result of separation distances<br>that these brothers are really close<br>together or places and so that really<br>precludes timber cladding<br>so yeah it's metal the neck rock you<br>know has a checkered history I<br>understand that there was some kind of<br>strategic restructuring that they have<br>emerged from but it did cause me some<br>anxiety about the day before we go to<br>lunch for exhaustion see and and on top<br>of that they're two different sorts of<br>Meg rockers or magnesium oxide sheet as<br>well so one very good one very bad for<br>the environment in so once it's reading<br>that the the thing I really didn't talk<br>about and one of the advantages of it is<br>a credible speed of erection and say it<br>allows you to assemble the buildings<br>with very unskilled labor very quickly<br>and so there's been a critical part of<br>the project that it will be seen to or<br>then it would offer a employment for<br>people from tomorrow constructing<br>these projects and so the idea was that<br>the first one would be constructed on<br>contract basis and they will be pulled<br>apart and we would start to treat it a<br>bit like a car if we could so political<br>loons would be put in plumbing and so<br>forth within a team structure on the<br>site and then that would those panels<br>will be taken and erected so there's a<br>quite interesting very pragmatic kind of<br>construction and detailing issues that<br>were seem to have a wider program than<br>you might normally have in a house hi I<br>had a question for pet because you<br>mentioned that one of these projects<br>wasn't looking at traditional unit<br>titled subdivision but was trying to<br>maintain ownership of the land and and<br>some of these collective models does<br>that different land tenure allow<br>different design outcomes on the site or<br>more freedom well yeah some of the fire<br>issues go away within buildings and and<br>there's a highly prevalent sort of thing<br>and it is an active I'm not sure they<br>did I was more interested on on a kind<br>of site wide scale that it that it did<br>allow you to make a decision like well<br>the cars aren't going to be there right<br>in the client developer in this case<br>would say no that's right that kind of<br>kasi so there were some things like<br>there the idea of the Commons and/or the<br>open space in the middle and cranking<br>there huh I suspect comes from that long<br>range land ownership strategy that if<br>you break it up and it's interesting to<br>see what's happened over to the west on<br>the two sites to the west where again<br>there are<br>a week clients got a very traditional<br>alleges and and you know traditional<br>approach to subdivision has emerged I<br>mean they're they're fine buildings and<br>there are dense and they're very humane<br>and all that but you know there is a<br>garage for the cow or a carport and so<br>forth and the writing occupies out of it<br>fifteen twenty percent of the site and<br>so in that respect be able to take those<br>sort of global decisions I'm not sure<br>how much that resulted from singular<br>ownership as much as the owners having a<br>long view of their land tenure hello my<br>question is regard to water retention<br>and rim water disposal or wastewater<br>disposal to you guys had to find new<br>ways of dealing with rainwater the<br>wallet attention because that median<br>density towards high density require a<br>high volume of water discharge thank you<br>yeah well I can speak about the project<br>Monica that one of the benefits of being<br>part of a larger development the three<br>sides is it there is a large storm water<br>detention pond I mean we have recycling<br>of the storm water but the know there's<br>runoff and rain water gathers but still<br>for all of that there is overflow going<br>to a larger community work we did<br>investigate the ideas of various<br>alternative toilet systems but that they<br>fell foul of I think the expectation of<br>Mission Bay<br>really<br>I think I'm not sure I just think that<br>got a Nick Garrity alley my question is<br>more from a design perspective in terms<br>of the multi narrative was interesting<br>to see the way I approach the site from<br>the start in reflected in the results<br>with a lot of inventory Marty concepts<br>in the design and working with a client<br>come on was in coming up with a result<br>which you've got and I like what you've<br>done as well did you answer this<br>question did you find a lot of I suppose<br>a lot of discussions with the client<br>along these meaningless I don't know<br>what you want to call it in at the end<br>of the design within the design you mean<br>was her discourse about Mari aesthetic<br>and murky and I wonder was but as they<br>were discouraged from pursuing their and<br>from the client themselves or yeah well<br>actually explained about the client that<br>tomorrow we're working through are<br>working through a company could inspire<br>traits and they are to all intents<br>purposes our client and they are an<br>outgrowth of a company called<br>at work and so my conversations were<br>largely with them so there was at the<br>very beginning there were some large<br>land use issues arise out of the<br>briefing and so various principles were<br>established there and those principles<br>are those enshrined in the design get<br>organ design guide and so forth but as a<br>specific articulation of ideas of<br>Mythology driving the project as we<br>heard from tre and I was discouraged<br>from pursuing that in theory Nick I mean<br>you're approached from a technical point<br>of view you know I just felt connected<br>to it straight away I guess like when I<br>when I graduated and my first job was<br>with Bill and Perry Royal Denon<br>Christchurch and so bill row first Mori<br>architects and he kind of instilled in<br>me their kind of process which has<br>become like with toys that like the<br>patented tour Co design process or the<br>money tiny process which we call it and<br>and as it's working shoulder-to-shoulder<br>and heart to heart with your client and<br>what I wanted to say it's like a it's<br>that's just how you do like and Nick<br>would be the same it doesn't matter who<br>your client is we're going to approach<br>it in that way with their client and<br>build that relationship but also that<br>the power of story and in the power of<br>to kind of capture capture the essence<br>as I see it and carry that through your<br>project and yesterday I was at a hurry<br>were at Waxhaw hospital we're doing a<br>new mental health unit and and manaphy<br>know were saying how we gonna how we<br>gonna see accountability throughout the<br>project and how do we know that that the<br>design idea is now going to be<br>translated to their building and we talk<br>to you know that's exactly where<br>seriously it's those design principles<br>and the parrot that that narrative that<br>will just carry it through and as long<br>as we establish that early on and<br>definitely have chicks along the process<br>right now right into construction but<br>yes it's about having their big picture<br>idea that the everyone can resonate with<br>your engineers your your your builders<br>your future residents and then and just<br>you know woof woof pups the tomahawk<br>project you know like that talking about<br>how do you get like-minded individuals<br>to move into your residential project<br>and it is having their dick bigger<br>picture story you know it's an open or<br>you know hey you know they they'll be<br>endeared by that story and and and<br>through their story there there'll be<br>you know like oh we idea of sharing or<br>something like that you know you build<br>into it and they can't help you know<br>it's just this is part of the the caring<br>part of the story so so I think um I<br>just was over in Brisbane for the Asian<br>Pacific symposium architecture symposium<br>and one of the other speakers was given<br>a Brian you know from Australia and he's<br>of Aboriginal and Irish descent<br>and we got to this interesting kind of<br>discussion about representation and<br>architecture he's very much like you<br>know I don't I don't like representation<br>and architects you know I was kind of<br>like okay that's where we might differ<br>there because we're very much about<br>representation and abstracted version of<br>and so that was quite interesting and I<br>think boiling down the Givens<br>perspective you know<br>butchering up myself on an Aboriginal<br>building he said you know they might say<br>put some dots over at make it a dot<br>painting and he's come right you know so<br>it was really interesting from that<br>perspective and I feel that you know we<br>are you know a lot of our work people<br>are coming to us before that narrative<br>and and the one that I may tell you that<br>chaddy put up on the screen it was<br>caught kind of almost like I just do a<br>sketch you know and so Terry did a<br>sketch and the client just absolutely<br>loved it and the the public changed but<br>they actually said the the narrative is<br>the number one thing and it's the first<br>project I think in that 25 odd years<br>I've been practicing that from you know<br>all of the consultants were shown the<br>concept from from day one and they all<br>loved it and they all you know we were<br>getting a issue from consultants early<br>perfect see it's a lot come let us never<br>happens right and so we're kind of all<br>punching ourselves but you know there's<br>an inherent belief you know there's<br>something that's bigger than the bricks<br>and mortar and I think that that's the<br>power of it that you know there's<br>underlying stories and narratives of the<br>slained and I done my little coming to<br>you pub is my lot seven building the<br>client didn't know what we were talking<br>with just that it you know that house<br>absurd subversive kind of thing in sila<br>actually I really love that that<br>corrugated and well the middle profile<br>just want to have these substantive kind<br>of almost you know the Potala and things<br>like that it's and because I think there<br>is that can was a bit more than that<br>so there's kind of for us that's all I<br>had were you attracted so it's not yeah<br>yeah look I've always thought the real<br>potency of that one would like meant for<br>the Maori tradition lies in issues of<br>land use and the way that space can be<br>transformed I'm a always really<br>interested on the I have a bunch of kids<br>kicking a ball around and then somebody<br>and you know an awesome that space goes<br>from being a playing field to be an<br>incredibly full space and it seems you<br>know that's a really you know single<br>kind of solution but any single example<br>but you know one might talk about entry<br>in the same way that there are places<br>where people will be for appropriate<br>welcome and the formalities of arrival<br>and so forth<br>and so essentially those underlying<br>patterns of things that have to be in<br>place I'm listening about the the sort<br>of figurative elements but I you know<br>totally with the idea of history<br>mythology and particularly the history<br>of particular science informing key<br>design decisions I'm interested in how<br>literal they have to be common for<br>myself i I think that's a crucial that<br>they remain those those ideas of power<br>projects along but I'm less certain<br>about them being explicit well I think<br>the microphones are telling us something<br>and those were some positive notes so we<br>can<br>and thank you again to for your<br>generous sponsorship and just a reminder<br>that there are some brochures down here<br>and you can come down here and have a<br>look at those I always forgive because<br>of my I'm an academic without the CPD<br>points but they are over there so don't<br>forget to sign up on the way out and<br>next week we have Andrew Eagles from the<br>Green Building Council and I thought I<br>knew what the Green Building Council<br>does and some of the tools that they<br>have available but there are some<br>interesting new things that they're<br>developing at the moment so come along</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
