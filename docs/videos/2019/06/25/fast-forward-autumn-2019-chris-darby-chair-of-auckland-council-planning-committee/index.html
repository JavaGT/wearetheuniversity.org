This semester we continue our focus on the question: How can we do medium density well? This series is proudly supported by GIB®.<br><br>Chris Darby, Chair of Auckland Council Planning Committee<br><br>Auckland is reining in suburban sprawl and intensifying residential development under the Unitary Plan. Much of this is guided by the Council’s Planning Committee. The Planning Committee, 'guides the physical development and growth of Auckland and focuses on land use planning, housing and the appropriate provision of infrastructure and strategic projects'. Chair, Councillor Chris Darby, will discuss the committee's work and vision. Elected from North Shore ward, this is his second term as an Auckland councillor. Described as a passionate environmentalist who knows the place of enterprise, Cr Darby is focussed on public and active transport, quality urban design and place-making, and climate change. Prior to elected office, Cr Darby was involved in property development, with a 2004 project receiving NZIA’s Supreme Award for residential architecture. He remains a keen enthusiast for architecture, especially within public places and buildings.<br><br>--<br><br>For more information about our architecture, urban planning and urban design study

architecture<br>architects and urban designers I have<br>treated with over the years created<br>buildings with a number of you and some<br>great buildings we've collaborated on<br>some great spaces we've collaborated on<br>hey thanks for the invitation to speak<br>tonight pass the intro yes I chair the<br>planning committee we've got three major<br>committees at Auckland Council and along<br>with environment community and the<br>Finance Committee and as bill outlined<br>the planning committee is responsible<br>for that you know the special planning<br>of Auckland or the land-use planning the<br>unitary plan the special thing is the<br>author all complain and it is an immense<br>task<br>I've got really indirect responsibility<br>for three CCO zorkin transport panic ooh<br>that's our Development Agency and water<br>care probably my big focus is on the<br>first to transport and the urban<br>regeneration their water care that<br>Paducah was undertaking so tonight um<br>I'd like to speak to you on the subject<br>of course in focusing on some lessons<br>that we have learned in recent time that<br>have come out of our work through the<br>urban design panel so the medium density<br>development that you've been discussing<br>and are discussing here tonight is a<br>critical part of delivering on a vastly<br>improved Auckland an Auckland that<br>doesn't continue to show us girth and<br>the shift towards that consolidated form<br>of housing it does it's necessary but it<br>actually provides us with an immense<br>opportunity to shine as practitioners<br>and deliver models of living that have<br>not previously been anticipated here in<br>Auckland and yet it's all about quality<br>homes but it's more than that it's about<br>quality communities<br>people that then knit into communities<br>and you cannot ignore the importance of<br>the unfolding of a community we're not<br>just building homes in Auckland is our<br>focus and it is of course as you well<br>know it's an it's absolutely imperative<br>that we get the design right now we'll<br>navigate some slides here um this is how<br>we have been growing and some of you<br>have probably seen these these numbers<br>before intensification is absolutely<br>necessary when you look at sets like<br>this that car number actually out of<br>interest is dropped dramatically we're<br>not putting that number of cars on the<br>roads anymore in fact the other ships<br>coming into Auckland are not disgorging<br>cars at anywhere near that number a few<br>others have moved around but generally<br>get the message the pressure is on<br>we have a wonderful attractiveness<br>problem we live in a beautiful place a<br>city that is gripped by two oceans<br>punctured by three harbors and then<br>further punctured by 40-odd a volcanic<br>Molnar tell that to your friends<br>overseas and that's why they come here<br>plus other things it is a very<br>attractive place but as a city we are<br>not that productive we generate 37% of<br>the nation's GDP most international<br>cities will be punching well above that<br>and we should be punching well above<br>that in my view we're failing in that<br>regard we're not contributing to the the<br>health not just the financial well-being<br>of the nation but all the well beings of<br>the nation a city like ours should be<br>contributing not taking from the nation<br>I'm not suggesting that we're absolutely<br>taking but cities of the future<br>international cities like ours will be<br>providing the subsidies to other parts<br>of the nation and for me that's an<br>important point to note going forward in<br>recent years or last year we have about<br>two and three-quarter million visitors<br>coming to Auckland that's another<br>pressure and of course we all know we're<br>super diverse 200 ethnicities living in<br>this place and that makes<br>tremendous for a tremendous richness<br>we're about 1.7 million people at the<br>moment and since 91 we've been adding<br>about I think we've added about 675<br>thousand since then and you can see 825<br>a week and we need to provide for at<br>least another million in the next 30<br>years and some recent feeds coming out<br>of Stax New Zealand suggest that we'll<br>be passing the 2 million mark in 2028<br>that's just nine years away so we're<br>experiencing unprecedented growth and<br>what that we need to provide capacity<br>some 400,000 dwellings for those many<br>people and then we've got to provide the<br>jobs some 280,000 jobs to go with those<br>for those people over the next three<br>decades so it's quite a significant<br>challenge how do you do it well I don't<br>want to bore you with plans but you need<br>one of these you really need to look out<br>before you can look short and<br>fortunately the statute that sets opened<br>up requires us and we're the only place<br>in New Zealand that actually has to look<br>long<br>so the Auckland play in 2015 we had one<br>in 20 2012 and last year we confirmed it<br>after a couple of years work it's been<br>much of my focus in the first two years<br>we've landed and updated and probably<br>slightly revolutionized the way this<br>plan is written so the sets out the the<br>high-level strategic direction the<br>vision as I mentioned for the future of<br>Auckland looking out 30 years it<br>outlines all the felt for well-beings as<br>you know them the social the cultural<br>really important in Auckland and the<br>economic and increasingly important the<br>environmental goals and outcomes it<br>guides the unfolding of our city<br>something will be familiar to you and<br>your practices and it includes a<br>development strategy that maps you out<br>quite a bit more specifically of where<br>that growth will occur and then that is<br>in sync with infrastructure planning and<br>then we've got infrastructure documents<br>the set<br>just alongside that development strategy<br>so if you can picture it this way it has<br>a city center of its core and then it's<br>supported by key nodes and the key nodes<br>or Westgate up north<br>Mancow to the south elderly back to the<br>north and further north walk with as a<br>satellite and another satellite Puu<br>Kukui<br>and then supported under putting that we<br>have got a number of other Metro centers<br>town centers neighborhood centers and<br>then coastal centers as well not taking<br>too much growth at all population<br>density or even job density in those<br>later sense centers so we're the only<br>city in New Zealand that's required to<br>have a 30 year vision and I think it's a<br>real bonus in it it really sets us up so<br>the way this plan now is read is not<br>like the 2012 plan the 2012 plan was a<br>big document and it was a print document<br>only it wasn't dynamic it took six years<br>to update now it's a plan that if say<br>the census data comes in we've got new<br>information we can update the plan we<br>can just do it it's a digital plan now<br>and it's also designed in such a way<br>that if you're in the transport body you<br>don't just go and read the transport<br>section you read the plan that's into<br>woven transport relates to the urban<br>form toured to the urban regeneration to<br>the environmental outcomes to the Marty<br>well-being these aren't isolated<br>chapters that you can pick off and just<br>say as a practitioner for example or a<br>technical officer or council I only have<br>to read this part no more we expect all<br>our staff to be reading right across the<br>the plan and understand in its totality<br>so that we get holistic outcomes so it's<br>about having that deeper knowledge and<br>there you can see the the directions cue<br>directions I won't read them all that<br>you read them in the plan and that's all<br>about thus that the the bones of how we<br>set the city up and so to do this we<br>need to enhance the sort of interaction<br>and the social cohesion with that within<br>our communities but we also need to<br>address the productivity which is what<br>I've just referred to in having our GDP<br>of just 37% when we've got a population<br>a castle of around or share of around<br>about 3334 percent maybe at the moment<br>we should be up there in terms of<br>productivity if you want to measure by<br>GDP and I admit there's a lot of other<br>measures you need to address than just<br>that the treasure is GDP but that for<br>our cities we should be punching well<br>north of 40 40 percent plus contribution<br>to the nation's GDP I would add to that<br>this plan brings a whole new focus on<br>environmental outcomes cultural outcomes<br>Mauri outcomes which I've just mentioned<br>and overall sustainability it brings a<br>greater awareness to climate changing<br>climate change breathing down our necks<br>and the enormous challenge that we have<br>in future climate proofing our city and<br>that's top of mind for me and we'll hear<br>more about that in our climate action<br>plan in the next month the council I'm<br>going to go down until one of those<br>sections so see that one up in your top<br>right homes in places now I'm almost<br>doing what I just said we shouldn't be<br>doing but just for for times sake I'm<br>just taking you down into one of those<br>sections and here's the homes and places<br>section and there are the key directions<br>there so the key directions there and<br>thus for them we're talking about a<br>quality compact approach that you're<br>familiar with that and that means<br>development that occurs to create<br>enduring well-designed communities<br>enduring communities and you get that<br>through well designing them well and<br>particularly when they are in close<br>proximity to record transit earning and<br>learning there are the three things that<br>people the market the real estate market<br>at the moment is really homing in on the<br>unitary plane and some 42<br>percent of dwelling consents are being<br>issued within 1500 meters of the rapid<br>transit network we've never seen that in<br>Auckland before but that is the market<br>trend and they asked that probably<br>jumping ahead a little bit here but that<br>really gets us to ask some questions<br>whether our greenfield focus is<br>something that we need to maybe put as<br>much weight and then budget into as we<br>thought even a year or two years ago and<br>so we need to accelerate obviously the<br>construction of new homes to respond to<br>the the growth that we're experiencing<br>and also the changing preferences of<br>people as I mentioned that the housing<br>preferences the living preferences are<br>changing dramatically and in some ways<br>that maybe does reflect the diversity<br>that we're experiencing and Auckland now<br>as well and the big focus there is we<br>need to change the way we are also<br>housing people it's no longer that<br>so-called quarter acre paradise and the<br>single dwelling home you know that's<br>just a car drive from a job in possibly<br>that is not what people are turned on by<br>anymore and we also need to ensure that<br>we're creating wonderful public spaces<br>for people to enjoy as this density<br>develops and that needs to be inclusive<br>and it needs to be accessible and then<br>there are four focus areas dropping down<br>from there we have four focus areas<br>accelerating the development to improve<br>the housing choices I've just mentioned<br>increasing the security of tenure and<br>recognizing the different sorts of 10<br>years we've invalidated renting for<br>decades in the city we need to validate<br>renting as a valid means of living in a<br>home long - if you look at the German<br>model people are investing their money<br>in equities and their businesses and<br>they're renting at the age of 50 and<br>it's entirely okay<br>we need to start looking at in my view<br>giving real validation to those that<br>rent a house long term and not<br>necessarily be predisposed with every or<br>conduct being able to buy a home get the<br>balance right so it's all about<br>broadening the range of those tenure<br>models in improving the the built<br>quality which we'll come to and<br>investing in supporting Maori is a big<br>focus of ours and we're just kicking off<br>the formative stages of working up a<br>papaya plan change that is in in<br>Motion's right now and again as I<br>mentioned before you know it's<br>ultimately it's about creating great<br>places for people great places which<br>people feel anchored to and feel a<br>belonging to so the unity plan is is I'm<br>sure you're well versed in that by now<br>we reviewed all that it's about 99<br>percent operative at the moment that's<br>our planning tool box that allows us to<br>little deliver on those aspirations of<br>the auckland plan and that's where we<br>get to accommodate the growth through<br>this quality compact approach of<br>enduring quality high-density living and<br>within that compact environmental<br>footprint and some of those I'm sure<br>some of you have have looked at the<br>various maps and that just gives you a<br>bit of an idea of one of the maps there<br>but the usually plan provides density<br>for developments over a number of zones<br>residentially these are the terrace<br>housing in apartment zone they're around<br>up to five storeys so we're talking<br>medium density we're not talking you<br>know high-rises here this is where most<br>of the growth in in Auckland will occur<br>there's the mixed housing urban zone<br>that's up to about three storeys and<br>we've resigned a substantial amount of<br>land<br>for these two particular zones plus the<br>mixed house in suburban as well so the<br>the third zone was principally applied<br>around Metro Tower in town centers metro<br>cities town centers and in some major<br>transit points and so it has good access<br>to public transit real frequent public<br>transport rapid and frequent public<br>transit and other goods social and<br>public infrastructure not forgetting<br>those because that's what knits your<br>community together that's what holds<br>your community and then the most housing<br>urban zone was primarily around the<br>other centers so Town Center's local<br>centers and a little bit of real<br>neighborhood centers but not so much<br>good walkability is important and that<br>is all part of the the transport<br>orientation and more importantly the<br>provisions of these zones now exclude<br>any restriction on density and that is a<br>big change on the old planning documents<br>of the legacy councils so what that does<br>in lifting the density torniquet what<br>that says is it's all about the<br>standards you know the bulk and location<br>of buildings that really come becomes<br>really important and that's where your<br>skills as architects urban designers or<br>landscape architects come to the floor<br>so all of that is is enable more<br>site-specific solutions and additional<br>density through the unitary plan<br>so really the invitation in that area of<br>the plan is to get creative there is<br>great opportunity to be creative as an<br>architect as a designer urban designer<br>using those no density provisions and<br>but we've also got to look now you know<br>to to the edges this is where I get<br>slightly uncomfortable but I have to<br>present you with this information I'm a<br>I'm much more of the in the camp of<br>density in the footprint that we're<br>currently occupying inefficiently<br>rather than going quickly to the edges<br>to the quick buck real estate which a<br>particular minister espouses we have<br>some contests and our discussions on<br>that one but that is a very costly area<br>and I might come on to that later on it<br>is a very costly area to develop so we<br>have the I focus through the your<br>complain on both big green field and<br>brown field we need to address that in<br>both our noble our planning documents<br>but most growth absolutely is in the<br>brown field area but the future urban<br>land supply strategy is a document that<br>we have that's confirmed just in 2017<br>which identifies this land beyond the<br>rural urban boundary that in a sequenced<br>way once triggers are pulled we can<br>bring it in to the to be urbanized but<br>we've got an we'll have a monitoring<br>strategy it's just not anything can come<br>at at any time it's a structured<br>sequenced release of land to a<br>accommodate another sixty seven thousand<br>jobs in around about 138 thousand people<br>are dwellings but look there's been a<br>lot of discussion about green fields<br>versus brown fields and extending or<br>removing the rural urban boundary as<br>just alluding to this boundary is not a<br>hard boundary the old one you've heard<br>of the the former boundary the model of<br>metropolitan Lunada that was much more<br>of a hard boundary this is a soft<br>boundary so it does surprise me when I<br>hear some of the parliamentarians<br>talking about getting a you know getting<br>rid of this barrier it is not a barrier<br>it's a it's a soft and necessary<br>boundary and I've talked to you about<br>the split we we probably would we did<br>the or complain first time we<br>anticipated maybe about 30 or 40 percent<br>of future<br>being in the green fields the market is<br>indicating at the moment that that it<br>could end up quite a bit less than that<br>as it finds its attractive to be closer<br>to places of learning and earning some<br>of the recent green field numbers that<br>we're looking at in terms of just<br>enabling it with infrastructure are up<br>to around about a hundred and forty<br>thousand dollars per dwelling unit so<br>before you get anything out of the<br>ground you're going to have to pay a<br>developer one of your clients is going<br>to have to hand over a hundred and forty<br>eight hundred and forty thousand dollars<br>just to enable the infrastructure to be<br>put in place so the core infrastructure<br>for that one hundred and thirty-eight<br>thousand new dwellings is enlivened this<br>is not for the brownfields area this is<br>just the edges the future urban land<br>supply area it was estimated a year year<br>and a half ago two years ago at twenty<br>billion dollars so do some divisions on<br>that and you'll see what the cost of the<br>true cost of growing out of the edges is<br>now I saw I think was the act leader<br>comment recently about the housing<br>crisis and he really referred to it<br>being caused by artificially constrained<br>land that was boosting product prices<br>and they're just releasing flooding the<br>lane at flooding the market with land<br>would lower costs all around the world<br>that they have canvassed all these<br>problems and there's no evidence of that<br>and going forward what I'm saying to<br>ministers Minister Twyford don't have<br>much to do with David Parker but<br>minister Twyford he's a significant<br>player in this is that this needs to be<br>an evidenced based approach that if the<br>government wants to crash the rural<br>urban boundary it needs to show us the<br>evidence is it's asking us to show<br>evidence for projects like the CRL or<br>light rail or whatever infrastructure<br>that we might be working on with them so<br>it is a case of the good quality of<br>medium density development being<br>achieved in my view in<br>footprint that were already connected to<br>and that we could connect to better the<br>inves car-dependent<br>commutes to those far-flung places in a<br>supposedly affordable home come with a<br>mess of mortgage and I know for a fact<br>they come with an eternal motoring<br>mortgage that you'll be paying forever<br>so cheap house day one 30-year mortgage<br>driving your car back to your friends<br>back to education back to learning<br>because they are disconnected<br>communities and it is really hard to to<br>to Anna liven a community in green<br>fields areas that you feel anchored and<br>contained with for the first five years<br>show me a green fields development that<br>within five years you feel a sense that<br>you can belong there that you don't need<br>to move great distances probably the<br>most recent example would be Hobsonville<br>n companies Hobsonville it took probably<br>at least eight years before there was a<br>sort of sense of a bound community and<br>there was a community that a place that<br>you could it would hold you would hold<br>you on the weekends and you didn't need<br>to run away from it we had some<br>successes in competing for that compact<br>urban model earlier this year we had a<br>big one not being involved with us for I<br>think as long as I being a politician<br>since probably 2004-2005 and it predates<br>me fighting with Todd and processors up<br>there and long bay but this proposal<br>would have allowed for 1912 but we<br>always argued that preserving the long<br>bay Okuda<br>marine reserve for future generations<br>was more important and we've been proved<br>right by the courts a number of times<br>hopefully this is the last time and<br>we're going to have to defend that we're<br>all over boundary if we're going to make<br>this a great place for us<br>and all the generations that are yet to<br>come it's these places there are the<br>green lungs for the sea<br>it's this and others that provide the<br>productive lands that sustain us we've<br>chewed up a third of the Phuket curry<br>Hill beautiful a lake soils soils that<br>you can grow two crops a year on and<br>we've eaten it up with housing on a<br>third of it I mean that's just a<br>sacrilege a people you know politicians<br>like their memorials when they get to<br>get things right there's some<br>politicians that need to have their name<br>attached to the atrocious decisions as<br>well and I don't mind if miners as well<br>I'm only interested in getting it right<br>of course but I don't want a name on it<br>so there there has been a good one we've<br>got some others that we're looking at as<br>well create a hill decision you might be<br>familiar with that a magnificent<br>environment if you've ever gotten to<br>create a hill and walked around Wow it's<br>a stunner and anybody who puts a<br>document that you would want to chew<br>that up for housing credit Hill is east<br>of the airport and west of the motorway<br>if you know the there is a cemetery down<br>there mark our cemetery it's north of<br>that it's hard to get to area if you're<br>coming into Auckland and by aircraft<br>next time you come in out of Wellington<br>look out to your right side as you go<br>across the motorway and there's some<br>wetlands there and crater water-filled<br>crater it's a magnificent landscape but<br>this is I wanted to talk to you about<br>some of the learnings that we've had out<br>of our urban design panel so I've been a<br>real big fan of urban design panels I've<br>spoken to a lot of you most many of you<br>will have peered in front of the urban<br>design panel at something that I brought<br>in when I was a emotional counselor<br>working for the with the ministry for<br>the environment signing all the cities<br>up to the urban design protocol started<br>in Auckland but we started using it<br>developed our own small one for some<br>projects the outcomes of this have been<br>phenomenal and there's been a real<br>willingness from your profession to to<br>recognize this panel and a willingness<br>to be in front of it with your projects<br>it's not mandatory that's hopefully part<br>of the development process for you and<br>it's mandated to provide an independent<br>a truly independent design review of<br>primarily the larger and more complex<br>projects at this time but as we increase<br>the budget numbers just to increase the<br>budget for this so that we can drop down<br>into some smaller projects and that<br>typically reviews developments of 20<br>units plus but we're now giving it to<br>review public public space proposals as<br>well and I understand that the Altea<br>precinct area will be going in front of<br>the urbanism design panel very shortly<br>so there are seven key lessons that<br>we've learned out of this after in<br>numerous discussions with developers and<br>panel members and I want to go through<br>some of those lessons and the issues and<br>challenges that have been flushed out<br>first up go for excellence hiring<br>yourself a designer for a start and<br>that's what we're telling people that's<br>what I'm often telling people when<br>people come to me with you know an idea<br>to to to work on a project as get your<br>design team together and that's not just<br>your architect that's your urban design<br>your landscape acting a decent planner<br>to guide you through the myriad of<br>documents in its it's amazing still in<br>Auckland I know the number of projects<br>that are actually engaging your<br>professions is increasing but there are<br>a lot a lot of projects that you know it<br>is really down to drafting skills and<br>and in a bit of CAD to get an<br>application and so it's a challenge for<br>your profession to elevate the<br>profession and actually sell it more and<br>and also we are really keen at Auckland<br>Council to collaborate with you so we've<br>got the pre lodgement sessions available<br>to work things out before the the you<br>know the account starts rolling up the<br>numbers<br>the second big lesson out of the urban<br>design panel and through developers is<br>get your context right understand your<br>context engaged with your context a good<br>design as you well know and I'm probably<br>preaching to what you already know here<br>but it's got to be you know have that<br>empathetic relationship with its<br>immediate and near context and what<br>you're what you're working on as a<br>response should always be as a result of<br>that for me that's sort of just 101 in<br>getting density right engaging with<br>neighboring developments with<br>neighboring communities engaging with<br>heritage that's present engaging with<br>the natural and and with the existing<br>built to lead an outcome that is going<br>to be a lot stronger and being from the<br>North Shore I'm very very aware of the<br>historic context of Devonport of<br>Birkenhead and I've seen a lot of<br>mimicking if you look at the wonderful F<br>field Devonport library doesn't try to<br>mimic at all doesn't try to pretend that<br>there's Edwardian Victorian stuff across<br>the road it's honest to that but it's<br>got references to that but it doesn't<br>try to mimic it and it's a it's a 21st<br>century building it's a fantastic<br>building it was a real contest to get it<br>there because you had a community that<br>thought it needed have a pointy roof but<br>it's it's there and people have really<br>fallen in love with oh it's a fantastic<br>the public Inc I also wanted to just<br>mention actually another example our<br>Northcote and I'm not sure whether<br>there's anybody from isthmus here<br>estimates have been doing some great<br>work at North Dakota is one of our panic<br>you unlock places council owns a lot of<br>Northcote center this is North gets into<br>the crown owns a lot of the lanes around<br>under housing New Zealand when you've<br>got two significant landowners you've<br>got an opportunity to do something and<br>so we're in the throes of a master plan<br>for the north cape town center and we've<br>taken it to the point where we're buying<br>out just every property there to get a<br>master plan that's not impede by not<br>having control of everything and up<br>there you've got this wonderful rich<br>diversity of people our strong strong<br>Filipino Chinese Korean community<br>underpinning it and that been amazing<br>contributors and I guess that's where I<br>emphasize that it's not just about<br>placemaking it's also about place<br>keeping recognizing that there are just<br>there are always valuable things to to<br>keep in to build on rather than make<br>over the top and I I have seen that<br>quite a lot in Auckland where you know<br>you hear this tune placemaking and it's<br>like nothing of value that's already<br>there is worth acknowledgement so I I'm<br>quite keen and in seeing that we do<br>recognise the value of what's there<br>recognizing that and building upon us<br>and that's what we are doing in North<br>code you'll see more of that to come<br>third lesson is get your site's order<br>open space pedestrian movements parking<br>I've got parking in brackets that's a<br>little bit better about me again<br>you know locate located blocks your<br>circulation your open spaces parking in<br>brackets concurrently don't do them<br>separately they don't belong and their<br>own little silos you've got to do it in<br>integrated way and so there are many<br>considerations and demands on your<br>limited space your campus but the key<br>elements are going to be those buildings<br>you know vehicle entrances the parking<br>possibly open space pedestrian movement<br>networks all of that and but where one<br>dominates the other eg Auckland the<br>parking is dominated for decades and you<br>get some pretty perversity outcomes so<br>get the balance right there in your<br>design process and you'll get a good<br>outcome making parking disappear one of<br>my favorite lessons out of the urban<br>design panel one of the great<br>achievements of the unitary plan is that<br>less off street parking is now required<br>and in some instances no off street<br>parking and we worked really hard to get<br>that that was one of my personal pushes<br>there are lots of things you focus on<br>when you're building the unitary plan<br>but again lessons from big international<br>cities is we needed to really work hard<br>on this we've got pushed back very<br>strongly by the development community<br>the development community is now going<br>wow I'm glad you got it right and we got<br>it wrong because we are now studying to<br>achieve what the market wants which is<br>not necessarily having to pay an extra<br>hundred and twenty five thousand dollars<br>on top of the dwelling price for a car<br>park because they are in proximity to<br>rapid transit frequent transit getting<br>them to their earning and learning<br>opportunities car parking spaces if they<br>have to be provided let's integrate it<br>let's not have any upfront showing<br>itself to the street that the car park<br>should not be the showpiece to the<br>street let that be you you you're<br>building that you're creating the the<br>spaces that you're creating prioritizing<br>real estate for car parking is<br>medium-density done wrong in in my view<br>so we're seeing a whole new context for<br>that limited amount of space space for<br>cars<br>is being repurposed and we'll be seeing<br>a lot more of that in our public areas<br>as well in the 1950s we mortgaged out<br>our streets to Motor Vehicles and and I<br>think it's time to call that mortgage in<br>streets make up about 25-30 percent of<br>urban Oakland and that road space is<br>beckoning us particularly in city center<br>areas major centers it is that road<br>space that is the new open space where<br>you can't create new parks you actually<br>have to take back what you loan to the<br>motor vehicle sixty years ago it's only<br>on the unity plan allows for a lot more<br>density as you know around our transport<br>hubs through the removal of those<br>density provisions increased height<br>limits gone over that and we're rapidly<br>building a 21st century worthy transit<br>system and we ramping that up now with<br>regional fuel tax better government<br>funding a tap and good plans twenty<br>eight billion dollar package of<br>investments over coming years on things<br>like city demand like rail more to come<br>on that<br>Eastern bus way it's all underway now<br>additional trains coming in two years I<br>think it is now one and a half years bus<br>priority rollouts delivering mess of<br>dividends northern Express just got the<br>numbers through March on March match 19<br>on march 18 the northern expresses up 39<br>percent frequent bus match on March up<br>31% pokery rail up 19 percent people are<br>flocking to public transport it's yes<br>they did it back in the 50s different<br>place then but it is an enormous an<br>enormous appetite for public transport<br>right now and with then we're gonna wrap<br>around that all the great walking and<br>cycling opportunities we're also seeing<br>the bike boom underway well underway<br>it's been underway for probably about<br>three years now and then a subset of<br>that as the ebike revolution ebikes<br>are<br>selling cars and New Zealand by about<br>ten to one no media on that you'll see<br>lots of media about the number of V's<br>cars are sold you won't see much about<br>the ebike revolution so we've seen great<br>num big increases in the city centre<br>we've seen a really quick shift and<br>maybe a lot of us is linked to the you<br>know construction of access but we're<br>seeing a shift in about three or four<br>months from 50% driving into the city<br>centre it's now down to 43%<br>at the end of March and active modes are<br>up they've done stuck to about 9% so<br>some good trends happening there and<br>then there's micro mobility and this is<br>all important about medium density being<br>done well and it's relevant there is a<br>runaway success of the the East scooters<br>and today we just announced three new<br>three companies all up in addition to<br>lime and wave a company out of<br>Wellington Flamingo will also be coming<br>to Auckland and we'll have about I think<br>it's about 1,800 scooters on the market<br>in city center and there's tier two and<br>Tier three to make sure that we get a<br>read of how people in Monaco or<br>Henderson or el Burnie enjoy scooters<br>not just the urban population close to<br>so one medium density needs to reflect<br>all those changes as well now think of<br>it think of it how many of us would have<br>anticipated the the arrival and enormous<br>success of East scooters 18 months ago<br>probably none of us would have<br>anticipated that you see people on<br>electric long boards now there's a whole<br>lot of things coming down lime<br>experimenting with I think they're<br>called uni pods know that having unit is<br>a two seater traveling device there are<br>going to be devices in technology which<br>is going to disrupt us you cannot<br>probably anticipate<br>look at how each scooters has disrupted<br>us and just multiply that by 10 over the<br>next few years it's going to change very<br>very rapidly and somebody asked me last<br>night are you but how many people are<br>giving up their cars to come to a<br>scooters<br>well Lyme's information their surveys<br>indicate that some 22 percent of their<br>users giving up on a motor vehicle to<br>take a scooter which is a good outcome<br>let's go to focusing on shared spaces<br>giving attention to activation and the<br>attractiveness of those spaces is<br>important providing generous planting we<br>need to green the city up pretty quickly<br>with climate change coming eros or with<br>us you know a adaptable seating in these<br>public spaces you know getting the soft<br>and a hard next right avoiding filling<br>up public spaces we've been pretty good<br>at that in the past just because it's<br>open suddenly sometimes<br>let's give architects the lesser ones<br>myth you are very quick to see that the<br>space is open so therefore it needs to<br>be filled I don't get that we need to<br>make sure that these these spaces<br>particularly in the city center can be<br>flexible that they can be intimate there<br>can be places where people congregate<br>with a where they linger where they have<br>their lunch and socialize and then they<br>come alive at night you know a place for<br>protest all of that that's how we need<br>to see our public spaces rather than<br>being you know the perfect landscape<br>architecture solution for maybe one<br>purpose they've got to provide a lot<br>more than that locating communal public<br>spaces if you're working on multi-unit<br>developments you know looking at the<br>movement networks that are around there<br>and within there the paths and lane ways<br>and just valuing all of that when you're<br>working things up making them really<br>relevant and desirable<br>their communal is open spaces they all<br>need their their sunlight that they need<br>their daylight they also need this shade<br>though got to be wary of designing a<br>space in the winter that doesn't work in<br>the summer you'll be commissioning<br>you'll be getting projects come your way<br>at the moment be an architect not for<br>the season that you're designing it in<br>be an architect for all the Four Seasons<br>and the change in the climate to come<br>making sure that those shared spaces<br>overlook the housing rather than being<br>entirely entombed and not relating you<br>know allowing those those dwellings to<br>observe the public spaces to participate<br>in the public spaces from afar giving<br>them life with without being that so<br>overt you know bringing public cooking<br>to public spaces we're looking at a<br>great public sphere and Takapuna at the<br>moment one of the things I've asked for<br>is to to what pre-wired have electricity<br>points and water points where you can<br>take water to form four markets you can<br>maybe take a guess take tech guess off<br>for cooking and that might be four<br>markets or it might be an event look we<br>see these in other cities there's no<br>reason why we can't do it here the other<br>another lesson is it's about you know<br>shaping a great city<br>you guys you have an important role here<br>as you well know in delivering not just<br>buildings but healthy streets and<br>neighborhoods I've emphasized the need<br>to you know break down the mess and<br>break down those overly large apartment<br>blocks into you know appropriately<br>appropriately human scale buildings in<br>an endeavor to create those livable<br>environments environments that feel that<br>a human being belongs there and I do<br>take my hat off to all those that have<br>been involved with the Wynyard cord I<br>know a number of you have been involved<br>when you<br>quarter but the women quarter is just<br>unfolding beautifully there's a real<br>sense of delight down there now and the<br>market is is responding the market wants<br>you know people want to be there<br>admittedly it's pretty highly priced and<br>it lacks the affordable component but<br>there are still some good lessons to be<br>head from the winded quarter the soft<br>infrastructure ISM is critically<br>important as well I've covered that you<br>know we need to allow nature to go to<br>work in our cities like never before and<br>I talked about some of you talked about<br>also the sponge city we've seen we've<br>been a city where it's disposed of its<br>water it's jettisoned its water into the<br>streams drains waterways and how to see<br>in the future we're going to have to<br>receive and hold that water make use of<br>its celebrator and and have that water<br>contribute to the greening of the city<br>as well and and you know get those<br>aquifers recharged keep it with us<br>rather than treating it as something<br>that is a waste product that's the<br>stormwater I'm talking about and a good<br>example of that is up and wire on my<br>patch and we did this about four years<br>ago and I can't remember who the<br>landscape architect was I should sorry<br>this has been hugely successful this is<br>at the top of the wire our catchment and<br>their whole catch going down that<br>catchment it is a concrete culvert all<br>the way pretty much all the way to the<br>sea and in time we'll have to remove all<br>of that concrete and we will it'll be a<br>long job but already communities are<br>crying out for for that in a bit more<br>starting at the Milford End and working<br>up so we're working from both ends at<br>the moment this is a beautiful project<br>you're seeing fish life return you're<br>seeing the Eels travel from the sea<br>invertebrate life up here wading birds<br>turn up this is in a really in a light<br>industrial area if you know it right<br>beside the motorway bothers<br>think you're right yeah I'll go back to<br>climate change though and you'll see us<br>draw a big focus on climate change in<br>about a month at our environment and<br>community committee penny Haas has been<br>doing a lot of work on this and there is<br>a question at the moment whether we<br>actually declare for the city of climate<br>emergency I'm having that discussion<br>with Penny and with the mayor about not<br>just having a climate action plan but<br>actually recognizing that we do actually<br>have a climate emergency and this is of<br>course being discussed in many cities at<br>the moment such is the enormity and<br>immediacy of this challenge it is no<br>escaping it yeah there's nowhere to go<br>there's no hideaways that you can<br>conjure up to escape this one so we are<br>going to have to ensure that we address<br>this like it is an emergency and look<br>probably last listen is ultimately<br>you're you're contributing to all the<br>people of the city in what you're<br>creating and it's all about the quality<br>of life holistically it is not just<br>about creating them homes or or places<br>to work or the or the public spaces they<br>might be congregating it is it's all<br>about delivering a as I term an enduring<br>quality of life wherever we go in our<br>city we should be experiencing great<br>places great buildings buildings that we<br>we can we can we do celebrate that we we<br>have a recognition of as being that<br>seems to me that contributes to me there<br>helps me stay in this place<br>it helps me that makes me smile I think<br>I've spoken a lot about daylight light<br>always remember the Christopher<br>Alexander book when I briefed an<br>architect I briefed<br>to some project a few years ago and it<br>took me a lot to my wife and I a long<br>time to write the brief I think was<br>about 10-12 page brief but one of the<br>one of the books that I I loved was<br>Christopher Alexander's patent language<br>and I'm sure most of you are familiar<br>with it but I always remember how<br>Christopher Alexander talking about like<br>from two sides and I've never forgotten<br>that<br>and I I do see a number of apartments<br>being going through the application<br>process today that are probably a bit<br>too deep and lacking that ability to<br>have like pin track them there's nothing<br>like light to wake you up not just in<br>the morning but throughout the day being<br>able to be in proximity to natural light<br>is just a gift so we need to get that<br>right and reflect on Christopher<br>Alexander are getting you stamp Heights<br>right you know 2.7 minimums and above<br>under that it's a cocoon and it's not<br>pleasant to be in so if you're a client<br>is insistent on you know lowering those<br>their Heights challenge them and the<br>easy flow between rooms that<br>connectivity between living rooms and<br>kitchen that's there you know that's the<br>that's the place of dwellings where the<br>you know people are magnetized to and<br>then there's those connections to your<br>living spaces ultimately your outdoor<br>room spaces and beyond your outdoor<br>rooms your outdoor spaces into the<br>street space so when ensuring that good<br>colleague to design as we intensify is<br>absolutely paramount you're all making a<br>massive difference to the the<br>Aucklanders that you're working for and<br>all the openers that will follow on and<br>let's ensure that what we are doing in<br>terms of medium density doing it well is<br>something that we can all sit back and<br>look back on and our careers 20 years<br>hence 30 years hence and still be proud<br>of the projects that you're working on<br>I'm sure there'll be some lessons<br>learned but<br>hopefully we can all sit back 20 30<br>years hence and go yeah<br>they added that added that didn't take<br>away so I think I might just wrap it<br>there and there isn't a tread water<br>approach in Auckland's future we have a<br>lot to do and got to do it fast the<br>challenges I've outlined affect us all<br>it's not council does this and you do<br>that we need to be in this together and<br>we need to tackle a this avalanche of<br>challenges that are at us head-on in<br>quite different ways to how we've done<br>it before<br>so I wish you well in your life for me<br>so we know that a city that the the best<br>thing a city can do to play its part in<br>combating the onslaught of climate<br>change trying to slow it up is to<br>address how that city moves there's lots<br>of evidence on this so transportation is<br>where you need to look first and<br>basically revolutionize your how you<br>move around the city so moving around by<br>private motor vehicle with an occupancy<br>in the AM and PM pkers we currently do<br>of 1.1 that's the 75% of a private motor<br>vehicle and the alien peak is empty so<br>with we've got to do a focus faster than<br>we are now so we've got to accelerate<br>the shift in mode from single occupant<br>vehicles private transport to rapid<br>transit to frequent transit to active<br>transport numbers are good but we are<br>going to have to invest even more<br>significantly and bring more out of the<br>toolbox I don't know what it's going to<br>be we are going to have to you know find<br>the spend but if we as a city like other<br>big cities are going to tackle climate<br>change you have to address address<br>transport there's no there's no way<br>around this we won't be driving as we<br>are today in five years and not remotely<br>and that'll look very different than 10<br>years<br>yeah there is good to see ya there are<br>some funds are enough so we've got level<br>crossings and we've got fatalities on<br>the level crossings we'll get a good big<br>focus on road safety leaders a road<br>it's a railroad intersection of railroad<br>in Road<br>we've got far too many serious injuries<br>and fatalities on those crossings we've<br>got some challenges out west as you well<br>know there is budget there is budget in<br>queue rail as well but there is not<br>enough budget to accelerate that road<br>with salty seas yeah so share cars<br>okay so there are lots of examples where<br>you you know you can't<br>I mean people you say I forgive that<br>you're a cycling pilgrimage Chris you<br>know I can't go to a supermarket on the<br>cycle well that's a fallacy now isn't it<br>you know there's plenty of people going<br>to a supermarket on this cycle you just<br>buy differently but look there are going<br>to be lots of categories where this the<br>transport plane doesn't it doesn't cover<br>everybody we're trying to cover most<br>people and it's a challenge but look I<br>can tell you now there won't be a 15<br>minutes service to the three meters well<br>at Norway there won't be a bus going to<br>you know take surfers to motorway or<br>pakery we just can't do there but there<br>will be other solutions and there<br>probably are solutions I haven't had to<br>explore those but someone mentions City<br>Hall go and ask someone for a car often<br>when I get caught out on the weekend I<br>got caught out on something I just asked<br>yep I recognize that well I guess what<br>I'm what I'm saying there Simon is we<br>won't be providing a bus to Moodle I<br>just to go to the surf break yeah well<br>obviously knows where there's a bit of<br>break yeah I take your point though<br>imagination<br>yeah so this is something we came to<br>stand directly at the neural housing<br>task force Kristina was on the rural<br>housing task force and we looked at the<br>need for innovation in building<br>technology it's big focus area MB are<br>just about to report to the Merrill<br>housing task force it was their body of<br>work to work on they've been working on<br>it for a long time<br>and it's recognized we've got people<br>from Fletcher building on that ever<br>design panel from other victim<br>you know big developers they all<br>recognize that they can not build the<br>way they're building into the future you<br>know we've got a resource of timber in<br>this country you can vertically stack in<br>timber construction there and I've seen<br>examples of up to I think it's eight<br>eight stories eight nine stories is it<br>even more yes and looking at your you<br>know material choices is something that<br>the not just the industry needs to<br>examine but look you're prescribing as<br>well you you're sorry you're you're<br>specify you're as architects you're<br>specifying so you're in charge here if<br>you know that then for you to go back to<br>your clients hey hey look you don't need<br>to do it this concrete this concrete<br>comes from Portland that comes from the<br>West Coast it comes through you know<br>energy setting batching plants I've got<br>this timber solution for you and Sol<br>pain in some ways it's in your court<br>building code yes so the code across<br>yeah so there is some work being done on<br>this by Mb and I think it's jus the<br>mural housing task force next month how<br>forward but I put it to you that<br>planning is probably more much more<br>responsible and will be much more<br>responsible to transport cities before<br>Cavins most about bus without running<br>cost building early trick anyway so it's<br>yep<br>great look it was<br>it was some it was back in the Franklin<br>district days just about all of that was<br>permitted under the Franklin District<br>Council before the the new structure<br>came in I don't know the names I<br>probably wouldn't knuckle them anyways<br>we've had to move on it's a it's a real<br>it's a crying shame when you are in<br>pokey<br>what's my stance on on the the<br>light-rail as proposed city center to<br>Margaret II to the airport anything okay<br>look at the net project this what you<br>have heard is the the light rail project<br>city centre through Mount Roskill<br>Dominion Road or new hanger mangani<br>Airport is the government's project that<br>they'd been done really picked up a<br>project that we've been working on for a<br>while and thankfully they're going to be<br>the cost of it so it's in a business<br>case stage and broadly speaking that<br>business case means that that they're<br>talking to a couple of major funders the<br>but that's better than only about I<br>think it's only five or seven eight<br>percent max of those that are boarding<br>in the city center are going to be<br>boarding an aircraft we often think<br>about this is the great connection from<br>city centre to the airport's total<br>fallacy the whole idea of that light<br>rail project is to connect the thousand<br>tens of thousands of people that are<br>going to be living in the isthmus so the<br>SMS all at Mount Roscoe Lee area and<br>parser mongery a quite disconnected from<br>yeah it is in the second fastest growing<br>economic zone in Auckland is actually<br>Airport economic zone and that extends<br>quite a way to the north as well but the<br>the first win in terms of connection<br>we've got a design for a new police<br>station if you've been to Rapa Nui it's<br>pretty much I'm not going to get off<br>there so that will be major interchange<br>from the south from from the way Qatar<br>but primarily from the north and then<br>you'll transfer there to a rapid bus<br>system on priority access priority lanes<br>to the airport and so that will just be<br>moving between the airport per Whanui<br>and beck again and then in time it'll be<br>airport Peru in Manukau and back and<br>then further afield it'll be punching<br>through theatres on you drive and out<br>towards botany there's these are<br>initially buses year yeah so when I'm<br>going to the airport now I I in durably<br>I'm in didn't port I'm a fairy<br>I'm I don't do the sky bus I transfer to<br>the rail get off a puppet or a tele<br>never look at the timetable because I<br>know there's a bus every 15 minutes of<br>Papa territory and it's a pretty quick<br>way to the airport then it's a dames<br>integrated fear and it's a damn sight<br>cheaper than the sky bus but we need to<br>promote that I just don't know why<br>that's not promoted as by open transport<br>is there's a really easy route but<br>that's just from my catchment you know<br>look our technical staff we don't see<br>them on overseas junkets you don't need<br>to do that and we get scolded for there<br>but look I'm I'm not the one that's can<br>you know contributing all the technical<br>you know data etc but I'll start from<br>very familiar and I'm familiar with some<br>really successful cities am I think one<br>of my favorite cities is Copenhagen I<br>love Copenhagen I love Stockholm Malmo<br>for me it's a lot of those those cities<br>and in some ways we're quite culturally<br>similar as well<br>they don't have this wonderful autumn<br>diversity that we have got maybe<br>Stockholm but look this we've looked we<br>with Swiss cities have made mistakes as<br>well but you can go to Bing Coover great<br>city get the rail and go out about 15<br>minutes and I don't think it's a great<br>city but get the rail and go out in<br>Auckland and you're not necessarily a<br>great city either I think you know<br>you've got to be careful when you look<br>at overseas examples reading them from<br>the core you've really got to read the<br>whole city and it embarrasses me<br>sometimes when I see or can rise up and<br>you know these Mercer rankings and<br>economists rankings as the world's most<br>livable city etc I'd really like to ask<br>some of these people that are writing<br>these stories how long they were in the<br>hotel for you know I don't get a sense<br>that they have actually explored all and<br>they have gone surfing and they haven't<br>gone to Ottawa and they haven't seen<br>Margaery and you know they haven't seen<br>the pockets on the North Shore I'm<br>really suspicious of those rankings<br>don't don't put a lot of weight on them<br>to be honest but in terms of cities yep<br>we can learn from a lot but then you<br>have to create in this context and we've<br>got to understand you know the Tamaki<br>Makaurau context as well because that is<br>currently there is this afternoon we met<br>with Minister filt Wofford on some<br>transport issues and some housing issues<br>down in the South we would see Minister<br>Phil probably every two weeks like he's<br>in he's actually meeting with us I<br>recently wrote a letter on universal<br>design interest to all of you we lost<br>the universal design provisions and the<br>unitary plans really so we're going to<br>go back and have another look write a<br>letter to I think it was Minister Mahuta<br>got a reply from three ministers all<br>wanting to come and talk to us about<br>universal design so we had Minister<br>bahudha Minister Solis administer<br>Twyford at that meeting there so this is<br>working on things that we think are<br>important Universal Design and access<br>we're getting real big uptake we don't<br>have a shortage of ministers wanting to<br>come and talk to us I'm probably keen<br>that there is you some of you might be<br>familiar with a PwC report about cities<br>recently I've always thought there needs<br>to be a minister of cities because I've<br>been critical at government's former<br>labour last national not understanding<br>cities cities are the future of nations<br>and they they've been pretty shy on it<br>but look I can say with look and this is<br>not just for some political response or<br>smart aleck stuff the relationship with<br>current government this is pretty damn<br>510 I'm probably not I'm not this is<br>probably not going to come out in any<br>rational way but we need to address we<br>need to get the spine of Rapid Transit<br>finished the spine of Rapid Transit so<br>we we need to do that light rail<br>Experion we need to electrify to book a<br>Cowie we need to go west with light rail<br>we need to punch out of the light rail<br>that blends in the city center under the<br>harbor and go north and then you've got<br>your spine and then you've got then your<br>entire mobility laterals off there with<br>a grade light rail connections but one<br>probably the thing that comes to mind<br>for me is I'm a little bit I'm quite<br>concerned about our centers and the<br>health of our centers and the onslaught<br>of online if you are familiar with<br>what's happened in the UK there are<br>centers that have imploded they imploded<br>when you know all the steel industries<br>closed down and the car manufacturing<br>plants closed down and they resuscitator<br>themselves and that collapsing again and<br>we here we're exposed to trade me in a<br>bit of Amazon and Amazon the building of<br>you know big warehouse over in Australia<br>so we'll see a bit more but we don't<br>have JD calm we don't have la barba and<br>the half-dozen others that that European<br>market has access to so also I think we<br>need to think about what our future<br>centres are I'm seeing really weak<br>centres and the future is not in<br>traditional retail it's going to be a<br>different retail it's going to be less<br>retail<br>and the biggest growth at the moment in<br>terms of retailers food and beverage<br>it's growing about fourteen sixteen<br>percent per annum<br>that's about people gathering<br>congregating exchanging there's<br>opportunities there I have thought I<br>don't want to give away too much about<br>election policies mr. Wilson but I I<br>until the CRL decision I would be<br>angling for probably half a billion<br>dollars in the next eight years to go<br>into centers and that that alone<br>wouldn't go very far you probably need a<br>a billion we're gonna we are definitely<br>going to have to think about our<br>sentence<br>yeah and that that sort of cohesive<br>plane you'd expect it to be with the<br>government but there's never really been<br>an invitation to understand when<br>Auckland grows and prices explode here a<br>year longer a grows and telling there<br>grows and Hamilton grows and everything<br>in between grows but it's very organic<br>at the moment<br>it's there's not I don't get a sense<br>that there's anybody and Wellington<br>thinking about that we struggle to just<br>keep up with Auckland and so it's a<br>little bit beyond our arena but we could<br>certainly participate in there because<br>we know where the pressures are and we<br>don't have all the answers here I cry<br>for funerai for example I know fun or a<br>pretty well and it's just been abandoned<br>for such a long time you know National<br>Party take the vote for granted and then<br>walk away and don't don't invest there<br>the current guy is investing but this is<br>this is a you know very similar stories<br>all in New Zealand there are many many<br>towns that have imploded because all the<br>focus has been on the big one week<br>that's why I say you know what Condor<br>yeah we'll see how that shakes out I'm<br>very open if it's evidence-based and if<br>it says go there or part of it goes<br>there I'm with it I'd probably like to<br>put the Navy into play as well I think<br>there could be some synergies if you put<br>the Navy into play at the moment I think<br>that's a my next letter of the wrong<br>markers and talk to Shane about putting<br>the navy into play yeah just just<br>briefly because we need to ret but Navy<br>you've changed their remuneration that I<br>provide housing anymore like they used<br>to at a discounted rate and so all that<br>housing on the Democrat benancio I'm<br>very familiar with it has been<br>transferred through treaty settlement<br>and most of the Navy ratings if you're a<br>new rating and you get a place on north<br>yard for six weeks or so and then you<br>have to find your own it's yeah it's<br>changed dramatically we we supposedly<br>have got a travel plan with Navy they've<br>done some things but we really need to<br>wake them up on how they move their<br>people to it from McDonald that's the<br>Navy that's an anchor the balance all of<br>us who live on the peninsula need to<br>due to design Authority I certainly hope<br>because that will be a powerful body I<br>simply hope that body follows a lot with<br>the guidelines and policy that's been<br>established at the moment rather than<br>going up and trying to get some</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
