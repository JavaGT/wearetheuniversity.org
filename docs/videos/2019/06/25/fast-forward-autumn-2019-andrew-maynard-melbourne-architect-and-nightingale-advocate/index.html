This semester we continue our focus on the question: How can we do medium density well? This series is proudly supported by GIBÂ®.<br><br>Andrew Maynard, Melbourne Architect and Nightingale Advocate<br><br>Andrew Maynard is a partner producing 'well-conceived, playful and edgy' architecture in the Melbourne firm Austin Maynard Architects. He is also a founder and board member of Nightingale Housing: 'a social enterprise that supports, promotes and advocates for high-quality housing that is ecologically, socially and financially sustainable'. Maynard was an investor in and designer of the first Nightingale project which, in addition to being community-oriented, was the first residential building in Australia to be 100% fossil fuel free and carbon neutral. Andrew will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities offered by this type of project while staying true to the original Nightingale principles. <br><br>--<br><br>For more information about our

everybody<br>anybody that see me speak before I'm<br>sorry I've got like three gags and I say<br>them every single time every<br>presentations here the same 3x it's<br>great to be back in Auckland I bloody<br>love coming New Zealand I'd like to take<br>back here Prime Minister if that's all<br>right<br>we've got currently a race going on<br>between two mediocre white men because<br>you know they're always the best choice<br>aren't they<br>speaking of mediocre white men awesome<br>they're Arctic's we okay is this thing<br>working I don't know is is this the<br>thing I'm talking to all that it's okay<br>you give me can you hear me yeah okay<br>who were the thought I'm a professional<br>it's true quality awesome<br>alright so we're all in this together<br>really in terms of housing affordability<br>you're probably all seen the stats in<br>terms of the housing affordability index<br>five point one of your the median income<br>is considered basically an index of five<br>point one means the median income in the<br>area that's hell that's how much you<br>have to pay five point one times of your<br>annual income to pay for a house where<br>you live so under the index that's<br>considered severely unaffordable now<br>when you look at Auckland Melbourne and<br>Sydney we're all you know nine point six<br>ten twelve point two we're all civilian<br>affordable twice over we're<br>twice over basically especially if<br>you're a millennial like if you're a<br>millennial there's pretty much a zero<br>access to housing without your parents<br>helping you out which is the tragic and<br>you've probably got similar news<br>headlines the other compounding factors<br>we've got in Australia is that we've got<br>the world's biggest houses now which is<br>surprising and shocking and really we've<br>got this culture that seems to be more<br>or more trying to privatize everything<br>have one of everything<br>build your high the offense is higher<br>looking would buy a pool give tennis<br>school if you can and obviously that's<br>problematic in terms of housing<br>affordability in terms of space because<br>it obviously is urban sprawl but also in<br>terms of community so we've just sector<br>ourselves into these individuals<br>separate from each other housing<br>affordability even though you I'm not<br>sure what it's like here but you know<br>this there's falling house prices in<br>Australia that's where people want to<br>live for they're actually pretty static<br>housing affordability is still just a<br>much as much of a problem<br>Melbourne is flat I'm originally from<br>Tazi so you know it's quite surprising<br>you know everything else get any<br>elevation unless you're a tall building<br>in Melbourne but melvins flat and<br>there's no real topography constraints<br>so the urban sprawl is just out of<br>control building right into our food<br>belts and getting towards our areas and<br>homelessness is on the rise and it's<br>stark you see on the street it is really<br>surprising over the last few years how<br>many people<br>streets and they typically represent<br>about 6% of their homelessness in that<br>area other people you actually see on<br>the street<br>in Melbourne itself with our problem is<br>that we have to house about 100,000 new<br>Melbourne Ian's every year for the next<br>30 years and there is no policy in place<br>there's no solution in place for that<br>and because of that developers are being<br>able to exploit the situation to either<br>buy up packs and just build you know<br>horizontal urban sprawl where everybody<br>has their own driveway and they drive<br>into their garage close the door and<br>never see anybody in the way they have<br>to drive two kilometres to go get a<br>liter of milk or use it to exploit sites<br>to maximize yield on-site saying they're<br>dealing with housing affordability when<br>in fact they're simply dealing<br>commercial stop boxes and fundamentally<br>those solutions have left us with a<br>broken system there's is leaving many<br>people and plus things like um negative<br>gearing as well you know you more<br>incentivize in Australia by seventh<br>house than you are to buy your first<br>house it's ridiculous and then you look<br>at what so developers over the last<br>couple of decades have gone to to<br>government if so let's see if we've got<br>this just lets build taller and we'll<br>just make more houses it's easy and when<br>you look at the outcome of that on South<br>Bank you end up with six levels of car<br>parking very little public interface<br>lots of 7-elevens and things like that<br>the ground level really tiny spaces<br>incredibly poor livability and around<br>85% of those assaulting investors and<br>the vast majority of those investors are<br>overseas investors that never brought up<br>the plan and have never even seen the<br>apartment they bought they bought a<br>commodity what will prove what<br>statistically provides the greatest<br>return it's a two bedroom apartment two<br>bathroom with it carpark<br>that's a commodity decision nobody is<br>asking the people living these buildings<br>what they actually want from their<br>housing they're being left out of the<br>equation and what's more is within these<br>within this housing as well on average<br>people are staying there about 11 months<br>so how do you<br>build and foster community if you've<br>constantly got this you know this<br>rotating community around you<br>and so nightingale housing is sort of<br>this spotlight like look at these people<br>that are thinking outside the norm to<br>create something innovative and new and<br>the reality is that that's not true at<br>all we are cut and pasting well-worn<br>solutions that have been around for many<br>many decades in Europe and other places<br>in the world yeah build six or seven<br>stories high no five or six stories how<br>I know higher than that because looking<br>the clouds get good passive surveillance<br>ones to the street try and really<br>connect to the ground plane so you get<br>great community spaces outside it's not<br>that hard and so all throughout<br>the world you see these great solutions<br>solutions so we sort of came to the<br>conclusion that and when I say we this<br>is a bunch of Melbourne architects so<br>breathe started it ourselves six degrees<br>Kennedy know I learned clear cousins<br>instead of being competitors of each<br>other with each other we just basically<br>said let's be stronger together<br>good old left-wing politics let's<br>actually try and tackle this together<br>now somebody should fix this and we're a<br>bunch of somebodies but what we really<br>quickly realized was individually we<br>were off trying these different things I<br>spend a lot of time with prefab thinking<br>build cheaper will provide cheaper<br>housing that's not the case we'll<br>provide a cheaper building solution that<br>will then be sold at maximum yield on<br>the open market and who gets that<br>returning between there's the developer<br>what are actually lowering housing<br>prices so we realized that good design<br>is an entirely equation and most of<br>those solutions have been solved you<br>know they've already been solved for us<br>the decision-makers other developers and<br>they're the ones the set the goal posts<br>and the a property developer sorry I<br>don't made it I'm not trying to keep<br>that my intent is not to keep the hell<br>out of probably Bowman it's it's these<br>are business people that's primarily a<br>purpose so they're acting within that<br>mandate that's how we make money that's<br>how you have a healthy economies by<br>producing and selling commodities the<br>problem is that housing should not be<br>doing<br>it's actually a human right access to<br>housing but because of our legislation<br>we've allowed business people to come<br>and produce these commodity commodities<br>rather than producing housing the<br>developer is a business person not a<br>housing provider and sadly in Australia<br>we don't have government like it was<br>throughout your this happens throughout<br>Europe providing housing where it's<br>but I've opted out so I served my<br>practice in 2002 and if being approached<br>by developers time time again and I've<br>just said I know that medium density<br>housing is the solution to melvin's<br>housing needs but I'm not doing it yeah<br>we're going to work for them because<br>what you just you hear the horror<br>stories over and over again you get your<br>fee gets compressed and the first couple<br>times I was really excited and then it<br>was obvious that they said they only<br>wanted two things from me one brand they<br>want to use our brand they knew that we<br>had a lot of people that couldn't afford<br>one of our single residential houses but<br>they could actually probably afford an<br>apartment that's branded Austin main<br>architects and secondly and so at first<br>I was like brilliant I've got all these<br>cool ideas about how we can create<br>really great community centered<br>sustainable housing and I like sweetie<br>so we don't need that from you we've got<br>our spreadsheets that show our<br>profitability we know what works we've<br>got our plans already<br>you know stores it out what we need from<br>you is to design the outside make it<br>really pretty on the outside darling<br>yeah because that's what you love you're<br>an architect make it pretty and we<br>it you know I'm not actually interested<br>if what this is is a branding exercise<br>for evidence and searly trying to deal<br>with good quality housing so we opted<br>out for four years you know<br>graph you know we aim to produce housing<br>that's that's environmentally socially<br>and financially sustainable triple<br>bottom line development they all have<br>equal importance there's not a charity<br>that's still making a profit within the<br>capitalist system but what it's not<br>doing is minimizing what we need to do<br>under our legislative requirements to<br>tick the boxes of sustainability and<br>livability and maximize<br>returns where possible James leg from<br>six degrees so describes he says just<br>turning capitalism down from 11 you know<br>just making it you know still making a<br>profit but not being exploitative but if<br>you'll indulge I've got a million slides<br>I'm going to keep a whole hip stuff but<br>I actually want to take a couple of<br>steps back because I want to show you<br>some of the ideas that we've been<br>working with over the last decade or so<br>that I always thought would translate<br>really well to to medium density housing<br>and developers have seen no value in<br>whatsoever yet we keep on getting the<br>average punter coming to us constantly<br>getting phone calls can you do my house<br>because I want these community oriented<br>sustainability ideas in and then they<br>see the cost of building and realize<br>they can't afford it and it's a tragedy<br>so it fits right is where my offices but<br>I'm originally from Tesla from<br>Launceston that photo has been a week<br>old that's how far far behind tessie's<br>and while I was growing up the the birth<br>of the first greens political party<br>happens while the fight for the Gordon<br>River was happening I was just a little<br>kid that in the background all of this<br>left-wing politics was happening that<br>was about our responsibility as<br>custodians to the earth and I think for<br>our generation where they're seeking and<br>probably for the generation of New<br>Zealanders to with the the the stance<br>taken on on nuclear weapons in the way<br>there was sort of this I guess embedded<br>activism that would happen from a very<br>early age for a lot of Tasmanians it<br>didn't happen in other places in<br>Australia when I studied I grabbed this<br>quote no love I've loved this forever<br>architecture is that discipline where is<br>impossible to escape values it's<br>radically evaluated it is possible that<br>you can become an architect and see it's<br>there's somewhat autonomous and not as a<br>political act which I which is<br>incredibly naive I try to make students<br>aware of the radical political cultural<br>social nature of our work and how it's<br>impossible to escape those<br>responsibilities by building walls<br>pulling apertures that are controlled<br>doors of Oxana we actually are creating<br>violent spaces the control people you<br>know we the authors of politically Laden<br>territory<br>who is paying us to do that and what is<br>their agenda so when I started my<br>practice I decided what I was going to<br>do was to do try to do half-built work<br>that was paid and then the other half<br>was polemical work these fictions based<br>in politics that I thought was important<br>because I was pre disenfranchised so<br>just lost some of these ideas were never<br>going to happen so I might as well spend<br>some time tree and paper architecture<br>and I did that for a decade before I<br>really changed my tune because what I<br>used to say was there's only so much<br>you're gonna do especially when I<br>started my practice of 27 you know I was<br>a young punter that didn't have much<br>push so I was always going to be a bit<br>of a slave to the social economic and<br>cultural issues around me but also the<br>client at the end of the day calls the<br>shots so I thought it's going to be<br>really good to do political work where I<br>take some problem in society and then<br>played with it in a really elastic way<br>I've completely changed my tune now and<br>that's what knowing else now it's<br>actually taking all of these things that<br>I was seen as constraints and saying<br>let's roll up our sleeves and reinvent<br>this stuff let's redesign that system<br>and it's turned out to be frightening we<br>stressfully hard we do anyway but I need<br>like this new Australian Parliament<br>where you you get the lefties on one<br>side and right wing matters on the other<br>and they're shoving the building denying<br>their politicians from sunlight and<br>naturally every time they show it or<br>they're building for a site where there<br>was just really wasted laying my space<br>and this was going you could just tip a<br>building over go get a permit for one<br>type of building and then tip it over<br>and I could really live livable and then<br>if council comes back to check out if it<br>still supply you just quickly stack it<br>back up good that wasn't what it wasn't<br>me or using<br>transport infrastructure to try and<br>flatten out the sort of the the<br>economics of a apartment building so if<br>you're at the top and you face north<br>it's probably worth more than the lower<br>apartments so using a container stacker<br>to constantly really relocate your home<br>so you know you might be ground-floor<br>facing south one day you come<br>from work and he's my house oh I<br>got the view in the Sun this is awesome<br>oh this one's not really political I<br>almost pulled this one off there was a<br>number of sites you probably got that<br>here as well where development often<br>takes so long and it goes to a tribunal<br>and you end up at least dead parts of<br>the see these empty building sites just<br>cordoned off this was the idea that we<br>work with Melbourne City Council to<br>actually roll out these playgrounds in<br>these building sites what empty sites<br>until a building got built yeah tiny<br>houses are coming up I don't know who<br>I'm gonna offend but I played a lot with<br>tiny houses and realize they're<br>completely unethical<br>we should be providing good quality<br>houses for people not requiring them to<br>change the way they live to fit no tiny<br>little dog box so the problems so you<br>know yeah building work a lot of them<br>being single residential we've played<br>with these ideas that they're<br>experimenting much bigger things<br>so not just building a single or not<br>just thinking about a client but think<br>about the ramifications of that building<br>house house is an example of that where<br>a son and father owned two terraces next<br>to each other and they decided to<br>develop a cross both of them and what we<br>decided to do was that if Melbourne<br>suffering from sprawl never everybody<br>spatially thinking very horizontally in<br>their houses what if we borrow a<br>typology from the different a different<br>location so say Tokyo where you stack<br>buildings you think vertically you don't<br>think horizontally and then maybe where<br>we have this abundance of space in<br>Australia we can actually have much more<br>outdoor space looks currently an open<br>outdoor space is really under siege as<br>people try to giggle your houses so this<br>is the idea that may will cut and paste<br>that typology and will throw it on its<br>on its head and then every you have a<br>different association to outdoor space<br>than you would have had traditionally in<br>Australia and so instead of doing<br>something big with this sacrificed<br>outdoor space you have much more outdoor<br>space but also you start to share these<br>spaces and this is something that's<br>happened a lot networking we really have<br>to<br>work with clients the other day I'm not<br>pushy like I'll just give client give<br>clients enough rope but only like this<br>these are two different dwellings but<br>the fence can actually slide away but<br>also the gate can slow way and this is a<br>do car park on this side and the idea<br>that you can actually open out to the<br>car park the master bedroom looks into<br>the car parking like why the hell are<br>you doing this and I'm saying because<br>this is like one of the last two sites<br>in this area where they haven't built<br>concrete walls to turn away from this<br>car park but we the way that transports<br>evolving and we'll probably all have<br>automated cars or cars penis up and<br>perish but we did this car park could<br>become a park in the future so you can<br>be part of that catalyst if you actually<br>engage the park but yeah you can see<br>where these spaces this is another big<br>thing I work he's being alone together<br>you know most people surprised<br>nationally introvert I should just hide<br>away and read play and every now and<br>then coming out and be loud and then run<br>away again and that's how we design our<br>buildings you can be together and have a<br>party and all that but then it's always<br>a place where you can go around the<br>corner and reven feel connected you can<br>still hear what's going on and there's<br>different gradations of that and what we<br>found is that's incredibly important in<br>multi risk buildings people hate like<br>they think it's a compromise because<br>there's a long corridor where it's<br>almost like you know the hotel I'm<br>staying in a long corridor there's your<br>front door you go straight it's<br>Australian through there there's no real<br>space to stop and talk to anybody it's<br>kind of awkward space if you choose to<br>engage with somebody you have to bring<br>them all the way through your space to<br>the living area usually in an apartment<br>it's past the veterans everybody has a<br>look in the bedrooms see how messy they<br>are I don't believe anybody who says<br>they don't have a look yours they look<br>and then you do this big social<br>commitment they're bringing it into the<br>space so things like this where we have<br>this gradation of space simple things<br>like the front veranda become really<br>important or a version of the front<br>prefer anda in apartments can you stop<br>near your front door talk to somebody<br>through that threshold we let up making<br>a big social commitment to drag them all<br>the way into your house<br>I love showing that because that's what<br>I get to confess because if you search<br>that up on the internet it's actually<br>tribute it it treated to me which makes<br>me feel very clever it's like the<br>cleverest thing I've never said but it<br>reusing materials I didn't mean to jump<br>through a lock we get an oval so reusing<br>materials so building a home where we<br>tried to use this many of the materials<br>on-site as possible to reconstruct it so<br>we reduce the embodied transport carbon<br>down to a minuscule amount that was fun<br>and really difficult a lot of our<br>clients living in sort of Fitzroy in the<br>northern suburbs having kids and their<br>houses are immediately too small for<br>them so they say we meant to do this<br>like every other idiot move out to the<br>suburbs and live in a bigger house and<br>they come to us so we've had a real<br>brief other than I love my community can<br>you figure out the creative way of<br>staying here<br>so Hill House was about creating a lot<br>more built area but having that built<br>area useable as an outdoor space we<br>talked about the Spanish Steps and we<br>actually created this role in Green Hill<br>that you actually inhabit but the kids<br>can run over as well and so a lot of<br>these ideas are now in forming the<br>rooftops of the nine girls that were<br>doing<br>and multi-generational houses has become<br>more and more important this super<br>interesting but unfortunately I think<br>this trend has started again because of<br>the economics of housing affordability<br>we can't afford to move out or our<br>parents can't afford to the house and<br>equality elderly housing that therefore<br>we need homes that can actually adapt to<br>allow for another generation to live<br>with us and so something like Charles<br>house is a single house that really is<br>three houses as well so it is actually<br>sort of a medium density development<br>where one where it's not allowed to<br>happen in queue there's no planning that<br>allows that to happen I don't know how<br>many you guys do it be sort of designed<br>these spaces where council will count<br>the number of kitchens and they never<br>say it's multi you know it's multiple<br>dwellings on a lot so we start designed<br>don't draw kitchens and then later on<br>camera put kitchens in you know the<br>places so bigger families can live<br>together but it's really interesting<br>trying to work out the circulation so<br>people can live to again together bill<br>so apart so they don't have to walk on<br>top of each other so nice to talk about<br>peeps talk about you know we always try<br>to get our spaces to have multiple<br>personalities<br>so really resistant to putting labels on<br>things so especially even things like<br>kids bedrooms<br>the walls are always able slow ways they<br>can share spaces we try to always have<br>corridor spaces that can be become part<br>of a bigger space so you can see it<br>there these walls from the bedrooms go<br>slide away in that corridor can be part<br>of a much bigger play space again that's<br>the kind of thinking that we're now<br>putting into our multi-race buildings so<br>that the foyer space is a much more than<br>floor space is there there there are<br>small unit of the community spaces so<br>where we do a green roof for the whole<br>community on each level they'll actually<br>be a smaller shared space that's just<br>the people on that level before they go<br>into their apartments but all of this<br>was learned through this single<br>residential work and all of it just<br>falling on deaf ears whenever we talk to<br>a developer because they didn't see how<br>they could sell that two bedrooms two<br>bathrooms in the carpark that's what<br>sells<br>that's what did sell until recently our<br>tower house was all about creating a<br>thoroughfare through a private residence<br>so neighbors could actually walk through<br>somebody's backyard to get from one<br>street to the other you know things like<br>veggie gardens in the front yard do a<br>veggie garden in the front yards cuz<br>anybody to a veggie garden it's always<br>one goddamn crop that just goes crazy<br>and you're eating you know broad beans<br>for months and months and months you're<br>doing the front garden and then people<br>just take what they or the lemon tree it<br>just goes mental and you're constantly<br>going to work with bowls of women saying<br>please take my lemons I'm just putting<br>the front yard and then the community<br>can sharing that well we would draw any<br>design the kids teach hanging in the<br>other well we're having a meeting said<br>go over there and draw thought your<br>house see what he has to be yeah go away<br>stop disturbing us while we sketch<br>there's some stuff with the owners and<br>then they came back and we were confused<br>with the owners what the hell we doing<br>in the kids can go back and go to this<br>and we just said yeah right just build<br>but yeah so this this is actually this<br>is AK at times because their house has<br>streets on either side on the weekends<br>quite often to leave the gates open to<br>let people wander through the neighbors<br>the neighbors the ones that feel<br>comfortable doing that<br>anybody else it'd be kind of like a lot<br>of our work is the steam release of<br>things - oh this was also the first<br>house already put a net in a house now<br>every house needs to have a net net none<br>gal three we're probably going to put<br>where we've got a light well we're<br>probably going to put a net I mentioned<br>it once to the community it purchases<br>money gal three they're like we're doing<br>that so a seven-story high net over a<br>light well anyway tell us yeah so this<br>is the other end the other end of the<br>street we can wander through and get<br>another house designed so that the<br>family can grow without anybody being on<br>top of each other these really carefully<br>considered designs we've been collecting<br>they can be a part so it's really<br>constantly breaking down that binary of<br>what is mine and what is not mine<br>so he's mine was house and they're<br>different gray areas around that<br>decision-making<br>King bills yeah so this is another one<br>so we finished this last year and got a<br>couple of good awards for it this is<br>where you know we work these clients<br>have care about where they live they<br>this little empty site here and we were<br>saying that in Fitzroy there's you know<br>doesn't thing there's these little<br>pocket parks which of these great relief<br>you've got this site where we could<br>actually for a lot of people that<br>maximize the year for it build as much<br>as you can make profit we were saying<br>you actually go and add some greenery to<br>this street youth actually do something<br>that's really enabling into the<br>community by actually having a park but<br>actually a garden that greens up this<br>area so why don't we create something in<br>between a home and a garden that gives<br>back to the street so all these examples<br>of what happens in the area we worked<br>with them to<br>make a stable in the back again<br>multi-generational house this can change<br>over time and become very big once the<br>kids yeah if the grandparents come in or<br>maybe there's an old life and the kids<br>start breeding anybody that lives in<br>Fitzroy your kids are never gonna buy<br>there so if you want them to stick<br>around not move out to the burbs you've<br>got to somehow create housing within the<br>lot your own we like our kids I'm trying<br>to create little honeypot where you<br>leave I want it to be right so a lot of<br>so what's interesting is most people try<br>to develop the hell out of this spot<br>some of the most expensive real estate<br>Melbourne and how our clients that love<br>the community they're in to try and<br>create greenery truncates garden out in<br>the street what's crazy is council said<br>you're under developing the site we need<br>you to do that<br>this is north this way so condemning the<br>backyard to a holiday shadow that was<br>saying we need to continue the<br>consistency of this become real heritage<br>argument and they just wouldn't listen<br>so what we end up doing if you go there<br>now is actually the original offense<br>they're basically City Council so if we<br>leave the fence there we can get away<br>with what we want carrion yeah all right<br>well you're a bunch of idiots we'll wait<br>defense but yet again a lot of these<br>little moments that are translating into<br>the multi-race work we're doing the<br>other Nightingale work we do now that no<br>developer had any interesting when we<br>talk to them about any shared spaces<br>this Langley look how public this is but<br>they the the idea is that you can as<br>long as you allow people to control<br>their level of privacy so we all are up<br>line so you can basically bring up to<br>whatever height you want you can still<br>see out you don't have to pull something<br>all the way down to to get complete<br>privacy as long as somebody has control<br>over their privacy<br>they will do it we're fining leave more<br>publicly which you see you know Europe<br>all the time which gives you great<br>passive surveillance over the street and<br>Oh Nance everywhere<br>I do enjoy them but we'll do a sketch<br>designed somebody so let's go to unit um<br>sorry I was in a rush but oh well this<br>is a really good example where their<br>bedroom is right on the street so this<br>is a street where there's just garage<br>doors all the way along here and we talk<br>to the clients about they can be the<br>catalyst to actually create to give this<br>whole street a new life actually make it<br>a new frontage rather than the crappy<br>service beam area but just require some<br>bravery so again giving them great<br>control over how those two lines of code<br>three they control over how public or<br>private they want to be may or water<br>they're constantly inviting people in<br>with this TV and getting the neighbors<br>pissed batches Australia this is now<br>holiday home you guys know how to do<br>checks and batches so well doesn't<br>matter how many and New Zealand<br>bachelors that show your clients they<br>just don't get the fact that if you you<br>can have a fancy house where you live<br>but you have no opportunity to be a<br>different version of yourself if you<br>don't go to a small place that's you<br>know barely waterproof that's connected<br>to the earth you get to be a different<br>version of yourself so many people are<br>just asking for the simulacrum of their<br>their house you know like this many<br>bathrooms and bedrooms all you've done<br>is change the view so we have contact I<br>lose a lot of Shack and holiday home<br>jobs because I just sort of say oh<br>alright<br>it's big enough so doorman was one of<br>those where we were told to knock this<br>down I was like let's not do that what<br>you need make just want the view so we<br>just worked to given with you great fun<br>I still most of my ideas from Finland<br>Japan and New Zealand just want you to<br>and this is when we finished this year<br>that so that's less than ten meters in<br>timer that house and we it's it's<br>getting good coverage and I'm really<br>proud of this one that's why these I you<br>know great client in one of these ones<br>we just execute the original idea of<br>don't around don't try and add<br>anything new just what was the original<br>idea stay focused and then having a<br>client that just buys into it and then<br>stands back is what you need because<br>often the other ones attacking extra<br>bits on so this one turned out really<br>well<br>again you guys do gas holiday homes and<br>batches so it's probably mediocre by<br>your standard it sound pretty parallel<br>oh okay<br>so last one before I come full circle<br>back to know you know because this is my<br>house this one we call this the mental<br>health house a lot of the ideas in this<br>I've tried we've tried to translate into<br>our multi residential because<br>Australians really see multi raise as a<br>compromise and that's simply because<br>they only seen apartments housing<br>should be good for you you know it<br>should be good for your mental health<br>and a big part of that is how community<br>works housing this one was quite blunt I<br>just lived in this tiny little<br>dilapidated house with no natural light<br>and I decided that I have the opposite<br>problem when I renovated my house put<br>polycarbonate roof in have too much<br>sunlight so that the probably have to<br>wear sunglasses inside<br>I would be saturated with vitamin D and<br>vitamin D is be sure to be really good<br>for you around mental health and the<br>steps I don't know the step smart you<br>see you guys are much more chilled I<br>think the Australians just because they<br>have to put up with in<br>Australia because it's full Australians<br>forty five percent of people end up with<br>a mental health issue<br>ah is it the same here everybody going<br>through architecture school is coming<br>out with a mental health issue 25<br>percent there<br>people look at this UK study one third<br>of all women studying architecture<br>develop a mental health issue while<br>they're studying<br>that's a crime we're gonna<br>reinvent the way we teach why does it<br>have to be so hostile and and I went far<br>too hard at you so and then I wrote this<br>essay if anybody's ready in 2012 which<br>is all about trying to get a work-life<br>balance you mean the day was all about<br>exploitation in architecture<br>architecture profession share a read if<br>you're young but yeah this house was all<br>about just creating some way where I<br>just wanted to be joyful and turned up<br>so like I wear them just so joyful<br>though I got just secretive Willy Wonka<br>scary but also was an experiment in in<br>working at home because thirty percent<br>of Australians are now working at home<br>regularly and for a lot of people that's<br>a niggly finger because they're working<br>too much and I think it could actually<br>be a really positive thing so the way<br>this is designed as you've got the shop<br>front which is just the next space down<br>here and then you've got our living<br>space now living spaces for the average<br>person that works our empty nine-to-five<br>so you've got this infrastructure their<br>dining table couches kitchen that's not<br>being used so what we did was say well<br>okay my son goes to school and we go off<br>to work and then the office can use that<br>space and then conversely if we throw a<br>party or something like that outside<br>office hours we do that in the office we<br>just line up all the tables and have a<br>party in it's about really optimizing<br>those spaces we don't AMA it's not there<br>anymore we just our crew unfortunately<br>got too big but it's a really fun<br>experiment in terms of over you know<br>people working at home because it became<br>a really big thing in our first<br>Nightingale that Austin my own design<br>which was known go through I think<br>that's it okay nine go so so a bunch of<br>us got together all the book journey of<br>breathe just going somebody's gonna do<br>something about this government should<br>be doing something about this I<br>a lecture in Delft in the Netherlands in<br>December and they were like why why are<br>you doing this<br>why isn't government Jeremy gave a<br>lecture in London year or so ago same<br>thing why are you doing this<br>so because nobody else is doing it so a<br>bunch of us got together we've got all<br>these problems that are talked about<br>earlier and Melbourne at one stage one<br>hundred and something years ago it was<br>actually doing it if you go through<br>Degraves lane you actually sees<br>incredible examples of european-style<br>housing we actually did it for a short<br>time and everybody then just retreated<br>and moved out to the to the burbs but<br>what we realized i are most real<br>architects or trains be architects yeah<br>and we feel will develop isn't a really<br> offended because I'm sorry so<br>we're all you know I could Arctic's are<br>pretty introspective we talk to each<br>other a lot so to the bubble like why<br>doesn't everybody else think like us and<br>we what we spent you know a decade or<br>more going why don't people understand<br>the medium density can be super high<br>quality actually far superior to<br>individual homes and it became a simple<br>case of build it and they will come by<br>quite simply the layperson wants to go I<br>get it I'm looking at it and I'm<br>touching it good and that's what<br>happened with the comments so when<br>breathe finished and breathe finish the<br>commons all these laypeople just go on<br>oh so straight from out of nothing<br>something's entire community it was like<br>give me one really more and there was no<br>plan to build anymore after the Commons<br>you know you want it every award there<br>meaning more than that the brief got and<br>today yeah almost immediately we had a<br>thousand people on waitlist saying can<br>you please build more of these<br>apartments we now have over 8,000 people<br>are waitlist we've built 20 apartments<br>so far we've got about 300 under<br>development but this was a case of you<br>have to build an exemplar version of it<br>to let the layperson go and see it<br>and touch it but what's most important<br>is the rest of the development community<br>you were saying well that's cute that's<br>nice<br>that's a fringe product then nobody else<br>wants<br>that's cute we can't make that stack up<br>financially what we realized is we had<br>to start chewing this stuff out you have<br>to start producing them because we have<br>the purchases we have the purchase to do<br>it but you have to make it a new norm we<br>have to actually have systems change you<br>have to break the current housing system<br>by producing the quantity and basically<br>just being in it sales<br>stealing all of their customers because<br>you're showing them that there's a<br>better way of doing things<br>no car parking depends where you are so<br>we're all about good transport solutions<br>a lot of the sites that we buy is<br>difficult or it's wrong to actually add<br>traffic tons of bike parking bring<br>travel plans so making sure we really<br>embed the owners corporation actually<br>has a fund that gets renewed that<br>actually has my key card to public<br>transport cards is this really<br>sophisticated green travel plan to<br>enable people to be able to get around<br>town this also go against cars do you<br>guys have that here car sharing and then<br>a really great ally of ours getting this<br>individual stuff out of apartments so<br>you've got more space so instead of<br>building big apartments as one of<br>everything build an economic apartment<br>and then getting things like laundries<br>out of it just that one half square<br>meters put it on the rooftop like<br>whenever you see I always financially<br>you see developers Brenda which there's<br>community across it and you've got these<br>wankers we've we've lattes you know<br>going this is candy we drink coffee<br>together community is a Saturday morning<br>on the rooftop where everybody's<br>watching their jocks together you really<br>get to know people do and that stuff<br>hasn't been hidden away it's the<br>everyday stuff that builds community not<br>the special events natural ventilation<br>no air conditioning that's melting we<br>can get over you guys probably be<br>further north here so you probably are<br>but no air conditioning this is<br>something we're battling with at the<br>moment with climate change happening and<br>we won't be really accessible housing<br>elderly people increasingly need for<br>health reasons air-conditioning so<br>that's something we're looking at alone<br>knowing our three will have energy<br>recovery units through the entire<br>building incredibly efficient and the<br>next lot of buildings that are doing all<br>that so the village which I'll get to<br>they all have energy recovering unit<br>Sina but no traditional air conditioning<br>and just building what you need and<br>nothing else so getting rid of you know<br>ceilings and just exposing all services<br>getting much more high through there and<br>just getting rid of chemicals where we<br>can so you know just using raw brass tap<br>things and things like that chroming is<br>crazy toxic just really simple moves<br>that over 20 or 30-year permanence makes<br>a huge environmental impact and always<br>focusing the endgame on the purchasers<br>who we get together as soon as we can so<br>basically if we go and secure a site we<br>then announce it and say who wants to be<br>in this community and get people to put<br>down some money and commit and then they<br>inform us how they want their community<br>to work so unlike the current or the<br>previous model which was users of the<br>building weren't even part of discussion<br>it was all about what telling the real<br>estate agent telling a developer what<br>will sell to an overseas investor the<br>green roofs especially it depends on the<br>area like they're a big investment for<br>us but in some way like once week which<br>is you know post-industrial to have the<br>have a green confined community space is<br>fundamental if we were somewhere else we<br>might actually lose that price point and<br>make sure we activate the streets or the<br>ground and what's really interesting<br>about the first few buildings is the<br>people who work on the buildings end up<br>buying abilities so no galones got a<br>bunch of architects that worked on it<br>even has the electrician the work type<br>which has become a bit of a problem<br>because people some people being on the<br>wait list for a nogal apartment for<br>almost four years and they're like no<br>you keep on giving it away to people who<br>worked on building it's like well they<br>did work on the building<br>but it's become there's politics around<br>pecking order and who gets in because I<br>have a slide about that I'll jump into<br>that so we've got a balloting system so<br>let me announce the project and he say<br>that general products that are in it<br>people get to ballot for an apartment so<br>for nightingale 3 when we had 16 hundred<br>people in the waitlist 250 real<br>purchases of people that were ready to<br>go applied for 20 apartments in there we<br>have a but before we ballot to the<br>general population we have priority<br>balloting so if you're an indigenous<br>Australian or a key service service<br>worker like a nurse or or we're actually<br>broadening that if you're a key<br>community contributor we calling it so a<br>schoolteacher or nurse or an artist<br>they're all being pushed further than<br>the further and suburbs you get one of<br>the first five apartments and then after<br>that it's to everybody else and that's<br>the way that we basically sell our<br>apartments that's driving traditional<br>developers nuts<br>can you just give us some of the extras<br>so getting rid of this model and just<br>triple bottom-line development financial<br>sustainability ecological sustainability<br>social sustainability and as I said<br>before making itself in your replicated<br>so it's not open source because they<br>actually takes time to push all this<br>information out if somebody asks we'll<br>tell them<br>yeah where's transparent as we can be<br>within the time that we have and we know<br>how much time but if somebody wants know<br>how to do it we try to help them but<br>this is what this is this is the thing<br>this is the big idea it's not a design<br>idea we read as well it's not an<br>architectural design we're redesigning<br>the system we're redesigning the<br>economics of how you put housing<br>together<br>so we've nightingale one what happened<br>was we had twenty mum and dad investors<br>bunch of those were architects I was one<br>of them Jeremy and breathed with the<br>Arctic's so a bunch of us chipped in<br>some money and said he go go build a<br>building so we're helping our lives but<br>we actually actively funded this another<br>architect our competitor to build a<br>building they fund an architect to work<br>with the community to build<br>their house and we don't end up<br>designing 20 separate apartments we work<br>out what the best most rational<br>solutions are we don't want 20 different<br>clients that would be a friggin<br>nightmare as you know we want them to<br>bond as community and have their own<br>arguments so things like bathtubs it's<br>like you guys figure it out and if you<br>can't build a consensus and we'll just<br>have to think of some other options for<br>those people it's really fun it's really<br>healthy you also get to find out early<br>on who the nutters huh and sometimes<br>they may have to touch the community you<br>know find somebody else and so this is<br>what we do so we pay the consultants a<br>good fee the architects get paid a good<br>fee no be screwing anybody over fees we<br>don't have a marketing team we're going<br>have a display suite because we've built<br>some before and people like the<br>architects works no real estate agent<br>charging almost as much as an architect<br>just to sell a product that's all result<br>itself construction building you know<br>with with building minimum 7.5 now<br>there's writing you know complete<br>thermal brakes incredible glazing green<br>roofs we're spending a lot of money on<br>this building but we're still delivering<br>them under the market so in this area<br>the app so in Brunswick we were building<br>the first view the average apartment<br>sales rate is 9,200 square meter<br>we're selling ours well onto that the<br>average of arming Brunswick is but it's<br>so ship so ones of a similar quality are<br>up around eleven and a half twelve<br>thousand all screaming that's like a<br>hundred thousand dollars more per<br>apartment through you know an average<br>two there because what we're doing is<br>we're working like architects what do<br>you want we draw it we get a price<br>that's what it cost we could have fee on<br>top of it we're not doing what<br>developers do which is what do you want<br>we think the market will bear that now<br>let's just build it for as cheaply as<br>possible maximizing our profits so we<br>built a great building but we we sell it<br>for what it costs to build that's it and<br>then any value is returned to the<br>purchaser it's pretty simple you want a<br>house well you wanna that's what<br>architects do we just don't exploit the<br>situation<br>to maximize profits it's make sense and<br>then just a really annoying developers<br>what we did with nightingale one was<br>there was a hundred nine thousand<br>dollars contingency left over okay that<br>strikes the community there you go your<br>your apartments cost a little bit less<br>that's what was left over after<br>contractors finished I love this these<br>are actually Jeremy's woods we didn't<br>keep it we didn't buy a yacht or a Range<br>Rover we gave it back and I think this<br>was probably the one move where a bunch<br>of the smartest developers in Melbourne<br>changed almost overnight they realized<br>that the markets shifting or ready to<br>our occupier market and they need to<br>deliver something he's better and they<br>need to tune their profit margins down<br>and that's the thing is the capital so<br>mum and dad investors are all getting<br>returned 15% parameter so thinking<br>returns roughly 45 percent on their for<br>a three-year project forty five percent<br>yeah so people are still making money<br>it's not a charity but in terms of what<br>we're doing that's the cost of capital<br>if you go from a bank we go from<br>everybody else you have to pay that<br>interest so and you can call it property<br>financial transparency so you know<br>anybody could have asked at the end of<br>the day you know what happens the<br>contingency and if we didn't give it<br>back anyway like it's it's fun you are<br>not a Nightingale develop development<br>unless you have complete financial<br>transparency to the stakeholders their<br>revolt fundamentally so we're providing<br>cheap housing neither so the sticker<br>price is really important but it's<br>ongoing affordability is fundamental to<br>good quality financially sustainable<br>housing so building an incredibly<br>thermally efficient building just means<br>that you're going to have much lower<br>rain costs we also have an embodied<br>energy network with buying green energy<br>in bulk across all buildings at far<br>cheaper rates than you would buy brown<br>coal energy we're doing same things as<br>well<br>craziest internet because we're just<br>buying we're just putting in embedded<br>networks for internet so I'm going you<br>know low running costs at fundamental in<br>terms of an affordable yoga it's not<br>just the sticker price and carbon<br>neutral so there's no gas in these<br>buildings so if anybody loves cooking<br>with gas<br>none gals not for you we're working with<br>the incredible amazing New Zealand<br>company Fisher &amp; Paykel take care and<br>they have got like a nine-hour package<br>including induction cooktops and all<br>that which proves you know which is a<br>great ally for us so this is what we're<br>about we're building homes not<br>commodities and therefore owner occupies<br>only so if an investor rocks up we say<br>sorry in which one house people yeah<br>we're just trying to deal with some meat<br>a human right access to housing is a<br>human right and we're trying to foster<br>community through doing that now and get<br>one finished a year a bit ago it's it's<br>great lucky<br>on Thurs it's it's really popular so<br>what's happened is we've had to we run<br>tours on a Thursday and I think it's<br>like 20 bucks a tour and all of that<br>money no most of that money goes to the<br>owners corporation so the people who<br>live in the building that have got<br>strangers walking through the house have<br>got their owners corporation you know so<br>subsidized by it but it becomes an<br>education piece to know about how you<br>can build good ethical housing building<br>just what you need and nothing more<br>so keeping it really simple and then<br>people can come and plant themselves on<br>it and that's something we found the<br>purchasers really want you know I don't<br>actually want<br>I really respect us and my architects as<br>an architect but I want you to stand<br>down and just give me a really rational<br>functional space and I'll go and paint<br>the walls and giving to it that way<br>you're not hiring us decorators they're<br>hiring us as people to facilitate their<br>Oh No so and the other cool thing is<br>that the we're it's a this is a Commons<br>on one side now you got ones on the<br>other side of the street and every now<br>and then they just close down the street<br>just take over street and sit in there<br>and have a get-together on the weekend<br>it's a dead-end street so it's pretty<br>easy but I just tell cast a off<br>Nightingale to buy six degrees and then<br>knowing our three by Austin main<br>architects the cool thing about this is<br>now landowners are coming to us so<br>people like Tony if either worked really<br>hard to get their land or they've<br>inherited it there's a lot of Greek and<br>Italian families in these areas in<br>northern suburbs we working mainly<br>because the lands traditionally being<br>cheaper it's really hard to get<br>elsewhere I know but they care about the<br>legacy that their parents have handed on<br>to them and they've seen other people<br>selling to developers in the most<br>horrible crap this happens to their<br>suburb so some of you like Tony is<br>actually working without seen on go<br>through we haven't bought the land from<br>him we've licensed ative from him to<br>develop his land for him and he will end<br>up with an apartment and a shop because<br>he runs the shop --kinky --kinky and he<br>will pay exactly the same price as<br>everybody else completely financially<br>transparent the village this is where<br>seven architects breathe a ball Kennedy<br>Nolan Claire cousins Austyn man<br>Architects architecture and architecture<br>of building a completely carbon neutral<br>precinct now so we bought eighteen<br>million dollars worth of land all next<br>to each other in Brunswick or just the<br>sheer shed you ever seen and this is<br>what this is where we're trying to<br>really normalize it now so we're taking<br>a huge personal risk to not be just oh<br>that's cute that's different we want to<br>try and make this the typical way you<br>build homes in Melbourne so that's<br>Duquette Street the rail line through<br>here our site clears you can see all<br>different sites that we've purchased<br>what's interesting is that what I was<br>right there<br>counts more than City Council came on<br>the board their site office and bought<br>the two sheds next door and they're<br>putting in Park now simply because of<br>the development that we're putting<br>through through is<br>the north-facing Park to the community<br>because if one of the mandates is that<br>it's a post-industrial sort of area is<br>to try and get more green space in there<br>and so nine galas catalyst is is all<br>that's happened and there's also a car<br>park here that we are wellbeing will get<br>paternal park as well<br>twenty percent affordable housing so you<br>talk about running the numbers and<br>trying to make this stuff stack up we're<br>selling we're working with housing<br>choices to put twenty percent affordable<br>thousand through there no Victoria state<br>government is that I know of is it ever<br>putting limits that high in terms of<br>housing affordability we're a private<br>enterprise that's doing it now they've<br>announced a couple of projects like the<br>gasworks in Victoria they're now doing<br>twenty percent affordable housing zero<br>cars but we do have a pod of twenty<br>electric go gets cars all different<br>types ago gets depending on your needs<br>that are in a basement underneath the<br>briefed building which is this one and<br>four hundred and forty bicycles across<br>the precinct that's our building the<br>Austin Manor one which is over the road<br>and that's been that's why we've been<br>dying to give you back sorry now there<br>will be multiple questions what's<br>affordable that's that's a great<br>question I'm trying to use the word less<br>because it's it's like what as<br>affordable meters of the original<br>sticker price I don't have a different<br>definition for you<br>unfortunately so it might may sound like<br>a cop out but we're delivering housing<br>below the market that's of much higher<br>quality<br>and importantly that ongoing running<br>costs far cheaper then but we don't have<br>a difference re in terms of 20%<br>affordable housing that least defines my<br>housing choices so that housing so we<br>haven't defined it so a group of housing<br>choices which will buy all of this stock<br>we've worked really hard from them since<br>knowing l1 to set this up they have to<br>find it is eight thousand two hundred<br>and thirty dollars a square meter which<br>is almost a thousand dollars a square<br>meter under the average in the area and<br>they will buy those at that rate from us<br>every other purchaser is paying a little<br>bit more for their apartment to<br>subsidize that and we make it absolutely<br>clear you guys are helping to add 20<br>percent affordable housing and and then<br>housing choices who works with state<br>government will then subsidized rates<br>for those particular assets that they<br>own<br>it's sadly it's from a big four banks<br>because especially for the village here<br>the only ones are gonna wind on that so<br>we've done a lot of work with if you're<br>learning bodies of then you go bank or<br>people it's just a scale they're being<br>ready for yet so we do a lot of banking<br>through NAB but we always have an<br>ethical lender there will be possible so<br>SVA or or Seifer to add mezzanine<br>finance so we'll give my big four banks<br>to carry most of the load sixty percent<br>equity and then we'll give an ethical<br>anybody to top that up so we get as much<br>as if to equity subs please we can so we<br>always know an ethical planning and I<br>hope is that then they'll be in a<br>position in one of the future ones yes<br>sorry that's a really good question too<br>we have been working since day one on<br>trying to bring in the Bell Griffin<br>model here in Australia everybody know<br>what Bell Griffin is it's German for<br>building group so and for decades<br>they've been doing it in in Germany so<br>basically instead of people putting in<br>deposit to secure their home which in<br>Australia it's protected so you can't<br>use that as funding for the project yeah<br>that makes sense<br>because you know it puts the money very<br>real risk<br>so now Griffin means that people can put<br>their money in to not only secure a<br>property but also to fund that so that<br>immediately drops the price of their<br>housing by the 50% that we are paying<br>out to other investors because they just<br>want low housing prices they don't want<br>thing percent the architecture<br>architecture one which I didn't move the<br>ones down the bottom on that village<br>that is loosely about group model<br>because that was a housing through if<br>there was a bunch of people that<br>had formed ten years ago to try and do<br>something and it working with us it's<br>loosely evelopment<br>but they are funding most of their<br>building by themselves she's really<br>exciting we've even got now an agreement<br>with the ATO to the people in a picture<br>you see on the housing like if you're<br>actually creating your own housing you<br>don't pay GST on it so that immediately<br>bet that reduces housing over ten<br>percent but we were working our asses<br>all the guys sorry employees at my house<br>me looking at asses off to try and get<br>that going from across the village<br>immediately getting it down ten percent<br>then the stumbling block block was back<br>to your first question the big banks big<br>banks are too scared of them will<br>eventually get me right they'll grow<br>ponies the wider really people are their<br>housing choices because they have<br>developers thing but with your amazing<br>government probably just do it super<br>easily or will consider you people we<br>great question so the leading question<br>but yeah because yes that's one thing I<br>didn't mention is we've got it was a<br>covenant on sale it's now a caddy it to<br>the sale so we run the risk as<br>developers of selling something at a<br>market somebody buys it two weeks later<br>they sell it and they make a hundred<br>grand by that so we were trying to put a<br>caveat on the original sales of<br>Nightingale one so linked to the title<br>of your apartment you can only sell your<br>apartment for what you paid for it<br>plus any rises in housing prices in the<br>area so not how not rises in apartment<br>prices because apartment prices<br>fluctuate because they're a commodity so<br>you're good you get a good uplift you<br>know if you don't get the freebie the<br>free kick then we go get the star if you<br>settle you get the uplift of the race<br>and housing prices and you have a three<br>month two months period you have to<br>offer it back to the nightingale<br>waitlist if you're nobody on the<br>waitlist buys it then you can sell it to<br>somebody else nobody else wants it if<br>you want it basically people on the<br>waitlist will jump on it straight away<br>but that's changed to a a caveat on the<br>on the sale now the reason we've done<br>that is if it's it's bait if it's locked<br>on title it just can't be lifted off and<br>we don't really know what's going to<br>happen with this we may actually be<br>shooting ourselves or shooting those<br>purchases in the foot so now that we're<br>making a condition of contractor sale<br>that means that something come back to<br>us with a real legitimate reason of why<br>that needs to be lifted and knowing our<br>housing can individually lift that from<br>each apartment but that yeah but thanks<br>for your question that's how we're<br>locking in those original savings<br>because the Commons so the test pilot<br>doesn't have that protection so that's<br>now being sold at almost $11,000 a<br>square meter crazy prices while over the<br>road and I get one they're all locked in<br>it's the original four ability<br>nightingale housing so which is the big<br>social enterprise that will the original<br>architects have put together and<br>Jeremy's the CEO of they they are<br>monitoring all that intact it's between<br>years that's 20 years it's just free for<br>all but hopefully by then we have<br>created systems change or helped enable<br>that not that I know of this super<br>secret organization then there are other<br>developers and funders that are changing<br>the way they do business so there's now<br>another group called the assemble model<br>so we have an oligo model and they've<br>just simply gone all great let's do that<br>and make all the same noises it appears<br>they're just a for-profit company we've<br>knowing our one next door there's a site<br>there that the developer wants cars on<br>their site they they keep the landowner<br>a serious sum of money to take us to<br>Viet so tribunal to slow down the<br>process so there was originally when<br>people didn't when the when the industry<br>didn't understand they're trying to help<br>everybody help themselves is look they<br>really tried to uni campus I think once<br>they realize it's right we're actually<br>increasing the value of their land they<br>you know chilled out it but I haven't<br>heard of any greater conspiracy okay<br>it's not because we're pretty vulnerable<br>we just a bunch of hunter architects<br>they're putting it all on the line to<br>try and create something we are cleaning<br>to two key industry just starting to<br>the Commons is a different piece like<br>like Jeremy and a few few other<br>architects was too risky for me where<br>they they were funding it and trying to<br>do it themselves and then the global<br>financial crisis hit and the banks<br>refused to lend so anything especially<br>to a bunch of hippie architects so he<br>had to go and sell that to be most<br>ethical developer he could find and they<br>engaged a real serration to go on Sylvie<br>pants but Jeremy still use these<br>absolutely it's sleepless nights but we<br>have all learners but I'm appealing to<br>decayed banking developers these<br>dangerous do you need to tell me so<br>dangerous and so we have we've got an<br>education in risk doing this and it is<br>really hard to make SEC out so even<br>though we're pulling out all these<br>things and trying to deliver on the<br>market the whole and I don't know what<br>building industries like here it's a<br>long list and they look like they still<br>really flat out and try these charging<br>whatever they want so we getting all<br>these inflated prices so he's a juggling<br>act<br>yeah so developers do you know I<br>understand why they make their money<br>yep<br>and so that's become an issue from app<br>they want because they don't see profit<br>they see more contingency so we have two<br>types of continued to you so we have a<br>contingency for a project to make sure<br>it's safe and then we say to the banks<br>how much more contingency do you want<br>and and we just add that continuous<br>scene and we tell the purchases you're<br>saying sales contract for X which is a<br>below market that we have all these<br>contingency and we have the bank's<br>contingency we've that one's pretty safe<br>all doing well<br>and this one we worry to as much as<br>possible<br>yeah they're all the same body corporate<br>rule rules for swimming each one and<br>they're green travel plans embedded<br>within that and we have one body coral<br>make sure that we we sort of have across<br>each ninety go but at the end of the day<br>you know we form these communities that<br>purchases its they call the end of the<br>day you know if they wanted to they<br>could set up different body corporate<br>instruction all that all we've got in<br>the end of the day is the threat to pull<br>the brand know and uh now with you don't<br>yeah I've talked to people talk to lots<br>of different people from all over the<br>place<br>talk to a few architects in Auckland oh<br>please<br>at the end of the day you're asking an<br>architect probably zero as I was with<br>zero experience in development to become<br>a developer let's take on significant<br>risk to go and buy a bit of CBD Auckland<br>they carry that risking financier and at<br>the end of the day even though everybody<br>loves loves the energy of it and what<br>we're doing and where we get into it's<br>the the amount of work and risk that's<br>required that means that there's a lot<br>of people we've talked to they're just<br>going I see you guys around here<br>doing it for us I feel confident but I'm<br>not I guess the thing is it's right and<br>reef there Auckland we just need to type<br>of person that's willing to willing to<br>I look to big teeth<br>we've been surprised the amount of<br>support we've gotten from industry I<br>don't know where that's an elven thing<br>like we expected to you know there's<br>some especially the gangster developers<br>like but we expected to them to really<br>come at us<br>but the economy's changing its changing<br>fast especially in Australia and I think<br>they're seeing as a template where they<br>can do risk especially legislation has<br>changed so there's very strict limits<br>now on sales to overseas investors so<br>that's changed the previous model anyway<br>so we were expecting a lot more<br>hostility actually kind of delighted<br>especially the new generation of<br>developers they want to do more than<br>just make money they actually want to<br>yeah we just think we'll do it ourselves<br>so with we there are so many discussions<br>having in the background you know and<br>they're these massive superannuation<br>companies some of them have got and<br>asleep which is actually the union's<br>super fund and they actually got a lot<br>stricter regulations throughout what<br>they can invest in so there's been a lot<br>of talk about building and adding our<br>fund so basically a war chest where we<br>can go out and it's available for us and<br>then we can go and talk to community<br>about what they need in certain places<br>and just mobilize that capital that<br>yeah and some of the superannuation<br>companies very keen eye so again more<br>stuff in the background is not a rental<br>model and now we go rent to buy model<br>all that stuff's being worked on you<br>know it's like it's hard to build a<br>building this is like just tenfold and<br>it's amazing how ruthless you get with<br>your own designs when you see these<br>spreadsheets coming through so that's<br>how something worked on Mount Airy thank<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type:
