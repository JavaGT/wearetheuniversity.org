prospects<br>and better health outcomes your<br>university experience and the<br>qualifications gained at university will<br>thus add real value to your lives and<br>the lives of those around you in fact<br>our University can add value at the fact<br>that our university can add value in<br>these ways reflects the abilities and<br>achievements of our staff and students<br>professor Simon hauled away was elected<br>as a corresponding fellow to the<br>Australian Academy of the humanities for<br>his international leadership in<br>Australia Egyptian and New Zealand<br>archaeology and in stone

scholarship spans<br>ethics political and social philosophy<br>and several applied ethics fields in<br>order to ensure that we can continue to<br>achieve successes like these and to<br>enhance our contribution to future<br>generations of graduates and to our<br>nation the university must do three<br>things first we need to attract students<br>of high academic potential and give them<br>an outstanding academic and<br>extracurricular experience in this<br>respect we are doing very well the<br>proportion of students entering the<br>university with a high grade point<br>average is growing every year and we<br>produce outstanding graduates just like<br>you second we need to attract develop<br>and retain outstanding staff this we are<br>doing is illustrated by the achievements<br>I described earlier many of our staff<br>are world leaders in their fields and<br>you will have been privileged to learn<br>from and work with them it is no<br>coincidence that in the Q s World<br>Rankings of university subjects the<br>University of Auckland came top in New<br>Zealand and 37 of the 41 subjects ranked<br>and in the New Times Higher Education<br>impact ranking which measures each<br>universities performance against the<br>United Nations sustainability goals we<br>were ranked first in the world both<br>overall and for health and well-being<br>and third we need to create the kind of<br>academic environment and facilities that<br>support and encourage excellence to this<br>end the university has been investing<br>heavily in its campus renewal program so<br>as to ensure that we do provide<br>facilities of genuinely international<br>quality many of you will graduate today<br>were the first qualification and you<br>will be rightly proud of that<br>achievement however I also want you to<br>reflect on the ongoing learning<br>opportunities and the wide range of<br>postgraduate options available to you at<br>this University you must never rest on<br>your laurels in a challenging and<br>ever-changing world but rather be<br>prepared to embrace change and new<br>technology and make the most of the<br>opportunities presented to you although<br>it may seem a daunting prospect right<br>now through the study and learning is<br>inevitable for all of us as the world<br>changes around us at an<br>ever-accelerating pace whatever path you<br>followed I urge you as alumni of New<br>Zealand's leading University to never<br>forget your alma mater your university<br>we rely on our graduates for support<br>moral political and financial but today<br>is your day with the focus firmly on<br>your achievement at the ceremony we<br>honor your success along with the<br>port of your family far now and others<br>who have sustained you through your<br>studies I congratulate you and trust<br>that you will long cherish the memories<br>of your graduation today it is my great<br>pleasure to welcome our guest speaker<br>this morning John Campbell our gift<br>speaker really does need no introduction<br>but he is getting one regardless<br>award-winning journalist and presenter<br>John Campbell began his career at Radio<br>New Zealand in 1989 he went

presenter please welcome<br>thank you very much for that<br>introduction<br>Chancellor Pro Chancellor<br>vice-chancellor it's wonderful to be<br>here in your company today's students<br>it's wonderful to be here in your<br>company today graduates it's so exciting<br>to be here in your company I don't think<br>I should swear at this August occasion<br>and lower the tone but I was at your age<br>something of a word that rhymes with<br>tanker and I didn't attend my own<br>graduation so this is I did a BA with<br>onset Beck so this is the first time in<br>my life I've ever worn one of these and<br>I'm really honored to be in your company<br>as I do so what makes this very special<br>for me is that my daughter has just<br>started at the University of Auckland<br>she's just had her first ever semester<br>here and I'm very proud of her and I<br>imagined mums and dads and brothers and<br>sisters and aunts and uncles and<br>grandparents how proud you must be<br>feeling as you sit up there gazing down<br>on your children or your siblings as<br>they prepare to come up and get their<br>degrees I want to tell you something<br>about yourselves you are people who can<br>do this now some of you will come from<br>environments where it was expected that<br>you would do this and mum and dad had<br>done this and older siblings have done<br>this and some of you will come from<br>environments where you may be the first<br>person ever in the life of your family<br>to hold a tertiary qualification and I<br>want to talk to those people first of<br>all you are remarkable if you have done<br>that and you will change the world I'm<br>not having a go at white folk we have<br>our place but if you look up on the<br>stage you'll see a reasonable number of<br>us now if I look down into the group of<br>people who are about to graduate and the<br>families I see a far greater reflection<br>of the diversity of the beautiful<br>diversity of our city of this great city<br>the largest smartie city in the world<br>the largest Pacifica city in the world a<br>city in which 50 percent of eligible<br>voters in Mount Roskill for example one<br>electorate were born overseas that's who<br>you are that's the world you've studied<br>them<br>you will bring your understanding of<br>that world which is far greater than my<br>understanding to the shaping of our<br>future and that's a profound gift<br>it's also all of you a thing of great<br>responsibility if we look at the hate<br>and enmity that is loading guns and<br>sharpening knives and misbehaving and<br>making the world an ugly place from the<br>margins the thing that will change us<br>and save us is what you know you're to<br>I'd decency your understanding of how<br>the world ought to be your education<br>your heads and your hearts will make us<br>better will make us more fairly<br>reflective and representative of the<br>country we are and should aspire to be<br>but will also make us far less likely to<br>hate the more we learn the more we<br>understand the less chance haters of<br>thriving and finding a place or<br>expression no pressure from me on you<br>but that is what I'm asking of you now<br>what do we know about you well you can<br>do it how do we know that because you've<br>done it because you're here I have a 15<br>year old son who was incapable of even<br>picking the towel of his floor I have a<br>15 year old son who regards any mark as<br>greater than 51 as a complete and utter<br>waste of effort<br>somehow I hope between the age of 15 in<br>the age of 20 21 22 23 he will learn to<br>study and he will learn to makkal down<br>and he will learn that if he is going to<br>get a degree the buck stops first and<br>foremost with himself you all know that<br>I'm talking there are people in this<br>room who are getting PhDs and master's<br>degrees and you are remarkable I'm<br>talking I guess to the graduates the<br>first time graduates the bas when I say<br>the world is your oyster now because you<br>are old enough to know who you are and<br>to have done this<br>but you are young enough for everything<br>still to be possible it's such an<br>exciting time in your life I went to Vic<br>I went to wearing to college first of<br>all in the days when we used to get the<br>strap and the cane and I was miserable<br>at school and I went to Victoria<br>University and studied English because I<br>couldn't think of what else to do and<br>I've got 24 in school certificate<br>science so by a process of elimination I<br>went towards the thing that I kind of<br>liked and was reasonably good at and<br>sometime in my first week or two I came<br>across a part called William Carlos<br>Williams who we had never studied at<br>Wellington College because it always<br>been siegfried sassoon and Wilfred Owen<br>and just God or faulty writing that<br>didn't even have the quality of being<br>anti-war and somewhere in one of my<br>early what a mere American modern<br>literature 109 lectures someone read<br>upon that was by William Carlos Williams<br>and it went this is just to say I've<br>eaten the plums that were in the icebox<br>and which you were probably saving for<br>breakfast forgive me<br>they were delicious so sweet and so cold<br>myself how the hell can that even be a<br>poem what's that guy all about but the<br>words wouldn't go out of my head and 35<br>years later I carry them with me as a<br>tribute to audacity to imagination to<br>people who dare to say no the world is<br>not like this and I'm going to reshape<br>that with my words I fell in love with<br>English and not a day has gone past in<br>the 35-year sense in which I haven't<br>been grateful for the experience of<br>going to university I hope you feel that<br>way I hope you understand now how much<br>you can do and I hope you understand how<br>much we need you and rely on you and how<br>much we expect from you now I want you<br>to do me a favor I know this is kind of<br>embarrassing but my son has never said<br>thank you to me for anything so I want<br>you to turn around<br>and look up at your moms and dads and<br>aunts and uncles and grandmothers and<br>just give them around the pause would<br>most of you will be flirting now and<br>very few of you will live at home but by<br>god there will have been days or weeks<br>or months or years in which without them<br>you would not be here<br>so thanks mums and dads and grandparents<br>and Guardians and aunts and uncles some<br>big brothers and everyone who gives a<br>damn now families I want to end by<br>saying how proud I am of your children I<br>want to end by saying that as I walked<br>in I felt such a flash of pride and<br>delight and the sense of possibility<br>this room contains I want to end by<br>saying that you will shape our future<br>and I believe in your ability to do it<br>what is the one thing that you have that<br>no one else has asked the squished in<br>always of journalism students in the<br>community work experience is an<br>excellent question because people always<br>and I go no you are the only you there<br>is so in the planet I must check how<br>many people are on the planet but maybe<br>there's 7 billion or 8 billion in all of<br>those people and all of the multitudes<br>and all of the repetitions and all of<br>the ethnicities and religions and<br>genders and all the things we have in<br>common there is only one of you and now<br>you have a degree and now you have an<br>education and now you have a self belief<br>take it and go and be yourself in the<br>world and be the best you you can<br>possibly be<br>and aim incredibly high and lead us and<br>make our world better<br>ladies and gentlemen graduates<br>congratulations I am so proud of you and<br>I can't wait to live in the country you<br>shape it's such an honor to be here<br>today I hope you have a wonderful moment<br>thank you John<br>you certainly demonstrated your love of<br>English in a in a most beautiful but<br>insightful that way and there is hope my<br>21 year old has just started picking up<br>his towel this is a meeting of Council<br>and convocation of the University at<br>which the Pro Chancellor Cecilia Tarrant<br>and I will be awarding diplomas and<br>conferring degrees I invite the Pro<br>Chancellor to award the diplomas and<br>confer the degrees in
