some<br>moments in some situations it will do<br>one or the other or neither one overall<br>I would say that right now people would<br>be right to to raise serious questions<br>about whether they've been a force for<br>the good in our politics at their best<br>social media give us new ways of<br>expressing ourselves of learning about<br>each other new ways of being together<br>potentially new ways of doing politics<br>of organizing for causes that we care<br>about and obviously huge economic<br>transformations at their worst social<br>media are a surveillance and propaganda<br>machine the likes of which the world has<br>never known that surveillance may be for<br>economic or commercial purposes it may<br>also be in some cases for the use of<br>governments of course governments can<br>use it again for good or ill that's<br>largely for economic purposes they're<br>collecting an unbelievable amount of<br>data about us and in moments that can be<br>useful and convenient and helpful but it<br>runs risks in the longer term that we<br>can't even foresee there have been of<br>course some situations where social<br>media have been used to organize for<br>causes that people care about but it's<br>also been potentially dangerous in in<br>some places<br>I mean examples recently Burma<br>potentially the United States elections<br>and brexit and the ways in which Russia<br>and other actors are implicated in that<br>so it it really depends which moment and<br>where you're looking social media at<br>their best can be new ways for us to<br>express ourselves new ways for us to<br>learn about each other new ways for us<br>to organize and to be together as people<br>whether that's socially or politically<br>or romantically for that matter social<br>medias<br>serves first and foremost shareholders<br>and this is true by law you know these<br>are corporations and they are required<br>to serve their shareholders needs so to<br>expect that social media would instead<br>serve democratic purposes seems an<br>unreasonable expectation they do also of<br>course serve the users in a number of<br>ways right you we use it to share things<br>with our families to coordinate a party<br>to do all kinds of things but at the end<br>of the day<br>first and foremost they're driven by<br>financial concerns the big social media<br>companies that we think of like Facebook<br>and Twitter are located in America and<br>specifically in California and are<br>subject to those regulations first and<br>foremost<br>so New Zealand can try to pass laws that<br>would restrict or change what those<br>companies are doing but at the end of<br>the day you know this is a comparatively<br>small country we don't have that much<br>weight to throw around that being said<br>there are other things that New Zealand<br>could do you know New Zealand could<br>build its own new social media system<br>akin to the public media we already have<br>like R&amp;Z which is funded by the<br>government for the good of the people so<br>there are different ways forward and<br>the massacre in Christchurch has raised<br>new questions or made New Zealanders<br>more aware of existing issues with<br>social media these are questions around<br>everything from live-streaming to the<br>way that somebody might be radicalized<br>by communities that they're involved<br>with on social media when we look<br>closely at this issue very quickly we<br>get down to these really basic questions<br>about who we are how we're gonna balance<br>safety and freedom the thing that maybe<br>worries me the most is that as we try to<br>strike that balance between safety and<br>freedom it's being struck by the<br>pressures of the market because these<br>are private companies and so it's money<br>that's making those decisions it's<br>social media good for democracy well two<br>things one is you can't talk about that<br>without a context a historic context and<br>a technological context historically<br>we've gone through several different<br>models of media and we've arrived now at<br>this mixed model where you've got all<br>different forms you've got radio and TV<br>and print and electronic and social<br>media and they all kind of contribute to<br>the milieu what social media has done is<br>it has taken what we call gatekeeping<br>out of the hands of the few that used to<br>control the range of debate in<br>traditional media so that can be good<br>and that can be bad it's good because<br>you can get a wider range if you look<br>for it but it's bad because at least the<br>gatekeepers kept out the lies to some<br>degree not always but they had<br>fact-checkers and so some things<br>wouldn't slip through though the<br>opinions might have been a little<br>narrower in some cases usually what we<br>you can have candidates and have debates<br>that are not necessarily controlled or<br>censored out by news norms which always<br>controlled the sort of economic model of<br>traditional journalism so if you look at<br>the United States as an example somebody<br>like senator Bernie Sanders could have<br>never become a presidential candidate<br>without social media but because he was<br>not part of the power structure he was<br>not a traditional Democrat he identified<br>as an independent as a Democratic<br>Socialist and even though he would spend<br>this time in the Democratic caucus he<br>was always an outsider his ideas were a<br>little bit too structural to really fit<br>into a news norm he talked about things<br>like campaign finance reform and they<br>found it really boring or economic<br>inequality but you know what social<br>media gave him a platform and he is pay<br>has built a following that nobody could<br>have ever predicted he is democratized<br>campaign funding in a way that the<br>United States would have never seen<br>nobody would have but he could have<br>predicted that he could have raised as<br>much money as a traditional candidate<br>for something like the presidency of the<br>United States so is that good for<br>democracy I think it does broaden the<br>range of discussion it does let these<br>ideas out that you might not have really<br>heard in that traditional media setting<br>it also enables people to see more of<br>what might have been clipped so Barack<br>Obama might have given a talk to CNN<br>might have shown you you know two<br>minutes but if people wanted to see the<br>entire talk to get the full context and<br>the range of what he had to say they<br>could then go watch it on YouTube one of<br>the other things that we've seen with<br>social media is is a type of engagement<br>that might not have happened just among<br>citizens everyday people who trade ideas<br>and build organizations not just within<br>their own countries but across borders<br>so you might see a movement on climate<br>change trying to affect both in the<br>streets and in the institutions and<br>grouping together in ways they might not<br>have ever been able to do before that's<br>good for democracy but it's also good<br>for the planet technology itself is not<br>you know the end-all or the be-all it's<br>what people do with it one of the things<br>that social media had done was enabled<br>terrorist groups to put some pretty<br>horrific images and ideas into the<br>public sphere into the milieu that could<br>then spread so even when I first moved<br>to New Zealand I you remember going on<br>to a television program and talking<br>about American politics which is one of<br>the things that I and just talk about<br>the structure of American politics but<br>some New Zealanders had been learning<br>some of the conspiracy theories around<br>say the Clintons and really latched into<br>me for not talking about those<br>conspiracies in a way as if they were<br>true that's bad for democracy because<br>it's spreading these ideas that have<br>really in many cases no basis in reality<br>and spreading emotions and in ways that<br>can be very destructive and harmful to<br>individuals and communities we saw what<br>happened in Christchurch it's not<br>something that would have been is easily<br>the idea of free speech it's the idea<br>that you have a marketplace of ideas and<br>let the best ideas rise to the top but<br>you need sort of an equal marketplace of<br>ideas one of the things that we've seen<br>happen and it is partly I think rooted<br>in the economic model of media where<br>people have to make a lot of money and<br>so they need to sell advertising so they<br>need to get your eyeballs in your<br>attention in a place that is pretty<br>competitive and what that's done is it's<br>led those media that are for-profit to<br>make things as sensational and emotional<br>as possible but we get addicted to those<br>emotions and we need more and more and<br>more intense and so the ideas sometimes<br>get drowned out by intense emotional<br>outrage and anger and hate in fear and<br>those are not ideas and so it's sort of<br>counter to the marketplace of ideas and<br>I think I'd be for rather than calling<br>it censorship some kind of moderation so<br>that we can still get those ideas look I<br>think all of our needs get served in<br>social media in one way or another I<br>live in New Zealand I'm a New Zealand<br>resident and my family's spread all over<br>the world my mother's from Cyprus my<br>father was from Lebanon I have family in<br>Canada I have family in France I have<br>family in England social media serves me<br>politically it also serves me I get news<br>from all over the place now what I get<br>that without social media probably but<br>it does organize it in a particular way<br>that makes it easy does it make me miss<br>some things yes it also makes me miss<br>some things because of the algorithms<br>that these outfits like Facebook and<br>others are using who does it serve the<br>most Facebook itself you know it's made<br>a lot of billionaires a lot richer and<br>they've sold us and they've sold our<br>privacy and they've sold our information<br>to the point where there's nothing about<br>us that they don't know so yes it serves<br>us and if we weren't being served we<br>wouldn't keep going to it but we are and<br>in some ways to our detriment<br>I do think there's a rule for moderation<br>of social media absolutely I think we<br>have to think about the public interest<br>we have a planet to take care of we need<br>to make sure we have the basic<br>fundamental necessities including things<br>like water and food which are going to<br>be in question in the coming years and<br>that also means that we need information<br>we need information about our policies<br>we need to know how they function we<br>need to know what our politicians are<br>doing thinking saying and we need to<br>know the fundamental premises of a<br>Democrat democratic societies a lot of<br>that stuff gets drowned out by the<br>hyperbole that is there and the<br>emotional material and the cat videos<br>but you know I don't want them to take<br>away my cat videos I just want to make<br>sure the other material is there too it<br>started about hundred and fifty years<br>ago at the place which many of us heard<br>about this which is the speaker's corner<br>which is a part of the Hyde Park well<br>what are the rules of the speaker's<br>corner anybody who wants to speak may<br>come and speak anybody who may like to<br>listen may listen and also have a right<br>to reply and everything is going under<br>the watchful eye of the UK police so<br>this is the what was the speaker's<br>corner now when we came to social media<br>those three principles that everybody<br>may speak everybody may listen everybody<br>may discuss still maintained but there<br>was two other very important differences<br>added the one is that the speaker's<br>corner is only watched by the police why<br>the social media are monitored or driven<br>by the network administrator and that is<br>a very important aspect and the second<br>aspect is that in the case of the<br>speaker corner you have to come to the<br>place to listen you have to come to talk<br>and both cases you have a time to think<br>about the issue in case of a social<br>media the situation is different because<br>our hearing what is written or you are<br>listening a clip on the video and<br>immediately may start typing and get<br>their answer so that may not be<br>something which is really really valid<br>so these are those basic differences the<br>positive aspect is obvious it is that<br>everybody around the world may<br>communicate to the world their point of<br>view may they argue and may start a<br>discussion so this is very positive but<br>in the same time it is very negative<br>because if you have a mass of<br>information then how to differentiate<br>whether given information is a<br>anybody who wants to communicate to the<br>world their own point of view there is a<br>other problem and the problem is when<br>you had already mentioned to you that<br>speaker corner was monitored by the<br>police and there is no any commercial<br>interest in a case of a other social<br>media discussion is monitored by the<br>network administrators and the network<br>administrators has a vast interest in<br>having as much circulation as discussion<br>as possible why because social media has<br>some cost to run it and the cost is<br>covered by advertisement and the people<br>or businesses who would like to<br>advertise they are paying for it so the<br>more people are listening to or watching<br>social media the<br>the higher profit for the network</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
