still birth in order to<br>ensure that we can continue to achieve<br>successes like these and to enhance our<br>contribution to future generations of<br>graduates and to our nation the<br>university must do three things first we<br>need to attract students of high<br>academic potential and give them an<br>outstanding academic and extracurricular<br>experience and this respect we are doing<br>very well the proportion of students<br>entering University with a high grade<br>point average is growing each year and<br>we produce outstanding graduates just<br>like you second we need to attract<br>develop and retain outstanding staff<br>this we are doing is illustrated by the<br>achievements I described earlier many of<br>our staff are world leaders in their<br>fields and you will have been privileged<br>to learn from and work with them there<br>is no coincidence that under Q s world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>University of Auckland came top in New<br>Zealand and 37 of the forty-one subjects<br>ranked and in the new times higher<br>impact rankings which measure each<br>universities performance against the<br>United Nations sustainable development<br>goals we were ranked first in the world<br>both overall and for health and<br>well-being third we need to create the<br>kind of academic environment and<br>facilities that support and encourage<br>excellence to this end the university<br>has been investing heavily in its campus<br>renewal program so as to ensure we do<br>provide facilities of genuinely<br>international quality many of you will<br>graduate

this prestigious<br>university I am passionate about this<br>university all that it stands for and<br>all that it has given me and to each of<br>you I myself for the second and the<br>second generation of University of<br>Auckland graduates in my family<br>inheriting my mother's passion and love<br>for this institution my husband and I<br>have instilled the value of the<br>University of Auckland education in our<br>own son and most recently our eldest<br>grandson and there are still two more to<br>my own university degree my passport has<br>taken me on an exciting and unforeseen<br>an extremely rewarding journey let me<br>give you just a taste of what's on offer<br>to Oxford as a Rhodes fellow at a time<br>when the first men were accepted into my<br>women's college and for the first time<br>the Rhodes trust accepted applications<br>from women scholars these were very<br>exciting times<br>Auckland Teachers College then separate<br>from the University of Auckland and from<br>the then Faculty of Education I was a<br>secondary teacher trainee piloting a<br>novel training program where we spent<br>50% of our time in the classroom<br>actually teaching a teaching position at<br>a forum 1 to 7 school that's year to sit<br>year 7 to 13 now I was somewhat of a<br>freak then teaching with a PhD I had<br>opportunities then to be a national<br>examiner for both bursaries and<br>scholarship as well as gaining insights<br>through marking national examination<br>scripts a teaching and research position<br>followed in the Faculty of medical and<br>Health Sciences and at that time I was<br>just one of two staff with a teaching<br>qualification what an absolute privilege<br>to be able to combine my passion for<br>teaching with my desire to make a<br>difference in the lives of those living<br>with devastating neurological diseases<br>and during my employment at the<br>University of Auckland and the Faculty<br>of medical and Health Sciences I<br>attended many international conferences<br>I ran an international conference here<br>in New Zealand and to this day it's<br>still heralded as the best that this<br>organization has ever had on sabbatical<br>I worked for 14 months in the lab of a<br>New Zealand er a Kiwi working in the<br>prestigious Salk Institute in San Diego<br>what a privilege this was but these are<br>just a few of the wonderful<br>opportunities that my passport presented<br>to me as a teacher and supervisor I have<br>attended many graduation ceremonies and<br>I never cease to be excited by the<br>wealth of untapped potential and the<br>opportunities that lie ahead of each and<br>every one of you<br>so to each one of you graduating today<br>stand tall and be proud of your<br>University of Auckland achievements<br>culminating in the award of your degree<br>or diploma but at the same time<br>capitalize on the opportunities that<br>arise from being an alumni of the<br>University of Auckland and let your<br>passport take you to as yet unknown<br>destinations affording new opportunities<br>and very exciting experiences for you<br>will be so much richer and happier as<br>you go forward in life
