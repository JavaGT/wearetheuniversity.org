must do three<br>things first we need to attract students<br>of high academic potential and give them<br>an outstanding academic and<br>extracurricular experience in this<br>respect we are doing very well the<br>proportion of students entering the<br>University with a high grade point<br>average is growing each year and we<br>produce outstanding students just like<br>you<br>second we need to attract develop and<br>retain outstanding staff this we are<br>doing is illustrated by the achievements<br>I described earlier many of our staff<br>are world leaders in their fields and<br>you will have been privileged to learn<br>from and work with them it is no<br>coincidence that in the qsr world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>University of Auckland came top in New<br>Zealand and 37 of the 41 subjects ranked<br>and in the New Times Higher Education<br>Impact rankings were to measure each<br>universities performance against the<br>United Nations sustainable development<br>goals we were ranked first in the world<br>both overall and for health and<br>well-being third we need to create the<br>kind of academic environment and<br>facilities that support and encourage<br>excellence to the scene the university<br>has been investing heavily in its campus<br>renewal program so as to ensure that we<br>do provide facilities of genuinely<br>international quality many of you will<br>graduate today were the first<br>qualification and you will be rightly<br>proud of that achievement however I also<br>want you to reflect on the ongoing<br>learning opportunities and wide range of<br>postgraduate options available to you at<br>this University you must never rest on<br>your laurels in a challenging and<br>ever-changing world but rather be<br>prepared to embrace change and new<br>technology and make the most of the<br>opportunities presented to you although<br>it might seem like a daunting prospect<br>right now further study and learning is<br>inevitable for all of us<br>as the world changes around us at an<br>whatever path you follow I urge you as a<br>Lum nine of New Zealand's leading<br>University to never forget your alma<br>mater your University we rely on our<br>graduates for support moral political<br>and financial but today is your day with<br>the focus firmly on your achievement at<br>the ceremony we honor

great pleasure to welcome him to the<br>stage in a manner in a real attend a<br>fight over our table<br>he mic her honor my kita for a a tune a<br>key to Papa taka-kun a Tina quarter er<br>akuma a Karuma a rangatahi ma here pi<br>kita quarter okay Cotto eat in a row<br>tena koe tena koe tenet our Tokugawa<br>Chancellor vice-chancellor members of<br>the council members of the university<br>graduates and most importantly families<br>friends and supporters in both my<br>current and previous roles I saw a lot<br>of young people wearing different<br>t-shirts and if you would permit me to<br>break with the ceremony of the tradition<br>I thought I would show you and start<br>with one t-shirt<br>I'm not going to undress completely<br>and we can put the t-shirt on the screen<br>but it depicts Martin Luther King<br>addressing over a quarter of a million<br>people who had gathered in Washington in<br>1963 as part of a match for civil rights<br>Martin Luther King was the final speaker<br>and he had had a prepared speech written<br>by his speech writers and the theme of<br>the speech was the bank of Justice in<br>the USA had delivered a dud chick for<br>the black people of their country that<br>the bank of Justice had delivered a<br>cheque marked insufficient funds to the<br>black people of the states Excel was<br>killing the story I should tell it to a<br>group of twelve thirteen and fourteen<br>year olds a few months ago and at this<br>stage I could see they looked a bit<br>hesitant and uncertain and I saw their<br>puzzled expression and said you know<br>what I mean by a chick don't you and you<br>know not one of them knew I said you<br>know where you write the person's name<br>and the money and you sign it and you<br>pass it over they did not have a clue I<br>mean no disrespect to those to get that<br>in front of me and behind me but I think<br>that most of you here will know what I<br>mean by a chick at any rate as Martin<br>Luther King was eight paragraphs into<br>that prepared speech he paused he<br>clearly thought he wasn't engaging with<br>his audience and in that pause if you<br>look at YouTube he can hear one of his<br>trusted advisors Mahalia Jackson call<br>out in that silence tell him about the<br>dream Martin tell him about the dream<br>and she was referring to a speech that<br>he'd given two months earlier in Detroit<br>the media were there was the I have a<br>dream speech but it never caught on and<br>for you can read about the whole speech<br>in a very good little book behind the<br>dream that tells the whole story of the<br>speech<br>and in that pause you can see and put us<br>prepared notes to one side and then in<br>fact again on the I have a dream speech<br>and in doing so captured the imagination<br>of the crowd and the whole world and<br>indeed his speeches reverberating down<br>the decades my purpose and starting with<br>that story is to ask you especially<br>those graduating today do you have a<br>vision or a dream for your life and what<br>you want to achieve today is rightly the<br>time where I and everyone here join in<br>congratulations congratulating you on<br>your achievement it's a time of<br>celebration but it should not overlook<br>the central question that I think you<br>face can I suggest that you need to ask<br>not so much what job or what vocation<br>your degree will enable but what will<br>you do with it to make New Zealand a<br>better place what sort of person will<br>you be and how will you better improve<br>and serve your community city and<br>country in my role as children's<br>commissioner I certainly have a dream<br>for all New Zealand's 1.2 million under<br>18 year olds now that's about 23% of the<br>population without a vote certainly<br>usually without a voice my dream as with<br>all of us is that all New Zealand's<br>children flourish thrive and reach their<br>potential<br>but unfortunately the reality is that<br>dream is far from being realized I'm<br>often asked how well are New Zealand<br>children doing<br>actually there's a very easy summary you<br>can remember this 70% do well some world<br>leading lis well when mathletics<br>competitions hip-hop dance competitions<br>in the state's when bronze medals at the<br>Winter Olympics are 16 year olds we can<br>be reassured that most of our children<br>about 70% do well but 20% live in<br>situations of intimate disadvantage and<br>stress and face significant challenges<br>and 10%<br>ahran chronic disadvantage and in<br>environments that make good life<br>outcomes not impossible but much more<br>difficult this latter group this 10% and<br>remember that 70-20-10 because it works<br>just about over every field you want to<br>measure whether it's justice whether<br>it's educational achievement whether<br>it's well-being whether it's education<br>and health that 10% is a number that's<br>significant enough to full Eden Park<br>twice over that group is a real<br>challenge it's a paradox in New Zealand<br>that we can do so well and have so much<br>that is good and so many resources at<br>our disposal but you'd have such a<br>significant group of children that are<br>genuinely doing it very very tough in a<br>country frankly which in the last 30<br>years has dropped the ball about having<br>a coordinated set a strategy a child<br>focused Tres strategy so that's my dream<br>in a sense it's been my recent life's<br>work and it's been a tremendously<br>fulfilling rewarding and absorbing role<br>and it's been a privilege in a small way<br>to have helped to make a difference in<br>the lives of some of our children and<br>young people who most need help you will<br>have different dreams and visions<br>and in all the excitement of graduation<br>and with the pride of your family<br>surrounding you now is a good time to<br>pause you'll never have more<br>discretionary time at your disposal than<br>now to think through what is it that you<br>want to do with your degree how do you<br>want to make a difference in New Zealand<br>and that dream will be amended as life<br>progresses and new opportunities open up<br>but you have to have it and that's my<br>challenge today one of the key<br>mechanisms to bring to life this dream<br>or this vision is to recognize the<br>importance of character my 91 year old<br>father who died just two months ago said<br>to me when I finished University son you<br>will never be trusted in the big things<br>until you demonstrate you can be trusted<br>in the small things as I started out my<br>working life and a law firm in central<br>Auckland that proved true<br>day after day reliability integrity<br>trustworthiness are the hallmarks which<br>will enable your degree that is<br>conferred on you today to be used to the<br>best possible effect because there's no<br>point in having a qualification if you<br>don't make a equal commitment to dream<br>character can't be underestimated you<br>know in Roman times one of the big<br>businesses was making candlestick<br>holders out of silver a huge business<br>and a lot of knockoff artists who used<br>to make wax candlestick holders but coat<br>it was silver on the outside and sell it<br>off as genuine silver those who were the<br>real deal and made candlesticks of solid<br>silver took to stamping on the base of<br>the candlestick underneath the latin<br>word sin cero si in cer e without wax<br>they were without wax candlesticks they<br>were the real deal the same on the<br>inside the same on the outside that's a<br>question for you<br>that's where we get our english words<br>sincere from a sincere person is without<br>wax on the outside as in the inside<br>people of integrity reliability<br>trustworthiness now I started with the<br>t-shirt can I conclude with a t-shirt<br>some of you may know the story it<br>depicts the middle ceremony at the 1968<br>Mexico Olympics the 200-meter event the<br>last race in the calendar the background<br>is the u.s. track team nearly decided<br>not to come as a protest for the lack of<br>civil rights back in the States<br>but in the end they decided to come and<br>they were going to protest at every<br>single event that they won and they went<br>a lot but actually they went out of<br>every opportunity until this last have<br>been and they confidently expected to be<br>first second and third but an Australian<br>Peter Norman came second Tommie Smith<br>first Janklow john-carlos third<br>immediately after the race they both<br>went to Peter Norman and said we going<br>to do the Black Power salute but it's<br>your middle ceremony - do you mind and<br>he said I'm a Salvation Army boy from<br>Melbourne I stand with you I know what's<br>going on in the States and he wore at<br>athletes Against Racism badge at that<br>point Tommie Smith said John Kallis the<br>place getter has forgotten his gloves<br>and was Peter Norman who said well Tommy<br>you'll have to wear your glove on that<br>right hand and john-carlos you'll have<br>to wear your glove on the left hand<br>breaking with protocol and there was a<br>huge commotion and in the end Smith and<br>Carlos got banned from the games and<br>never ran for the USA again had great<br>trouble getting jobs back home Peter<br>Norman ran the fourth fastest time in<br>the world in 1972 to qualify and was a<br>favourite from Munich Olympics but he<br>wasn't selected by the Australians<br>something of a shame an enduring shame<br>in Australia because he wore that<br>athletes Against Racism badge and the<br>way they did it was to select no<br>Australian sprinters that year because<br>none was said to be good enough and<br>Peter Norman never ran for Australia<br>again and it's all told and a wonderful<br>DVD called salute<br>the story of that 200 meters final and<br>Mexico and in it you see the coffin of<br>Peter Norman being carried out of the<br>Salvation Army Citadel in Melbourne<br>just a few years ago when he died in the<br>pallbearers front left and front right<br>at Tommie Smith and John Carlos they<br>traveled all the way over from the<br>states where they're now both University<br>professors because they said this man<br>demonstrated moral courage authenticity<br>under pressure he stood up for what he<br>believes that is what El tiro and New<br>Zealand needs from you you are some of<br>the most privileged and talented and<br>capable young people in our country we<br>desperately need you to demonstrate that<br>same moral courage and model of value<br>system under pressure<br>so in conclusion today is a great<br>opportunity to think about what you will<br>do with your degree in how you will use<br>it to better our country and maybe even<br>our world and you'll never get a bit of<br>time to reflect on it and to start<br>thinking and dreaming to remind<br>ourselves about the importance of<br>character about what demonstrating<br>without wax sincerity means and to<br>remind ourselves that no dream is going<br>to be achieved not only without hard<br>work but without moral courage tena koe<br>tin our koto
