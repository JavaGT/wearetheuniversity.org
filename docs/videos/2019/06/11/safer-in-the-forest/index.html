They are developing methods that, for example, will tell workers when they are becoming tired, or are dehydrated. So far, a shirt with sensors, a smart-shirt, is looking like the best option.<br><br>With exceptional help given by Nik Jessop from WorkSafe New Zealand, they’ve been holding hui in Northland with workers from Lloyd Logging, Johnson Training Services Ltd and Ngati Hine Forestry Trust. These are facilitated by Erina Korahina from the Centre for Health in Tauranga, and involve talking with workers and their whānau and running design activities with them in what’s called  participatory design.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>so the project came about when we were<br>looking at different industries in New<br>Zealand and thinking about how we could<br>use technology and wearable technology<br>in ways that were potentially beneficial<br>a couple of people had mentioned to us<br>that forestry was an area we should be<br>looking at because it has such a high<br>accident rate and so we started<br>investigating and asking people you know<br>where the problems were what they<br>thought the issues were in forestry<br>we needed to understand exactly what the<br>workers needs were in terms of firstly a<br>lot of things that you can use for<br>tracking people through gathering data<br>don't work very well in forestry<br>environment so you have to be mindful of<br>where things are attached to people in<br>how robust they are you also then start<br>thinking about food for the three of the<br>data that's being gathered who has<br>access to that so if you're tracking<br>workers and trying to understand things<br>about for example things like their<br>heart rate and their activities and<br>their workload that's quite invasive in<br>terms of the data that you're gathering<br>it's very personal and so if you start<br>using off-the-shelf tracking for that<br>you're giving away all that these<br>peoples data for free you know they lose<br>all control over it and we realized<br>again fairly early on that this wasn't<br>something that we wanted to do we were<br>much more interested in transfer Fida<br>solution so we call it ethical and<br>evidence-based so gathering data in a<br>way that doesn't take away people's<br>rights to their personal data and also<br>using the data in a way that is<br>meaningful so one of the ways we're<br>looking at for gathering data is is via<br>shirt so what that means is<br>incorporating sensors into something<br>similar to a compression bag so the<br>sensors embedded in a compression ship<br>those sensors as in send data to a SP 32<br>board so small microchip board that then<br>analyzes that data and it seems that via<br>bluetooth to a mobile device so it fits<br>into the compression shirt so this<br>sensors themselves sort of embedded in<br>there that we sew on them or attached in<br>some other way they will then be run<br>using conductive thread so the wires and<br>the shirt will actually be embedded in<br>the ship once they get towards where the<br>boards are going to be held they will<br>have connectors soldered to the Y's and<br>those connectors can they move plugged<br>in and out of the board this allows the<br>board to be removed with the battery and<br>the shirt can be washed<br>we've been running participate Ori<br>design working groups and hui also with<br>forestry workers up north so a lot of<br>forestry workers are Maori and<br>particularly in Northland we've been<br>working with teams who are 100% Maori<br>workers so we'll again we have to be<br>sort of culturally respectful about how<br>we gather data and the sort of data we<br>gather and who it belongs to<br>so engaging those workers in the design<br>process means that they have input and<br>they have buy-in they feel like it's<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
