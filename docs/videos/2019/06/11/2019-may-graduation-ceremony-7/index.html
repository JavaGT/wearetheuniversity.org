name just a<br>few<br>one of his Commission's is as project<br>architect on the conservation of the<br>historic Hut's built in the in the age<br>of Antarctic exploration<br>these are Tong as the huts built by Sir<br>Robert Falcon Scott and Sir Ernest<br>Shackleton and later Sir Edmund<br>Hillary's 1955 Antarctic Hut<br>pup is a past president of the New<br>Zealand Institute of Architects a

please welcome him to the<br>stage Thank You Chancellor<br>vice-chancellor members of council<br>members of university graduates families<br>fauna friends tena koe tu now it's<br>pleasure to be here this afternoon and<br>to have this opportunity to look at so<br>many of you who are our future there to<br>be honest there have been a little<br>uncertain as to what I might say to you<br>you face the world very different from<br>that which I graduated into it and I'm<br>honored to be amongst so many of you who<br>have earned yourselves with the<br>intellectual tools to forge a better<br>future we are as Oscar Wilde has said<br>all in the gutter but some of us are<br>looking at the Stars and I congratulate<br>those of you who are looking at the<br>Stars and who are graduating today I<br>also congratulate your father<br>and friends who've supported you through<br>the years of study the pressures of time<br>and money and intellectual challenge the<br>successes and inevitable frustrations of<br>academic study it is said that when<br>British Prime Minister Winston Churchill<br>was asked to cut arts funding to support<br>the second world war effort<br>he replied then what are we fighting for<br>we should not be surprised I suppose in<br>this age of fate news that he did not in<br>fact I thought out of those were<br>they apparently having appeared in New<br>York's Village Voice as recently as 2008<br>the sentiment does though echo<br>Churchill's pre-war view that the arts<br>are essential to any complete national<br>life the state owes it to itself to<br>sustain and encourage them ill fears the<br>race which fails to salute the arts with<br>the reverence and delight that are there<br>June we if I might associate myself with<br>you your cohort are involved in those<br>activities identified by Churchill as<br>essential to any complete national life<br>as we move into a time of ubiquitous<br>computing automation and the replacement<br>of human activity by digital apparatus<br>creative endeavor is more important than<br>ever it is perhaps a concentration on<br>the quantitative measures of life and<br>the proliferation of goods and services<br>that inevitably occlude the activities<br>of those of us committed to the pursuit<br>of qualitative excellence as we rightly<br>applaud the spectacular advances and our<br>understanding of the mechanics of life<br>so we as a society must ensure that our<br>knowledge is applied to something beyond<br>the pursuit of more bigger Longer as we<br>seek to navigate the complexities and<br>risks of instantaneous and ever-present<br>communication in our search for just<br>equitable and sustainable communities<br>the recognition of excellence in human<br>endeavor sits aspirational goals be<br>those of Performing and visual or the<br>design and ordering of our built<br>environment we might paraphrase<br>philosopher Thomas Hobbes who wrote in<br>the 17th century takes the Leviathan<br>that in the absence of our disciplines<br>life would be solitary poor nasty<br>brutish and short though of course the<br>natural sciences will reasonably claim<br>that they have extended our life short<br>lifespans<br>the values of creativity and connotative<br>rather than quantitative assessment are<br>more important than ever as we confront<br>the extraordinary challenges to human<br>life on earth really in the past as our<br>future seemed so uncertain and yet never<br>in the past has our ability to affect<br>the future been so much within our power<br>you the graduates for those disciplines<br>that privilege creative endeavor must<br>seize the day we're long past the ages<br>of singular specializations that time in<br>which the apparatus of human settlement<br>was measured in the number of houses<br>schools and motorways constructed as of<br>life were no more than the aggregation<br>of physical goods the values that guide<br>the requirements of resilient and<br>sustainable settlement are the stuff of<br>your settlement of your study be at<br>performance planning or design our very<br>survival bullet II as a species depends<br>on the synergistic weaving of social<br>cultural creative and pragmatic<br>endeavors in the making of resilient<br>communities these are not new<br>imperatives indeed the conjunction of<br>scientific scientific endeavor and<br>creative expression have been ideals<br>since classical times and in my own work<br>I have seen a poignant collection of<br>artifacts of the speaker life of<br>conjoined scientific discovery and<br>creative expression I've been fortunate<br>to have been working in the Antarctic<br>engaged with a skilled group of<br>conservatives for some 20 years and the<br>conservation of the Explorers hats from<br>the heroic age of borscht grin Scott and<br>Shackleton's explorations in the first<br>years of the 20th century the<br>expedition's each left behind hats<br>constructed as temporary basis from<br>which their explorations of the polar<br>regions were launched and which served<br>as basis for the gathering of weather<br>geophysical zoological and chemical data<br>to better understand that most unusual<br>continent<br>the huts were each constructed to last<br>two or three seasons at best they G each<br>have survived but are now showing signs<br>of age the extreme climatic conditions<br>of their location and the effects of<br>increasing visitation the huts were<br>abandoned after Shackleton's 1917<br>Imperial Transantarctic expedition left<br>to the elements for some 40 years until<br>they were visited again during the<br>International Geophysical Year in the<br>late 1950s<br>this began annual visitation in the<br>first attempts at conservation of the<br>huts each of the time capsule the<br>equipment of exploration and the<br>artifacts of occupation quite literally<br>frozen in place and time of all the hats<br>that was Cape Evans the hut of Captain<br>Robert Falcon Scott that is most<br>poignant this is a hut from which Scott<br>and his party headed out from their<br>expedition to the South Pole there<br>culminated in the disappointment of<br>being beaten to the pole by five weeks<br>by the Norwegian Roald Amundsen and the<br>death of the party turrets attempt to<br>return to Cape Evans the hut was and<br>Scott said like the Ritz compared with<br>those of the other explorers it's<br>relatively large has rudimentary<br>insulation and a settling lighting<br>system efficient heating a darkroom a<br>well-equipped laboratory and was<br>surrounded by the paraphernalia of<br>weather observation and recording it is<br>from here that Ponting made his superb<br>photographs and Edward Wilson his<br>beautiful watercolor paintings that<br>transcend the me recording of those<br>unusual conditions rather they evoke the<br>strangeness of that alien environment<br>its land and ice formations and its<br>unusual weather events further south<br>along the coast at that point the<br>exposed and desolate point at which<br>Scott's first expedition went at over<br>nineteen hundred and one the royal<br>terror theater was established and gave<br>performances to the expedition members<br>it was there to that editions of the<br>South Antarctic Times were<br>produced a newspaper combining<br>scientific results poetic compositions<br>sketches and paintings these small<br>isolated communities gave voice to the<br>human need to express the sublime<br>environment that they were experiencing<br>as eloquently and precisely as a daily<br>recording of wind speed and temperature<br>you may not travel to the extremes of<br>human reach they some of you may well<br>travel beyond Earth's embrace yet the<br>challenges you face creating a resilient<br>and equitable Society for our burgeoning<br>population must be met by the<br>integration of disciplines not the least<br>of which those being celebrated here<br>today our country is changing rapidly<br>and must continue to do so to meet the<br>challenges of population growth and<br>environmental degradation to do so we<br>you need to show the way that we can<br>live to show how we can live with<br>respect for the land our environment and<br>of course our people the creative<br>industries of art dance music<br>architecture urban design and planning<br>have in your power the ability to make<br>manifest our future I urge you all to<br>seize a day and make your voices heard<br>in the making of that future do not<br>forget the intellectual fervor that has<br>powered you through the last few years<br>please for all our sakes dream those<br>well dreams those dreams be of Civility<br>inclusion and respect and the expression<br>of those dreams filled with passionate<br>commitment to the sublime tena koutou<br>thank you for sharing that wonderfully<br>interesting delivery with us this is a<br>meeting of Council and convocation of<br>the university of which the Pro<br>Chancellor
