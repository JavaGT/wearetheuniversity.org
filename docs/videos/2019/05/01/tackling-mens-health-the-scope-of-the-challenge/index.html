you've experienced<br>it's been humbling for me to come and<br>see see the city and actually to also go<br>around quake city and to see what you've<br>experienced over the years and and how<br>horrific has been so just just to say my<br>thoughts who with you I also just want<br>to acknowledge the University of Otago<br>I'm here on the William Evans fellowship<br>at the Centre for men's health with Dave<br>Baxter professor Dave Baxter who has is<br>pioneering a lot of the work in in in<br>men's health and it's great to see Rob<br>who runs the men's clinic here in the<br>city as well now my work I've done a<br>great deal of work I'm a nurse<br>interested in in why men do what they do<br>and do and how they do it how services<br>reach out to men how men go into<br>services I'm interested in the stories<br>men tell I'm also interested in trying<br>to unpack the data the the reality of<br>men's health not just the stereotypes<br>the experiences that people think they<br>have of men and because of that we've<br>worked with a Premier League of trying<br>to get boys into health initiatives<br>we've worked on men and gender equality<br>I led the team that did the European<br>Commission stated Men's Health Report<br>looking at the data we've worked with<br>Movember during the global analysis of<br>men's mental health and as just been<br>said by Philippa Thank You Philippa<br>we've worked with the World Health<br>Organization and that for those rugby<br>aficionados is the Leeds Rhinos ground<br>at Headingley where we run at a Clemente<br>health with the supporters in the in the<br>halftime and the before the match so<br>it's very eclectic range of work and we<br>brought out books on men's mental health<br>men and weight men's using public health<br>a sport as a public health vehicle and<br>we've also done a big study on the state<br>of mental health in Leeds which was<br>covering the 400,000 men males boys and<br>men in the city too and that has now<br>been starting to change the way the<br>whole city looks at men and their health<br>we're commissioning<br>services based around the findings of<br>this to try and think about how do men<br>use weight loss services how do men use<br>went mental health services and so it's<br>been a very significant part of the work<br>we've been doing in the UK and then this<br>last year I was invited to do the<br>Women's Health Report and and that was<br>quite a staggering piece of work for me<br>for for many reasons one is you'll see<br>the difference and and when you see the<br>difference in the men's health in the<br>Women's Health Report you certainly<br>begin to realize why women's health has<br>had so much more attention than men's<br>health because it is so much more<br>complicated their lives from a girl from<br>11 through to menopause and then beyond<br>the menopause is just vastly more<br>complicated in terms of the biological<br>processes and how that impacts on a<br>woman on a day-by-day basis week by week<br>basis then the man whose body is mostly<br>static and they can go years without<br>seeing a GP because they don't need to<br>and if they've got a problem it's<br>usually fairly transitory and they get<br>over it and then layered on top of that<br>is all the socio-cultural stuff of being<br>a woman and and the implications of that<br>for men and the implications of the<br>social cultural aspects of being a man<br>on the implications of that on women<br>that makes sense it's a very very<br>different world for the woman and the<br>man there are a lot of similarities but<br>there's a lot of differences today I'm<br>going to be focused on the men but I<br>could easily be giving a detailed<br>analysis at talk on the women because it<br>is it is actually so much of that is<br>unknown and that it's only recently<br>we're starting to explore what the<br>reality of of the women's body as well<br>as the man's because to be honest most<br>of the research has been done biomedical<br>research has been done on this anonymous<br>male body and this is an older woman's<br>body and you the amount of research<br>that's been done on long Swamp women's<br>lungs and colon and all the other stuff<br>as well as the social cultural actually<br>is still massively under under sir tree<br>search but then is so as men because the<br>older man is still not reply researched<br>the the ethnic might not are the ethnic<br>the racial issues of bio physiology in<br>men has not been fully explored we have<br>got an awful lot of work to do<br>and that goes right the way through from<br>from preconception the health of the<br>male and the female through to that this<br>time in the fetus the socio-cultural<br>experience of childhood and adulthood<br>and how that impacts from health and<br>well-being and it does impact on health<br>and well-being this is the life<br>expectancy you can see here in New<br>Zealand up where we have got a<br>relatively good life expectancy compared<br>to a lot of other countries but you'll<br>still see that men have a lower life<br>expectancy than women in all the<br>countries apart from one or two across<br>the globe and some of that is biological<br>but when you see the difference between<br>a man in Switzerland and a man in the<br>photo then you realize that that is this<br>is not a biological inevitability men<br>are not programmed to die something is<br>happening and what this talk is about is<br>what is happening to men and what's<br>changing with men this is a New Zealand<br>data where were I've looked at the<br>numbers the numerical ad straight<br>forward numbers not rates but if you can<br>see that at every age from from newborn<br>through 255 more men than women die if<br>you take that through above 60 you see<br>it's only in the 85 plus where you have<br>numerically more men dying and the World<br>Health Organization picked up on this<br>and they identified the a significant<br>age for men is the 1530 to 69 I've taken<br>a slightly different age I'd tend to go<br>a bit earlier than that both in the<br>early age and a bit earlier in the older<br>age but they looked at the mortality and<br>they saw they saw that that more men are<br>dying in the these are the wealthy<br>countries the the well-off countries<br>down this end and here we have them down<br>at the bottom end which tend to be the<br>more the countries with the really low<br>life expectancy and it is this that they<br>noticed they noticed this that there is<br>a a general gap between men and women<br>but they also noticed this change<br>women's life expectancy was<br>changing a great deal but men's was and<br>they say that this is a significant<br>missing men I'm going to come on to that<br>in a second<br>but when you look at your population<br>when I calculated for this is the total<br>number of deaths in men and women a<br>somewhat similar number but if you look<br>in that 15 to 65 age group you have<br>nearly a fifth of your male deaths<br>occurring in an age when they should be<br>a father they should be a worker they<br>should be a partner or if they haven't<br>say they should just be living but when<br>you look at Maori you are up 47 percent<br>of deaths in the Maori population male<br>deaths are occurring in that 15 to 65<br>age range Pacific Islanders 39.4 women's<br>are also higher so it's not just a men's<br>issue it's a woman's issue as well but<br>at the moment I'm just focusing on the<br>men's issue but just to show that it<br>does affect women as well the Asian and<br>if you actually took out all the other<br>populations in terms of percentage<br>you're looking at eighteen point two<br>percent of male deaths the World Health<br>Organization met stated it this way the<br>adverse mortality experience of these<br>men of working age has a profound<br>demographic economic and political<br>impact this burden of avoidable<br>mortality is so large and has been<br>observed for so long that in many<br>countries is almost seen as a natural<br>phenomena and unmodifiable and therefore<br>forgotten<br>nearly all the policies I've explored<br>through the world I've looked at I've<br>been involved in all sorts of reports on<br>men's health globally I'm a visiting<br>professor in Malaysia we've done work in<br>America in Canada men's health is almost<br>invisible oh and when I started out in<br>the mid 90s looking at men's health and<br>then I got my chair I was the world's<br>first professor of men's health I mean<br>you think well that's bizarre that we<br>were to never have any kind of academic<br>view of men in relation to their health<br>men and war<br>men and sex<br>men and violence but not men in health<br>it's like an invisible where people just<br>just don't see it and when they see it<br>they don't know what to do with it and<br>so therefore they ignore it this is what<br>is killing those men it's not a complete<br>compendium of of causes you realize very<br>soon that being professor of men's<br>health I don't get invited to many<br>parties oh yeah hey he's good he's<br>enough oh yay talks about mortality is<br>great yeah but when you look at it God<br>you need to have that conversation don't<br>you because what you see is for women<br>the majority of deaths are through in<br>the Oh in those earlier from malignant<br>cancer from cancer and breast cancer sex<br>specific cancers and some of the other<br>cancers in fact this is cancer for men<br>if you took out all the sex specific<br>cancers for that only impact on women so<br>you left with the cancers that should<br>affect men and women equally this I<br>wasn't able to do it but this line would<br>be down here men are impact it have a<br>huge burden of cancer but you also see<br>ischemic heart disease taking off but<br>down here in these early years you don't<br>see the cancer you don't see the<br>cardiovascular what you see is accident<br>these are the accidents and then this is<br>the suicide and still for women suicide<br>is still a significant part of of a<br>woman's early mortality from actual<br>mortality in fact that's an important<br>point because you tend to hear it more<br>of an issue for men but it is still a<br>very important aspect of women's<br>experience of life as well but the<br>accident and the suicide coming down<br>here thankfully but then overtaken by<br>the the cardiac and the cancer and if<br>you look at the maori deaths here we<br>have the accidents and they who we have<br>the suicide again and here we have an<br>earliest rise of the ischemic heart and<br>here we have cardiovascular not ischemic<br>our cardiovascular a lot of cardiac<br>deaths in in the maori are<br>ha failure but here we have the cancer<br>as well taking off and so we have to be<br>thinking about what's happening down<br>here that's impacting on those early<br>life loss if you look at the other end<br>of the scale you can see 65 to 85 more<br>cancers in men ischemic heart disease<br>coming through and then kardi of<br>cerebrovascular accidents degenerative<br>brain disease in the UK now they put<br>dementia down as a course of death and<br>now it's the single biggest killer of<br>women dementia but you see here<br>everything Rises very steeply because<br>this is the 85 plus the the statistics<br>haven't caught up with the aging<br>population and so we really need<br>National Statistics to be going it<br>further into the 80s 90s hundreds but<br>you're and another reason why you're<br>going to have to do that is because of<br>the change in your population and it's<br>the change that's happening globally<br>though we've got high numbers of men<br>dying prematurely the biggest growth is<br>in the 80 pluses for men by 2038 you're<br>going to have 14% more men 15 to 39 20%<br>more men aged forty to sixty four<br>eighty-four eighty-five percent more men<br>aged 65 these are projections but 166<br>167 percent more men you're going from<br>69 thousand to one hundred and eighty<br>four thousand you've still got increases<br>in women but it's what what's happening<br>for a lot of women now the life<br>expectancy is before in in England it's<br>actually slowing down and we're now peak<br>and were actually in lead starting to<br>dip and that's a really worrying sign<br>but for men those that we I did a polar<br>decomposition of mortality data across<br>the European Union looking at 10 years<br>and what you found was the the more tap<br>we're getting better at keeping the<br>older alive longer because we pick up<br>cardiac we pick up cancer and we're<br>getting damn good at treating it and so<br>once we've got it then we can we can<br>stop them dying and in fact we're<br>getting an increase in chronic illness<br>because of people who would have died<br>earlier<br>being not dying and so we're seeing that<br>this is what I mean about the successes<br>this is this if they're going back to 79<br>through to 2013 from the World Health<br>Organization database you can see that<br>the ischemic heart disease has dropped<br>dramatically in New Zealand<br>this is the cerebral vascular accident<br>dropping we can see cancer cardiac<br>chronic this is bowel cancer actually<br>bowel cancers remains somewhat stable<br>and I'm going to look at bowel cancer in<br>a second now what you could ask is is<br>just going back to that what causes that<br>and what causes that what causes that<br>and now it is what's occurred down here<br>now we tend to think of men has been<br>fairly invincible they think of<br>themselves as invincible I can smoke<br>what I want I can drink what I want my<br>weight doesn't matter I am okay but it<br>isn't because the majority of the<br>cancers that men experience are cancers<br>and ischemic heart disease are are<br>ischemia a heart diseases of lifestyle<br>there is some aspect of the way they<br>have lived their life there is a<br>biological advantage for women in terms<br>of their schema their heart disease<br>except if they become obese their sex<br>hormones gives them a protectant factor<br>that's why more women die from<br>cardiovascular disease in their later<br>years and the gencode project is a<br>brilliant analysis of the differences<br>between men and women I don't have a<br>reference for it here but if anyone's<br>interested<br>Jenny had gender and coronary artery<br>disease it's brilliant study with<br>guidance for practitioners but just<br>looking at this for a time being you can<br>see that something is going on here to<br>start this rise and what's going on here<br>is is the lifestyle that of men are<br>experiencing so when we start to look at<br>the lifestyle this is just a range of<br>countries from North Korea where you can<br>see a significant amount of alcohol is<br>it's consumed by men litres of alcohol<br>compared to women<br>and here we have New Zealand where<br>you've got a similar significantly<br>greater amount of alcohol consumed by<br>men than women here we have road traffic<br>accident I know that's not related to<br>the lifestyle for the but it's put it in<br>because I think it's just part of that<br>story of premature death in men and you<br>can see here how the difference between<br>men and women is still quite marked it's<br>also interesting when you have<br>international comparisons because you<br>think to yourself so why is the United<br>Kingdom which has got 60 million people<br>66 million people down here and New<br>Zealand has is the rate is so much<br>higher up here and then is the whole<br>question about Road legislation and how<br>that is enforced and people's attitudes<br>to driving and attitudes to to road<br>safety I'm and we're just in the middle<br>of voting on brexit at the moment I<br>don't know if any of heard of Brick City<br>for amusement I'm sure you go on and<br>have a laugh at what's going on in the<br>UK the the vote is happening right now<br>so if I'm slightly distracted every now<br>and again if I can just see my whole<br>career my whole life just disappearing<br>down to some kind of bricks it's swanee<br>so but and actually it's gonna have an<br>impact on men it's gonna have and as we<br>go on through this talk and I think<br>you'll probably see that one of the<br>things I'm talking about is we're not<br>looking at one specific issue here we're<br>looking at the way men are living their<br>lives and the content the reasons why<br>men live their lives in a certain way<br>and the consequence of living their<br>lives in a certain way because a lot of<br>this is bound up with that and it's not<br>just a single man deciding I'm going to<br>smoke or I'm going to be overweight<br>there's a whole raft of factors which<br>have impacted on that here we have<br>smoking and how successful you are but<br>also how many women caught smoking in<br>comparison to a lot of the other<br>countries and this is overweight<br>overweight is still seen predominantly<br>as a female issue but in the majority of<br>countries there's more men overweight<br>than women and and the consequence of<br>overweight for men I'm going to discuss<br>in a sec<br>and the other thing that's happening<br>that were realizing now is that a lot of<br>these are clustered together this was a<br>study we did with the Premier League<br>where we looked at young Liao's 15 to 45<br>that were engaging in the Premier League<br>and we did an analysis of sitting time<br>because that sedentary behavior has now<br>been seen as a really significant aspect<br>of augment health we spend a lot of time<br>sitting farmers sitting in tractors we<br>see people sitting at work they're in<br>the service centers where they're sat<br>for long periods of time students sat<br>for long periods of time unemployed men<br>sat for long periods of time because<br>they have no inclination to get up and<br>go and do something not inclination as<br>in a will but there's just they have<br>lost the will and so they spend a lot of<br>time just sitting so sitting is a very<br>significant aspect of time but you see<br>how the clustering of diet activity<br>smoking alcohol all come together which<br>has got implications for the way we<br>tackle a lot of these problems if we<br>just tackle them one at a time and you<br>expect a person to go from this service<br>to this service to this service you can<br>understand how how frustrated they<br>become and how confuse they come because<br>they're getting guidance from all<br>different court and we're trying now to<br>think about how we bring cluster<br>together more of the health guidance for<br>these guys and and in in many ways<br>public health is much of as much about<br>personal choice as the weather it's a<br>quote I found years ago and I forgot to<br>write down the reference but I just like<br>the quote we we don't choose our<br>sanitation we don't choose smoking bans<br>we don't choose the legislation we don't<br>choose to wear a crash helmet or not<br>it's it is dictated by by society we<br>have fluoride in our toothpaste too much<br>of public health is imposed upon us and<br>it begs the question how much more<br>should be imposed upon us to give us a<br>legitimacy for changing the way people<br>live their lives because the way we live<br>our lives is actually quite significant<br>and I just want to focus on on old men's<br>weight for a moment women tend to put<br>their weight on on their hips and thighs<br>and the majority of women who think<br>they're overweight are not overweight<br>they are it with a perfectly<br>natural shape they are within a<br>perfectly natural range and the fat on<br>the hips and thighs is a in the earth in<br>inert substance which actually helps<br>through reproduction helps with bone<br>density helps in all sorts of ways<br>visceral fat around the gut is more<br>complicated and it's actually quite<br>nasty for women visceral fat means the<br>higher risk of of wiping out all the<br>benefits of the sex hormones hormonal<br>preference for for women living longer<br>with cardiovascular health and and<br>diabetes and all sorts but for men we<br>tend to stick it on here we have<br>visceral fat the metabolic syndrome<br>increases our risk of type 2 diabetes<br>the fat related cancers high blood<br>pressure high cholesterol and a reptile<br>dysfunction and I often say to men when<br>they're trying to lose weight you'll get<br>a bigger Willie because the because the<br>work because the Willie is attached to<br>the pubic bone if you've got any weight<br>in front of it it sort of makes you<br>thought a little bit of the end sticking<br>out less so if you lose the more you<br>lose weight your bigger you Willie so I<br>mean if it works for some but when you<br>look at weight when you look at weight<br>for men and for women this is<br>interviewer measured body mass you see<br>at 16 to 24 we have 62 percent of the<br>male population in England with a normal<br>body weight and it drops dramatically 25<br>to 34 to 42 percent and then to 32<br>percent and 23 so we are we certainly go<br>from active youngsters to inactive<br>workers for women that is a much more<br>gradual process 59 53 39:33 30 and and<br>so something is happening here between<br>here and here and we've got to be<br>thinking about well well what does<br>weight mean for MIT women and what does<br>weight mean for men and what we find is<br>that for women the more educated they're<br>less likely they are to be overweight<br>for men the more educated they are the<br>more likely to be overweight and it says<br>a lot about so what does the meaning of<br>weight mean for women and for men and<br>you find that there's a huge<br>socio-cultural implication for weight<br>and and being a big man and being a it<br>doesn't matter you don't have the same<br>kind of social stigma associated with it<br>obesity different but overweight yes<br>and and what are the drivers most normal<br>weight boys think they're underweight<br>most normal weight girls think they're<br>overweight and and you don't get to be<br>like this we're eating salad and we've<br>now got a big issue about boys and and<br>buildings themselves up and body<br>dissatisfaction and steroid use and such<br>like and you have another level where I<br>don't care this is a beer belly<br>competition and we actually utilized the<br>power of the badge the badge of football<br>to to n'd to work with men with weight<br>loss and football fans in training has<br>been a really really successful in here<br>we have the The Lancet paper that came<br>out I didn't put the reference down I'm<br>sorry but we got 5.8 kilograms of weight<br>loss after a 12-week program that was<br>retained for a year<br>5.6 kilograms at the end of a year now<br>anyone who knows anything about weight<br>loss programs will know that that is<br>phenomenal health screening say a little<br>bit about health screening blood<br>pressure cholesterol diabetes bowel<br>cancer weight significant opportunities<br>now exists for people to take part in<br>health screening and I did an analysis<br>of routes to diagnosis stage at<br>diagnosis survival all sorts of<br>different parameters with Cancer<br>Research UK and Bob Steele who chairs<br>the UK cancer screening program and what<br>you find for men is they have much<br>higher levels this is meant incidence of<br>colorectal cancer and this is women's<br>incidence of colorectal cancer and you<br>can see how many more men develop and<br>actually die from bowel cancer and we<br>were intrigued to see whether we had a<br>behavioral component and what we found<br>which was quite interesting was almost<br>no difference in the the route to<br>diagnosis there was slightly more women<br>that would take him part in screening<br>but women didn't like it either and so a<br>lot of women refused to do it<br>we noticed that actually more women were<br>being picked up at the emergency<br>presentation but that though more women<br>were picked up his emergency<br>presentation men were a higher stage of<br>cancer development but in those four<br>state 1 and stage 2 council we're<br>picking the men up in almost equal<br>numbers now a lot of people have been<br>staggered by that they thought that<br>there would be a much poorer deaf<br>behavior in relation to men with regard<br>to the bowel cancer but actually we're<br>on parity with women which means we have<br>failed miserably and this way it comes<br>down to equality inequity because if you<br>have so many more men developing the<br>cancer early than women just being on<br>the same level as women mean that you<br>failed and we have to work really hard<br>to get more men to cancer screening<br>earlier if we're going to save lives<br>does that make sense that you have a<br>national bowel screening program and we<br>need to be thinking about how you get<br>that message to men and one of the<br>things we found with men or was that if<br>they if someone asks them have you done<br>your bowel screening or because if you<br>if anyone's got an opportunity to have<br>bowel cancer screening they get it who<br>are not doing that fecal occult blood<br>ruin arm pull that have someone say it's<br>good idea you should do that especially<br>if it's the partner or the GP or nurse<br>somebody say have you had your tests yet<br>or not Maura well I'll do it<br>save your life if you get picked up at<br>stage one it's a little polyps gone life<br>saved weight problem do it now and it's<br>bat it's as simple as it needs to be we<br>don't have to do complicated stuff with<br>a lot of men we just have to give them<br>our prod sometimes with a sharp stick<br>but this I'm not going to talk much<br>about the male reproductive system but<br>whoever thought of putting those dangly<br>this causes so much unsaid it should it<br>be big and should it be smaller should<br>prostate a lot of in a survey in England<br>a lot of men didn't know they had a<br>prostate<br>a lot of the men thought women had it<br>but didn't use it as much a huge amount<br>of uncertainty over what goes on down<br>below and if you think about it where<br>you're gonna find out what at what point<br>do you get told school you don't get<br>told it's a really interesting<br>misconception that men will just have<br>this information women don't know about<br>the menopause because they're never told<br>about it and actually it's been Crichton<br>quite incredible how how confusing the<br>menopause is prostate is exactly the<br>same men just don't know what they're<br>looking for and we have to be better at<br>giving them information and there's so<br>many different ways now getting that<br>information online through doctors<br>through GPS through nurses but it the<br>the problem with screening for prostate<br>is that it is so difficult to find the<br>right person to be screened and there is<br>a new paper out prostate predict which<br>is just out in this last month which is<br>which has actually got a really good<br>predictive tool for prostate cancer so<br>if anyone's interested in it there's<br>want to look out for this is a scan MRI<br>scan of a man's heart with a reptile<br>dysfunction and this is triple artery<br>disease he had erectile dysfunction but<br>no heart problems and that is because<br>the penile artery is a third of the size<br>of the coronary artery so any vascular<br>problems that start to emerge will<br>emerge in the penis before it emerges in<br>the heart and yet we're extremely bad at<br>getting men to own up to having erectile<br>dysfunction problems and if they own up<br>to erectile dysfunction problems and we<br>analyze assess them we might find<br>cardiovascular and now that a lot of the<br>medications for erectile dysfunction are<br>freely available or not freely available<br>they're available online there's a worry<br>about men missing out on that diagnosis<br>and we need to be better at getting men<br>to know there is an issue if they got<br>erectile dysfunction it might not be<br>psychosomatic it might not be<br>performance related it might be cardiac<br>similarly for all of those who view care<br>for men with cardiovascular problems<br>chances are there have also got a<br>reptile dysfunction which will impact on<br>their relationship<br>and and therefore are we get are we good<br>at talking to men around a reptile<br>dysfunction so that we can give the kind<br>of guidance that is necessary to so that<br>they can have a fulfilling life but I<br>want to break away from this that's the<br>sort of the biomechanical and them this<br>is the this is the World Health<br>Organization report first time the World<br>Health Organization has ever put its toe<br>into men's health brilliant and they<br>have a strategy and when they looked at<br>it when they were developing it they<br>identified three areas one was reducing<br>premature death one was achieving gender<br>equality and one was reducing<br>inequalities those inequalities between<br>countries and they noted that it affects<br>education occupation income citizenship<br>and masculinities and sexual orientation<br>and service delivery and and they<br>identified the the five key areas that<br>needed to be focused on to save more<br>men's lives was wealth in education<br>employment retirement and living<br>arrangements gender equality and social<br>exclusion and discrimination not getting<br>them to the doctors that's interesting<br>isn't it's not about it's about societal<br>change to enable men to live a healthier<br>life which prevents them needing to go<br>to the doctor's this is the men these<br>are the men these are the ones that<br>we're interested in we're the ones that<br>are living a good life a normal life<br>that we're trying to be father's so that<br>we've got sons were also got men who are<br>disabled we have men who have got mental<br>health problems we've got homeless men<br>we've got violent young men we have got<br>crowds of men and if you when I put New<br>Zealand men I put strange things into my<br>google search if anyone came and looked<br>at my Google search they'll say well<br>that's interesting I wonder why is doing<br>that but if you put Google through<br>Google up men you can see how you have<br>all different perspectives of men's<br>lives just that is one page I just put<br>New Zealand men and this is the page on<br>images that came up and and we're not<br>dealing<br>with with one man we are dealing with<br>complexity we're dealing with gender<br>ethnicity race sexuality age disability<br>so you it's a Muslim man it's a Muslim<br>man who is disabled it's a Muslim man<br>who is disabled and a JIT it's a Muslim<br>man who's disabled aged and living alone<br>it's a Muslim man who's disabled aged<br>living alone and gay now each one of<br>those puts a level of complexity that<br>just talking about men bland<br>fails to pick up and we what is man what<br>I'm in now we have got such diversity<br>male/female MX this this this this<br>notion that masculinity femininity is<br>masculine males traditional nails is no<br>longer really viable lgp LGB what does<br>that mean we've got lesbian gay bisexual<br>transgender transsexual to two-spirit<br>queer questioning a sexual ally<br>pansexual a gender that that it is we<br>are not talking about binaries and this<br>is my life without gender Tyler Ford<br>what is he is email is a female and I<br>think that that it gives them gives an<br>impression of change that if you went<br>back 30 40 50 years that this would what<br>do you mean what do you mean well we're<br>now here in the middle that we're in the<br>almost at 2020 and life is very<br>different and the more we regress back<br>to the traditional form of masculinity<br>and manhood then the more difficult it<br>is because the whole world is changing<br>women's place within society has changed<br>dramatically then we've got the layer on<br>top of that the social determinants of<br>health all the class that cut the the<br>financial the poverty that impacts on<br>people in education the housing<br>employment marital status access to<br>services and crime this is another layer<br>that's on top if you go to your index of<br>multiple deprivation you can find that<br>Christchurch's is separated out into<br>agent areas and here the ten you've got<br>the lowest the most deprived areas and<br>you can sense that perhaps the health of<br>these people on Diamond Harbor have got<br>a very different life to the people down<br>here and they have and the the study by<br>Sharples in New Zealand identified that<br>for the Pacific Islands they have a 40%<br>higher chance of dying of colorectal<br>cancer if they live here than if they<br>live up here because the the poverty<br>with poverty comes housing difficulties<br>comes nutritional issues that comes<br>access to service issues it comes<br>there's all sorts of things which go<br>with poverty that is not just about<br>finance and in leads where I come from<br>this is the week for some reason it's<br>the scale is the other way around this<br>is the most impoverished and we can see<br>here how many more men and women live in<br>the lowest of the low areas and a lot of<br>the ethnic minority population of leads<br>are living in those low areas education<br>your schools now are seeing boys coming<br>out with much worse qualifications than<br>girls and if you look at your 16 to 19<br>year old population you've got this is a<br>hundred eighty three boys are in custody<br>six females<br>you've got more boys in in employment in<br>those younger years because more girls<br>are still in education<br>you've got more boys who are not in<br>education employment or training boys<br>and girls are living at home longer<br>they're taking longer to get established<br>in the world it's now thirty two point<br>three is the average age of of getting<br>married for men thirty point five for<br>women women tend to go out with boys who<br>are older girls are much more mature<br>right from birth and their neural the<br>neuro pruning that necessary for the<br>brain to function in a more effective<br>way happens earlier for girls and so<br>what you tend to find is girls tend to<br>go out with boys who are older than them<br>not their peer group and so therefore<br>marriages tend to occur it's actually<br>interesting because one of the<br>consequences girls and wide who are<br>suffer from sexually transmitted<br>diseases infections because they are<br>changing world and met male employment<br>this is a really interesting one in that<br>the world has changed where we had<br>employment it was a very manual<br>employment we had lots of heavy industry<br>men could use their physicality and even<br>now we're in farmers that they're in a<br>lorry they're in a van or they're in a<br>tractor there it's automated the<br>factories are more automated it's it's<br>becoming a very different world for<br>people for men in work you need a lot<br>less men to be able to do the work and<br>we certainly in the UK have had a<br>massive reduction in permanent contracts<br>now men are working more short-term<br>hours they're on fixed term contracts or<br>zero hour contracts where they don't<br>know from a day by day I don't know if<br>you have this in New Zealand you don't<br>know from day by day whether you're<br>gonna have any work and and so it's a an<br>incredibly difficult way of working and<br>and we also have an involuntary<br>part-time work and in work poverty where<br>people cannot earn enough money because<br>of rent and switch like to live a life<br>so they're having to do two or three<br>jobs and in many men's worlds now the<br>woman is the most important breadwinner<br>and we're getting more men who are<br>staying at home to be the main carer<br>because the women are coming through<br>with degrees that are better than<br>they're not getting degrees or like<br>there's a whole raft of issues in<br>relation to where the women tech<br>opportunities are opening up and for men<br>this they're closing down and it's very<br>good gender equality is all about equity<br>and actually the more traditional the<br>family where the man expects to be the<br>breadwinner and fights against it that<br>is a very stressful and unpleasant<br>position to be in the more you are able<br>to embrace change they're more you're<br>able to work together as a partnership<br>in the New World Order the better it is<br>for your health and you see this time<br>and time again Iceland has got paternity<br>leave the man is off for a year if he<br>want to be and that gives him an<br>opportunity to be a better father better<br>partner and he has better health the the<br>children have better health that<br>marriage the partnership stays longer<br>and you can see here the across Europe<br>how we are having a massive decrease in<br>construction fishing and an increase in<br>in-service related industries and<br>there's a really fascinating problem<br>we're experiencing now with men and<br>service-related industries because women<br>are much more much more geared up to<br>service related industries they have an<br>emotional reflexivity that gives them<br>the the emotional capacity to deal with<br>problems that a lot of men don't and so<br>they they they find it very hard to deal<br>with someone who's shouting at them down<br>a phone does that make sense<br>where's so a lot of men's issues can<br>actually come down to men's mental help<br>and it may be that what we've got is is<br>an issue where we've got women<br>struggling with their mental health and<br>they do men struggling with their mental<br>health and they don't put come forward<br>and it it brings out problems hidden<br>depression in men most of the current<br>diagnostic procedures I don't think are<br>effective are picking up problems with<br>men there are men around willing to<br>express their emotions reticence seek<br>professional health and they see<br>struggling with life as an issue not<br>their emotional mental health my wife's<br>left me I've lost my job I have money<br>problems I'm drinking so what can you do<br>to help me do what can you help me with<br>that you're not going to bring my wife<br>back so why am I talking to you you know<br>and I we know that men will get a huge<br>amount of help from talking but trying<br>to persuade them that they can Susan<br>brown hills work around avoiding men<br>numbing it escaping at escape behavior<br>such as extramarital affairs hurting and<br>then suicide and and actually a very<br>interesting study by Martin as how found<br>that if you if you look for anger if you<br>look for substance abuse and risk-taking<br>then you find more men with depression<br>than women and that risk-taking is doing<br>stupid things postnatal depression anti<br>depression in men is now been recognized<br>we're seeing something like 9 9 percent<br>of new fathers experiencing a<br>diagnosable mental health but how many<br>men are engaged and how many midwives<br>actually reach out into men how many<br>health visitors reach out into men and<br>look for problems and if you've got a<br>man with a mental health problem in a<br>family where they're trying to bring up<br>a child and the woman might be<br>experiencing mental health problems<br>isn't that a double whammy in that<br>terrible<br>this is adolescent suicide in in in New<br>Zealand and what you find in that 15 to<br>19 age group across all these countries<br>New Zealand now that's not males but<br>males are the biggest caught are more<br>likely to be committing suicide so it's<br>not broken down by gender but you can<br>fairly well assume that that is actually<br>a lot of males I've been analyzing<br>suicide data over the over the years and<br>you can see this is female suicide and<br>this is male suicide and male suicide<br>has been getting up on up on are going<br>up and up and up as the as the recession<br>bit and also older male suicide is<br>building as well rural masculinity<br>you've got to be thinking about what's<br>happening in your rural areas and you're<br>seeing great change that's occurring the<br>changes within the family structure<br>changes in within roles changing with<br>this within the technologies and these<br>disasters that are occurring and when<br>you look at self-harm in rural setting<br>you can see the isolation of loneliness<br>stress that is hip impacting on the men<br>it's not it's not as if the men don't<br>care it's just the men are overwhelmed<br>overwhelmed with change extreme seasonal<br>fluctuations market fluctuations<br>everything is getting more complex and<br>the more traditional you are in your<br>masculinity the more difficult it is for<br>you to accept that you need to have help<br>indigenous suicide indigenous suicide is<br>not being indigenous but it's second<br>coping with loss is secondary to<br>colonisation if it's not just about<br>being poor and<br>it is about your whole place in society<br>and and what it does to your identity<br>and your pride and your face and your<br>position within the family and within<br>society and though the more you are<br>together the safety you are the more<br>isolated you are the harder it is<br>communal loss of power and autonomy<br>fewer ways for individuals to access<br>resources and to solve difficulties in<br>leads where I come from the audit it was<br>brilliantly done it was brilliantly done<br>and on the front what you'll find very<br>rarely for a policy document is<br>something relating to men but you can<br>see that over the years 2008 9 when it<br>was last done 2011 13 female suicide<br>actually hasn't changed<br>mens suicide has gone up and now five<br>times more men in leads are committing<br>suicide than women and this is these<br>blocks of flats in in armed ly 85% of<br>the occupants of those flats are males<br>this is social housing because they're<br>not deemed vulnerable and you wouldn't<br>put a young pregnant girl with up in<br>that one of the tops of these flats you<br>put the men up there and you have low<br>self-esteem low self-worth you have high<br>levels of depression high levels of drug<br>addiction and so what we've had to do is<br>we have to have to think completely<br>rethink about how we safeguard these men<br>to safeguard these men that everyone<br>else sees as being invisible by putting<br>services into the SIRT into the flats to<br>try and save them from the drug<br>distribution because there's no doubt<br>for a lot of men seeking help is<br>actually a threat you say well why don't<br>you just ask well it is loss of status<br>its loss of autonomy of control it's a<br>feeling of incompetent it's a feeling of<br>dependence it's a it's a damage to my<br>identity so we've got to get around that<br>and actually what we're finding in in<br>the UK is is groups forming of men and<br>his man club he was a rugby player he<br>was it was committed almost had he had a<br>suicide attempt but it was stopped I<br>can't remember<br>that story now so he decided he was just<br>going to get his mates together so he<br>got his mates together and they started<br>talking and then someone else found out<br>but and so they've now got these groups<br>opening up all around and people say men<br>don't talk they do talk it's hard to<br>shut them up you get them in the right<br>place at the right time and they feel<br>they will not be laughed at<br>they'll not be stigmatized they will be<br>listened to with respect they will share<br>and nurses and doctors you hear things<br>for every health professionals get in a<br>person in front of them you will often<br>hear things they will not have told<br>anybody else ever very very powerful<br>position for a nurse or health<br>professional to be in but these clubs<br>are showing that actually men will just<br>come together by themselves organize<br>themselves and do stuff together we've<br>now got walking groups in Leeds and<br>doctors are prescribing walking groups<br>has been a more effective cure for<br>isolation and loneliness and depression<br>than giving them a tablet we have calm<br>can campaign against living miserably<br>lots of online stuff particularly<br>focused on two men we've got the New<br>Zealand Men's Health Network doing great<br>work in in broadcasting to men there are<br>alternatives you've got rugby players<br>that are now showing that men it's okay<br>to talk mates cafe and this is one<br>that's specifically designed for the<br>Maori population and the Men's Shed<br>people laugh about the Men's Shed but my<br>goodness that is a lifesaver it's not a<br>Health Initiative it is an initiative<br>which brings men together and it gives<br>them the covert intimacy<br>shoulder-to-shoulder not face-to-face<br>which actually will give them the space<br>to to be with other men in a safe<br>environment and they are talking about<br>all sorts in in when I was in Australia<br>they had the shed which was a Maori not<br>married it was an Aboriginal shed not<br>making things but it was a place where<br>they came together and in that place<br>services came to them family lawyers and<br>a finance guy<br>people and it had a tremendous impact on<br>giving the men a sense of belonging<br>within a society there are calls for for<br>men's masculinity to be managed better<br>and this is the APA guidelines<br>psychological process and it says it's<br>important to recognize that certain<br>masculine traits can be helpful but<br>others are damaging and and the the boy<br>the Gillette anyone who's not seen the<br>Gillette film about the toxic<br>masculinity and how we should be<br>reframing masculinity has had a lot of<br>backlash from a lot of men's groups<br>saying how dare you start to argue that<br>we should be changing our ways and it's<br>a very difficult one and a lot of men<br>are very confused than me to hashtag me<br>to movement has left a lot of men thing<br>on earth can I say what can I do what is<br>it safe and it's a whole whole if there<br>was ever a a call for better education<br>of our boys on relationships and what is<br>normal and what is not normal and that's<br>it and in agriculture we've got to move<br>to a different form of masculinity so<br>what success have we got we've got<br>improved public health we've got the<br>success of statins and health checks<br>we've got improved survival we've got<br>fewer men smoking we've got safer cars<br>we've got health and safety at work so<br>actually society is doing a lot to<br>improve the health of men but we have to<br>be working harder progress needs to be<br>faster to keep up with the demographic<br>and social changes men need to be<br>healthier and live safer lives<br>Healthcare is getting more expensive and<br>different challenges are emerging all<br>the time and one of the things that we<br>came up with as one of our conclusions<br>from this report is there needs to be a<br>make a concerted effort made to address<br>the causes of the health challenges men<br>face to tackle men's physical and mental<br>health action is required at the<br>structural level of service provision in<br>reaching out and targeting men more<br>effectively and also at the societal<br>level<br>we've got to get up into that meta meta<br>room the meta frame addressing the<br>social determinants of health so we can<br>we can see how changes that are<br>occurring impact on men and not be<br>frightened to say we need to think about<br>what the implications are for men and we<br>need to start naming men within policy<br>and strategy so this is not just a<br>health service initiative this is a<br>educational initiative this is a<br>workplace initiatives this is a law<br>court initiatives this is everywhere<br>sport has to take its own the whole of<br>the every sector has to be thinking<br>about what are the implications of<br>enabling this guy in the center here to<br>have a life and not a death so here we<br>have the ending they're the ones who are<br>vulnerable they're the ones we need to<br>be thinking of because they are the ones<br>who are the fathers the the husbands the<br>partners the the workers the everybody<br>is actually directly impacted on because<br>of their health so to finish why focus<br>on men's health because poor men's<br>health impacts across society such<br>variation in men's health means this is<br>not a biological inevitability and we<br>have to make men's health visible and an<br>issue that cannot be avoided and there's<br>a clear need to have greater emphasis on<br>the health of men in policy practice<br>research and education thank you very<br>much<br>never heard of that one no no no never<br>heard of that one I mean oh the medics<br>in the room might be but I've never<br>heard of that one there's talk of male<br>menopause and testosterone reduction and<br>there are some men that definitely have<br>low testosterone and they become<br>lethargic and overweight and and all<br>sorts of problems and they do need<br>testosterone replacement therapy but the<br>talk of a proper male menopause as<br>there's various studies that have looked<br>at it and not really found much worth<br>but there are definitely some men who<br>are impacted on by by their low<br>yeah that's a real anxiety over how do<br>you do social marketing two men do you<br>use the stereotypes to draw them in or<br>do you give them a different way are the<br>sheds just reinforcing separateness and<br>misogynistic and social we find that not<br>the case we're finding actually that<br>there are the the guys just coming<br>together in a way that we would the<br>problem for a lot of older older women<br>or all the women is that they're certain<br>we're not a problem but it's good a lot<br>of services that women access are very<br>much more focused on to women so we<br>don't say that women joining different<br>women's groups are reinforcing feminine<br>plates within society we're just saying<br>that's where they're meeting up and it's<br>stopping social isolation etc so at the<br>moment we're fairly confident that if<br>they're run right then it can be<br>positive if it's not run right then<br>actually it can be very limited and the<br>other point about it is it will work for<br>some men it's like the weight loss<br>groups that we've been running in the UK<br>some of them will work very well for<br>some men other men gay men may not think<br>they want to join in that group because<br>they feel as though they'll be excluded<br>so therefore we should be thinking about<br>well so how we're going to meet their<br>needs do we need a specific group for<br>the gay men and that that and so we<br>we've got to be more selective in choice<br>they I'm not actually an advisor we<br>worked with the Europe I led the<br>European Commission stated men's health<br>report and and actually one of the<br>things that was most disheartening and<br>yet we and and this is where we still<br>got a lot of work to do is that we<br>produce that report and it went nowhere<br>the World Health Organization we've now<br>got a strategy for men's health across<br>the 53 countries of the European region<br>including Russia Kazakhstan right the<br>way down what's happened since almost<br>nothing and the reason is that<br>government don't cement health as a<br>priority so they're not fighting for it<br>we don't have men on the streets arguing<br>for men's health<br>we don't have women's health was very<br>much part of a political movement really<br>to regain control or to gain control of<br>reproduction and suchlike<br>whereas for men they've never had that<br>they've never had that and so there's an<br>awful lot of silence around men's health<br>that makes it extremely difficult for us<br>to get movement on a global scale that's<br>why I think Leeds is so forward-thinking<br>because we're now my job next year is to<br>help them think through how do we<br>integrate the Men's Health Report the<br>women's health report so the public<br>health becomes more gender sensitive and<br>well yeah absolutely well there are not<br>many cities that are taking on Island<br>has got a men's health policy which is<br>which is being it's been extremely<br>useful because we have a general gender<br>equality which means that it's illegal<br>not to consider the needs of the of the<br>groups whereas the island and Australia<br>and I think Iran are forming one and<br>Brazil have got a men's health policy<br>which is actually giving structured<br>guidance as to how they should be<br>meeting the needs of men but there's not<br>many other cities that have done what<br>we've done yeah yeah no it's it's it's<br>it's I'm not an expert on on no I can't<br>I'm not going to stand here<br>authority talking about the drugs aspect<br>but it but it is it's a great anxiety<br>over a there is young men's brains are<br>are under a lot of scrutiny at the<br>moment should I say the youth justice<br>work is that what they're realizing the<br>the the boys brain and then the 18 to 25<br>brain there's more similarity between<br>the 18 to 25 year olds brain male brain<br>and boyhood than adulthood and so we're<br>getting so we're getting a lot of lads<br>are still not being out really able to<br>see that the implication of their<br>actions on other people it's part of the<br>neural linkages that are still forming<br>at that age and and the the difficulties<br>they've got in when you add on top of<br>that drugs it becomes a much more toxic<br>relationship and alcohol and risk-taking<br>it's really interesting yeah<br>maybe<br>I I think you've got a whole raft of<br>different things going on across society<br>and and some men are very much<br>we-we is another session starting are</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
