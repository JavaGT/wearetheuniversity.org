Thomas burns he is<br>well known of course as the nephew of<br>the great poet Robbie Burns but he was a<br>very important figure in early Oh Tago<br>he was the principal minister for the<br>Otago colony he was also the first<br>Chancellor for our University and he is<br>the great-great-great grandfather of our<br>current chancellor dr. Gordon Somerville<br>the establishment of the University is<br>inextricably linked with the development<br>of the city of Dunedin and the province<br>of Otago Otago of course was established<br>as a colony in 1848<br>there was a distinctive understanding of<br>the role of Education in early Otago a<br>vision that was shaped by the religious<br>and cultural wedlock of the Scottish<br>colonists most of whom were free church<br>Presbyterians they saw education as a<br>foundation stone for their faith for the<br>routines of civilized life and also for<br>the progress of society and Scotland<br>education was relatively open and it was<br>available to individuals from a range of<br>backgrounds and part this was because<br>Scottish universities were important<br>training grounds for the clergy but it<br>also reflected a strong practical<br>orientation as well<br>we are training and the sciences was<br>valued for its utility in terms of<br>agriculture and industry and we're legal<br>and medical training was also held and<br>very high regard the idea of a<br>university seemed distant in the early<br>years of Otago the population grew<br>slowly resources were limited and it was<br>a struggle to develop Dunedin itself as<br>the roads were choked with mud and the<br>infrastructure was rudimentary the<br>discovery of large gold deposits in 1861<br>radically changed things colonists<br>flooded into the region gold made the<br>young colony energetic and Restless<br>everything sped up the city grew rapidly<br>colonists established new workshops<br>factories and stores banks and insurance<br>companies supported the growth of trade<br>and shipping and churches and<br>educational institutions proliferators<br>the establishment of a university was<br>seen as key to promoting advanced<br>knowledge and the proficiency to<br>sciences and in the arts graduates were<br>specialist skills were needed for an<br>increasingly complex colonial society<br>the idea of developing a university<br>gained greater currency in the mid 1860s<br>with some strong support from leaders in<br>Otago like the provincial superintendent<br>James McAndrew and from Thomas burns<br>many other public leaders were skeptical<br>one parliamentarian dismissed the idea<br>is absurd when the central government<br>concluded that New Zealand was not yet<br>ready for university leaders in Otago<br>decided to go at alone many Otago<br>colonists were supportive and so was the<br>Presbyterian Church it agreed to fund<br>two of the four foundation<br>professorships here at the university ho<br>Tao goes provincial government passed an<br>ordinance on the 3rd of June 1869 to<br>establish the universe<br>much work had to be done to actually<br>create a working University the<br>professor's had to be hired and<br>convinced to relocate to the far edge of<br>the British Empire a building needed to<br>be fixed upon courses of study had to be<br>agreed and of course students had to be<br>recruited the university was conjured<br>into being really swiftly out of the<br>ideas debates and the incredible energy<br>of a cohort of community leaders who saw<br>education as a powerful engine that<br>would drive the colony forward the<br>teaching at the university was in the<br>Scottish soil based on lectures by the<br>professors the expertise of those first<br>professors also echoed Scottish<br>universities with classics philosophy<br>and mathematics were emphasized but it<br>also reflected a colonial interest in<br>making the most of natural resources and<br>the fourth chair here was in the Natural<br>Sciences the ordinance that established<br>the University in 1869 was explicit and<br>stating that all classes and<br>denominations of people were welcome the<br>proponents of the creation of this<br>university were influenced by the<br>egalitarianism of Presbyterianism and<br>they were consciously setting themselves<br>against English models which barred<br>certain religious denominations and also<br>which favored the sons of the elite the<br>importance of our Scottish connections<br>are symbolized by the Ellen Burstyn that<br>sits in the heart of our Dunedin campus<br>when the university opened in July 1871<br>there were 81 students and they were<br>from a range of social backgrounds they<br>were not all rich and most of them<br>worked as well as studying but they were<br>unified by two things they were all men<br>and they were all parkia or of European<br>descent<br>colonial woman were very keen to study<br>there had been a vigorous campaign to<br>establish a secondary school for girls<br>in the city and that was a first in the<br>southern hemisphere a petition was<br>swiftly put together and in August 1871<br>with the University still when its<br>earliest infancy the University Council<br>agreed to admit woman women enrolled at<br>Otago from 1872 and an 1885 we had our<br>first female graduate Carolyn Freeman in<br>1896<br>Emily Soderbergh became New Zealand's<br>first female medical graduate and in the<br>following year<br>Ethel Benjamin was the first woman to<br>graduate with a Bachelor of Laws by 1900<br>Otago had produced 58 female graduates<br>in the 20th century and especially from<br>the late 1960s on many more women<br>enrolled now approximately 60% of our<br>students are female the colonial nature<br>of our University was undoubtedly a<br>significant barrier to Maori students<br>enrolling while T&amp;E jack tile or a<br>renowned nighttime sportsman from an<br>influential family studied in the 1880s<br>and played rugby for the university and<br>cricket it was not until 1904 that we<br>had our first Maori graduate q Danny<br>Hillier or Peter Buck Tim Donaghy Laura<br>had a very distinguished career as a<br>doctor and as an anthropologist working<br>in Hawaii and also at Yale University we<br>are very proud to have a residential<br>college that bears his name and in fact<br>he left his mark here on one of the<br>benches that adorns the wall of air<br>council chamber noise our families<br>provided welcome and Nikita for many<br>Maori students but at<br>the University a long time to begin to<br>recognize the importance of Maori to<br>support to sustain teaching of Terrell<br>Maori and Maori culture and to begin to<br>adequately recognized Nita who finally<br>special status as monofin or we now work<br>very hard to support Maori students to<br>encourage tutorial and multi takuna as<br>part of the fabric of university life<br>and to build strong connections and<br>relationships with Yui and a range of<br>community organizations those<br>commitments are only going to become<br>more significant as we move into the<br>future to my mind the transformations we<br>have seen in the last two to three<br>decades are very significant with the<br>establishment of T to MU which is our<br>school of Maori Pacific and Indigenous<br>Studies with the work of the Maori<br>Centre with taeho kimitaka and the<br>office of Maori development these<br>initiatives have marked a very<br>substantial move away from our colonial<br>origins and they will play an<br>increasingly significant role as we move<br>students from the Pacific were also<br>drawn to Otago following on from our<br>first Pacific student journey Tom Dodi<br>from Fiji who enrolled in 1929 a number<br>of scholars from the Pacific also<br>studied Otago before going on to notable<br>political careers<br>these included commerce' Samarra who<br>served as the Prime Minister and then<br>president of Fiji for over two decades<br>and also Tom Davis who became prime<br>minister of the Cook Islands from the<br>1970s growing numbers of New Zealand<br>born students of Pacific descent began<br>to enroll at the University<br>Pacifica students and those students who<br>come to study at Otago from across the<br>Pacific region are now an integral part<br>of the University we are proud of the<br>great support that they get from the<br>universities Pacific Island Center and<br>from the office of Pacific development<br>we are working hard to build our<br>connections within and across Tim l1 and<br>Nui Akua answer more fully realized the<br>opportunities that come from our own<br>Pacific location international students<br>have also become more important with<br>time at Otago and again they have<br>transformed our University in the 1960s<br>and the 1970s significant groups of<br>students arrived from both Asia and from<br>Africa Asian connections grew from the<br>1990s but Otago also has very strong<br>links to Europe and North America as<br>well today<br>our university is truly global with more<br>than two and a half thousand<br>international students from over 100<br>countries the changing face of our<br>student population echoes the border<br>transformation of the University we have<br>traveled a long way from 1869 new areas<br>of study and professional programs have<br>been established<br>innovative areas of research have been<br>opened up and the structure of the<br>university has shifted over time the<br>university has always been dynamic<br>needing to respond to changes and<br>research methods shifts and forms of<br>teaching technological innovations<br>changing government funding and new<br>patterns of student interest the<br>university has become a lot larger and<br>more complex<br>we've gone from 81 students in 1871 to<br>20,000 today our staff here at the<br>University are incredibly international<br>many come from overseas or they like me<br>though New Zealanders was postgraduate<br>qualifications from abroad we have also<br>became a truly national university with<br>our campuses in Christchurch and<br>Wellington becoming very very important<br>parts of Otago we also have significant<br>centres for teaching and outreach and<br>Invercargill in Auckland and our<br>students carry out research and they are<br>on placements throughout New Zealand and<br>in a wide number of countries<br>internationally the physical footprint<br>of the University has changed markedly<br>initially teaching was carried out from<br>a site on Princess Street and the centre<br>of the young city we only moved here to<br>our current main site in Dunedin in 1879<br>in that year the registry building was<br>that signature clock tower came into use<br>it has become an icon of our University<br>but construction was difficult and there<br>were cost overruns our clock tower was<br>actually without a clock until 1930 only<br>then to Tk psy.d the university<br>chancellor who was well known as the<br>father of daylight saving in New Zealand<br>then he donated the funds for the clock<br>to be installed<br>sometimes good things do take time<br>developing a campus has frequently posed<br>challenges<br>government funding has often been<br>constrained and our resources scant<br>but we have managed those resources<br>carefully and that mindset has been<br>elaborated and refined as we now lead<br>the way in our commitment to<br>sustainability we can take real pride in<br>our campuses today in recent times our<br>Dunedin campus has been ranked as one of<br>the 15 most beautiful university<br>campuses in the world residential<br>colleges have been a feature of Otago<br>since the opening of the first College<br>selwyn in 1893 they became increasingly<br>prominent as the university grew in the<br>1960s and 70s you Nicole for example was<br>built in 1969 to mark the university<br>centenary today the colleges are not<br>only great places to live but they<br>provide top class academic and pastoral<br>support for students they are simply<br>integral to campus life for many young<br>people studying it at Otago is not only<br>a path to a great career but it's also a<br>rite of passage living in a residential<br>college sharing a flat with mates and<br>having a great time are key parts of the<br>Otago experience our students have<br>always been politically engaged<br>they've always been energetic and<br>enthusiastic they have embodied the<br>motto that the founders of our<br>University selected Sapir day all day<br>dare to be wise this comes from both the<br>Roman poet Horace and a great<br>enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant<br>it encourages us to recognize the<br>importance of education and to get to<br>work using the power of our intellects<br>to make sense of the world and to make<br>it a better place<br>I was an undergraduate student here at<br>Otago and the great teaching I received<br>from the history department changed my<br>life I care deeply about this University<br>I love teaching here doing research and<br>working here every day the University of<br>Otago has made a huge difference to my<br>family as a whole my parents were born<br>in the late 1920s just before the<br>depression World War two broke out<br>before they were teenagers and as a<br>result they both had limited educational<br>opportunities they also ended up having<br>a really big family on the youngest of<br>11 kids so my parents never had much<br>money but they clearly understood the<br>importance of reading and the great<br>value of education both to in ritual<br>life and to enhance your opportunities<br>as a result of their commitment almost<br>all of our family had some tertiary<br>education the majority of them here at<br>Otago there's no coincidence that most<br>of us then have carried on to become<br>educators of some kind those careers pay<br>the gift of Education forward to the<br>next generation that's my Otago story<br>but for each and every one of our<br>students all of our graduates and for<br>all of our current and former staff each<br>one of those have their own Otago<br>memories collectively those stories make<br>up the rich history of our University I<br>will encourage you to read Ellison<br>Clark's excellent new history of the<br>University which gave us together and<br>reflects upon those stories please also<br>participate in the 150th program there<br>is a host of alumni events in New<br>Zealand and around the world as well as<br>a sequence of celebrations here in<br>Dunedin and on our other campuses we<br>have a great deal to celebrate and even<br>more to look forward to the University<br>of Otago continues to develop our<br>connections within New Zealand and the<br>Pacific strength and the multiplied and<br>our global reach groves<br>the University will continue to change<br>and adapt and it will be fascinating to<br>see what the future holds<br>during 2019 there will be a lot of<br>reflection but also important<br>discussions about that future I would<br>encourage you to join in be part of<br>those conversations and enjoy the year<br>for here Kuro<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
