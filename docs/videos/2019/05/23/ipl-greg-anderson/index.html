Royden<br>Summerville who is also in the audience<br>this evening against a backdrop of an<br>incredibly busy day job Royden also does<br>an immense amount of service for us here<br>at the University of Otago and I think<br>it's particularly fantastic that he<br>makes time to come to these inaugural<br>professorial lectures so thank you and<br>thank you for being here right now in<br>addition to all these very special<br>guests as I look out on the audience<br>this evening I recognize many of you<br>there are staff and students from around<br>the University and members of the wider<br>Dunedin community and it is fantastic as<br>always to see so many of you here know<br>my head am I welcome so we've all<br>gathered here members of Greg's family<br>members of our university community and<br>members of the wider Dunedin community<br>to celebrate Greg's promotion to<br>professor<br>now as many of you know the pastor<br>professor here at the University of<br>Otago is not an easy one<br>it requires years and years of<br>excellence in teaching research and<br>service not only to the University but<br>to the wider community as well so as you<br>will learn this evening professor<br>Anderson is an effective and highly<br>motivating teacher and he is a very<br>popular postgraduate supervisor he<br>teaches both very large 100 level<br>courses here at the University of Otago<br>and also small 400 level seminars<br>he's also the past recipient of the<br>Health Sciences postgraduate supervisor<br>of the Year award professor Anderson is<br>also an outstanding researcher who has<br>made major contributions to research in<br>the area of brain regulation of<br>fertility and I'm sure that we will hear<br>quite a bit about that this evening and<br>last but not least professor Anderson<br>has provided sustained service not only<br>to his department but to the University<br>and at a national level as well so Greg<br>on behalf of the University of Otago it<br>gives me great pleasure to congratulate<br>you on your very well earned promotion<br>to Professor I will now call on<br>professor Vernon ward who will tell us<br>just a little bit more about Greg's<br>journey to Professor Noir era Tenneco<br>Thank You Vice Chancellor tena koutou<br>katoa<br>Aminu eat nak koto welcome everybody to<br>Professor Greg Anderson's inaugural<br>professorial lecture I sort of thank you<br>very much for coming along this evening<br>and celebrating this occasion with Greg<br>and with the rest of us here and it's<br>really it's a pinnacle of an academic<br>career to make your way to Professor and<br>these ones really earned that right it's<br>my role as the Dean of the school of<br>biomedical sciences to provide some<br>little bit of background information on<br>professor Anderson for you this evening<br>and his career to date for those who<br>aren't aware of his background<br>Greg ghada's was a graduate of the<br>lincoln university getting his bachelor<br>of agricultural science in 1993 and then<br>he went on to get his ph.d in 1998 and<br>this is something like she didn't know<br>myself was thetan was around neuro<br>endocrine control of reproduction and<br>red deer so it's a good link to here he<br>understood a postdoctoral took a<br>postdoctoral fellowship at the<br>University of West Virginia in the USA<br>and then he returned to New Zealand to<br>take up a foundation of research Science<br>and Technology postdoctoral fellowship<br>at Massey University in 2000 he came to<br>us here in Otago in 2002 and he was a<br>research fellow before becoming a<br>lecturer in 2007 and then subsequently<br>has progressed through senior lecturer<br>and associate professor to reach<br>professor today in this 20-year career<br>from attaining his PhD to becoming a<br>professor<br>the he's really worked this whole time<br>and neuroendocrinology and it's quite<br>appropriate and I make the point that is<br>not only in the department of anatomy<br>he's also in the center for<br>neuroendocrinology one of our top flight<br>research centres here at the university<br>he's been extremely successful in<br>gaining research funding he's had<br>near-continuous marsden funding as a<br>principal investigator since 2003 and<br>there's not many that can say that he's<br>received as PA HRC project grants he's<br>been an associate investigator and<br>multiple HSE program so he owes projects<br>and he's on a number of other research<br>funding as well as h-index is 29 with<br>over 2,800 citations in 56 journal<br>publications and you can see the<br>strength of those publications is there<br>sitting there and<br>neuroendocrinology endocrinology Journal<br>of Neuroscience core contributions to<br>his field with a substantive body of<br>work consistent with that focus<br>professor Anderson is currently<br>president of the New Zealand in a<br>chronological Society and he's on the<br>Editorial Board of the Journal of<br>endocrinology at present and has served<br>under a number of the editorial boards<br>in the related field he supervises over<br>30 postgraduate students and as the Vice<br>Chancellor pointed out he was voted the<br>Health Sciences postgraduate supervisor<br>of the year in 2011 but I do want to<br>draw a little bit more as already<br>mentioned on his service to the<br>department and to this University he<br>teaches widely in anatomy neuroscience<br>and into the medical program he's the<br>deputy head of department of anatomy<br>which is an incredibly large and complex<br>department where he oversees the<br>teaching through that department and<br>that's a substantive role here's the<br>chair of the H tau academic advisory<br>committee he's the chair of the I arms<br>process group he's the member of the RSF<br>building executive planning team and he<br>served on the University of Otago Animal<br>Ethics Committee so he's contributed a<br>lot of his time here when asked to<br>describe his research what he's got his<br>big picture goal his big picture goal is<br>the development of new improved<br>treatments for infertility and anxiety<br>related disorders both of which are<br>unseen conditions experienced by a large<br>proportion of modern societies so<br>hopefully a big picture fits with what<br>you're going to present and for this IPO<br>it's going to explore the neuronal and<br>hormonal mechanisms that coordinate to<br>drive ovulation you look at the lack of<br>ovulation due to either too much or too<br>little fat and the lack of ovulation due<br>to stress and the idea here is to<br>explore and find workable treatment<br>options for these conditions with that<br>I'd like professor Anderson to present<br>his inaugural professor or lecture and I<br>just want to thank him for a nice<br>tongue-twisting title to work me over at<br>the end here female fertility<br>fundamentally faithful yet frequently<br>fickle so nor a Latina to me he<br>kata-kata tena koutou tena koutou tena<br>Gina koto katoa<br>call Greg Anderson Taku Inga Thank You<br>professor Haines and ward for your kind<br>words of introduction thank you also to<br>my head of department professor Mehta to<br>Smith for being here and also professor<br>Blakey professor Squires and professor<br>Nicholson Vice Chancellor Chancellor and<br>to all of you for coming along thank you<br>very much gives me great pleasure to<br>have both friends and colleagues and<br>family here today special thanks to all<br>those who traveled to be here makes it<br>special for me so for my parents and<br>grandparents infertility was never an<br>issue and this is um so this is my<br>mother's family my mother was the<br>youngest of seven here she was born deep<br>in the south and the Catlins and I'd<br>like to think of my mother as it would<br>be academic she she was always loved<br>books ducks of her school I think you<br>were two students in who year at awake a<br>high but you know the university study<br>was never really an option for my mother<br>at that time and so my mother was a<br>teacher aide and a nurse aide and of<br>course the mother of my family my father<br>was also the youngest a more moderate<br>sized family so this is my father here<br>the youngest of his brood as well I<br>never described my father as an academic<br>he dropped out of high school just as<br>soon as he could and yet and so dead<br>couldn't be here today dad's in hospital<br>with advanced Parkinson's and and<br>although you know books were never my<br>dad's thing<br>even when his brain was ravaged by<br>Parkinson's my dad was the person you<br>would go to for the spelling of a<br>difficult word what 13 times 45 is<br>how to solve a crossword puzzle he was<br>always the fastest of these things so I<br>think academic ability comes in many<br>shapes and sizes and dad would have<br>loved to have been here he also you know<br>he could also play me under the table<br>for table tennis even when he got to the<br>stage where he couldn't bend down and<br>pick up the ball so some things are just<br>retained in the brain this is the family<br>that my mother and father raised so I'm<br>this one here if you can't still<br>recognize me and so you can see that you<br>know infertility was still not a problem<br>even at that stage and my brother Craig<br>is here today so welcome and this is my<br>family so this is my wife Vivian my son<br>Finlay my daughter Lydia and my son<br>Lewis and they're all here today come<br>from as far as Auckland and Wellington<br>to be here so it's great to have you all<br>here for this lecture thanks very much<br>so three generations of Anderson's<br>represented in these photos so I need to<br>give you just a little bit of background<br>and I don't want to make this too heavy<br>on science but you need to know just<br>enough to be able to get you through<br>some of the some of the science that I'm<br>going to present later on so here's a<br>little bit of background to the control<br>of female fertility most people<br>understand fertility to be controlled by<br>the gonads so in the female of course<br>that's the ovaries and so during the<br>first half of the cycle there's a clutch<br>maybe 20 of eggs that begin to grow and<br>only one of them will make it to the<br>stage where it's a large or the egg<br>doesn't change that much this is the egg<br>here but the little bubble around it's<br>called the follicle and only one of them<br>will make it to that large stage by mid<br>cycle as it grows it releases estrogens<br>and they are critical to the control of<br>the events that happen at that time and<br>to follow and at that time at mid cycle<br>the egg ovulates<br>and the cells that are left behind all<br>these cells here they left behind form a<br>new structure on the ovary called the<br>corpus luteum<br>the egg is released into the fallopian<br>tubes here perhaps it will meet with a<br>sperm and be fertilized and implants in<br>the uterus but the structure that's left<br>behind begins to secrete a different<br>hormone called progesterone and<br>progesterone dominates the last half of<br>the cycle it's easily measured as<br>evidence hormonal evidence that<br>ovulation has happens and I'll show you<br>plenty of examples of cycles where you<br>can see progesterone going up and down<br>and you can read there as evidence that<br>ovulation has happened is a picture of<br>ovulation happening I think this is in a<br>rhesus monkey on the cover of a recent<br>endocrine magazine and you can see the<br>rupture of the ovary here the egg being<br>released along with all these cells<br>around it this is a short video of human<br>ovulation that has just happened and<br>you'll see the egg here just in the<br>process of being released and being<br>picked up by these little fingers which<br>will guide it into the fallopian tube so<br>you can see the mess of rupture that<br>happens it's a bit frightening to see<br>this on the ovary and the egg is<br>released and it's hanging on by a mucous<br>plug and it's guided into the fallopian<br>tube by these little fingers called from<br>brain well well that's all integral to<br>my research this is not actually where I<br>target my research yet I'm a<br>neuroendocrinologist and so for me<br>control of reproduction it was all about<br>what happens here and a small part of<br>the brain called the hypothalamus and a<br>little bland underneath it called the<br>pituitary gland hypothalamus pituitary<br>gland and so these are the parts of the<br>brain and the gland under it which<br>direct the events that are happening<br>down here below the belt and and when I<br>say they direct it you can argue that it<br>starts at either in because it's a cycle<br>these hormones feed back on the events<br>that happen at the brain so the<br>pituitary gland here releases<br>hormone called luteinizing hormone and<br>these are just some little windows into<br>what happens throughout the cycle early<br>on in the cycle the pulses are not too<br>fast quite large pulses towards mid<br>cycle they get faster smaller but faster<br>and they eventually culminate in a<br>massive surge release of LH and this is<br>the central events for a<br>neuroendocrinologist of the cycle and<br>it's I always try and tell my students<br>not to call these surges and not to call<br>this pulses because they're<br>fundamentally different so this is a<br>surge these are pulses and preps the<br>problem is that the word surges have but<br>understated someone recently and a<br>article I was reading described this as<br>a luteinizing hormone tsunami so I'm<br>going to refer to it as a tsunami so<br>that you don't get mixed up between<br>surges and pulses like my students do<br>and after the tsunami this is the thing<br>that drives ovulation you need these<br>massive amounts of luteinizing hormone<br>in order for this egg to be ovulated and<br>after that LH pulses return to a much<br>more slow drawn-out state now most of<br>the time this whole system is kept<br>relatively controlled and under<br>homeostasis thanks to the feedback<br>effects from these steroids and they<br>they have negative effects on<br>controlling the secretions of<br>luteinizing hormone and so that works<br>well for homeostasis because every time<br>LH starts to get too high it drives an<br>increase in the release of these<br>steroids and they dampen things down<br>again and it keeps it nice and stable<br>but perhaps you can see that that's not<br>what's happening here at mid-cycle the<br>level of these extra genes are getting<br>really high thanks to this large<br>follicle that's releasing massive<br>amounts of estrogen and yet at the same<br>time we're building up to this LH<br>tsunami so somehow the negative feedback<br>has broken down and there's a remarkable<br>switch to positive feedback we're<br>instead of inhibiting these events this<br>here drives this event and just how the<br>brain can switch it States and its<br>response to this hormone in just a<br>matter of hours is a remarkable<br>phenomenon<br>we are still slowly beginning to<br>understand but I'd say we're a long way<br>off it yet so for neuroendocrinologist<br>reproductive neuroendocrinologist this<br>is really the central wonder of our<br>lives perhaps how this event happens<br>it's easily measured so you can if you<br>know what time to sample you can measure<br>this evidence that ovulation is about to<br>happen and even in humans I was in the<br>supermarket the other day and you can<br>buy little urine tests Achatz so<br>metabolites of this hormone luteinizing<br>hormone are available are detectable in<br>the urine and you can you can check with<br>her ovulation has happened simply by a<br>single sample obviously you would never<br>get this profile you get a smiley face<br>if ovulation has happens and and looks<br>that's what's happening at the pituitary<br>gland higher up here in the hypothalamus<br>there are a small set of neurons and<br>they're called ganado troph and<br>releasing hormones that are mirroring<br>the effects of these in fact they're<br>driving all the effects of these and so<br>these are neurons but they secrete their<br>product into the bloodstream so they're<br>actually making a hormone that's why<br>they're called ganado troph and<br>releasing hormone neurons and they'll be<br>every pulse of this LH will be driven by<br>a pulse of GnRH the surge tsunami sorry<br>will be driven by a tsunami of GnRH but<br>it's much harder to measure because<br>these are brain neurons and they only<br>secrete a tiny amount of their peptide<br>it does make its way into the<br>bloodstream but only a little local<br>blood stream that links the hypothalamus<br>and pituitary gland and so it's<br>extremely difficult to measure these<br>things but in the species that have been<br>done and it doesn't include humans it<br>exactly measures these effects of these<br>patterns of luteinizing hormone all<br>these profiles here are samples that<br>i've taken throughout my career and none<br>of them actually are from woman in fact<br>I don't think I've knowingly blood<br>sample to human being ever before so all<br>my research is based on animal models<br>and yet the aim the wider aim<br>as professor ward said the wider aim is<br>to become more educators about human<br>fertility how its controlled how it goes<br>wrong so that we can develop better<br>treatments and I operates well back from<br>there and perhaps the people other than<br>me will take that information and<br>develop into clinical trials but never<br>less the build-up of knowledge based up<br>on these animal models contributes to<br>that wider goal so it it is amazing that<br>such a complex thing that involves<br>temple timing as well as multiple<br>different layers from the brain down to<br>the ovaries can work so faithfully just<br>about every time and so women can cycle<br>every month for their entire<br>reproductive life just like clockwork<br>many woman will have this suppressed<br>because of the contraceptive pill for<br>much of the reproductive life and they<br>can stop taking that pill and the very<br>next cycle they can get pregnant so<br>that's why as I think about that I think<br>it's a remarkably faithful system and it<br>amazes me that it works so very well but<br>that's cold comfort perhaps for those<br>many couples who struggle with<br>infertility and it's a surprising amount<br>up to a quarter of couples in New<br>Zealand as well as other parts of the<br>world experienced infertility definers<br>not being able to conceive after five<br>years of trying it's a silent problem<br>people don't tend to declare their<br>infertility and others perhaps just<br>think they don't want to have kids but<br>it's a distressing state to be and not<br>to be able to conceive so it's a it's a<br>big problem about 50 million couples are<br>unable to have a child after five years<br>of trying and sadly is someone who works<br>doing research in this area we've been<br>able to do very little to change these<br>statistics over the last three decades<br>we have IVF of course and it's wonderful<br>for the few people to whom it's<br>available but on a population level this<br>high level of infertility has stayed the<br>same for decades<br>and there's been few real breakthroughs<br>so it's a big problem well I'm going to<br>give you three little stories or<br>vignettes that spend the things that<br>I've been doing throughout my career and<br>the first one is about a type of<br>infertility that's really nothing to do<br>with humans and yet there's things we<br>can learn from that that might have<br>relevance to ourselves so as Professor<br>Ward said I began my research looking at<br>seasonal patterns of reproduction that<br>served time the birth of the young to<br>the appropriate season for the survival<br>of a baby whatever and it's been called<br>nature's contraceptive by someone other<br>than me<br>the next story I want to tell you about<br>is the links between nutrition and<br>fertility which is perhaps an increasing<br>problem and our current generation and<br>the last one is the links between stress<br>and fertility again a very common<br>problem and we've been working on<br>establishing what the links are that<br>that might bring about infertility<br>because of these dates so let's start<br>with number one so this was work that I<br>did as part of my PhD actually before I<br>get to that this is some background that<br>was done around about the same time to<br>help you understand how seasonal<br>reproduction works so this is data from<br>New Zealand so you don't have to think<br>about changing the hemispheres but India<br>which I did my PhD research on they<br>become fertile around about April when<br>days are getting shorter this time of<br>year now and you can tell that from<br>these because you can see that there are<br>cycles of progesterone going up and down<br>about every two weeks and this is the<br>length of the cycle of a rare deer so<br>every one of these as you now know as<br>evidence that ovulation has occurred and<br>it's happening in the rear deer here<br>eight times just like clockwork<br>unbelievably faithful and then it stops<br>as the day start to get longer and<br>spring approaches it stops and so this<br>is in in the absence of the high on<br>getting pregnant which is probably an<br>unusual situation on either<br>on farms or in the wild this animal just<br>continued a cycle but only throughout<br>the winter and the same in many other<br>species of deer so I think the clockwork<br>of this system is a remarkable<br>demonstration of the faithfulness of<br>reproduction not only that it occurs<br>with such wonderful regularity but the<br>fact that it starts and stops and every<br>animal in this experiment had almost<br>exactly the same timing of reproduction<br>so it's a fascinating thing to study for<br>the faithfulness of the control of<br>reproduction so I began my PhD research<br>and completed it under the supervision<br>of dr. Graham Burrell at Lincoln<br>University little University just south<br>of Christchurch and Graham Burrell was<br>one of my undergraduate lecturers and I<br>always think of him fondly when in my<br>own teaching because he's an example of<br>a guy that can inspire you and his<br>undergraduate teaching and it was during<br>those undergraduate years and his<br>classes during my Bachelor of<br>agricultural science that I determined<br>that I didn't want to be a farm advisor<br>or anything else that I could have<br>become with that undergraduate degree<br>but I wanted to study reproductive<br>physiology and it was because of his<br>passion for his subject and so if I can<br>impart some of that to my students I<br>think I'll be doing well so the<br>background to the story comes before I<br>came along<br>and Graham was doing some work with a<br>previous student of hers who was looking<br>at the role of the parathyroid glands<br>and the thyroid glands bearded in the<br>neck and the role that they had in I'm<br>not sure what they were studying to be<br>honest but the studies involved removal<br>of the thyroid glands and the animals<br>remain remarkably healthy and I guess<br>they got their results but one thing<br>that they noticed along the way that<br>completely surprised them all was that<br>while the normal animals went through<br>the typical cycles that you may be aware<br>of that deer do of body growth antler<br>growth antler hardening shooting their<br>antlers<br>and so on the animals that had had their<br>thyroid glands removed did not they also<br>remained remarkably healthy but once<br>they got into this state where there you<br>can see their larger body size the hard<br>antlers you can perhaps imagine that<br>this animals attitude is targeted 100%<br>to mating and the other hundred percent<br>are fighting off other rivals they<br>stayed in that state for as long as the<br>experiment went on and remarkably they<br>never made the transition to the States<br>and it was like whatever it is in the<br>brain presumably that switched them from<br>their breeding state to their<br>non-breeding state failed to happen<br>there was a remarkable chance<br>observation so I began my PhD with<br>Graham Burrell investigating whether<br>thyroid hormones are critical for that<br>kind of transition in female animals and<br>we had looked at the profile of thyroid<br>hormones this is t3 the active form of<br>the thyroid hormones and although it's a<br>bit up and down you can see that it<br>increases here as the summer months<br>approached and it Peaks just before<br>midsummer<br>and we wondered whether these increasing<br>levels of thyroid hormones might be the<br>thing that drives the animal to some<br>somehow changed the neuronal wiring of<br>its brain so that it could enter the<br>non-breeding states as I showed you in<br>those previous graphs so our treatment<br>involved removal of the thyroid glands<br>and again the animals remain remarkably<br>healthy and you can see that the iodine<br>levels were right down at sa detection<br>levels these are the animals and the<br>only thing you could notice just from<br>looking at them is that the<br>thyroidectomies animals retained the<br>course pale winter coat we had another<br>group of animals where we replaced<br>thyroid hormones so they were also<br>thyroidectomies and we replaced the<br>thyroid hormones<br>it's a classic endocrine old-school<br>endocrine experiment where you remove<br>the gland and replace the hormone that<br>you think is is the culprit and see if<br>you can revert the animals back to the<br>control States<br>so here are the results and these are<br>profiles of progesterone just like a pro<br>showed you before and every significant<br>episode of progesterone is evidence that<br>the animal has ovulate 'add so the<br>control animals just as I've shown you<br>in other data had these cycles right<br>until spring and then they stopped and<br>then progesterone was low throughout the<br>summer months no surprises there the big<br>surprising thing was all of the thyroid<br>ick demised animals bar one which we<br>have evidence had regrow and it's<br>thyroid gland all of them carried on<br>cycling for as long as we couldn't<br>measure for and this really blew us away<br>that the animals could not only stay<br>wonderfully healthy but actually stay in<br>their fertile state for as long as we<br>could measure them for so whatever<br>causes this transition is not active in<br>the absence of thyroid hormones and when<br>we replace the thyroid hormone thyroid<br>hormones we were able to terminate their<br>breeding season at exactly the same time<br>as the control so clearly these thyroid<br>hormones are needed for these seasonal<br>transitions here's another example of<br>these profiles of progesterone going up<br>and down each cycle and we were able to<br>show that the animals were able to be<br>mated and so most animals will only mate<br>just before ovulation and so we could<br>synchronize ovulation and some of these<br>animals and observe their mating<br>behavior so I spent long hours of my PhD<br>in this position with binoculars<br>observing mating behavior and rear deer<br>and these and these animals were able to<br>be mated even out of season and the<br>summer months some quite some challenges<br>getting the stag to be interested in<br>them and their time as well but it's<br>another story about how we achieved<br>there we could show in addition to these<br>episodes of progesterone we could show<br>that they have you lated by doing<br>ultrasound scanning and you can actually<br>see the corpus luteum that's evidence<br>that that ovulated<br>even out of season and we were able to<br>make them so I forgot to say but the<br>mating that we observed earlier on was<br>with a vasectomized male so that they we<br>wouldn't muck up our experiment and they<br>would continue to carry on going through<br>these cycles in their non pregnant<br>pregnant state but at the end of this<br>experiment we decided let's see if they<br>can get pregnant out of season and so we<br>put them with a fertile stag and this<br>rise in progesterone that just stays up<br>is evidence that they have become<br>pregnant and we were able to show that<br>with ultra on scanning this is an out of<br>season<br>conceived red deer fawn and here it is<br>here was born in July so we called it<br>Jules and it featured on TV three news I<br>think it's the first out of season born<br>deer that that wasn't born by<br>manipulating the length of day ever we<br>wanted to so that was all very well but<br>we wanted to know other mechanisms at<br>the level of the brain and the pituitary<br>gland that our drive and all these<br>things are they fundamentally dependent<br>on thyroid hormones as well and so in a<br>separate group of animals we measured<br>profiles of luteinizing hormone that<br>I've told you the driving factors for<br>all of these things and in our control<br>animals you can see luteinizing hormone<br>went down and became undetectable in<br>midsummer<br>this is profound and fertility much more<br>than you would see in a sheep or many<br>other seasonally breeding animals but<br>the thyroidectomies animals they<br>maintain high levels of luteinizing<br>hormone right throughout for as long as<br>we could measure and if you take a<br>window into if you put a magnifying<br>glass on different times and actually<br>take blood samples every 10 minutes for<br>these are for nine hours I have no idea<br>why I chose such a long period of time<br>but that's an extraordinary amount of<br>blood sampling to do you could see that<br>in both groups of animals the LH pulses<br>are going really fast indicator of<br>fertility and during the winter months<br>and in the control animals during the<br>summer<br>LH was completely undetectable no pulses<br>at all profound and fertility<br>but in these thorough dictum eyes<br>if anything the posters were bigger and<br>just as fast and clearly whatever in the<br>brain causes this transition hadn't<br>happened in these animals it was a<br>remarkable finding we thought well there<br>was the end of my PhD and after that I<br>went to do a postdoctoral research with<br>a guy called Bob Goodman in West<br>Virginia and so I went there with my<br>wife and newborn daughter at that stage<br>Lydia and we were bob was good enough to<br>allow me to spend half of my time doing<br>the kind of research he wanted to do in<br>his lab which wasn't too dissimilar to<br>this but also suspend half my time<br>following up on pretty much anything<br>that I wanted and so I was able to carry<br>on answering some of the questions that<br>had arisen during my PhD that I really<br>didn't have either the funding or the<br>tools to address at Lincoln University<br>so this is West Virginia's much colder<br>than Canterbury but there's some indoor<br>facilities there as well for the sheep<br>it didn't seem to keep them much warmer<br>so these are what I wanted to do while I<br>was there was to try and figure out just<br>we're in the brain and I presume that it<br>was in the brain that thyroid hormones<br>were acting to bring about these<br>remarkable changes and so anytime I show<br>you pictures like this I'll try and<br>indicate it with this cartoon that this<br>is a a coronal slice through the brain<br>to show you different parts of the brain<br>and so while I was in Bob's lab one of<br>the things I did was to replace thyroid<br>hormones right throughout the<br>hypothalamus from the front to the back<br>and we did this by lowering implants<br>down into our region of interest<br>violet also won each side and attempt<br>unto the end of these implants a small<br>amount of thyroid hormones that will<br>last there for a month or two and so in<br>thyroidectomies animals that aren't<br>undergoing any seasonal transitions we<br>can try and determine what site of the<br>brain it is that thyroid hormones are<br>bringing about these seasonal<br>transitions and maybe from there<br>begin the process of learning something<br>about Howard as they bring them about<br>and all of these diagrams each till<br>appear of dots or it presents the sites<br>that I put these implants in actual<br>sites based on sectioning the brains<br>afterwards and finding out where the<br>implants ended up and all the open dots<br>indicates implants that were completely<br>ineffective in restoring these animals<br>to the normal seasonal transitions so<br>anything with an open dot just remained<br>in the breeding States for as long as<br>the experiment ran for but these ones<br>here with the closed dots were the sites<br>where the implants were effective in<br>causing the end of the breeding season<br>and you can see there's two sites one is<br>here in the preoptic area close to a<br>region we call the ovo T and the other<br>site was here in the arcuate nucleus in<br>anywhere else even if we were aiming for<br>these sites but slightly misplaced our<br>implants which you can imagine happens<br>quite often none of those were effective<br>only when we got direct hits in these<br>two sites were the implants effective in<br>bringing out the transition to the end<br>of the animals breeding season so we<br>published this without really knowing<br>much about what was significant those<br>sites and we published that in 2003 and<br>I to my shame perhaps I only realized<br>just two or three days ago when I was<br>preparing this talk the significance of<br>this dates in relation to these sites<br>because in exactly the same year<br>reproductive neuroendocrinology which<br>turned on its head by two studies<br>published in prestigious journals at<br>almost the same time within a month of<br>each other and what these publications<br>showed was that in those exact two<br>regions of the brain where my thyroid<br>hormones implants were effective the<br>preoptic area near the OU VLT and the<br>arcuate nucleus lai neurons which<br>produce a chemical peptide called<br>keptin and it's only produced in these<br>two places and this peptide is the most<br>potent driver of fertility that's ever<br>been discovered and it holds huge<br>potential for treatments of infertility<br>and it's being therapies are being<br>worked up using keptin to drive<br>ovulation both in animals and humans but<br>in that exact same year that these were<br>published I was showing that thyroid<br>hormones are active in these sites of<br>the brain and the significance of that<br>completely eluded me at the time it's<br>only recently a colleague of mine in<br>France in 2016 showed that the neurons<br>which make keptin they have receptors<br>for thyroid hormones so this is a<br>technique called immunohistochemistry<br>where you can image the neurons of the<br>brain these keptin neurons and also<br>image thyroid hormone receptors and when<br>you merge them together you see that<br>they're overlaid what this means is that<br>these neurons are able to respond to<br>kiss pip them so presumably I was<br>delivering Kiptyn to these neurons they<br>were able to respond to it and bring<br>about the changes in fertility that kept<br>in neurons Drive so you know perhaps a<br>missed opportunity if I'd followed up on<br>my results perhaps I could have been<br>part of the wave that followed the<br>discovery of keptin but we can't live<br>our lives over again so others who have<br>carried on and this field have been at<br>been able to put all the molecular and<br>cellular steps together and they now<br>know that the changes in the length of<br>day that happen is springtime approaches<br>the days lengthen and that drives the<br>conversion of thyroid hormone from its<br>inactive form to its active form this is<br>the active form here and this active<br>form is able to bring about a remodeling<br>of neurons such as these keptin neurons<br>and genes changed the gene synthesis of<br>Skipton and bring about the non-breeding<br>states but there was left for others to<br>do and I came back to New Zealand and<br>moved into different fields and so I<br>want to move on to my second little<br>vignette<br>and this is work that I've conducted<br>here at the University of Otago it began<br>as a collaboration when I was working<br>for professor Dave Breton as part of his<br>lab but it's become an independent thing<br>which I've carried on throughout my<br>research career since that time and so<br>this story is about the link between the<br>level of nutrition and infertility and I<br>think we're all aware because it's been<br>drummed into us so often that we live in<br>the century and perhaps the last Tsar<br>for the century before we live in a time<br>where obesity has become an epidemic and<br>as well as all sorts of the effects of<br>metabolic syndrome that leads to it also<br>is highly correlated with infertility<br>both in males and females to the extent<br>that if a couple go to a fertility<br>clinic<br>desperate to conceive and if their BMI<br>is 32 or above they probably won't even<br>qualify for funding for that in New<br>Zealand because the chances of success<br>are so poor so it's a big issue for<br>fertility and at the other end of the<br>spectrum as well those with an<br>incredibly lean phenotype such as<br>athletes people with anorexia nervosa<br>that that that body type is also<br>strongly correlated with infertility and<br>there are many many couples who are<br>desperate to conceive but can't do so<br>presumably because of the lack of body<br>fat and so clearly fat seems to have<br>something to do with it and you might<br>gather from what I've said so far that<br>you need some fat but too much is not a<br>good thing well in 1949 a mutation arose<br>in a mouse line at a lab called the<br>Jackson laboratories in Maine and so<br>this gene mutation which no one had any<br>idea what it was for the next several<br>decades cause the animals to get fat and<br>infertile so this is the litter mate of<br>that Mouse it's fertile and lean but<br>this one has inherited the mutation<br>which Noah knew what it was and it was<br>obese and infertile and someone at the<br>Jackson laboratories was interested in<br>in this to maintain this line and<br>although it's infertile you can maintain<br>the line by breeding from carrier<br>animals that don't that don't in here at<br>the infertility because they've only got<br>one copy of this mutated gene and it<br>wasn't until nearly fifty years later<br>that someone called Jeffrey Friedman<br>figured out what the gene was that was<br>mutated but long before that people did<br>rather crude experiments and I've been<br>able to do the same thing in my lab will<br>you simply take some fat from this<br>healthy Mouse and so you need to suck up<br>about two cc's of fat and you give it to<br>this mouse that doesn't look like it<br>needs any more fat but what it needs is<br>fat that doesn't carry this mutation and<br>so this fat will grow in the animal and<br>rather quickly miraculously it seems<br>this animal will become fertile and over<br>a longer period of time it will become<br>lean the fertility is restored before<br>the lean body type is restored and we've<br>done this in our lab and it's a<br>remarkable demonstration that there is<br>something about the fat of this healthy<br>animal that this animal here is lacking<br>and that's leading to its to its<br>infertility well we now know that what<br>that is that gene that is produced by<br>fat is called Lipton it's a hormone and<br>it's X at all of the levels of the<br>control of reproduction that I've talked<br>about it exit the ovaries and X the<br>pituitary gland and exit the<br>hypothalamus and it's critical for<br>normal fertility and so you need to have<br>it but too much is not a good thing and<br>so we set out to do some research<br>firstly to figure out where is the<br>critical site that lived in X is that<br>here in the brain and there's a new<br>endocrinologist that's where we want it<br>to be but perhaps that's other places in<br>the ovaries and so one of the<br>experiments we've done more recently<br>actually is weather and was with an<br>honor student called Hayden McEwen and<br>we've just followed a group of animals<br>over the period over a period of months<br>and every one of these triangles every<br>one of these lines shows an individual<br>animal it's time line and if we triangle<br>is where it has a letter so these are<br>mice and you can see that mice have<br>elisa just about every three weeks<br>remarkably like clockwork and so we<br>could follow them over a period of<br>several months and so these are normal<br>animals on a normal Mouse showered diet<br>and and they stayed food for as long as<br>we could afford to pay for their upkeep<br>well when we take those similar animals<br>littermates of the same animals and we<br>put them on a high-calorie diet and this<br>is sometimes been called the Western<br>diet because the level of fat and the<br>level of sugar is roughly similar to a<br>Big Mac when we put them on that diet<br>they started off exactly the same but<br>each animal had two litters and then<br>they just stopped<br>and so this was though as they were<br>starting to get obese and infertility<br>just sitting we suspected that would<br>happen we were pleased that it did<br>because that was what our basic<br>experimental paradigm and required but<br>we did something else as well we wanted<br>to look at some of the signaling<br>pathways were themselves that we thought<br>contributed to the the effects of too<br>much Lipton and so when you have too<br>much Lipton some signaling molecules<br>called Sox stands for suppresses of<br>cytokine signaling kick into gear and<br>they seem to disrupt all the effects of<br>this hormone leptin and so we did a<br>study where we knocked out these<br>signaling molecules we got rid of them<br>to test whether they were the culprit<br>and bringing about this infertility and<br>you can see in the animals ko stands for<br>knockout when we knocked out the gene<br>for that signaling molecule the animals<br>remain fertile not forever in fact most<br>of the animals became infertile after<br>about four letters but it at least<br>doubled the length of their fertility<br>and that suggested to us that this<br>signaling molecule Sox is a critical<br>gene for bringing about infertility on a<br>high-fat diet<br>perhaps it could be a therapeutic<br>targets for overcoming this type of<br>infertility I suspect that there are<br>other genes as well and that's why these<br>animals eventually became infertile as<br>well so maybe it won't be a complete<br>therapy and of itself but it's a<br>potential target and so I guess if you<br>don't remember all that the take-home<br>message is that too much Lipton<br>signaling inhibits fertility you need<br>some but too much it's not a good thing<br>well we've spent over well over a decade<br>trying to unravel where it is in the<br>body the brain or elsewhere that lipped<br>an X to bring about these effects on<br>reproduction and I'm very much indebted<br>to a long term postdoc of mine although<br>she's gone on to do medicine now her<br>name's dr. Jeanette quenelle and she has<br>been was with me at the outset of these<br>projects and is responsible for the<br>first set of results I'm going to<br>present here and what you see that to<br>show was that Lipton it's critical site<br>of action is in the brain perhaps at X<br>and the ovary perhaps an X in the<br>pituitary gland but the most important<br>site she wanted to test the idea that<br>that was in the brain and all of the<br>experiments that I've done since then<br>have relied on some special tricks we<br>can do by mixing and matching different<br>lines of transgenic mice to targets<br>whatever receptor or protein we were<br>interested in and knock it out get rid<br>of it just in specific cells that we<br>want so it's a very very carefully<br>targeted removal of genes and instead of<br>globally knocking them out of all cells<br>in the body and you need to do this kind<br>of trick you need two lines of mice one<br>is a brain specific cream Mouse and that<br>just as a way of targeting the the<br>knockout that we want to the brain we<br>only want it to happen in brain neurons<br>we don't want to happen and other types<br>of cells in the brain we don't want it<br>to happen and the pituitary gland we<br>don't want to happen in the ovary so<br>this mouse allows us to target it to the<br>cells we want and this mouse here<br>allows us to choose what gene we want to<br>knock out and so we're able to knock out<br>the receptor for this hormone leptin put<br>them together and we have an animal that<br>has brain specifically can dress it to<br>knockout and the first thing we know<br>just didn't happen immediately was that<br>these animals became obese and so<br>clearly you need leptin signaling in the<br>but even before that became obvious<br>Jeannette looked at the puberty onset of<br>these animals and so this graph takes a<br>little while to get your head around but<br>it's just a timeline the green line is<br>for our normal control animals the red<br>line is for animals in which we've got<br>rid of the leptin receptor specifically<br>in brain cells and if this line goes up<br>it means that an increasing percentage<br>of the animals are going through puberty<br>is measured by the beginning of their<br>reproductive cycles and so you can see<br>there is expected the control animals go<br>through puberty between 35 and 40 days<br>of age and by let's say 42 days of age<br>100% of them have gone through puberty<br>but not one of our brain specific lipton<br>receptor knockout animals went through<br>puberty and so clearly Lipton is<br>required to act somewhere in the brain<br>at the stage we didn't know we're for<br>the onset of reproductive cycles so this<br>was a very profound finding that we were<br>very excited about and we thought well<br>is that the into it and we but we were<br>because we're in your endocrinologist<br>were particularly fascinated in this<br>event that drives ovulation that's<br>remarkable LH tsunami and we wondered<br>whether that the change in<br>responsiveness of the brain that causes<br>this could happen at all in these<br>animals and so we gave them all the<br>estradiol they need to drive this event<br>so we're doing three-quarters of the<br>work for them and we just tested whether<br>they could have this huge release of LH<br>and so I can't having graphed out this<br>LH tsunami because that stage we could<br>only we couldn't their essays weren't<br>precise enough to be able to<br>take multiple samples and graph the<br>thing over time so this is just from a<br>single sample but you can see our normal<br>controls had a massive release of LH<br>here this is the average for the whole<br>group but the animals from which we'd<br>knocked out the Lipton receptor<br>just out of brain yawns had no LH<br>tsunami at all so even this event in the<br>brain which is critical for ovulation<br>you can't drive it even if you give them<br>all the steroids needed you can't drive<br>this event and animals that don't have<br>Lipton receptors we were even able to<br>look at what goes on within these GnRH<br>neurons which drive reproduction and we<br>can't measure the release of GnRH and as<br>a hormone very easily but we can image<br>the neurons and so these are 3 GnRH<br>neurons from a control animal 3 from a<br>neuron specifically pin receptor Nokia<br>the gnrh neurons looked fine but we're<br>also able to image the level of activity<br>of these neurons and these little black<br>dots here within the nucleus of the of<br>the neurons is staining for a protein<br>called cephas and when you see that you<br>know that this neuron is active and you<br>really only see that at the time of this<br>LH tsunami because directive because<br>they're driving that massive release of<br>hormones and and i want to say that my<br>kids during their formative years became<br>very adept at recognizing a busy GnRH<br>neo and they would come and look over my<br>shoulder at home and say that one's a<br>busy one<br>that one's a busy one so they've become<br>quite good image analysis experts at<br>least for the specific thing but all<br>these neurons specifically pin receptor<br>knockouts not one of them was active and<br>so the thus infertility seems to be<br>happening somewhere within the brain so<br>that's the take-home message there is<br>that leptin X in the brain to control<br>fertility and via began a rather<br>frustrating decade where we knew that<br>but that's not good enough for us the<br>brain is like outer space it contains a<br>lot of different cell types and so we<br>tried to knock them off one by one to<br>figure out where<br>was Lipton was acting and we got a lot<br>of negative results it doesn't act<br>directly on those gnrh neurons the GnRH<br>neurons aren't working but they don't<br>seem to be the ones that are responding<br>to Lipton receptors it doesn't act on<br>those keptin neurons that I said were<br>the most remarkable discovery of this<br>century and reproductive new<br>endocrinology we felt sure that those<br>would be the targets no not them either<br>it doesn't act on neurons that make<br>glutamates it doesn't act on neurons<br>that make this peptide called our FRP<br>and so you can see a rather frustrating<br>series of negative results coming out<br>from my lab and we're thankful that we<br>were able to publish them because you<br>know scientists are human and negative<br>results don't tend to catch people's<br>attention and then I am asked a student<br>began in my lab and her name was Olivia<br>Egan and my next hot guess for where<br>these Lipton hormones might be acting<br>was a set of neurons down here and a<br>place in the brain called the arcuate<br>nucleus which is called a GRP neurons<br>and gu t related peptide neurons and so<br>we used the same tricks as before to<br>knock lip and receptors out of these AG<br>RP neurons to test whether they might be<br>the critical neurons that lipton users<br>to communicate its effects to the<br>reproductive system and we saw a partial<br>effect so these are our normal control<br>mice their reproductive cycles are<br>beginning at about 34 days of age on<br>average and the animals we knocked out<br>the leptin receptor from specifically<br>from the AG our opinions they did have<br>puberty so there's this fertility there<br>but they were markedly delayed in their<br>puberty okay you might look at that and<br>say it's only four days we have to<br>remember that these are animals that<br>have an incredibly synchronous puberty<br>humans are most unusual and the wide age<br>of puberty that that um that we<br>experience and so a four day delay is a<br>big deal for a mouse and they've got us<br>interested enough to look at the role of<br>these neurons a bit further and we<br>started to think well there's probably<br>not one just one type of neuron that<br>leptin users to communicate its effects<br>to the reproductive system maybe there's<br>several different types of neurons<br>and maybe just disrupting any one of<br>them is not going to be sufficient to<br>show complete infertility because Lipton<br>will just use a different pathway to get<br>the message there and so we took a<br>different approach that we were able to<br>do with our tricks with transgenic<br>animals and we could knock Lipton<br>receptors out of every cell in the body<br>and no surprise there that those animals<br>were completely infertile they never<br>began their reproductive cycles the<br>normal control mice began the<br>reproductive cycles in about 34 days of<br>age just as they always do but we had an<br>additional group of animals where we<br>were able to make them completely leap<br>and receptor deficient except for these<br>AG RP neurons we could rescue Lichtman<br>receptors just in those that small<br>population of neurons here in the<br>arcuate nucleus and so we're testing a<br>different idea there we're testing that<br>these cells are all that is required to<br>communicate Lipton's effects and thereby<br>information about how much body fat you<br>have to the reproductive centers of the<br>brain and remarkably when only those<br>cells had leptin receptors and no other<br>cells in the body did we were able to<br>restore reproductive cycle onset it was<br>a little bit delayed compared with the<br>control mice but nevertheless every<br>single animal had puberty onset and so<br>all that is required is this lipt and<br>acting on this one population of neurons<br>to convey the effects to the<br>reproductive system and so I think um<br>there is potential for it well it just<br>so happens that these same neurons are<br>important for control of food intake as<br>well and so there is potential for<br>developing drugs that not only control<br>food intake but might restore fertility<br>at the same time and that remains to be<br>seen whether that becomes a possibility<br>okay for my final little story here I'd<br>like to talk about the links between<br>stress and infertility and so<br>it comes as no surprise that infertility<br>is a distressing situation it's<br>correlated with depression and it's a<br>silent situation people don't talk about<br>the effect in fact that they're<br>infertile but for couples who experience<br>this and who try again and again to<br>conceive it's hugely distressing and<br>it's hard to know whether it works the<br>other way does the stress itself lead to<br>infertility anecdotal evidence would<br>suggest that's the case but it's hard to<br>really prove it and probably the best<br>evidence that there is the case is that<br>cognitive therapy approaches that have<br>some success in reducing the level of<br>stress and anxiety and depression have<br>been in some studies correlated with an<br>increase in pregnancy rates but the data<br>is pretty mixed and as you can imagine<br>it's so difficult perhaps to to really<br>determine that we all feel we're<br>stressed don't we and some of us are<br>fertile and some of us are not so these<br>things are hard to get good data on and<br>we wanted to try using our mouse models<br>of course to try and determine whether<br>there was a link we're by stress causes<br>and fertility and what that neuronal<br>link might be so yeah it's a chicken egg<br>argument as to whether the stress is<br>causing the infertility we know of<br>course that the infertility is causing<br>the stress but does it work the other<br>way so I need to give you a bit of<br>background about these neurons here<br>which are in a region of the brain<br>called the dorsal medial hypothalamus<br>and they're called our FRP neurons it<br>stands for if a mode related peptide but<br>that's nobody remembers that and the<br>characterization of what they do has<br>been done by a number of people in my<br>lab but this is Mohammed Rizwan June<br>chem Caroline and so in India soio are<br>some of the people in my lab that have<br>been working on characterizing what<br>these neurons do and here are some of<br>the a data just very quickly firstly if<br>you give if you treat an animal with RFR<br>P 3 which is the peptide<br>call that these neurons make you can<br>increase stress hormones corticosteroids<br>the mouse version of cortisol the stress<br>hormone and you can cause a big increase<br>in corticosteroid just by treating<br>that's worth the product of these<br>neurons in collaboration with colleagues<br>in the School of Pharmacy<br>we made a drug that blocks the effect of<br>our FRP 3 with the aim of perhaps<br>developing a therapeutic drug we called<br>it GJ 14 and this drug if you give it<br>together at the same time as our FRP 3<br>that overcomes all these effects these<br>stress response effects that are FRP 3<br>is caused what about behavioral type<br>stress responses so we have in mice we<br>have measures of anxiety and one of them<br>is simply to put the mice and we call it<br>a maze but it's just to boxers side by<br>side one is darkened you can imagine<br>mice like that because it's nice and<br>safe and the predator can't get them and<br>another is an open box with a light<br>shining on it you've got to be a brave<br>Mouse to go out there and so normal mice<br>spend about 20% of their time exploring<br>the open box and if you treat them with<br>RF rp3<br>they spend less than half their time<br>exploring the open box they're more<br>anxious presumably if you interpret this<br>test in this way<br>and so they like to spend all their time<br>where it's safe and again if you treat<br>them with our drug which blocks the<br>effect of RF rp3 you can overcome that<br>and even make them more bold than they<br>were in the normal state so that's a<br>little bit of background about what<br>these neurons do for stress responses in<br>anxiety what do they do for reproduction<br>well we can so this is another graph<br>here of this LH tsunami which would<br>normally lead to ovulation and if we<br>give the animals an injection of RF rp3<br>at the same time it almost completely<br>blocks that effect this release of LH<br>would not be enough to drive ovulation<br>and we have measurements that suggest<br>that in the normal situation the levels<br>of this thing go down at the time of a<br>normal ovulation and it's like it's<br>opening the gates the floodgates for the<br>tsunami<br>so normally that's how this huge release<br>of LH occurs as that's one of the ways<br>anyway<br>is that the levels of RF rp3 go down to<br>permit it we think so with that in mind<br>we sit about testing the idea that RF RP<br>3 levels might increase during anxiety<br>and that might be one of the things that<br>prevent ovulation from happening so I<br>was just going to say this has been<br>thought of as the brakes and the<br>accelerator for different aspects of our<br>endocrinology so it's the brakes for the<br>control of ovulation but the same<br>chemical might be the accelerator for<br>driving anxiety responses so this work<br>was done by another honor student in my<br>lab Sean Stowe and she once said about<br>testing the idea that our FRP neurons<br>might be the link which links stress<br>responses to blocking ovulation and<br>again he used our transgenic mouse<br>tricks and so we have our own mouse line<br>where we can localize this thing called<br>crea Combinator the neurons where you're<br>interested and that helps us direct<br>whatever treatments we want just<br>specifically to these neurons and not to<br>any other cells in the body and this<br>mouse line here allows when when cross<br>together allows these are FRP neurons to<br>become very sensitive to a drug which we<br>can give them which allows the neurons<br>to be completely removed so once we<br>cross these animals together and then<br>give this animal an injection of this<br>drug we can completely get rid of those<br>neurons it takes about four days and<br>then they're gone permanently and again<br>the mouse is perfectly first oil when<br>you wouldn't normally notice any<br>difference but if we do look at the<br>brains you can see that those are FRP<br>neurons which are here blown up here and<br>higher magnification are completely gone<br>in in this mouse here that we've made<br>our FRP known and none of the other<br>neurons around about are affected so we<br>look to see what would happen<br>for this LH tsunami in these animals and<br>so these are our normal animals that<br>don't have any transgenic changes to<br>them and when they're in their non<br>stress states perpetuated to handling so<br>completely unstressed they have this<br>beautiful LH surge and we stop bleeding<br>here at blood sampling at about the peak<br>if we just give a short period of stress<br>and all it requires is that we restrain<br>the animals for a short while during the<br>build up of this big release of<br>luteinizing hormone we almost completely<br>block that tsunami of LH and so this was<br>a sort of an experimental model for<br>stress induced suppression of<br>reproduction that Shawn developed I know<br>it's not the same as the long-term<br>stress that's the plague of our society<br>but it's a nice simple model for showing<br>how stress can affect fertility well<br>what happened when we repeated this and<br>the animals that didn't have any are FRP<br>neurons they can have a perfectly normal<br>surge of LH and the absence of any<br>stress so they seem to work just fine<br>but here's the remarkable thing that we<br>discovered when you expose them to the<br>same brief period of restraints that<br>prevented the surgeon and normal animals<br>these animals were able to have a<br>perfectly normal<br>tsunami of LH that would drive ovulation<br>and that shows to us pretty clearly that<br>these neurons are critical and somehow<br>linking that those effects of stress<br>into the outcome of impaired ovulation<br>and so perhaps these neurons themselves<br>could be targets for overcoming stress<br>induced infertility and what remains to<br>be done of course is to determine<br>whether some individuals are more prone<br>to this preps the RFR p 3 levels are<br>high at all the times and it doesn't go<br>down at the time of the surge as happens<br>an healthy woman and those studies still<br>need to be conducted there's just a<br>quantification of all those results you<br>can see that in the animals with no RFI<br>opinions they are able to have a perf<br>normal this is the peak of the LH surge<br>even when they're exposed to a period of<br>restraint stress so that's the end of<br>the three stories that I have to tell<br>you about my research I'd like to think<br>this is I think a complete list of all<br>the students who have studied in my lab<br>some are still here now but many have<br>moved on and gone and done wonderful<br>things in their own rights and I just<br>like to mention many of them along the<br>way that have been involved in the<br>things that I've told you about like to<br>make a special mention of my technician<br>Megan Ingalls who's up the back<br>somewhere she's been a long-term<br>technician in my lab and she's an<br>absolute pillar in terms of making the<br>things happen in the lab when I'm not<br>able to be there in terms of training up<br>all these new students and the skills<br>that they need so thanks Megan thanks<br>also to the critical groups that are<br>funded my research and these are the<br>main players here that are funded by<br>research these things cost as you can<br>imagine tens of thousands of dollars<br>every year and so we're very thankful<br>for the funding that's been provided so<br>thank you all for coming and sitting<br>through this and I hope the science<br>didn't get too over your head and I just<br>appreciates your involvement so Kyra<br>evening everyone my name is Lisa Modesto<br>Smith I'm the head of department of<br>anatomy and I'm absolutely thrilled to<br>be here for a number of reasons<br>as you heard Greg is the deputy hid of<br>Anatomy and we're a very very big<br>department and I have really come to<br>rely on Greg so much for his incredible<br>knowledge of our teaching program and<br>it's very complicated and his very cool<br>and calm demeanor when I as a new head<br>of department would get stressed out<br>about things greg was always like no we<br>got it under control so when he told me<br>that he had the date for his IPL this<br>was my first opportunity to to be part<br>of the academic party and for a member<br>of the anatomy department to give a<br>professorial lecture and told me the<br>date of it I thought uh-oh looked at my<br>schedule that's right around the time<br>that I'm going to a big conference in<br>the US so I looked at the dates and said<br>okay it's at the end of the conference<br>that should be fine and then when I got<br>the schedule for the conference ended up<br>realizing that I was one of those lucky<br>people to be scheduled in the very last<br>session of a five-day conference so I<br>quickly gone on to the travel agent and<br>said is there any way that we can change<br>my flight so that I could get out late<br>Sunday after Sunday afternoon it was<br>yesterday in the US and and we were able<br>to do that and and get a very quick<br>one-hour connection in Houston between<br>my flight out of Albuquerque so I<br>thought okay that should be fine they<br>guaranteed that it was an Air New<br>Zealand flight and that I could make<br>that connection and then Saturday night<br>everybody's phones were going off<br>because there were tornadoes in Texas<br>and the south and lights were being<br>canceled and and everybody's having to<br>reschedule and I kept checking mine and<br>it was no is all okay it was on time was<br>going to be able to get back in time and<br>got to the airport and for the first<br>time ever in my life flying United the<br>flight was going and<br>we boarded and we're getting ready to go<br>doors closed on time and it was we're<br>gonna think I was gonna make it I was<br>texting great I'm gonna make it I'm<br>gonna make it and we started to take<br>rank down the runway and almost up to<br>full speed and then the brakes slammed<br>on and everybody's looking very nervous<br>and thinking oh no here we go we came to<br>a stop the pilot came on and he said bit<br>of a problem there's a coyote on the<br>runway<br>only in New Mexico and as we taxied<br>around we saw the coyote trot off after<br>a female coyote so it's springtime and<br>female fertility and animal models just<br>about stopped me from being here but we<br>were able to taxi around and take off<br>again and with a sprint through the<br>Houston Airport I got on the plane and<br>arrived here this morning so I am very<br>very pleased to be here to celebrate<br>with Greg and I think it's it was very<br>clear to me the other exciting thing<br>about it as Greg and I are usually<br>talking about teaching or other<br>administrative things in the department<br>we rarely get to talk about research so<br>to be able to see your talk tonight and<br>pitched at the perfect level for a<br>biological anthropologist to really<br>fully understand the exciting work that<br>you're doing and what really impressed<br>me was the involvement of all of the<br>students and the recognition of all the<br>students which is just another indicator<br>of what an amazing I'm not only amazing<br>researcher Greg is but an amazing<br>teacher and mentor to his students so<br>thank you Greg and we have a small</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
