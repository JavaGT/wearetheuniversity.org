Ana tato katoa<br>good evening everyone my name is Harlan<br>hain and I have the great privilege of<br>being the vice chancellor here at the<br>University of Otago and it is my<br>pleasure to warmly welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>Rachel Taylor on behalf of the<br>University I'd like to begin by<br>extending a particularly warm welcome to<br>the members of Rachel's family some of<br>whom who have travelled quite a ways in<br>order to be here with us this evening<br>her husband Simon her children cam Caleb<br>and Mac her parents Bryan and Lynn and<br>her in-laws Colleen and John Ford it's<br>fantastic to have you here with us this<br>evening and it makes Rachel's day so<br>much more special in addition to these<br>special guests as I look out on the<br>audience I can see people from around<br>the university both staff and students<br>and members of the public and especially<br>warm welcome to our Chancellor dr.<br>Royden Summerville who is a regular<br>attendee here on behalf of the<br>University you are always warmly<br>welcomed here and I know that many of<br>you use these IPL's as part of your own<br>ongoing education so on behalf of the<br>university not me he newly kia Coto now<br>we're here tonight to celebrate Rachel's<br>great achievement<br>and I don't want to take up too much of<br>her time but I do want to tell you just<br>a tiny bit about some of the things that<br>have led to Rachel's promotion her<br>research program as many of you will be<br>aware focuses on child and adolescent<br>obesity and the development of<br>interventions for prevention as you will<br>learn from her lecture this evening her<br>work is creative and she is a highly<br>successful researcher she's also an<br>incredibly effective communicator she's<br>also a popular research supervisor and<br>she has mentored literally dozens of PhD<br>and masters students to completion<br>Rachel Service has also been exemplary<br>she has provided excellent service both<br>to the university and to the wider<br>academic community nationally she's<br>provided services to organizations like<br>the Ministry of Health and the HRC and<br>in all of her activities she has been an<br>outstanding ambassador for the<br>University of Otago so Rachel on behalf<br>of the University I would like to<br>congratulate you on your very<br>well-deserved promotion to Professor I<br>will now call on professor Barry Taylor<br>who is going to tell us just a little<br>bit more about Rachel's academic journey<br>to Professor noreda<br>kyoro everybody it's a real pleasure to<br>actually be in a special pleasure for me<br>because I've just worked out that I've<br>been I've known Rachel for the last 20<br>years and I want to especially welcome I<br>guess her husband Simon and three<br>children Kim came Caleb and Mac and<br>especially to thank them because I've<br>actually heard the results of Rachel<br>testing out a range of equipment that<br>we've used because I work closely with<br>Rachel's coming home we tried this and<br>so thank you especially for<br>participating in in the research studies<br>that your mum was about to talk about<br>so to summarize academic career I first<br>became acquainted with Rachel when she<br>was doing a PhD under the supervision of<br>a famous researcher in the Dunedin<br>School of Medicine Elsa Golding now<br>retired but who was an expert in body<br>composition and so she did her PhD in a<br>nutritional field but to do with body<br>composition as a pediatrician I was very<br>interested in child body composition so<br>that's to some degree how we initially<br>met each other<br>she did her BSC in 1995 finished her PhD<br>in 2001 when it was awarded and then a<br>relatively short time later looking at<br>many other people going through the<br>system in 2005 four years later she's<br>appointed as a senior lecturer and then<br>switched slightly sideways into a senior<br>research fellow role followed on really<br>by moving into an associate professor<br>professorial position research focused<br>in 2011 and then taking on a deputy hit<br>a department role in the department of<br>medicine in 2016 so she has shown and<br>I'm you know rapid progression from my<br>point of view through through the system<br>and I've known personally the drive and<br>her ability to focus and get things done<br>and you have a range of people within<br>any team that's working she's the person<br>that may<br>sure that things actually get done and<br>often we'll do them and we'll chase<br>people to make sure they're getting done<br>so I've been the recipient of some of<br>that chasing instill em so Rachel fully<br>deserves this disappointment I think<br>you're going to have a feast of interest<br>coming up in the next 45 45 minutes so<br>welcome in congratulations Rachel is<br>wonderful thank you very much for the<br>kind comments to both howleen in to<br>berry and thanks so much everyone for<br>coming out tonight on this beautiful<br>autumn evening so yes is mentioned you<br>can see the title of my talk there move<br>eat sleep repeat and this is really<br>because these three behaviors have<br>really formed an integral part of both<br>my life but also my research interests<br>over the time and really in particular<br>how they pertain to child health now of<br>course I have a personal interests as<br>well I do like getting out and about and<br>active which is just as well because I<br>also like to eat the only one I'm not so<br>hard at as the sleep but luckily thanks<br>sigh I can live vicariously through my<br>husband who can actually sleep for New<br>Zealand so we cover all our bases there<br>some of us are even able to multitask in<br>some of these areas which is fantastic<br>so I'm actually a North Islander and<br>it's not something I lay claim to very<br>often mainly because I lift off on the<br>knowing when I was 5 years of age so I<br>don't have great memory of what actually<br>happened up there so I grew up in<br>Alexandria and the early 70s it was a<br>fantastic place to grow up I'm not sure<br>if we just got out of the pool there or<br>ELYX didn't have here dresses or here<br>brushes but that's ok that's me the<br>blondie there on the right so spent all<br>my schooling and Alexandria until we did<br>we experiment shall we call it in my<br>semen form and I actually went up to<br>Kings College so is there anyone from<br>King's here it's but safer great so I<br>left Dunston and I left Alexandra town<br>of 4000 went to Auckland City of around<br>a million or so at their time state<br>school private school co-ed school boys<br>school that had just started to take<br>girls in the sixth and seventh form only<br>normal people now have shabbiha but<br>anyway you know it was a fantastic<br>opportunity and a real learning<br>experience and that's what life's all<br>about<br>so I had a great year at Kings I'm in<br>next year but it was very different to<br>what I was used to but<br>didn't take me long to win my way back<br>down to Otago now I didn't actually do<br>science its Cole sorry didn't actually<br>do science at school in fact I took<br>great delight and tell him my fifth form<br>teacher after school cert that I<br>couldn't stand for stupid subject and I<br>was never going to do it again the bad<br>side of having a mother who was a<br>teacher at school mean I had to go back<br>and my second year of university and<br>apologize to see a science teacher<br>because I've taken up science so I<br>actually did at Tech drawing accounting<br>economics and all those things at school<br>loved them at school came down to<br>University as you can see from my grades<br>I didn't always go to university but in<br>my defense we lived at Helens hospital<br>that year the old Walker II hospital and<br>we were a long way away from University<br>compared to all the other students we<br>also had hitchhiked to uni so if it was<br>raining or no one stopped that day it<br>wasn't you know a lot of point and<br>actually going so come the into that<br>first year I had to wreck my brains and<br>think of something else now mum was a<br>homemaker teacher in those days so<br>nutrition had always been a little part<br>of our life<br>in other words sounds kind of<br>interesting and so I enrolled for that<br>not realizing I had to do chemistry so a<br>very big thank you to a togo in<br>particular Bob Smith for anyone who<br>remembers Bob from those days because I<br>was in his office every single week we<br>had cabbage kimchi just for me and I<br>only realized what a mechanism was for<br>my organic chemistry exam on the morning<br>of but there's okay we got there and<br>then from after that nutrition was plain<br>sailing<br>so as Barry mentioned I had the very<br>good fortune of river answer is hiding<br>and to be one of Elsa's students this<br>years and my honours year for those of<br>you who don't know Elsa she was a real<br>tour de force a fantastic scientist but<br>also a very dear friend and I owe her<br>hugely for my career so thank you very<br>much Elsa so I was actually it's very<br>mentioned she was a bone health<br>researcher<br>and so I actually started off my life I<br>sort of morphed a little bit here in<br>terms of looking at bone health and we<br>were looking at lactose malabsorption<br>now lactose is the main sugar found and<br>milk if you can absorb it no problems<br>that splits into its two component<br>sugars and you don't have any problems<br>if you can't absorb it you have some<br>problems and we won't go into what they<br>are but they're essentially a little<br>annoying for most European populations<br>lactose malabsorption is not a big issue<br>but what we were able to show here is<br>that actually becomes quite common an<br>elderly European woman as they age and<br>that really hadn't been noticed before<br>one of the beauties of working without<br>Sarah is that I got exposed sorry ham to<br>the diksa the dual energy x-ray<br>absorptiometry and as well as measuring<br>bone health really well it's an amazing<br>measure of body composition and that's<br>just as well because I was particularly<br>interested in child health or that I do<br>Dibble in adult health and this all it<br>takes for a child as to life still on<br>the beard now for only about five<br>minutes back then it was a bit longer<br>and you get really accurate information<br>on Baronne house basically every your<br>amount of fat lean and bone to shoot<br>down to the gram so it's not always<br>information you might want because those<br>grams add up that anyway in terms of<br>children this was a huge advantage<br>because prior to the dick sir this was<br>the gold standard for assessing body<br>composition so you had to be entirely<br>dunked underwater for a certain length<br>of time it's Archimedes principle when<br>he jumps out of the bath saying Eureka<br>with a whole lot of fancy calculations<br>this is how I used to determine body<br>composition clearly not that<br>straightforward so during my PhD we<br>really sticks ascared hundreds and<br>hundreds of children and I was<br>interested in particular and finding<br>simple ways that we could assess body<br>composition that didn't used exa so<br>using that as the gold standard one<br>the things we looked at was that even in<br>very young children at only 3 to 6 years<br>of age<br>girls had higher body fat than boys even<br>their young at the time that was very<br>much considered that gender differences<br>and body fat didn't really start until<br>puberty and yet we were able to show<br>them here we now know that babies boy<br>babies are born leaner than girl babies<br>so it shows you that we have a harder<br>Road to follow ladies one of the other<br>big things we were interested in looking<br>at is the whole Apple versus peer so if<br>you have an apple body shape you do have<br>a higher health risk than if you have a<br>peer body shape because body fat stored<br>around your central area is more<br>metabolically active but we didn't<br>really know how to measure central<br>adiposity in children so about a<br>thousand dixit children later what we<br>were able to show is that waist<br>circumference a simple tape measurement<br>around the waist is actually a really<br>good indicator of health and children<br>and we were able to produce waist<br>circumference cut-offs for New Zealand<br>children from three to nineteen years of<br>age Dena took we holiday Sian I got<br>married we do look a little bit flushed<br>there it's not all excitement happened<br>to be about 45 degrees that day so for<br>those of us in Clyde those of us who had<br>chosen a white singlet dress went too<br>badly off those of us who on a cooler<br>Dunedin day had chosen satin shirts with<br>black suits we're not so lucky<br>and then after appropriate length of<br>time of course we came came into the<br>world so I had a few months off there<br>and so really having all that exposure<br>to body composition really created my<br>interest and obesity because we were<br>scanning a lot of these kids and a lot<br>of these kids were quite big but some of<br>the interesting part particularly in the<br>young females as they didn't overtly<br>look big but they had very high levels<br>of body fat and or very low levels of<br>muscle men<br>and so this is where the idea of our<br>Apple study came into play and I just<br>again there's lots of people that I've<br>worked with but I'd particularly like to<br>acknowledge Jim and Sheila here who were<br>also with me throughout my PhD and also<br>fantastic researchers also helped me<br>hugely and remain very dear friends of<br>mine so thank you to you both so when we<br>set up Apple some years ago now was<br>really about this concept of the<br>obesogenic environment that we shouldn't<br>actually be looking at why some people<br>get fat we should be actually looking at<br>how on earth some people manage to stay<br>lane in the world that we actually love<br>and so this is just one example the fact<br>that portion sizes have increased<br>tremendously across the world<br>essentially it's really really easy to<br>over eat and really really hard to get<br>your physical activity levels up to the<br>level where it might make a difference<br>so we wanted to change the world but<br>essentially we just went to Palmerston<br>and why ket instead and had a go at<br>changing there so really what we wanted<br>to do was actually change the<br>environment in which these kids lived<br>both the food environment and the<br>physical activity environment in the end<br>the food environment became a little bit<br>difficult to change because 90% of the<br>food intake of people in these areas was<br>of course bought and Dunedin and we<br>weren't changing the internet in<br>environment so I pretty much ended up a<br>physical activity intervention<br>predominantly and we really put physical<br>activity coordinators into the primary<br>schools in these areas these are small<br>country schools they found it really<br>difficult to get sports teams together<br>and so by doing this we were really just<br>creating a face for physical activity in<br>the community that was a sort of liaison<br>point to get interest going and they<br>were able to get and one school couldn't<br>get a single parent coach hockey in the<br>end they had three hockey teams they<br>only had 40 odd kids in the school so<br>that's a pretty good effort in seven<br>teachers willing to coach they also did<br>events like this top-down events so for<br>those of you who remember the days of<br>top-down and that was just a way for the<br>community to get together<br>and so on what we were able to show at<br>the end of our year intervene to<br>intervention is that we actually reduced<br>the risk of obesity by about thirty<br>percent and these children which was<br>fantastic we went back two years later<br>after four years where the activity<br>coordinators had no longer been employed<br>for two years and we very much expected<br>those differences to have disappeared<br>but surprisingly they had listened a<br>little bit but they were still there so<br>there was still a sort of 19 percent<br>lower risk of overweight now we that<br>getting that bad bit of data those two<br>little numbers there we had to go around<br>and measure about 700 children they were<br>no longer and the Seven original schools<br>they were now in 49 schools around at<br>Agra Southland that was a big job but I<br>still remember a conversation we had Jim<br>and I had one day that our best evidence<br>for the success of Apple was many years<br>later when these children were at high<br>school they were a part of another study<br>and they were found to be significantly<br>leaner than kids from the surrounding<br>area and the school contributed that to<br>them being applicants which was pretty<br>cool even ants also dabbled and I do<br>mean dabbled and the more lay literature<br>some of you may be familiar with Bill<br>O'Brien<br>he's a local Dunedin also he approached<br>me about helping him write a handbook<br>called the fat word here there was a<br>really cool experience bill was a<br>fantastic author and great to work with<br>I still remember my second royalty cheek<br>though of $1 24 so wasn't a huge seller<br>so I would go for some of bills other<br>books he's actually an ex-policeman he's<br>got some fascinating stories about life<br>and the place and he's also written up<br>some of the terrible tragedies that have<br>happened in our local area as well<br>anyway Caleb came so baby boy number<br>twos I had another few months off sort<br>of as you do as an academic and then we<br>had some other projects and essentially<br>what I'll tell you is a story in about<br>how all of these projects have really<br>morphed into the next project and one of<br>the interesting things about<br>Apple was that it was actually only<br>effective and children who are of normal<br>weight now we didn't make the fun kids<br>thinner because remember normal weight<br>is a bit of a curve and because they're<br>all at the higher end this capacity to<br>bring the mean back a little bit but<br>it's not effective and children who are<br>already overweight to begin with and<br>it's been found since by quite a few<br>other community-based studies so we need<br>to do something different and so that's<br>why we set up a mint study and enter and<br>gel with the PhD students and many other<br>of my colleagues are here today we<br>actually set up this up at the time when<br>the before school check was coming into<br>play in New Zealand so virtually every<br>four-year-old child and New Zealand goes<br>through the before school check and a<br>number of years ago now they decided<br>they would add height and weight<br>measurements to the before school check<br>as a way of measuring prevalence within<br>the country<br>however we also know that 90% of parents<br>of young children do not recognize<br>overweight and their children and<br>doctors and nurses and other people do<br>not want to have this conversation about<br>a very emotive and sensitive issue so<br>what we wanted to do was to see if we<br>could do this better if you like could<br>we design a way that this would actually<br>work so we used something called<br>motivational interviewing which I won't<br>get into now but it's a sort of a<br>different way of interacting with your<br>your client or your patient that sort of<br>lets them lead the way if you like<br>rather than just telling them whatever<br>news that you're actually going to tell<br>them so we actually did a very<br>comprehensive health check and more than<br>a thousand children because we had to<br>get these overweight children which are<br>about a quarter of the group the parents<br>were then randomised to get feedback via<br>either this motivational interviewing or<br>usual here and we've got them back<br>another couple of weeks later and said<br>how was it did you hate it did you like<br>it has it changed anything<br>was it a waste of time and so on and<br>would you like some help and 3/4 of<br>those parents despite the vast majority<br>of them having no idea what was coming<br>we actually came to come under the<br>2-year intervention so some success I<br>think that's really down to the fact is<br>that we use this traffic<br>approach we never used the words obese<br>or overweight we tended to talk about it<br>in the sort of traffic light concept so<br>greens okay<br>orange caution red stop you know your<br>child is a bit heavier than other kids<br>their age and so on and so essentially<br>that message was quite well accepted<br>they didn't always like it and they<br>didn't always agree with it but they did<br>like the way the message was actually<br>delivered so it is possible to have<br>those difficult conversations took<br>another break for a little while here<br>and baby number three little Mickey came<br>and now I'm going to tell you a story<br>here because Mickey likes to tell<br>everyone that I broke his leg when he<br>was a baby so I'm going to get him first<br>and explain it I did break his leg when<br>he was a baby we were going down the<br>slide at my skill he's actually sitting<br>there with his cast on trying to cool<br>down and that bucket and it was good<br>from the fracture point of view I'll see<br>you see because he only cried for about<br>ten seconds at the bottom of the slide<br>so I didn't bother taking him to the<br>doctor it was only two the next day when<br>he wasn't really walking on a more<br>favoring his leg that we took him in and<br>they thought it was fractured but they<br>weren't sure so they put him on a side<br>toe cast but half fell off so I took him<br>back a couple of days later and it<br>doesn't matter eysan got a fracture so<br>off we went it still wasn't really using<br>his league so we went back two weeks<br>later and they reiterate him and he had<br>a very clear fracture across his tibia<br>and that's because of such young<br>children you can't really see on the<br>x-ray and it's only when the bones start<br>missing themselves back together that<br>the fracture is really clear so they put<br>on another but cast unfortunately we<br>were going on a two-week beach holiday<br>the following day so that was cool they<br>had a new system where they were having<br>these new sort of waterproof casts that<br>they'd used on teenagers with their<br>wrist fractures in the past so it was<br>great we went to the beach every day we<br>shoved a hose down flushed out all that<br>sin not a problem it was only when we<br>got back two weeks later and then it was<br>getting a wee bit cranky and he was not<br>a cranky baby and it looked a wee bit<br>weird around the top when we took it off<br>we realized that this poor little bugger<br>had no skin on his leg because it had a<br>wet sandy leg for the previous two weeks<br>so that's you know get out of the way<br>you don't need to mention that's not<br>know Mickey and so that really led to<br>one of the other school-based funds that<br>we were interested in which was really<br>about just turning back the clock could<br>we bring back bulrush into schools and<br>really that the modern playground has<br>become so monumentally boring as<br>illustrated by the top photo that no<br>self-respecting child would ever want to<br>play in it so it might take meet all<br>those safety things but there's no<br>interest whatsoever and so really what<br>we were doing is trying to encourage<br>schools to increase the amount of risk<br>and challenge and thus called Craig and<br>letting them climb trees like they did<br>in Brockville school there this top<br>school here was a school that just had<br>an entirely flat service so they wanted<br>to build mounds that the kids could jump<br>off roll off etc the loose parts picture<br>was actually a really important part of<br>that it's not risking and the in the<br>wildest sense but basically those logs<br>tires tree trunks whatever ant logs and<br>tires and tree trunks they're a<br>spaceship or these stepping stones to<br>avoid the crocodiles or something else<br>and although the caretakers hated the<br>Missy loose parts they were a<br>fascinating learning environment for<br>children something as simple as not<br>picking up the cat grass it was a mess<br>of attraction to the children yes you<br>did get fart grass throwing at you but<br>you could also hide in a troll in it etc<br>so we had more than eight hundred and<br>children from sixteen schools and<br>Auckland and Otago through a two-year<br>individual the schools really embraced<br>us some of our principals were really<br>gung-ho we had one who was wanting to<br>light fires with children to shake some<br>fire safety went off okay we had another<br>one whose kid was climbing the tree and<br>broke their arm and the parent marched<br>and to Matt demand that the study did<br>not stop because their child had broken<br>their arm because it was a writer petal<br>just I know that's not quite right<br>outside but that was their view we<br>didn't increase physical activity it was<br>now obesity penisy<br>because the kids were doing different<br>activities but there were some really<br>interesting findings around bullying and<br>how the kids were interacting with one<br>another and it was not so much that<br>bullying itself decreased because<br>actually those ma mounds were a goldmine<br>for boys who used to love pushing<br>everyone off the mounds but there was<br>much less reported bullying and the<br>teachers really put that down to<br>increased resilience and the kids they<br>really felt that the kids were able to<br>interact better and just put up with a<br>rough-and-tumble of life a lot more and<br>this project did generate huge media<br>interest as you might expect in<br>particular from this man here who was<br>one of our auckland principals and we<br>filled of calls from all over the world<br>really from media outlets who just loved<br>this idea of having no rules than the<br>school playground<br>we had no negative outcomes really from<br>the study and no negative feedback so it<br>was something that was very well<br>received and essentially cost nothing<br>we've been moved in at that time a few<br>years ago now we started really thinking<br>about earlier obesity prevention so<br>pretty much all the work our group had<br>been doing but also internationally was<br>really in the primary school age group<br>but the sad fact is by the time children<br>in New Zealand are only 2 to 4 years of<br>age 1 &amp; 3 of them are overweight or<br>obese<br>we know treatment is an effective and<br>just about impossible so if we're going<br>to do a beastly prevention let's start<br>earlier so the first of these two<br>studies was the blood study and that I<br>ran when Lewis hey've a colleague and<br>nutrition and many other people here and<br>this was all about how we introduce<br>solids to babies so when I first heard<br>of this one I thought it was kooky airs<br>basically you start off life on milk<br>every single one of you here and at some<br>stage around four to six months of life<br>mum or dad start introducing you to<br>solid foods they generally spoon feed<br>you pureed food couple of days later<br>they'll give you a new food and you<br>gradually increase the variety and<br>texture so but by the time your<br>venters one year of age they're pretty<br>much eating what you do baby led weaning<br>bypasses all that bypasses the spoons<br>bypasses the purees goes straight to the<br>spaghetti bolognaise from six months of<br>age why I was interested from an obesity<br>point of view as the proponents argue<br>that we start off life as infants<br>totally in control of our food intake<br>especially in this day and age with<br>demand feeding we tell them when we want<br>to eat when we've had enough and when we<br>want to eat next<br>but then as parents when we introduce<br>solids we tend to take back that control<br>we tend to feed them because it's tea<br>time because we want them to sleep more<br>through the night because that's the<br>size of the what is baby jar or a whole<br>variety of other reasons in infants when<br>they're spoon fed are often telling us<br>that they've actually had enough they<br>turn their heads they spit it out they<br>throw it over the side but we actually<br>ignore those cues with baby led weaning<br>the baby continues to feed themselves<br>from day one so you put the food on the<br>tray and they actually consume how much<br>they actually want so this did really<br>intrigued me not enough<br>their baby boy number four I could just<br>convince enough Dunedin woman to do it<br>all myself it would be a much easier<br>prospect so we crew recruited 200<br>Dunedin families they were fantastic<br>because these women had to agree to be<br>randomized to either a traditional spoon<br>feeding or a baby lead approach and we<br>knew particularly with your firstborn<br>that's quite a big thing not knowing<br>what you might want to do at the other<br>side so when the infants were 6 7 8 9<br>and 12 months of age we asked the<br>parents how much they were actually<br>feeding themselves and in the blue you<br>can see the ones who are spoon feed so<br>very few Tim percent feeding themselves<br>most or all of their food at 6 months of<br>age but about half by one which is what<br>you'd expect that graduation our bliss<br>babies on the other hand feed most or<br>all of their food three-quarters of them<br>from 6 months of age so they really were<br>adherent to this way of feeding but like<br>many things in the obesity world it was<br>also not the answer to childhood obesity<br>so it didn't actually follow the<br>hypothesis in terms of them having<br>better energy<br>self-regulation or indeed reduced<br>obesity but they actually were bitter<br>eaters and bitter least fussy children<br>is actually a very attractive and<br>appearance of infants that's a it's a<br>big deal so they were less fussy about<br>food they did eat a more varied diet but<br>it was only temporary by the time these<br>kids were two years of age they were<br>really pretty similar to the traditional<br>spoon fed infants oh yeah we finally had<br>a little girl week Fergie joined us in<br>2016 and then the other thing we were<br>able to do in 2016 was spend quite a lot<br>more time and paradise otherwise known<br>and one account where we like to sort of<br>swim and play golf climb small hills and<br>occasionally throw on the beach the<br>other project that really stemmed in<br>there earlier basically prevention space<br>was one that Barry and I ran together<br>with many many colleagues as you can see<br>there and that was our poi study and<br>this was because at the time we were<br>interested in doing a food and activity<br>based intervention and Barry and his<br>team are interested in doing a sleep<br>intervention now Dunedin is pretty small<br>we can't run two studies at once so we<br>joined forces 800 Dunedin woman our<br>families came into the study and either<br>received a fairly conventional and quite<br>intensive food and activity intervention<br>or a very brief sleep intervention so<br>essentially we got this woman and their<br>partners if they had one and when they<br>were in the later stages of their<br>pregnancy and it was all about setting<br>up realistic expectations that yes they<br>were going to be tired for the next<br>whatever length of time and just because<br>auntie barrels could slip through the<br>night at two weeks of age that was<br>actually not normal and so just sort of<br>setting the pace and then when the<br>babies were three weeks of age we went<br>into the homes and looked at where they<br>were sleeping how they were sleeping how<br>they were settling their infant and so<br>on and gave them a bit of advice most of<br>the kids in that sleep group did not see<br>us again after three weeks of age apart<br>from the sort of normal measurements and<br>yet that incredibly brief sleep<br>intervention at two years of age those<br>children who received the sleep<br>intervention had only half the risk of<br>obesity as children who did not receive<br>the sleep intervention so this just<br>shows the BMI z-score which is how we<br>measure relative weight and children and<br>the blue and the kids who got the sleep<br>in the red and the children who didn't<br>get the sleep so that was really<br>intriguing because you know Abby's<br>success for the BCD prevention is not<br>terribly widespread and so we also<br>decided to do a follow-up study when the<br>children were three and a half and five<br>years of age and what was very very<br>novel as the fact that this little<br>difference at the end of the<br>intervention widened effectively and so<br>those intervention benefits were<br>apparent even three years later and<br>remember most of these kids that had<br>nothing nothing since three weeks of age<br>so there's real interest in the role<br>that sleep pace and obesity management<br>and it's only really just come in in the<br>last few years and I really have Barbara<br>and Barry in particular to thank for<br>this interest and sleep it's really<br>become an interest of mine and where all<br>our work at the moment is actually<br>hitting and that's because a big part of<br>it is about increasing our accuracy<br>measurement of sleep because as you can<br>see it's quite easy to cheat and lots of<br>ways and so one of the big studies that<br>we're doing at the moment we've called<br>time to move and the problem with this<br>is it's actually quite difficult to<br>measure every single one of those<br>behaviors physical activity sleep and<br>sedentary time what we tend to use are<br>these accelerometers and you've got a<br>picture of a couple of different ones<br>here what accelerometers do is measure<br>movement so what you get are these sorts<br>of Gress when yes clearly they're<br>playing a game or running around and<br>periods of time where they're not doing<br>as much what you can reasonably assume<br>overnight is that this could went to bed<br>around 8:00 p.m. and got up around 6:00<br>a.m. because you can assume that this<br>was probably sleep a lot of our interest<br>though as looking at daytime activity<br>and it's much harder to assume sleep in<br>the daytime hours is that period of low<br>activity because they're sleeping<br>because they're what<br>in television or because they've<br>actually removed the accelerometer so<br>there are a few kids in the audience not<br>just mine who have been guinea pigs here<br>but we were out taking a very large<br>validation study I'm using much better<br>gold standard measures that have been<br>used in the past to really try and<br>create really good algorithms so we<br>plaster the kids and five different<br>accelerometers and a heart rate monitor<br>for a few days<br>we then measure their sleep by something<br>called polysomnography or PSG now the<br>gold standard of course is to go to a<br>sleep clinic but that's not a terribly<br>natural environment for kids and so you<br>can use portable PSG as someone I know<br>is modeling here it's clearly not a sort<br>of normal sleeping environment but the<br>kids actually do manage this quite well<br>they come into our lab and we get them<br>to run on the treadmill and cycle and<br>run up the stairs<br>and watch some telly and all those sorts<br>of things and we can look at our<br>accelerometer data because we know that<br>that's what it looks like when they're<br>running and so on the problem with this<br>is that running on a treadmill is not a<br>typical child activity and so it doesn't<br>really represent real life activity so<br>what the kids are also doing for us is<br>wearing GoPros for several hours a day<br>so they're worn on the chest facing<br>outwards and you can see very clearly<br>what the kids are actually up to in<br>terms of their activity and that's going<br>to give us much better data in terms of<br>the free living physical activity second<br>other big study that we're doing is that<br>we know sleep is a really important risk<br>factor for obesity but we don't actually<br>know why most of the observational<br>evidence tends to suggest it's more<br>about what you eat then how physically<br>active you are but both of them actually<br>make sense so our dream team as you can<br>see that we call them beer<br>basically we're getting a bunch of kids<br>in them and we're making them<br>sleep-deprived and we're seeing how it<br>changes their eating behaviour so 110<br>children are coming in we measure their<br>normal sleep patterns and that's<br>represented by the green and<br>there we send them away and for a week<br>they go to bed one hour earlier than<br>they normally do to try and extend their<br>sleep and then in another week they go<br>to bed one hour later than they do to<br>try and restrict their sleep so we're<br>essentially trying to create a sleep<br>deficit of around one to two hours<br>now the read represents the restriction<br>condition the yellow the extinction<br>condition and we simply compare these<br>two timeframes seven of these eight<br>pilot children showed a really big<br>difference in their sleep and six of<br>them managed to extend the asleep by<br>some considerable time and that's<br>interesting because these children meet<br>sleep guidelines they weren't sleep<br>deprived to start with suggesting that<br>kids perhaps aren't getting enough sleep<br>as they need to now measuring dietary<br>intake is notoriously difficult and<br>we're looking for very small differences<br>you only need to eat one extra super<br>wine a day to actually gain more than<br>you need to gain several kilograms a<br>year it's obviously very difficult to<br>get that sort of dietary assessment<br>accurately so one of the things we're<br>doing is doing and eating and the<br>absence of hunger and experiment an<br>objective way of trying to see if you<br>pig out more when you're tired so what<br>the kids do at the end of each of those<br>sleep weeks as they come into the lab<br>and they do questionnaires and a variety<br>of other things and then we offer them a<br>feed as you can see there's quite a lot<br>there and they can have a sandwich some<br>fruit some pizza some Cheerios and so on<br>mum and dad at the air if they want to<br>be we then make sure that they're full<br>and that's a very important part of the<br>experiment we then send them away and<br>then 15 minutes later when mum and dad<br>aren't there<br>the second course comes out as you can<br>see it's quite palatable to many people<br>and we've measured each of those foods<br>and that bottom picture incredibly<br>accurately mum and dad aren't there<br>they're left to eat as much as they like<br>and that tells us eating and the absence<br>of hunger because we can measure that<br>very carefully the other thing we're<br>able to do is they're also wearing<br>wearable cameras these are little<br>cameras<br>about the size of a watch that you we<br>are facing out and they're capturing a<br>lot of that head and eating and<br>unobtrusive eating a few like that's<br>very difficult to get in traditional<br>dietary assessment techniques so it's<br>also telling us like the picture here<br>where they might be eating whether this<br>happens to be in the car but perhaps<br>they're eating more meals in front of a<br>television or so on and it also gives<br>you some indication of mealtimes one of<br>the things that silkie one of the PhD<br>students has been working very hard on<br>though as as how what they do is they<br>automatically take a photo every few<br>seconds now the more photos you have of<br>course the more data you have and when<br>you've got a hundred and ten kids in a<br>few days we're talking sort of billions<br>of images just about and obviously<br>managing that data is difficult but it's<br>important because here's a kid who's<br>gone to the cupboard they've grabbed the<br>corn chips they've left the cupboard and<br>now they're sitting down but you can't<br>actually see them eating corn chips so<br>it is important to get your camera data<br>correctly the last one I just want to<br>mention as a study I'm really excited<br>about it isn't actually funded yet so<br>this is wishful thinking in some ways<br>but it's kind of our better science<br>that's very better a better start<br>National Science Challenge work that we<br>hope will go ahead in the second half of<br>this year it's partly based on our poi<br>work but within a bit of start what<br>we're really trying to do is to reduce<br>overweight improve literacy and increase<br>mental health<br>luckily sleep is really involved in each<br>of those behaviors very closely<br>the problem with coin is any problem is<br>that it was really undertaken and<br>predominantly European populations and a<br>lot of the sleep messages that we have<br>really don't fit the lived realities of<br>some farno and so I'm very pleased to be<br>working very closely with Justine in ROS<br>who are here to be doing this very cool<br>project where we're going to develop a<br>sleep and dimension for babies by Marty<br>and Pacifica for Marty and Pacifica and<br>then hopefully roll it out initially<br>through Plunkett and perhaps and other<br>EE providers and so on I just like to<br>think I've worked with some terrific<br>people many of whom I've mentioned<br>specifically by now<br>but I've enjoyed my time at a tire I<br>love my job I still love my job and I've<br>loved it from the start which is a<br>fantastic situation to be and but also<br>like to thank mum and dad of course<br>they've been awesome from day one<br>dad in particular just got a new HEPA<br>two weeks ago so he's made the good<br>effort and to come down from Alex I<br>thinks Gramps to Colleen and John who<br>have always been very welcoming to me<br>into the fourth are now so again thank<br>you very much into my four gorgeous<br>blokes of course that make home life<br>pretty cool as well so thank you very<br>much<br>thank you very much Rachel this was a<br>fantastic presentation my name is Micah<br>Schulz I'm the head of department of<br>medicine and Barry said it quite rightly<br>rachel is somebody who gets things done<br>so there's no surprise rachel is my<br>deputy HRT because there's an HRT you<br>need people who get things done and then<br>they blame somebody else I would like to<br>thank Elsa Elsa<br>despite B's and C's that we've seen here<br>that Rachel achieved you made Rachel to<br>what she is an excellent researcher so I<br>think the the biggest honor goes to you<br>that we have Rachel here today for her<br>appeal<br>we also learned a lot about her research<br>we learned how to get research done<br>despite some ethical concerns I'm not<br>quite sure if you can now they still put<br>kids on trees and let them fall over and<br>report to the Ethics Committee that you<br>broken some some arms but obviously her<br>family wasn't treated any different than<br>her study subjects so that's quite good<br>getting things done I think is is<br>remarkable to get 800 people into<br>studies in a little place like to need<br>an 800 mothers who have possibly<br>completely other concerns then than what<br>you had on your mind and get them<br>motivated and get them to participate in<br>trials I think everybody who's running<br>trials themselves be it with patients or<br>be it with mothers this is absolutely<br>amazing Rachel you looked at three<br>different aspects of why people get<br>obese and I think you we're ahead of<br>your time quite considerably as a<br>gastroenterologist well this is the<br>coming epidemic that we have we have<br>fatty liver disease it's all just a<br>consequence of of being obese and here's<br>Rachel who thought about that some years<br>ago already Rachel thank you very much<br>for your presentation and I hand over to<br>Paul Brunton<br>well see getting things done obviously<br>not Rachel this is a token of<br>appreciation for your wonderful work and<br>congratulations again for reaching<br>professorship thanks very much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
