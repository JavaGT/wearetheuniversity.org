Abbott's productive publication<br>record represents high quality research<br>that has significantly contributed to<br>the advancement of non-surgical<br>management of musculoskeletal disorders<br>and outcome assessment in clinical<br>practice his work has made a substantial<br>impact on instructors and practitioners<br>of orthopedic physical therapy we also<br>learned that dr. Abbott has established<br>himself as a leading clinical researcher<br>in musculoskeletal health research both<br>nationally and internationally he's<br>earned the respect of his peers in the<br>physical therapy profession and has been<br>extremely successful in the advancement<br>of knowledge and has shown outstanding<br>leadership in research so Haxby on<br>behalf of the University of Otago it<br>gives me very great pleasure to<br>congratulate you on your well earned<br>promotion to Professor I will now hand<br>over to the Dean of the Dunedin School<br>of Medicine professor Barry Taylor to<br>tell us just a bit more about Haxby<br>academic journey to Professor noreda<br>cura everybody it's a great pleasure to<br>introduce hex be who's and actually to<br>plot the sort of trajectory of his<br>academic life which is my role in less<br>than five minutes the like our previous<br>IPL from our school serie young who gave<br>her APL two weeks ago<br>hex b was born in a very small town<br>called low cliff which was next to the<br>ranga tata River just south of<br>Christchurch he went to a rural school<br>and then on to watch a key boys high and<br>then finally came to Otago after that so<br>so this is the second person in row<br>who's actually had as initial sort of<br>education and actually a very small<br>school he came to Otago thinking that he<br>might want to do marine biology but<br>ended up doing a physiotherapy degree<br>and then doing some locum rolls around<br>New Zealand I see really across New<br>Zealand in a physiotherapist before<br>going to the States<br>while in the states he got I think<br>turned on to academia and sidetracked<br>into research he proceeded to do a<br>Master of Science in physical therapy<br>and then came back to a target to do his<br>PhD and so in 2005 he graduated with his<br>PhD at Otago and then worked in the<br>school of physiotherapy as a research<br>fellow and then a senior research fellow<br>before transferring to the Dunedin<br>School of Medicine where I've known him<br>really since the about 2010 he started<br>in the department orthopaedics and I was<br>good to see the orthopaedic people here<br>and fairly rapidly moved from senior<br>research fellow to three years later a<br>research associate professor 2013<br>finally making professor last year he's<br>currently the director of the Centre for<br>musculoskeletal research within the<br>orthopedic department and as noted by<br>Harleen there's been I think<br>instrumental in actually showing that a<br>surgical solution is not all you need<br>especially if you've got osteoarthritis<br>and that there's a range of other things<br>that we'll hear about shortly on the<br>academic side he has raised more than<br>ten and a half million in research<br>grants of which seven point eight<br>million were related we where he is<br>actually the the prime investigator or<br>co-prime investigator he supervised<br>eight PhDs seven masters our students<br>and has had several other awards and<br>honors the Cal Smith research medal in<br>particular for early career researcher<br>and also the Sir Charles hircus research<br>fellowship from the Health Research<br>Council is greater than 94 peer-reviewed<br>publications and is that the editor<br>including editor chief of four different<br>journals in his area of expertise so you<br>can see the trajectory not actually the<br>traditional trajectory that you might<br>expect so I expect we're going to learn<br>quite a lot about what was this unique<br>individual who's able to actually almost<br>not fit the early trajectory that we<br>would often see and academics who come<br>from academic family so here's a really<br>interesting story coming to us thank you<br>Kotani TTT card tongue eater car car car<br>tangy hokey aho tena koutou tena koutou<br>tena koutou katoa thank you for the<br>generous introductions and think of the<br>opportunity to speak with you all here<br>tonight thank you to friends and family<br>members were the public colleagues old<br>friends and current students and and the<br>community thank you for for coming along<br>and sharing this event with me what I'd<br>like to share with you today is not just<br>some highlights of the research that<br>I've been working on but a little bit<br>about what drives me maybe a little bit<br>about how I ended up doing what I'm<br>doing and what it means to me and what<br>next so but first we are asked when<br>giving these inaugural professorial<br>lectures to give a little bit of our<br>academic journey our research journey<br>this is a billboard from the campus of<br>the University Amsterdam where I had the<br>privilege of doing a short sabbatical<br>they have quite a few of these dotted<br>about the campus all with wise of<br>inspirational quotes about people's<br>reflections on their their academic<br>journey the pathways to wisdom and<br>knowledge and it's important to<br>acknowledge that one never gets to to<br>this place without a lot of help from a<br>lot of goodwill and a lot of good people<br>over a long period of time<br>and so all of you who appear on the<br>slide I thank you very much and I really<br>appreciate all of your help and support<br>over the years and I've also had not<br>just the privilege but the great benefit<br>of working beside a lot of great people<br>worked alongside and and still some more<br>that I've missed and I apologize 20 that<br>I've missed and I thank you all very<br>much this is the wonderful group of<br>young people that I work with at the<br>moment they are bright and humble and<br>hard-working<br>and really a joy to work with and you'll<br>see some of their work and this<br>evening's lecture as a research-only<br>academic I am profoundly grateful to the<br>research funders who have supported my<br>research who have assessed and then<br>backed some of my ideas and proposals<br>and advanced training and without this<br>and I'm grateful to some inspirational<br>teachers along the way a few of whom<br>I'll mention tonight and there have been<br>many more and also two inspirational<br>colleagues perhaps as a few here in the<br>audience tonight who have have come on<br>this journey with me but I'd also like<br>to thank this University for giving me<br>the freedom to pursue my own research<br>directions to pursue my own footsteps<br>and firstly as a PhD students then at<br>the school of physiotherapy as an early<br>career academic and more recently in the<br>past nine years or so at the Dunedin<br>School of Medicine it's a great<br>university to work in a beautiful campus<br>and a wonderful wonderful part of the<br>world and most importantly I'd like to<br>thank my family for all of the love and<br>joy you have brought and the support<br>you've given through the tough times and<br>the disappointments and the pride and<br>joy that you've shared with me through<br>the the triumphs especially my wonderful<br>beautiful wife Sarah for keeping me<br>grounded and reminding me to realize<br>what are the important things of all of<br>those important of life and to keep a<br>balance and all of those important<br>things and to make sure I smell the<br>roses and enjoy the journey along the<br>so to my research journey I didn't set<br>out to be a clinical epidemiologist or<br>any kind of health researcher or any<br>kind of health professional really as<br>very SID I um I started out I was<br>brought up on a mixed cropping and sheep<br>farm in rural mud Canterbury<br>I enjoyed the farm I enjoyed the animals<br>and operating machinery and the outside<br>the fresh year and I was very fortunate<br>that my father did not impose<br>expectations on me that that I was you<br>know to be a farmer and take over the<br>farm and I had freedom to to find my own<br>pathway and I was captivated as a youth<br>by the underwater world of Jacques<br>Cousteau and so by the end of high<br>school I had my scuba diving ticket and<br>I was off to the University of Otago to<br>study marine biology until two separate<br>careers advisors said no no that's not a<br>good idea<br>there are five too many marine<br>biologists and not enough jobs and so I<br>arrived a university a little bit with a<br>little bit of indecision a little bit<br>directionless and ended up enrolling in<br>an eclectic mix of arts and science<br>papers which which was a wonderful<br>experience and I'm glad that I did and I<br>was perhaps a wonderful expression of my<br>newfound freedom coming from a<br>relatively conservative boys boarding<br>school farming background to be in like<br>the academic sweet shop of a university<br>and being able to sample all that was<br>available here to see and learn and<br>experience to the stay the most<br>inspiring teachers I think I've worked<br>from that first year and I think of<br>Charles Higham and Helen leach from<br>anthropology 101 102 and somebody<br>possibly Jeff white from psychology one<br>one one and one one two<br>and but 1986 and 1987 were perhaps more<br>than academically expensive they were<br>socially expensive at Simon College so<br>now Simon Hall them Simon Hall I met<br>some physiotherapy students they were<br>fun than quite lovely I never heard of<br>physiotherapy before but I kind of like<br>the sound of what they were doing you<br>know it was it was helping people<br>constructively it was sort of physical<br>and it was sort of mechanical but with<br>human levers and hinges and bellows and<br>wiring and and so I I decided to apply<br>and on my second attempt I got in in the<br>mean time I did a second year at<br>University and physical education in<br>order to do the anatomy and physiology<br>papers so it was there the first year<br>student at Tiger Polytechnic third year<br>tertiary student that I discovered that<br>I thought I liked teaching and and that<br>I enjoyed teaching and I'd covered the<br>anatomy and physiology material of the<br>year before and some of my classmates in<br>my tutorial groups were you know feeling<br>a bit all a little overwhelmed and I<br>enjoyed helping them learn and helping<br>them to make it seem logical and as it<br>turned out that was one of the most<br>formative experiences of my career but<br>by the time I got to my fourth year as a<br>tertiary student second year and Oh<br>Tiger polytechnics physiotherapy had<br>gone from the the structure of boarding<br>school to the freedom of university I<br>was feeling frustrated by the relatively<br>more insular apprentice like environment<br>that I felt that I was in and I was<br>Restless constrained rebellious<br>I failed that year so I did what any<br>self-respecting OTO scarfie would do I<br>took a gap year joined up with some<br>friends wore women's Underpants on the<br>outside of my and took a road trip<br>I returned completed the course<br>graduated practice for a few months in<br>Dunedin Hospital Ashburton Hospital<br>before setting off for America<br>there I got wide experience traveled and<br>felt competent in and felt well trained<br>and perhaps more so than I'd given her<br>Tiger Polytechnic credit for and was<br>grateful I pursued a master's degree<br>there began teaching in ship at the<br>University of st. Augustine and I<br>enjoyed the teaching I was passionate<br>about being good at it<br>I wasn't at first I was terrible<br>self-conscious nervous I have an old<br>video of one of my first lectures I've<br>saved you the pain of watching it but I<br>became good at it<br>I was diligent had high standards was<br>perhaps a bit too earnest but I wasn't<br>yet thirty and I was in the process of<br>doing that master's degree in order to<br>be qualified to teach that I discovered<br>research and I found that as as much as<br>I was enjoying teaching her I was I was<br>really digging this research so my wife<br>and I returns to New Zealand's to be<br>recycled students at Otago ceará for a<br>second career in medicine and me to take<br>on the new challenge of a PhD and I'm<br>very grateful for the opportunity to do<br>the PhD in the department of anatomy and<br>structural biology where I got such a<br>valuable grounding and good quality<br>science biological science and it was<br>during these years that I encountered<br>some other great teachers because I I've<br>always felt that a person should get a<br>good grounding in the area that they're<br>their own really stuff foundational<br>stuff and so I felt well you know if I'm<br>gonna get a doctorate in philosophy then<br>which in a little bit that philosophy so<br>I rolled in philosophy 100 well not 102<br>epistemology it was and there I<br>encountered Ellen Musgrave and all his<br>wisdom and gravitas and also pursued<br>some courses and epidemiology and<br>biostatistics even though coursework is<br>not really encouraged at the University<br>of a toe or a New Zealand PhD but I'm so<br>glad I did it was really variable and<br>it's really set the foundation for my<br>research career and training to be a<br>clinical epidemiologist and working with<br>with numbers and data and and the basis<br>of new knowledge so how do we know<br>things well there are many ways to<br>approach this talk to Professor<br>Maclaurin after the class but I was<br>particularly interested in the<br>philosophy of scientific experimentation<br>of cause and effect of interventions and<br>outcomes in healthcare interventions now<br>in order to tell whether a treatment has<br>been effective in a in a patient we<br>could either do something like take a<br>sample of that population let's say<br>people with osteoarthritis and provide a<br>treatment and then over the course of<br>time we can measure the effects of that<br>treatment and we might think that we are<br>seeing the effects of the treatment but<br>but really we're not because that could<br>just be the passage of time you know<br>maybe the people are going to get bit<br>here anyway maybe that would have been<br>better without the treatment and so well<br>what about comparing two treatments we<br>could compare two treatments and over<br>there check their effects over the<br>passage of the same amount of time but<br>still that wouldn't give us a solid<br>foundation of knowing whether the<br>difference is really from the two<br>different treatments or perhaps the<br>people that ended up<br>one treatment were the fitter younger<br>less severe patients and you know the<br>older more severe ones with<br>comorbidities and and crumbly joints<br>within the other treatment and they<br>weren't the same they weren't balanced<br>and then we wouldn't really they would<br>bias the results so here is where we<br>introduced the magic of randomization<br>and the intention of randomization is to<br>ensure that the people that are randomly<br>allocated to each of the two groups<br>equivalent in all manner of factors that<br>might influence their outcome like for<br>example their age their height their<br>weight their sex their severity of their<br>disease how long they've had the disease<br>what are the diseases they have etc and<br>so that way when we look at the<br>difference in effects we can be much<br>more sure that the difference really is<br>to the only thing that should be<br>different between those two groups and<br>there does the treatment they've got so<br>we can also apply this to economic<br>evaluations and in this case we're not<br>only assistir fix over time but we look<br>at the costs as well as the effects over<br>time and the outcome is that the<br>difference in costs divided by the<br>difference and effects and I've had the<br>opportunity to conduct a number of<br>physical of randomized controlled trials<br>over my career and to do with plantar<br>heel pain and elbow pain and back pain<br>and several and osteoarthritis including<br>this one which in which we showed that<br>the people who received the three<br>physiotherapy intervention programs that<br>we provided got a bitter outcome than<br>those who had the usual care alone and<br>those outcomes seem to be still<br>improving at two years follow-up even<br>though all of the treatment was only<br>provided in the first year now<br>because I I don't want to bore those of<br>you in the audience who have seen civil<br>of the other trials and their outcomes<br>etc before I'll skip to the new stuff<br>and this because I'm always excited<br>about the future and so this is a graph<br>of the quality of life that people<br>experience over a period of time where<br>higher numbers higher quality of life so<br>as we can see this here is the usual<br>care group this is the usual way the old<br>way and what we can see is people stayed<br>much the same in the first year got a<br>little bitter hardly at all the first<br>year a little worse at the second year<br>they improved it they seem to improve<br>slightly over the five years of<br>follow-up but probably that is<br>interventions that they receive<br>subsequent to the trial for example<br>joint replacement surgery and this is<br>the most effective intervention from our<br>trial their exercise therapy and we can<br>see that the difference here is the<br>difference in health-related quality of<br>life so we can conclude that we made a<br>difference I'm very proud of the fact<br>that we made a difference for the 150 or<br>so people in the trial that received the<br>interventions particularly the 50 or so<br>that received this most effective one<br>but if that's where it stops then that<br>would be that limited wouldn't it you<br>know it wouldn't be a great impact if<br>that was all that it touched those<br>people were all that it touched so this<br>isn't what drives me what drives me is<br>the fact that we could get this<br>difference and a lot of people if we<br>were able to get these people that get<br>the treatment delivered to all of those<br>who needed it and who wish to receive it<br>so I really wanted to get these research<br>findings implemented and I tried this in<br>several ways the most conventional is to<br>to write about it still go to<br>conferences to talk about it and that<br>can make a little bit of a change as<br>we'll see shortly secondly I tried to<br>get a bigger trial and implementation<br>trial in primary care where we set up a<br>specialized clinic for patients with<br>osteoarthritis delivered the<br>interventions and were able to show what<br>the cost and effects were in a real<br>primary care environment and thirdly I<br>pitched the idea to the hospital for<br>what we called the joint clinic which<br>aims to serve the unmet need of patients<br>referred with in staged Happiny<br>osteoarthritis but we're not severe<br>enough to be offered surgery with the<br>southern dhb we got some funding from<br>the National Health Board to set that up<br>and it's now provided consultation and<br>treatment to around 700 people as a<br>researcher what I would really like to<br>see what the funders of research want to<br>see what all stakeholders in research<br>want to see is impact for the research<br>to change things now I mentioned earlier<br>that I tried to get a bigger trial<br>funded implementation trial and I tried<br>over four years to get that trial funded<br>and I got what I thought were good<br>reviews but it never quite made the cut<br>I failed to get that off the ground so I<br>thought to myself well if they won't<br>fund me to do a real trial what if I<br>pitch the idea of doing a simulated<br>trial so computer simulation modeling is<br>as a way of lifting the curtain on an<br>alternate reality what would be the<br>costs and the effects or the outcomes if<br>we were to have chosen a little front<br>path if we were to do something<br>differently and I like to think of it as<br>an appeal<br>simulation modeling is used in things<br>like with a prediction and predicting<br>what would be the outcomes of<br>overfishing or of climate change and<br>it's always based on real data observed<br>data the highest quality observed data<br>that one can find and I like to think of<br>it as kind of like a trial of virtual<br>trial standing on the shoulders of many<br>existing real trials all of those<br>standing on the shoulders of our<br>knowledge about the course of disease<br>its symptoms the costs and effects all<br>standing on the shoulders of detailed<br>knowledge of the target population and<br>the underlying population from from<br>which they come here's how it works<br>first of all we start with as accurate<br>as possible description of our<br>underlying population a description of<br>the age sex ethnicity of the base<br>population what proportion have the<br>disease the distribution of BMI among<br>those with the disease and those without<br>the disease and they enter the<br>simulation model the simulation model<br>has annual transitions of health states<br>that our model the disease progress of<br>osteoarthritis for those who have<br>osteoarthritis or simply follow the<br>observed base underlying costs and<br>effects that are accrued over a person's<br>lifetime through background healthcare<br>background health losses onset of<br>diseases according to their risk of<br>disease probability of degrees of<br>disease onset probability of disease<br>progression and we can overlay the<br>effects of treatment and then over the<br>patient's the simulated patients<br>lifetime we add up the accumulated costs<br>and effects on quality of life over each<br>year of modeled life<br>until death or until they turn 100 which<br>becomes first and then we start with a<br>new simulated patient and these<br>simulated patients are randomly drawn<br>from the underlying population now we<br>can do one of these virtual trials with<br>about a million people in each group<br>overnight and then when we come back to<br>work in the morning the results and the<br>Inbox Thank You Ross and whereas the<br>moer trial it took us a year to recruit<br>200 people and a year to deliver the<br>interventions and a year to follow them<br>up at one year and then so on until five<br>years took about five years to get the<br>data on 200 people so I'm going to heal<br>myself so what we can use this for is to<br>look at what would be the effects at the<br>population level if we were to do things<br>differently and based on what has been<br>observed before in real trials of real<br>people with real comparisons in the real<br>world<br>in other words to answer the question<br>what if we were to do things differently<br>so let's start with just that first<br>trial the Moller trial which had 206<br>people if we look at just the observed<br>data on those 206 people of both their<br>health effects and their costs not just<br>the cost of providing the intervention<br>but all healthcare costs and not just<br>all healthcare not just all healthcare<br>costs but also social costs like their<br>loss of productivity and loss of income<br>and costs out-of-pocket expenses for the<br>disease and transport to health events<br>etc and what we saw what could we see in<br>these observed data as this cost savings<br>yes it does cost money to deliver the<br>intervention but what we found was that<br>it more than recouped the costs<br>providing intervention through savings<br>and other areas of the healthcare system<br>we saw almost a third of a healthy year<br>gained per person and calculate three<br>million dollars of net monetary benefit<br>assuming the value of a healthy life<br>being at the conventional rate of one<br>times GDP per capita per year which is a<br>conventional metric so I mean this<br>looked pretty good really doesn't it<br>about a three dollar 50/50 value for<br>each dollar and Vista because the trial<br>itself cost about 850,000 but oh hang on<br>that's just these people over just five<br>years yet we saw that the afix over five<br>years the lines were pretty parallel<br>they weren't getting closer together<br>anytime soon and the same thing has been<br>observed in a similar trial and the UK<br>so what if we were to model the ongoing<br>costs and effects over the lifetime of<br>these military participants right<br>through their expected lifespan under<br>the assumptions of the individual<br>lasting five years the intervention<br>lasting degrading over time and to<br>mentioned lasting throughout their<br>lifetime at the same difference to usual<br>care well but hang on hasn't the mower<br>trial had further impact than that<br>haven't we've we've delivered these<br>interventions to other people well yes<br>we did the demo trial here under need<br>another 75 people we did a a parallel<br>trial in the United States of 300 people<br>using exactly the same protocols the<br>Melbourne hip trial used our protocols<br>from the mower trial Dunedin Hospital<br>used the intervention protocols and<br>their outpatients it formed the basis of<br>the interventions provided for the joint<br>clinic and some other programs who were<br>applying to a Ministry of Health pilot<br>program<br>called the mobility Action Plan they<br>approached us and asked for our<br>protocols as the basis of what they<br>would deliver for that program so with<br>my colleague dr. Ross Wilson we thought<br>we'd do a bit of an exercise in adding<br>up what would be the costs and effects<br>of the direct impact of the mower trial<br>well first of all we didn't count the<br>ones that we did overseas and we didn't<br>count the Dunedin Hospital outpatients<br>because we couldn't get the numbers out<br>of a system we only counted 340 or so of<br>the joint clinic ones whom we had<br>followed up for two years but there had<br>been more that haven't got through to<br>follow up yet so that's about 2,300 and<br>we estimated the the costs and effects<br>over the time to date as well as what<br>they would be over the longer term and<br>so here's what we find we find that the<br>mower trial itself here in the blue<br>provides these cussin effects and then<br>those on top of that is the demo trial<br>and then on top of that is the joint<br>clinic and then on top of that is the<br>mobility Action Program providers that<br>have used our protocols and what we see<br>from this is that where the real impact<br>comes is through implementation if we<br>were able to get uptake if we were able<br>to communicate the value of what we're<br>doing and get the implementation that's<br>where we get the gains and so what would<br>those gains look like well now we're<br>talking about 1,500 years of healthy<br>life gained and about a hundred and<br>forty million of NIT monetary benefit<br>can be traced back under those<br>assumptions to the start of that of that<br>series of work and so you know that's<br>better that's like 165 dollars return<br>for each dollar invested in the trial<br>and what this shows that is that if we<br>can get the results of research into<br>practice if we can implement them if we<br>can deliver them we can show some pretty<br>appreciable impact to to people to the<br>community to a health care system into<br>society if ah if only if only we can get<br>it delivered and our health care system<br>at the moment is not delivering to any<br>great extent those things that are the<br>most effective and most cost effective<br>and the most highly recommended by all<br>of the international clinical practice<br>guidelines and international experts and<br>that is the two most highly recommended<br>things are supervised exercise therapy<br>and weight loss programs for those who<br>for whom it's appropriate so why aren't<br>we doing that well there are a number of<br>barriers really to the delivering<br>evidence-based care we've got at<br>multiple levels what consumers prefer<br>what patients value what providers offer<br>what experts recommends what healthcare<br>systems are willing to pay for and what<br>can be delivered within the healthcare<br>structure hmm<br>so what a what if we asked these<br>stakeholders what they value and prefer<br>in terms of delivering and receiving<br>here and so yes we did this analysis<br>work by PhD student Jason wah we we<br>recruited people from these the<br>stakeholder group and over a process of<br>research this is what we found that<br>these are the things that they value<br>and prefer the most an order of<br>preference with the preference waiting<br>for each attribute of an intervention so<br>what if we apply this to the evidence<br>about how strongly each intervention<br>scores on these attributes and so we've<br>done this and put it all together and a<br>very nice interactive web table<br>developed by dr. Ross Wilson and what<br>this shows is that here for early<br>osteoarthritis we see a kind of a<br>mismatch between what people value and<br>prefer and what is effective and what<br>really gets delivered in the healthcare<br>system and it goes both ways because<br>weight loss is really not featuring here<br>and what people prefer and value but it<br>is one of the most highly recommended<br>and most effective interventions so<br>there's a mismatch between what we need<br>to deliver and what we are delivering<br>and here what we can and this is an<br>order of priority and what we see is<br>actually the exercise therapy's four out<br>of the top five and for early<br>intervention and for late intervention<br>late stage osteoarthritis joint<br>replacement surgery probably should be<br>number one really a bit suspicious about<br>the underlying data for from the very<br>few trials about Tai Chi and better dat<br>vo it's an effective intervention as an<br>exercise based intervention but the<br>preferences are very very similar<br>for those two interventions but we focus<br>so much on one and not so much on the<br>other and the the beauty of the methods<br>that we've gone about doing this and the<br>way that we're conveying them is that<br>these tables and these data can be<br>updated they as new evidence comes to<br>light and as new interventions become<br>available and new interventions<br>will become available I get mailed from<br>time to time from from from patients and<br>members of the public suggesting I I do<br>research on a treatment they're<br>enthusiastic about I've got one others<br>dis is here actually and this is from a<br>lady in North Otago who who recommends a<br>treatment that's not on one about their<br>tables doesn't currently feature on our<br>tables of evidence but she claims it's<br>highly effective<br>she says that I'd like to tell you about<br>something I've discovered that takes all<br>my pain away she says I am 65 years old<br>I couldn't knit for 10 years with this<br>damn arthritis please try this yourself<br>you'll be amazed with the results<br>cannabis butter she doesn't smoke it she<br>tried smoking it made it worse but so<br>she she bakes it into muffins and she<br>has a muffin for breakfast and one for<br>morning tea she says I will continue to<br>do this even though I understand<br>cannabis is illegal and I she says I all<br>I need is five plants and I grow them<br>behind my truck house I won't include my<br>name and address because I may get some<br>trouble for this but I feel some<br>research must be done on this miracle<br>plant so as we get more evidence about<br>more treatments we can assist them on<br>the same yardsticks as the existing<br>evidence and include them on the same<br>league table that we have populated with<br>the evidence from the Royal Australian<br>general practitioners clinical<br>guidelines and if we were to deliver the<br>two most effective most recommended<br>interventions that feature on not just<br>the most recent guidelines the Royal<br>Australian College of General<br>Practitioners one but all the<br>international us<br>to arthritis research society ones us/uk<br>and those are again supervised exercise<br>therapy and weight loss where indicated<br>then this would be the projected<br>healthcare quality of life gains now it<br>looks like you know a reasonably slim<br>line but at the population level it's<br>actually a very large amount because<br>osteoarthritis is so common and it<br>affects people over such a long period<br>of time and the difference amounts to<br>three hundred fifty thousand years of<br>healthy life and the NIP monetary<br>benefit of delivering those<br>interventions in terms of the healthy<br>life years gained valued at one times<br>GDP per capita per year<br>minus the health care costs of<br>delivering those interventions is around<br>ten point nine billion so that goes to<br>thinking what if we could better<br>estimate what were the health care gains<br>and and costs because our model and<br>these estimates don't really capture all<br>of the health care savings or of the<br>health gains in in good detail and so we<br>have looked at what if we could estimate<br>the first-line intervention for people<br>with hip or knee osteoarthritis that<br>supervised exercise therapy using data<br>generated here in New Zealand from a<br>high quality randomized controlled trial<br>that compared the intervention with<br>usual care and we overlay that with all<br>of the underlying<br>health care costs of the population<br>within the New Zealand healthcare system<br>and then modeled the outcomes over time<br>and and this is what we'd find a knit<br>lifetime benefit of close to 20 billion<br>of the 2013 adult population of around<br>about 2.7 million and of those around<br>about 640,000 would sometime over their<br>lifetime become eligible for the<br>intervention and about two-thirds would<br>accept it and take it up those are the<br>assumptions of this analysis and that<br>would result based on the cost savings<br>we observed in the five-year trial right<br>here in Dunedin lifetime cost savings to<br>the healthcare system and yes it costs<br>money to provide the interventions but<br>again those costs more than recouped<br>through savings and other areas of the<br>healthcare system so what will it take<br>for us to do this to do it differently<br>to deliver these these potential<br>benefits well I think we need to<br>restructure the healthcare system just a<br>little bit so that the interventions<br>that are most recommended by the<br>International clinical practice<br>guidelines with the best evidence and<br>those that people delivering and<br>receiving the interventions value and<br>prefer if we restructure so that those<br>can be made available within the<br>healthcare system then and then we need<br>to ensure they are delivered well the so<br>my aim is to communicate the impact to<br>policymakers and we're going to do this<br>through a we're writing up a<br>a briefing document for the ministry at<br>the moment based on the findings of our<br>of our modeling research and the basis<br>of the clinical trial research earlier<br>and some of the observations from other<br>trials around the world and then here's<br>my plan I'd like to roll out nationwide<br>some training for providers on how to<br>deliver what people value and prefer and<br>what works best in a way that is it is<br>most effective and then I plan to reach<br>out to the community and to raise health<br>literacy about osteoarthritis to<br>communicate our findings and our<br>recommendations not just to the<br>policymakers but also to to people<br>suffering from osteoarthritis in easy to<br>access language language people can<br>understand to connect with people who<br>are unable to access the healthcare that<br>they need providers that are unable to<br>get people the health care that they<br>would prefer and value and to do this<br>I'm going to go on another road trip the<br>tour I'll tell Roy is a three thousand<br>kilometer bicycle adventure from Cape<br>May now to the bluff and in mid-february<br>to mid-march next year they hold the<br>biennial Tour altero a river which is a<br>an event where all of the riders have to<br>as individuals ride the whole course<br>unsupported continuously within a<br>timeframe of between 10 and 30 days I<br>intend to take 30 days and along the way<br>I'm going I plan to hold five or six<br>public lectures in town halls in terms<br>up and down the length of our beautiful<br>country<br>- to reach out to the community about<br>about healthcare and about how to<br>improve the the symptoms and the fix of<br>osteoarthritis and I intend to use this<br>event to help to raise some funds to<br>fund some of the impact activities to<br>try to get implementation from the<br>research that we've already done because<br>you know that's what we all what we want<br>to see a change being made and and to<br>further impact implementation and<br>outreach so I hope you'll support me in<br>that effort so thank you very much for<br>your attention tonight<br>I've focused a lot on the future but in<br>the grounding of what research we have<br>done in the past and because I'm I'm<br>always excited about the future and I'm<br>looking forward to spending it here at<br>the university thank you<br>you know screeners on sorry yeah your<br>flexibility and your change in those<br>early years has carried through and the<br>attributes you've demonstrated in your<br>research and two things sort of strike<br>me one has obviously impact that you've<br>demonstrated that it's about making<br>modest differences and a common<br>condition to a large number of people<br>and some of you who's sitting in the<br>audience getting to my age enough have<br>probably already got some creaky joints<br>and a lot of you are going to get them<br>in the future so this will be important<br>to to many of us and you've demonstrated<br>obviously the economic benefits of the<br>country as well as the quality of life<br>benefits I think another important<br>attribute that's come out that is<br>something I admire and you as resilience<br>and it takes resilience to be successful<br>in getting external grant funding and XP<br>has been very good at that and as a head<br>of department there makes you smile<br>because external grant funding comes<br>with overheads and it makes the coffers<br>good and it gives the department a bit<br>of flexibility and also XP and in his<br>research so he's been successful in that<br>area and also starting in physiotherapy<br>and then through Anatomy and then into<br>surgery it is difficult to negotiate<br>people that think can come from<br>different paradigms and he's done that<br>as these moves to his career and he<br>works with surgeons who I guess where<br>we're very easy people I think to get<br>along with and<br>I guess you know that there's always the<br>Big Bang of the hip replacement to get<br>rid of your arthritis and make it much<br>better but that comes with pain and<br>costs and not everybody wants that and<br>not everyone needs it and so xbe has put<br>himself in a position where he's<br>juxtaposed to completely different sort<br>of you know cut to cure mentality versus<br>a physical therapy and yet done that<br>successfully in in flourished and so<br>thank you very much for being in our<br>department for delivering your lecturer<br>and being an outstanding researcher and<br>fully deserved of being professor</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
