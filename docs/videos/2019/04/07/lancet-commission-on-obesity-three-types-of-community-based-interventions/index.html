This video clip briefly describes the characteristics of the three main types of approaches: Package Testing; Capacity Building; Systems-Based.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

reduce<br>childhood obesity this is covered in The<br>Lancet Commission on obesity report and<br>I'd like to expand on the<br>characteristics of three broad<br>approaches we described in that report<br>so here I show a linear logic model<br>showing the proposed pathways which an<br>intervention would reduce childhood<br>obesity the factors related to<br>individuals are shown in the shaded<br>boxes to achieve BMI change we expect<br>that this will require behavior change<br>and that in turn will require changes in<br>predisposition such as attitudes<br>knowledge and beliefs and changes in<br>food and physical activity environments<br>we call interventions at this level<br>package delivery because they are<br>usually a package of interventions pre<br>developed by academics containing for<br>example things like curriculum materials<br>cooking programs funding to start school<br>gardens and so on the package of<br>strategies is usually implemented with<br>fidelity in a short-term controlled<br>trial setting until the grant finishes<br>and then the package is delivered no<br>more most studies reported in the<br>literature are like this and while they<br>can help to answer important questions<br>hardly any of these programs even if<br>they're successful ever rolled out to<br>scale in this table from the Lancer<br>report we summarize the characteristics<br>of the three approaches and you can see<br>the package delivery approach tests the<br>impacts of the package and is largely<br>designed and often delivered by experts<br>with some input from the community the<br>study design can often be robust like a<br>cluster randomized control trial which<br>gives its strong internal validity<br>meaning that we can have confidence that<br>the results from the study reflect the<br>true changes due to the intervention<br>however its external validity or its<br>relevance to the real-world intervention<br>and the potential for wide application<br>is often marginal<br>by shifting the focus of the<br>intervention a little deeper we get the<br>community capacity building approach<br>which means the actual intervention if<br>it is on strengthening leadership<br>building relationships mobilizing<br>resources UPS killing people and doing<br>the monitoring and evaluation these are<br>the capacity building blocks which<br>support the community to find its own<br>solutions this approach<br>seems to be very successful for reducing<br>childhood obesity in some communities<br>but for those who need it the most such<br>as specific communities three years of<br>this community capacity building<br>approach was not enough to reduce<br>adolescent obesity you can see the<br>characteristics of the capacity-building<br>approach in the middle column of the<br>table it's much more engaging and<br>empowering of the community the<br>quasi-experimental designs of having a<br>few communities as intervention sites<br>and a few others as comparisons does<br>weaken the internal of validity but this<br>approach is strong proof of principle<br>for real-world conditions that could be<br>applied at scale the third type of<br>intervention is systems based we're at<br>the early stages in obesity prevention<br>and testing this approach but it has<br>several added advantages broader systems<br>such as culture the natural systems and<br>in particular community contexts are<br>much more readily included in the<br>interventions the real added value of a<br>systems approach is that the problem of<br>childhood obesity is seen for what it is<br>the unwanted but inevitable consequence<br>of multiple complex adaptive systems the<br>food system for example is a set of<br>feedback systems based on supply and<br>demand and profit generation this<br>inevitably leads to food environments<br>which are increasingly dominated by high<br>profit ultra-processed foods designed to<br>be ultra palatable convenient and with<br>long shelf lives in other words by<br>design the food system is creating<br>obesogenic food and<br>violence now community members can<br>really work through a guided process<br>called<br>group model building to create systems<br>maps of the causes of childhood obesity<br>in their community this allows them to<br>not only better understand the problem<br>but also to identify the most effective<br>leverage points for reorienting some of<br>those systems for example school food<br>systems towards creating healthy<br>outcomes for the students the<br>characteristics of the systems based<br>approach are shown here and it's<br>important to note that the intervention<br>is explicitly about reorienting existing<br>systems and that the role of the expert<br>is to support the group model building<br>process and the systems mapping and to<br>do the evaluation but not to do the<br>interventions themselves so that was a<br>quick Whistlestop tour of the evolution<br>of thinking and implementing<br>community-based interventions to reduce<br>childhood obesity while there will<br>continue to be some need to test<br>specific packages of interventions in<br>controlled trials I hope that most of<br>the future research on community-based<br>interventions will use these newer<br>systems methods because they offer the<br>most promise for sustained cost<br>effective and at scale approaches to</p></main><footer
