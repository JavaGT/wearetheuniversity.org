are regular attendees of these I pls<br>have heard me say many many times the<br>path to Professor is not an easy one in<br>order to receive this promotion the<br>individual must demonstrate excellence<br>in teaching in research and in service<br>to the university and to the wider<br>community now as you will learn from<br>Hazel's lecture this evening she is an<br>effective and creative and motivating<br>teacher she's an outstanding researcher<br>and she has provided exemplary service<br>to her department to the University and<br>to the wider research community so hazel<br>on behalf of the university of otago it<br>gives me great pleasure to congratulate<br>you on your very well-deserved promotion<br>to Professor and I will now call on the<br>PVC of commerce professor Robin Gould to<br>tell us just a little bit more about<br>Hazel's journey to Professor noreda tena<br>well 10 okoto Tenneco<br>10 DeCoteau katoa very very warm welcome<br>to you all here this evening it really<br>is wonderful to see you all here to<br>celebrate and join in on the occasion of<br>Hazel's fili new title of professor here<br>at the University of Otago and the<br>University of Otago business school so<br>three warm congratulations hazel and I'm<br>very pleased to see you all here tonight<br>so just to begin with a little bit about<br>Hazel's background so professor hazel<br>Tucker<br>she's now routinely referred to came to<br>the University of Otago from the UK<br>where she received first of all a BSC<br>with honours and behavioral sciences<br>from the University of Huddersfield in<br>1988 followed by an MA in anthropology<br>from Durham University in 1995 and then<br>a PhD also from Durham in 1999 1999 now<br>in 1989 shortly after her be ace BSC<br>professor Tucker took up a role as<br>teacher of English as a foreign language<br>in Turkey and this stimulated a<br>long-standing subsequent interest in<br>research in Turkey trekking long-term<br>tourism development and social change in<br>the Cappadocia region this research has<br>focused over the years on world heritage<br>values rural community entrepreneurial<br>development gender and poverty<br>alleviation and tourism Refugee<br>interactions she also in the period<br>after her initial visit Turkey<br>taught English and Singapore and then in<br>Japan before commencing her MA and PhD<br>degrees at Durham now hazel here at OU<br>Tago has served in various roles since<br>joining us in 2000 she rose from<br>initially lecturer then senior lecturer<br>before in 2010 being promoted to<br>associate professor she served as head<br>of department of tourism from 2012 for<br>three years through 2015 and in the<br>period since she's been here she's<br>supervised twenty five PhD students<br>including currently around six of those<br>students seven master's research<br>students and eighteen dissertations in<br>her time so it's quite a hefty<br>supervision load by any account she's<br>taught classes at undergraduate and<br>postgraduate level including<br>development and teaching over the last<br>five years of a 400 level so that's a<br>graduate level field school paper taking<br>classes to northern Thailand which was<br>just mentioned before each time for four<br>weeks a year and this has also resulted<br>in a book chapter on the use of<br>ethnography for teaching and learning<br>purposes now professor Tucker has a<br>distinguished research career with<br>multiple international collaborations<br>these include with researchers in China<br>at China's top university that's Peking<br>University which also has involved a<br>visiting fellowship at the New Zealand<br>Centre she's also worked was with<br>researchers in Japan and Iran the<br>Netherlands the UK and of course Turkey<br>her research has resulted in numerous<br>publications including her sole authored<br>book living with tourism negotiating<br>identities in a Turkish village which<br>was published by round lodge<br>she's edited two volumes of book<br>chapters including introductory chapters<br>and concluding chapters 23 book chapters<br>and 32 peer-reviewed journal articles<br>now it's this and other work along with<br>the work of her colleagues that has<br>helped build a stunning reputation of<br>our tourism department here in the<br>business school at the University of<br>Otago which sits somewhere depending<br>upon which rankings you look at between<br>about fifth and 15th and the world so<br>we're very very proud of that department<br>and it's also one of only three world<br>leisure organisation centres of<br>excellence and the only one in the<br>asia-pacific region<br>now professor Tucker's work has gained<br>significant international recognition<br>she's been invited as an earmark of that<br>and given eight conference keynote<br>addresses international conferences and<br>countries from turkeys through<br>Scandinavia and the UK and so forth she<br>serves on the advisory board of nine<br>international academic journals and is<br>also associate editor of the annals of<br>tourism research which is amongst the<br>highest ranked and a leading<br>international journal in the field now<br>Hazel's work has increasingly focused on<br>who on questions of sustainability and<br>UN sustainable development goals and<br>starting this year Hazel's taken on an<br>important role as leader for the Otago<br>business school for a strategic<br>imperative which commits us to being a<br>local national and global citizen now<br>this is one of our seven strategic<br>imperatives and demonstrates commitment<br>to ensuring that our teaching research<br>and service reflect these sustainable<br>development goals of the United Nations<br>now tonight hazal is going to explore<br>how tourism effects may affect our<br>capacity for hope this is particularly<br>important and a very timely question as<br>the vice-chancellor has pointed out for<br>all of us here this evening given the<br>events of recent days it's a question<br>through which we need to ask what tools<br>we can use to build a more compassionate<br>and inclusive society tourism being one<br>of those so Hayes will be exploring<br>amongst other questions how tourism<br>creates a hopeful mood or orientation<br>towards the future so Vice Chancellor<br>deputy vice-chancellors academic staff<br>and those of you here in the audience<br>tonight professor professor taser hazel<br>Tucker will now give her presentation<br>shame empathy fear and hope why tourism<br>matters so I invite professor Tucker up<br>now to address you all<br>well good evening everybody thank you<br>very much for coming thank you for that<br>very kind introduction<br>Harleen and Robin if I may and I'd also<br>like to say hello to anybody that's<br>watching in from elsewhere possibly<br>Georgian Amy in Guangzhou and Jasmine in<br>Sweden if he managed to get up in time I<br>think most people in in that part of the<br>world decided that it was a bit too<br>early to get up for this so so we'll<br>forgive them and hello when you watch it<br>later just a word first of all on on the<br>title here and so I had to submit the<br>title for my IPL a good three or four<br>weeks ago so that it could be advertised<br>and so on and so I played around with it<br>with it with a few different titles<br>first of all and my initial title that I<br>was going to go with was much more they<br>would have given me much more room to<br>play with at this point in time but Liam<br>my son told me that it was a sort of<br>nerdy anthropologist title and that I<br>ought to give Thank You Liam had<br>something a bit more specific and so I<br>ended up with this title and so I've<br>committed myself to talking about this<br>stuff tonight and as alluded to by by<br>both Harlan and Robin and as it turns<br>out the title and the subject matter is<br>extremely poignant at this particular<br>point in time and in fact there was a<br>brief discussion<br>last week about whether we should<br>postpone the IPL because of that that<br>sort of it was almost too poignant but<br>as a colleague quite quite rightly said<br>to me when would a time be when these<br>issues were not were not to urgently<br>poignant so we decided to go ahead and<br>to persevere with it and so I am going<br>to be talking about shame empathy fear<br>and hope and I'm going to tell you about<br>the key ideas in my in my work that have<br>related to these things and I'm going to<br>use examples along the way both of my<br>turkey research and from New Zealand<br>research and I'm also going to tell a<br>few personal anecdotes to illustrate as<br>well because of the relevance of these<br>matters to what's happening here in New<br>Zealand and beyond right now I've had a<br>bit of trouble during the last few days<br>sort of deciding exactly what to say and<br>how to say it and I've ended up sort of<br>rewriting bits and pieces over and over<br>again which is driven Robin limb a bit<br>mad I think so I'm going to stick to my<br>notes fairly closely and because I you<br>know what I want to get it right I guess<br>and and sometimes I will make direct<br>reference to these broader relevances<br>and sometimes I'll let you infer in<br>further relevances so before I get into<br>into my work on on shame and empathy and<br>and hope and so on I'll quickly give two<br>levels of introduction to my work and<br>the first introduction that I'll give is<br>a sort of broader brief introduction<br>around tourism so this is especially for<br>the non tourism specialist members of<br>so first of all in a sort of important<br>point is that tourism is said to be one<br>of the world's largest industries and so<br>internationally and nationally here as<br>as I'm sure you know it's a very<br>important promoter of economic growth<br>and development as well as a massive job<br>producer and so on so according to the<br>United Nations World Tourism<br>Organization this is mainly why tourism<br>matters but this represents only one way<br>of thinking about tourism albeit a<br>highly mainstream sort of dominant one<br>and as I see it<br>so for me actually the key words in in<br>that quote from the UN WTO are tourism<br>is large very large in fact and it's<br>getting larger all the time the stats<br>tell us that there are now around 1.5<br>billion international tourist trips per<br>year in the world let alone the number<br>of domestic tourists traveling around in<br>many countries so as well as being an<br>industry tourism is also a massive<br>movement of people and a massive series<br>of encounters people encountering other<br>places and people encountering other<br>people and this notion of encounters<br>with other people and places has grown<br>in in poignancy this week because<br>tourism could be said to be premise on<br>difference or on experiencing different<br>or other places people's landscapes<br>cultures foods weather and so on in<br>tourism places and people's are often<br>represented as extraordinary whereas in<br>fact they are ordinary<br>and so this is my where my work fits in<br>as an anthropologist over the course of<br>my career I've been interested in<br>tourism encounters in the various ways<br>in which tourism through these<br>encounters is implicated in and kind of<br>acts or does things in relation to the<br>social cultural and even the moral<br>fabric of society and I see these<br>implications and acts as always<br>multi-layered complex and mostly not<br>measurable or reducible to simple<br>positives and negatives and one<br>particular layer in this complexity that<br>I've paid attention to in my research is<br>the affective or emotional dimensions of<br>tourism and so that's what I'm going to<br>focus on this evening and especially on<br>these for shame empathy fear and hope<br>and so I'll keep these in a sidebar here<br>as pointers along the way so that you<br>know where we are and so that you know<br>when we're getting down the list and<br>closer to going to the staff club and<br>and also as a reminder that all of these<br>terms ultimately linked linked with or<br>lead to the important matter of hope but<br>before I get on to this list and because<br>my IPL is meant to tell you the story of<br>some something about the story of my<br>research career from the beginning<br>through to food to Professor I'm going<br>to firstly give you a bit of background<br>on when and how I first got into all of<br>this stuff and I guess a lot of people<br>at this point might self start their<br>research career story at the point of<br>their masters or PhD but I think that my<br>research story begins quite a bit before<br>that before my post-grad studies and<br>I've sort of traced it back to thinking<br>so when<br>when did this start and I think I traced<br>it back to I've sort of hit on the point<br>and that was a pivotal pivotal moment in<br>1984 that's the year not the book when I<br>was a teenager and I met a German hippy<br>or hippy German I don't know which way<br>round you sow in the common room of a<br>youth hostel in central Athens and the<br>German hippie had just had his his Kodak<br>film developed in a photo shop down the<br>road and looking around the rooms only a<br>few of you that won't won't understand<br>what I just said and he he was kind he<br>was keen to show us his his his photos<br>me and my friend to me my friends and in<br>the photos was a place here to travel to<br>just before coming to Athens and it was<br>the village of goreme in an area of<br>central Turkey called Cappadocia he told<br>us that the place was amazing and we<br>should definitely go there too but<br>Turkey wasn't a place that tourists went<br>to at that time and so we were extremely<br>hesitant but the hippy told us that the<br>people were incredibly friendly and<br>wonderful and I guess in the end he<br>somehow persuaded us because the next<br>day there's a map so that you can say<br>Athens over there in the in the green<br>bit Greece the next day we got onto the<br>road heading north out of Athens and we<br>stuck out our thumbs and with a few<br>bumpy adventures along the way we<br>hitchhiked our way around to Istanbul<br>and then we made our way through to to<br>go remain and there when we arrived in<br>in in gourmet in Cappadocia we were met<br>with this magical bizarre moon-like<br>landscape of these giant cones called<br>fairy chimneys and and guram a itself<br>was a dusty<br>with Kate cave houses built in amongst<br>amongst these fairy chimneys and there<br>was no tourism then so we put our little<br>tent up on a piece of scrub land in the<br>middle of the village and and then we<br>hung out for a few days and so that's<br>where it started<br>basically I I developed a love for the<br>place from that point and then I I went<br>back a few times in the later part of<br>the 1980s when I was teaching English as<br>a foreign language in in Izmir and by<br>that time at the end of the 80s<br>geurim a village was beginning to<br>develop her a little bit of backpacker<br>tourism and so then when I was doing my<br>post grad studies in anthropology at<br>Durham in the 1990s I decided to look at<br>goreme and the wider Cappadocia region<br>as a case study of tourism development<br>and social change I lived in gourmet for<br>a year and a half to do my PhD research<br>and and that was later published as as<br>they broke up their living with tourism<br>and since then I continued this<br>longitudinal study tracking tourism and<br>change over now 30 odd years in this one<br>area which is both a national park and a<br>World Heritage Site so I've seen the<br>area developed from having pretty much<br>no tourism tourism business at all in<br>the early 1980s to developing backpacker<br>guest houses and small restaurants in<br>the 80s and 90s and then developing<br>hot-air-balloon tourism in the - 2000's<br>and it was I think the hot air baloon<br>tourism which really sort of set things<br>off and changing because the balloons<br>above the landscape are so photographed<br>now that guru Mays fame on the sort of<br>world stage of destinations has grown<br>and grown<br>and you may have seen goreme in programs<br>that Michael Palin have done he's been<br>there Joanna Lumley<br>she's been there her program just<br>recently shown famous Chinese pop stars<br>have been there<br>and so now geurim a the picture there<br>with all the balloons they're from<br>Instagram it's become an Instagram<br>sensation and when I last visited which<br>was in October last year and<br>conversations I had with people there<br>made me made me wonder if if development<br>has now sort of started tipping over<br>into the state of what we're now calling<br>over tourism so it in Gura made the same<br>village that we put our tent up in in<br>1984 there are now over 300 hotels and<br>over 130 restaurants authorities have<br>limited for safety reasons the number of<br>hot-air balloons that can fly above<br>goreme each morning to 150 hot-air<br>balloons and even though the baskets<br>they're using are getting bigger and<br>bigger and able to carry about 20 to 30<br>people you know at the same time it's<br>still difficult to get a ballooning<br>ticket because they're always full so<br>gourmet has given me heaps of material<br>to work with over the years and I've<br>published on on many different aspects<br>of tourism and change there but always<br>looking at what the change there that in<br>this place can tell us about broader<br>issues in tourism studies such as things<br>that Robin mentioned community based<br>tourism and sustainability and how world<br>heritage and local community values<br>connect or not gender and women's work<br>identity hospitality relationships<br>entrepreneurship and so on more recently<br>looking at refugee tourism interactions<br>with with turkey now<br>being having the largest refugee<br>so also somewhere along the line I I<br>started doing research and writing about<br>the topic of shame in this in this<br>research so we're now coming to the<br>first item on the in the sidebar and<br>I've looked at shame in two quite<br>different ways one way is in relation to<br>the to the strand of my work looking at<br>gender relations and I'll tell you about<br>the other way after so first of all I'm<br>going to start with with that work on on<br>shame and gender relations in gourmet in<br>in my early research on tourism in<br>kapadokya I aligned how life in this<br>part of Turkey which which can be<br>considered quite socially conservative<br>is strongly gendered and in short agenda<br>spatial separation operates there<br>between public and domestic space which<br>is upheld through a system of honor and<br>shame so as tourism started to develop<br>in the area in in the 80s and 90s women<br>were largely separated from from<br>tourists and tourism activity so that<br>tourism business became almost entirely<br>the domain of men but through my my<br>longitudinal research research I've<br>observed how the gender situation there<br>has gradually changed and during the<br>past 15 years or so particularly more<br>and more women have got work in the<br>hotels and guesthouses and some women<br>have also started entrepreneurial<br>activities such as making and selling<br>jewelry to tourists running cafes and<br>restaurants or offering in Turkish<br>cooking classes in their cave homes for<br>example<br>and so through all of all of this local<br>women have come to be more visible in<br>Guram aids public spaces such as the<br>main the main street and the shops and<br>the cafes in that area and as I've<br>written in one of my articles on this<br>all of this has entailed the undoing of<br>shame in terms of the honor shame system<br>and while other aspects of social change<br>will will probably have played a part in<br>this<br>I sort of concluded in this research<br>that tourism has largely been<br>responsible for this this gradual<br>undoing of shame and in fact tourism has<br>shifted the spatial and moral boundaries<br>to such an extent in Gura may now that<br>there's almost a reversal in career and<br>livelihood prospects for young young men<br>and women this is because they increased<br>wealth from tourism together with the<br>undoing of shame that previously<br>restricted girls and women from going<br>away from from their homes has meant<br>that families have been sending their<br>daughters as well as their sons to high<br>school and because many boys and young<br>men are choosing the sort of easily<br>available road of tourism and dropping<br>out of school early it's the girls and<br>young women who are becoming better<br>educated and now pursuing careers such<br>as teaching nursing translating and<br>engineering and so while my my own<br>particular research on this is based<br>mainly around this one one area it has<br>wider applicability because the the<br>pattern of gender this is the same<br>pattern of gender inequality is repeated<br>in many tourism contexts all over the<br>world it's for that reason that tourism<br>age development agencies such as the<br>World Bank often deliberately promote<br>women in tourism projects but what what<br>my work has shown together with with<br>k-star<br>is conducted by my PhD students in other<br>parts of the world is the enormous<br>complexity of what's involved in this<br>kind of change and so in this article<br>and here in the Journal of a journal of<br>sustainable tourism brenda buddha bana<br>and i warned that whilst<br>well-intentioned many such development<br>projects and interventions which are<br>often underpinned by Eurocentric ideas<br>about women's empowerment and how with<br>Western ideas about how gender relations<br>ought to be these projects may lack<br>sufficient understanding of the specific<br>so that's the first area of sort of<br>connection with with shame that I've<br>looked at now onto a another very<br>different link between shame and tourism<br>that I've written about and this was<br>prompted when I started to examine<br>during my fieldwork in guru Mei what I<br>observed as uncomfortable tourism<br>encounters I'm not really interested in<br>comfortable tourism encounters I'm more<br>interested in uncomfortable tourism<br>encounters this has led me to become<br>interested in tourism's capacity to<br>prompt feelings of shame or to produce a<br>heightened shameful awareness of the<br>tourists tourists self an example might<br>be where tourists for example might<br>might catch themselves trying to bargain<br>the price down at a market when they<br>they know that the meager amount that<br>they're trying to reduce the cost by is<br>nothing to them but it's likely worth<br>much more to the seller or another<br>example is where tourists might shame<br>noticed themselves objectifying or even<br>romanticizing poverty and in this<br>research and this article in particular<br>I draw on the work of an Australian<br>cultural studies scholar Elspeth probin<br>who points out that shame can be<br>productive it can be a productive<br>emotion because it illuminates our<br>interest in living ethically so in this<br>linking of shame instead of viewing<br>shame as something to be undone I<br>consider shame as potentially productive<br>in its reflexive and self evaluative<br>role disrupting an often inherently<br>colonial relationship between tourists<br>and other and potentially prompting a<br>kind of dispositional change in a desire<br>tourism encounters I think can often<br>create a kind of an interesting kind of<br>mirror effect where in each party's<br>encountering of the other they also see<br>themselves and this can occur both at<br>the level of the individual and the the<br>societal level I think an example and an<br>uncomfortable example especially right<br>now is what occurred here a few months<br>ago following the murder of British<br>tourist Grace Mullane the fact that<br>grace was a tourist here when she was<br>murdered I think was significant in the<br>reactions around New Zealand that it<br>prompted and that the word shame was<br>quite prominent at that time as in this<br>this article from the ODT the vigil for<br>grace held in the Octagon for example<br>Dave Cole the mayor here said that he<br>felt shame bitter deep shame and I think<br>that it was the particularly sort of the<br>tourism context of this that through<br>tourism's<br>tendency to<br>this mirror effect that led to this<br>strong sense of shame and<br>self-evaluation sort of being produced<br>which in turn then led to a widespread<br>call to action against this kind of<br>violence against against women<br>particularly to quote Elspeth Brogan<br>again shame can be particularly<br>productive because it indicates a<br>rethinking of and I quote how we wish to<br>live in proximity to others and so then<br>this links very closely I think with<br>with the matter of empathy in relation<br>to empathy is the question of whether<br>tourism can be as is suggested by some<br>in the tourism literature a force for<br>cross-cultural understanding empathy and<br>peace and this of course is based on the<br>idea that tourism and travel provide<br>opportunities to learn about other<br>places and peoples and while my research<br>in this area and in this article<br>particularly I sort of quite strongly<br>interrogate this idea and question it<br>and certainly I I'm sort of strongly<br>questioning of the idea that tourism may<br>enable an ability to truly imagine what<br>it would be like to walk in another's<br>shoes my conclusion from examining a<br>wide variety of ways in which tourism<br>might promote empathy is that tourism<br>encounters by placing you there in<br>proximity and in relation to others can<br>be productive to use that word again<br>in rethinking how we wish to live in<br>and I'm gonna give you a tell you a<br>short anecdote from to illustrate this<br>point and this anecdote this story is<br>from a few years ago when I was<br>traveling in Europe with with Robin Liam<br>it was it was late in the summer of 2015<br>and we were traveling from Turkey up<br>through Europe to go to the UK and we<br>found ourselves following the main<br>refugee route as many refugees mainly<br>Syrians at that point we're trying to<br>make their way up to Germany or<br>elsewhere in northern Europe<br>at one point we stayed overnight at a<br>hotel on the German side of a river<br>which marked the austrian-german border<br>in that evening we walked across the the<br>bridge because the hotel owner told us<br>that there was no nowhere to get<br>anything to eat on the German side and<br>that we had to go over to the to the<br>town on the Austrian side so we walked<br>across the bridge to get a meal and when<br>we returned after our meal we saw many<br>refugee families gathered at the police<br>checkpoint on the bridge waiting to be<br>Liam was about he was 10 at the time of<br>that encounter<br>I do have might have his permission to<br>tell you the story and it was<br>interesting how he recalled the scene<br>when about two years later he was having<br>an email conversation with his granddad<br>about the care being taken to resettle<br>refugees coming into New Zealand during<br>the conversation he told his granddad of<br>our refugee encounter on the<br>austrian-german border and there were<br>two main stories within his his bigger<br>story one of the stories was how the<br>large crowd of refugees who were<br>gathered on the bridge by the German<br>police let off balloons in order to in<br>Liam's word words<br>celebrate their arrival and the start of<br>their new life in Germany his other<br>story told that relative to to the<br>Syrian families on the bridge we as in<br>our family were able to walk back and<br>forth across the bridge coming and going<br>between Austria and Germany and that we<br>didn't need our passports and that the<br>police on the bridge just ignored us and<br>of course I can't really know what<br>effects these kinds of experiences might<br>have on Liam as he grows older but this<br>encounter did appear to create some sort<br>of awareness of his own life situation<br>relative to others and it also seemed to<br>prompt for him some important kind of<br>bigger than himself questions such as<br>who has passports and who can travel and<br>neither I therefore like to think that<br>these kinds of trips and encounters that<br>we exposed Liam to as many versions of<br>world schooling as it's called in in<br>tourism literature where families take<br>their children out of school and travel<br>the world viewing the world as their<br>classroom in order specifically to<br>develop cross-cultural understanding and<br>empathy but of course not all tourism<br>does this as I've seen more recently<br>during a research project I've I've<br>conducted with Chinese tourists in New<br>Zealand for example at times tourism may<br>even have the opposite effect and<br>actually increase intolerance disrespect<br>and other Inge among groups of people<br>and as Paul hunt the Human Rights<br>Commissioner said that his talk here<br>last Thursday it's this other ring that<br>can all too easily<br>lead to the type of terrible violence<br>that occurred in Christchurch ten<br>days ago and so on the matter of empathy<br>and whether with the renewed relevance<br>some important questions about tourism<br>that I think that we need to keep<br>pursuing when and how does tourism<br>incite intolerance and adds to other<br>ring by strengthening notions of<br>difference and conversely under what<br>conditions can tour ISM enable<br>cross-cultural understanding together<br>nurse and a sense of sameness so now to<br>move on to something completely<br>different but still somehow related and<br>I'm going down the list here and so now<br>on to the word fear in the list and here<br>I'm going to talk about my research on<br>the links between tourism and a big kind<br>of fear which is an apocalyptic fear for<br>the future and again I'm going to<br>illustrate with an anecdote this time<br>from Safranbolu which is a world<br>heritage town in the north of Turkey and<br>we visited again with Robin Liam and I a<br>few years ago again and when we were<br>there we we met an elderly man in the<br>middle Mooji loose 'aqaq which roughly<br>translates as metalworkers street so he<br>wandered into the man's workshop and he<br>said that he was making himself a<br>Turkish coffee and he offered us one we<br>accepted and so then we we chatted while<br>he made the coffee on his small stove he<br>told told us that he had been welding<br>brackets there since he was 17 and he<br>also earned a bit of money from folk<br>dancing because he belong<br>to a regional folk dancing group and<br>they dance at weddings and sometimes at<br>official events such as world heritage<br>meetings for example I asked him think<br>about what he saw of the future of the<br>metalworkers Street and he said that<br>young people these days don't want to do<br>this kind of work because it's too hard<br>he said he'd asked his son to come to<br>the workshop to learn his trade but he<br>didn't want to come young people don't<br>like work he said and would rather spend<br>their time on their computer or phone I<br>translated this to Liam who was sitting<br>beside me and he rolled his eyes the old<br>man then said that he feels sad and<br>scared that because the young people<br>don't want to do these trades when<br>elderly people like him die these arts<br>will be lost another conversation that I<br>had in Safranbolu was with a family from<br>Ankara with two young children who'd<br>come to Ankara to visit Safranbolu for<br>the weekend the parent said that the<br>town represented for them a pastime when<br>people walked around together there was<br>more kindness politeness respect closer<br>relationships<br>it was a closer community then they said<br>fearful of the kind of world that their<br>children are growing up in they said<br>that they wanted to take their their<br>children to visit Safranbolu because it<br>would help them not to forget what life<br>so there's an idea here that World<br>Heritage status and the term that sorry<br>the tourism that comes with that has<br>somehow saved the town the town of<br>Safranbolu from falling into ruin and it<br>saved at the traditional way of life<br>from disappearing or at least saving it<br>from disappearing quite as quickly as it<br>otherwise might might have done but I<br>think that this kind of heritage tourism<br>creates a kind of apocalyptic aesthetic<br>illusion in a similar way to the to the<br>phases vars illusion and also<br>illustrated in this lovely picture which<br>which Liam took thanks them of<br>safranbolu town tinted golden yellow<br>through saffron tea when looking at<br>these pictures just as the appearance of<br>the faces always seeps into your view of<br>the vars the state of the world outside<br>of the world heritage site of Safranbolu<br>always seeps into your tourist<br>experience when in Safranbolu<br>bringing the decline of what is good in<br>the world into stark relief and imbuing<br>the experience with a fear of the<br>world's impending demise and it's<br>actually incredible how how much tourism<br>creates this kind of last chance to see<br>something before it disappears narrative<br>both kind of slotting into and feeding a<br>prevailing sense of living in the end<br>times<br>so while places like Safranbolu are<br>lovely to visit no doubt I have no doubt<br>about that I think that many examples of<br>tourism and heritage tourism in<br>particular are often in fact a darker<br>form of tourism than the sites which are<br>which are overtly known as dark tourism<br>sites because heritage tourism often<br>promotes a melancholic sense of law<br>which in turn creates fear that the<br>world is gradually or even quickly<br>perhaps moving towards its demise and<br>I'll give you a very local example of<br>this and this is Fiordland well World<br>Heritage Site area right on our doorstep<br>which is probably considered New<br>Zealand's number one natural heritage<br>tourism area but next time you go over<br>there have a close read of the<br>interpretive sign boards at places like<br>mirror lakes and the chasm many tourists<br>come here explicitly to experience one<br>of the last paradises on earth and yet<br>tourists are given a strong sense that<br>the ecosystem and wildlife here have an<br>uncertain future so when this Chinese<br>man for example goes away and perhaps<br>uses his translation app to be able to<br>understand kind of properly the words in<br>the interpretation panels he'll read<br>that the forest that once rang with<br>birdsong has now become silent because<br>the native birds are disappearing and<br>he'll come to understand that the place<br>and its life are on the brink of no<br>return and clearly a large part of this<br>narrative is aimed at drumming up<br>support and perhaps donations for the<br>conservation efforts that take place in<br>Fiordland but there's also an extremely<br>fine line I think between creating a<br>story which will which will generate<br>hope and positive action and one which<br>simply produces a pessimistic fear for<br>the future which is what I think much of<br>your lands tourism does and<br>finally we get on to hope so yeah some<br>examples of tourism do present a hope<br>narrative an example from far away is<br>that sort of described as a sort of hope<br>museum is Robben Island Museum in in<br>South Africa which is described as a<br>museum which purposely mobilizes a hope<br>sensibility among its ability among its<br>visitors not to generate some sort of<br>pleasurable or positive tourism<br>experience but rather with the<br>deliberate idea that hope is associated<br>with promoting and effecting positive<br>socio-political change and even in in<br>Fiordland a hopeful narrative can be<br>produced as Eric Shelton and I observed<br>during research on the narratives<br>presented on trips to doubtful sound<br>during cruises on on the sound the boat<br>very often they'll take the boat into<br>into some into a sort of quiet bay and<br>they turned that the boats engines off<br>and and instruct everyone to stay very<br>cognizant of still and quiet so that<br>they can experience the sound of silence<br>but depending on the level of the sort<br>of brink of no return narrative being<br>presented by the guide up until that<br>point tourists will often experience the<br>sound of silence as the sound of<br>Paradise Lost because the focus in that<br>case is on how silent it is because of<br>the lots of birds and their song<br>alternatively if the guide is passionate<br>about the restoration work taking place<br>in Fiordland they may emphasize how much<br>birdsong is coming back and in this case<br>tourists can experience the place as a<br>paradise we found or regained or a<br>narrative of hope so<br>because there clearly is a fragile very<br>fragile line or balance between fear and<br>hope this aspect of my work my research<br>is about developing understanding about<br>the ways in which tourism tends to often<br>unwittingly feed feed pessimism and fear<br>but also how tourism might be able to<br>act as a narrative technique in order to<br>create a hopeful orientation towards the<br>future so back to my title event start<br>again so yeah I just gonna come to it<br>there's a few words of conclusion really<br>so my intention when I submitted this<br>title a few weeks ago was to try to<br>convince my audience that tourism<br>matters precisely because it does things<br>in connection with with these things<br>with shame<br>empathy fear and hope but if I'm honest<br>because up until 11 days ago I wasn't<br>entirely sure how convinced you you<br>would be that even even these things<br>mattered because of the the largely that<br>the the dominant thinking that only for<br>example GDP and jobs and so on matter as<br>I as I talked about earlier but I think<br>that our world has changed<br>quite substantially since then and I<br>think that the ground underneath our<br>feet in terms of what matters has<br>shifted somewhat to say that something<br>matters implies an obligation to pay<br>appropriate attention to it and I think<br>that over the last week or so we've<br>moved towards a realization that we do<br>need to pay appropriate attention that<br>is more attention to the matter of for<br>example how we wish to live in proximity<br>to others<br>we've also illuminated our common<br>interest in living ethically and<br>empathetically and we realize now how<br>vital it is to overcome a pessimistic<br>fearful mood and to find ways to be<br>hopeful about the possibility of<br>something better<br>and so if tourism and indeed any of the<br>areas that we research and teach here at<br>the University of Otago are in any way<br>connected to these kinds of matters then<br>I think we can safely say now that they<br>are worth paying appropriate attention<br>finally I want to say a big thanks to a<br>few key people who have contributed to<br>my my life my career first of all I<br>think that it's important to thank the<br>German hippy from the atoms from the<br>Athens youth hostel ooh he pushed me to<br>go there and even started all of this I<br>also need to say a massive thank you to<br>many many many many many people in in<br>guram a particularly and elsewhere in<br>Cappadocia but especially in in goreme<br>and there are too many people to name<br>there so I've just put a picture up of<br>goreme but I do want to thank<br>particularly a pass and send him and<br>paradise Mehmet as he's called who<br>really helped me and supported me and<br>cared for me during my PhD fieldwork and<br>since and they've become great friends<br>over the years I also want to thank<br>Tammy Cohen who an anthropologist at<br>previously at Durham University now at<br>Melbourne University she was my PhD<br>supervisor and provided wonderful<br>guidance support and friendship I want<br>to thank all the students and colleagues<br>and co-authors and friends over the year<br>who I'm representing you all here in<br>this multiculturalism image because<br>you've come from all over the place and<br>you've taught me heaps and so thank you<br>and then of course there's Robin Liam<br>the loves of my life thank you for<br>keeping me real and giving me a nice<br>work-life balance and so on thank you<br>thank you for allowing me to use your<br>stories tonight Liam and last but not<br>least I want to thank my mum and dad<br>Carolyn Jim Tucker who are in Scotland<br>they of course provided me with a very<br>loving environment as I was growing up<br>which then gave me the confidence and<br>sort of a loud meter to go forth and go<br>all over the world which I obviously<br>have and Here I am and so yeah thank you<br>very much mum and dad and my dad is<br>appropriately he's always in that<br>position actually my dad is<br>appropriately holding holding up a glass<br>and and I think that I will end there<br>and because that's what we're going to<br>be doing soon right<br>kyouda koto everyone my name is james<br>heim and it's my great pleasure to offer<br>a few words and reflections following<br>Hazel's IPL hazel I first want to say<br>congratulations on a really outstanding<br>presentation I'm sure everyone here will<br>agree with me that we've really had a<br>very challenging and thought-provoking<br>presentation from hazel by way of<br>reflections I was sitting there<br>reflecting on all sorts of things during<br>Hazel's presentation one of those things<br>was the fact that it's 30 years exactly<br>since tourism studies was established<br>here at the University of Otago and<br>tourism studies at Otago was the vision<br>of three professors in three different<br>departments one in marketing one in<br>geography and one in history and the<br>vision from the outset was that tourism<br>would be cross-disciplinary and we would<br>be a research centre with a very outward<br>looking focus and just looking around in<br>the audience right now I can see<br>colleagues from all sorts of different<br>departments around the university that<br>within our department we've had the<br>great pleasure of collaborating with and<br>one of the things that I love most<br>particularly about our field of research<br>is that we're very very collaborative<br>and I could list all of the different<br>disciplines across the various divisions<br>and departments at the University that<br>we've collaborated with but in one<br>particular discipline we've been<br>extremely fortunate and that is social<br>anthropology because we've had hazel in<br>our department and hazel brings<br>disciplinary expertise and also<br>methodological expertise to our<br>department that has influenced a<br>generation of researchers and influenced<br>the way many of us think and conduct<br>ourselves as researchers within the<br>department so in that sense it's been a<br>great pleasure of course to have Hazel's<br>expertise within our department so Thank<br>You hazel for that as well<br>other reflections I'd have to say that<br>one of the most amazing things about<br>Hazel's research is that she has<br>maintained as you've seen a focus within<br>her research that has been sustained<br>over not just years but also decades and<br>I was also reflecting during her<br>presentation that one of the most<br>special things about her research is<br>that dating right back to a German<br>hippie in 1984 she has maintained a<br>particular focus and a stream of<br>research published in the very top<br>journals in the field that is quite<br>honestly unparalleled anywhere else in<br>the world in our field so much of the<br>research that has published as one-off<br>it's isolated and it makes individual<br>contributions but I was reflecting upon<br>Hazel's research program and it really<br>occurred to me that the University of<br>Otago and the the University of Otago<br>receives so much recognition for example<br>from the Dunedin study which dates back<br>to 1972 and young people born in Dunedin<br>in that year and their pathway through<br>life Hazel's research program within our<br>field very much reflects that insofar as<br>she is reported tonight on a program of<br>research that not-not looks at<br>individuals born in a particular year<br>and their life course but looks at a<br>community a society and how tourism has<br>evolved and how that community has<br>evolved over time over a sustained<br>period of research over yes decades that<br>is truly outstanding and the recognition<br>that the university gets from the<br>Dunedin study is actually very similar<br>that the recognition that our department<br>gets from Hazel's research program which<br>is viewed by many colleagues around the<br>world with very envious eyes because of<br>that sustained and outstanding<br>contribution over time so<br>congratulations on that as well hazel<br>hazel has challenged us to think about<br>why tourism matters and she's challenged<br>us to think at all sorts of levels about<br>shame<br>and empathy and fear and hope and I'm<br>sure that will all go away this evening<br>with lots to think about in terms of her<br>contributions to scholarship and talking<br>about fear and talking about living in<br>the end times I'm pleased to say that I<br>was actually on Hazel's appointment<br>panel when she came to Dunedin for the<br>first time to be interviewed and there<br>were all sorts of reasons why she may<br>may have taken up the position that we<br>offered her here at the University of<br>Otago and in fact I'm very pleased to<br>say having sat on that appointment panel<br>that on several occasions I've been at<br>conferences and meetings else around the<br>world and people have said hazel Tucker<br>we really wanted to recruit her when she<br>graduated from Durham why on earth did<br>she go all the way to a tire go so far<br>away from her family and so far away<br>from her her field site and Gura main<br>Cappadocia central Turkey and I can now<br>reveal one of the clinches one of the<br>key reasons why she came all the way to<br>live here in Dunedin because she told me<br>and when she was here to be interviewed<br>we showed her round a little bit and one<br>of our little field visits was to the<br>Otago Peninsula and on that visit to the<br>Otago Peninsula she saw a couple of<br>yellow eyed penguins and she told me<br>that that was the clincher<br>that was what convinced her that she<br>wanted to come and live in Dunedin and<br>forge her career at the University of<br>Otago of course the prospects of the<br>yellow eyed penguin were reasonably grim<br>then and they're even more grim now but<br>I hope that the yellow eyed penguin can<br>be preserved because it does play an<br>important important role in recruiting<br>world-class academics to come and work<br>here at the University of Otago so it's<br>my great pleasure now to be able to pass<br>over a little gift to Hazel on behalf of<br>the University and obviously to offer<br>her our congratulations</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
