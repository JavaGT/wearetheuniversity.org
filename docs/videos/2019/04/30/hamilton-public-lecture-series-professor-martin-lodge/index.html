It seems impossible to pin down a core function for it. Does music reflect the society it comes from or does it actually help shape that society? Today as recordings, the internet and social media blur distinctions between composer, performer and listener through software engines like automated DJ apps, maybe it is time to rethink what music actually is & how it functions. Why do we humans make, play and listen to music? What is it really? Composer and musicologist Martin Lodge introduces these issues and suggests some alternative ways of thinking about them. This lecture will be concluded by the live performance of a short composition of his, given by a staff and student group from the Conservatorium.<br><br>The Hamilton Public Lecture Series introduces our newest professors to the community and gives them a chance to demonstrate how their work is having a real impact on the world around us.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size:

number of<br>different angles ranging from the<br>Creator the reflected the reciprocal and<br>in recent years it's becoming<br>increasingly clear to me that just as<br>the world is changing at a tremendous<br>rate especially with the burgeoning of<br>Technology and the difficulty with the<br>internet so the nature music is changing<br>too or at least the way we need to think<br>about it is changing focus on this issue<br>has been sharpened directly by the<br>dramatic effects of music not only as<br>using our most probably disseminated<br>volumes event and cost as we say in the<br>trade topic the media is it but the<br>economic model Internet and the way<br>people have come to accept it is<br>overwhelming power essentially people<br>like ask uses of the internet trade is<br>showing the professional connections the<br>public the service the personal data<br>their text in exchange for additional<br>services such as websites and Facebook<br>but also a nearby though such as<br>Google's Gmail services such as these<br>appear to be free but of course they're<br>not really this challenge an economic<br>model where in return for services<br>privacy is bugs and instead of money<br>it's not only changed but is about<br>public versus private life and what<br>constitutes a community or a society<br>that has also changed the way the music<br>exists one major change has been deep<br>commodification of music so that today<br>it's difficult to sell recordings of the<br>music and make<br>the the only on the basis of unit<br>sailors attract outside a handful of<br>international celebrity figures of<br>supergroups few composers or performers<br>are able to make significant money from<br>selling recordings anymore<br>instead music has become a flux of<br>activity mediated through electronics<br>and supported to some extent by live<br>shows and the question of who is doing<br>what in terms of creating performing<br>disseminating and listening and how the<br>musical actions and interactions relate<br>to each other has become a really<br>fascinating this year thinking about<br>these changes let me back to the<br>writings of proposal is ecologist and<br>educator Chris's a small originally from<br>Pastor north<br>he's a classic case of a prophet without<br>our revenues are glad but read respected<br>greatly overseas after leaving New<br>Zealand this young man small was<br>basically a slice of London expect the<br>last twenty seven or so years of his<br>life was spared smaller a series of<br>books that have proved hugely<br>influential<br>despite their controversial either<br>rather than the way they've admitted who<br>proposed<br>reevaluated function and place music<br>society<br>his last and most of what was music<br>which that you could see it has a really<br>subtitle the meanings the meanings of<br>performing any music<br>small data that there are three<br>questions have seemed to keep recurring<br>about wheezing throughout the ages for<br>this week what is this thing called is<br>it that's privilege of every society and<br>about humans consider me to invest huge<br>amounts of time attention emotional<br>commitment creativity and money and of<br>course that favorite artists not what is<br>the meaning of music and thirdly what is<br>the function of music for vegetable<br>species Chris more positively conducive<br>answers to any of these questions<br>because the questions themselves are<br>wrong there is he wrote no such thing as<br>music music is not thinking at all about<br>an activity something I thought strongly<br>about I read those words a few years ago<br>they confirmed an idea that had slowly<br>slowly groping my way towards which was<br>we often try to think about music in<br>ways that are really not pretty helpful<br>well that's been happening to these<br>sorts of evolving ideas once the first<br>step of illumination has been made it's<br>they're easier to see other connections<br>one such connection turned out that what<br>first seemed at unlike the quarter named<br>in the computer analysis of big data and<br>popular music<br>that's disseminated on the Internet the<br>American electronics research engineer<br>Joe Johnson as<br>just a video clip on YouTube explaining<br>by the self-titled audio content that's<br>part of the message Jesus instituted<br>technology this Center just in using<br>computers to apply data analysis and<br>feedback to the reception of the court<br>of music<br>borrowing eternal life job<br>what do you common names quite to remove<br>the fourth all that seems to have come<br>to exist between your performance and<br>listeners and recorded music is the only<br>so a lot of you are probably wondering<br>why did I join a music technology<br>startup after doing all that work to get<br>a PhD a big part of that is exciting<br>transition I'm going to talk about today<br>which as you mentioned is a transition<br>to interact or music consumption and<br>data so when we used to listen to music<br>it's hot right we had to break out<br>clunky heavy equipment we had to you<br>know use some unconventional accessories<br>I think people remember the tennis or<br>the cassette tape trade uh-huh well what<br>does it even the next song record get<br>the deal at just the right point and<br>groove yes push buttons you have to turn<br>the knobs and what we wanted to learn<br>more we even have to get through our<br>notes and that time Friday<br>it goes out a booklet to think about<br>remembers that year's fire season even<br>musicians we set out to fix this we did<br>it we made things lighter more data rich<br>faster easy and in some cases free so<br>how things get any better well at some<br>point if there's frenzy to create a more<br>personalized music experience we lost<br>something we don't walk between our<br>music to create a new consumers between<br>the olives in isaiah johnson focuses on<br>recordings that's because she's from the<br>interior point of view well<br>traditionally over the past hundred<br>years also recorded music has arrived on<br>vinyl tape CD or now the internet<br>completely finished by a music producer<br>so the listener cannot interact with it<br>very much when playing back recorded was<br>if we can control volume and maybe the<br>right speaker balance much else<br>overall very limited the direction as<br>possible<br>and the performance who made the<br>recording certainly not aware of many<br>choices that individual listeners are<br>they do when using the recording now in<br>the recording process particularly<br>studio as Popular's the component parts<br>stairs a stem might be something like<br>the drum track or the lead guitar or<br>vocalist and so combining stairs is<br>called mixing and today it's possible to<br>offer music as a package of stairs which<br>could be our driver pre-mixed by the<br>producer or available to be mixed<br>according to the listeners of a<br>preference his stuff from the second<br>video showed very briefly how this<br>technology can work in practice and this<br>test demonstration shows over sneezes<br>how elisany using a smartphone can<br>choose to listen not just to a selected<br>piece of music in this case it's a rock<br>song<br>but more than that the listener can<br>choose to listen to any single music<br>music is always been ingested the same<br>way you stand in front of some speaker<br>system anyone and that much innovation<br>has come in that respect<br>the market has told us that this<br>experience is still people want more<br>into the various black experience we use<br>it with all innovation around us and<br>software hardware and data and even with<br>all beliefs and that was being done we<br>found that derivations call what we call<br>completion rate the in percent of users<br>consumers skip a song within 30 seconds<br>meaning that their box is likely to skip<br>a song as they aren't even listen to it<br>so we know that we still have this black<br>music problem so what are we going to do<br>this beast we believe that the answer is<br>interactive music experiences with<br>or the traditional Golden Triangle of<br>musical activity is create before but as<br>we saw in that video<br>computer technology allowing increased<br>interactivity to perform an implicit up<br>take reduces well but there's no reason<br>why so I think we need to turn the<br>if you think about it we can basic<br>possibilities we have a chronic<br>mediation with listening to recordings<br>for quite a long time for example we can<br>choose to listen to the movements of a<br>Beethoven symphony and a different order<br>to what the composer prescribed it is<br>easier less obstructed and CD player or<br>the website to play the order movements<br>we won't now that act of work creates a<br>different set of physical relationships<br>between the large-scale parts of the<br>symphony so as listeners we are<br>beginning to move into the composers<br>rock of eternity visible spectrum but<br>I've been wondering as the underlying<br>principles here applied beyond computer<br>mediated music supply mateus degrees is<br>it feasible to rethink the way proposal<br>before we had listener relate to each<br>other and that this played might there<br>be a way to provide means of mediation<br>that allows more interactivity perhaps<br>analogous to the concept to the role of<br>the computer music well I think there<br>may be and the piece you're about to<br>hear to that was created partnered with<br>these ideas in mind in our top reporter<br>of the traditional Maori experts and<br>theology which would he play virtually<br>one of the key compositional ideas ahead<br>was to find a way to mediate between the<br>worlds of traditional art music and<br>traditional Western classical music the<br>aim was to allow each part of these to<br>be true to its respective cultural roots<br>to avoid<br>so-called future uses but before getting<br>to the thickness time to touch very<br>briefly on some technical issues but not<br>too technical and the day-to-day<br>activity of musica prison I see four<br>elements as being important and<br>we've discussed some of these already<br>but let's look at notation the<br>potentially system that wisdom music<br>uses today we evolved simple centuries<br>in fact 3,000 years in response to<br>requirement of practical musicians<br>especially those employed rather<br>Christian maturity no tension began by<br>as a means of strengthening community<br>community as a mendicant wars of<br>complications<br>in different places and Chris is a long<br>time spans but all celebrate their trade<br>using the same music a community that<br>literally says we were saying that what<br>is likely to be a unified community and<br>then at the time a musical lingua franca<br>was the whole text annotations their<br>work for the 13th century and one for me<br>it is the ability to visually represent<br>the musical elements of time proved to<br>be extraordinarily powerful and its<br>effects shot well beyond original<br>straightforward intentions of its early<br>apprentice as the system became<br>horrified remembered those other<br>committees for performance centers<br>composers realized that potentially<br>could be used to write more<br>intellectually context music previously<br>as possible it could also use as a<br>virtual laboratory experiments were<br>possible of parley and structure it was<br>no longer necessary to work earlier real<br>Tigers would say today but when put at<br>risk time and Paul for as long as you<br>like therefore the construction of the<br>cords say or the architectural shape of<br>a piece of music and turned out<br>eventually the musical notation it<br>wasn't a sense the functional<br>predecessor of computer program which<br>initially specifies the installation<br>attire well for the south of discussion<br>about the real nature of the function<br>using notation entities beloved<br>complicated of course by the invention<br>of audio recording in the late 19th<br>century recording has not made a<br>notation redundant in a subjective<br>advice but instead recording has<br>developed a notation systems odds over<br>particularly as the<br>digital processes here's a shot from the<br>computer screen effect provides a<br>webinar the film store the word thought<br>to Professor the software being is not<br>of a crisis composition editing and<br>mixing of recordings is now continue<br>done using a combination with the organ<br>that is listening and the digital which<br>is looking at waveforms of tracks on the<br>computer screen like that so in a sense<br>we've actually moved back close to the<br>original original use of notation in<br>which digital representations were<br>generated to pay ideas and memories<br>use of digital editing programs and also<br>as a recording for two signers I'll<br>become part of the performance process<br>and that's what sort of a video clip<br>today listeners can also take on the<br>role of producers patrolman Eric mixing<br>but potentially also changed elements of<br>the composition itself the whole musical<br>equations becoming much more of flex and<br>activity in their list collection here's<br>a psychic tension side what I mean<br>mr.

these<br>installations were devised that<br>invitation of the bio engineering<br>Institute at the University Walters to<br>contribute interactive music<br>installations as part arts

completely transitoriness<br>physician and original execution as a<br>composer recently has I've had to<br>grapple with this question and decide<br>how to create music scores for pieces<br>that are both wisdom instruments and<br>traditional Maori instruments not only<br>does each group of instruments<br>hepatech completely different cultural<br>traditions about how to use a very<br>instrument<br>and long history of performance<br>techniques but the issue of notation<br>itself was challenged in western<br>notation as mentioned earlier again as<br>opposed to my technical religious homes<br>then began to be applied to the archive<br>of music as well<br>expectation became horrible used by<br>instrumentalists and fasten this and<br>less attached to words the issues of<br>specifying things like pitch rhythm<br>phrasing dynamics timbersaw<br>all became ordered<br>their attention evolved to meet those<br>challenges as they were issued by<br>Western instruments which themselves<br>constellation redevelopment by the 18th<br>century both instruments and notation<br>techniques were highly developed<br>symbiotic things like scales tuning<br>systems and work experience determined<br>how protection he was refined it's a<br>different kind of music such as<br>traditional balinese have claimed no<br>cars and evolution of the western<br>notation system and thus there is a gulf<br>separating what the top or the<br>traditional instruments do and how they<br>played over one hand with the traditions<br>and characteristics of western notation<br>on the other one of the issues about<br>this divide the dyeing the most<br>elaborate other musicians have had to<br>come up with practical solutions for as<br>how to create scores from both wasted<br>estimates and our estimates whenever<br>played at the same composition of course<br>each composer finds this world or her<br>answer to this question for my part I<br>prefer not to compromise on our<br>instruments by writing for the musical<br>list instead with specified words Cee<br>and Charlotte song as wonders for<br>Western instruments because most<br>relations such as scales and exactly<br>determine the touch and rhythmic<br>elements generally are not part of the<br>traditional cultural links to my mind<br>has fitted to a large tradition to be<br>true to its roots and to try to create a<br>special
