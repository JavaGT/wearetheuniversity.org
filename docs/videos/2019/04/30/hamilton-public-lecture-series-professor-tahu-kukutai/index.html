Professor Tahu Kukutai’s approach is flipping that on its head. “I started off doing research on populations. Now I’m more interested in doing research about people and using data to tell their stories.”<br><br>In the second of this year’s Hamilton Public Lectures, Professor Kukutai talks about how she is blending her passion for demography and Indigenous data sovereignty to craft a new approach to Indigenous population research. “Māori, like other Indigenous peoples, are often the objects of demographic inquiry. Rarely are we the ones collecting and managing our own data; doing our own analysis; telling our own stories. I’m trying to change that.”<br><br>If you think demography is all about statistics, think again. A former journalist, Professor Kukutai came to Waikato University to study history. “I’m a words person who stumbled into numbers. I was initially scared of statistics and not keen on demography. Now it’s the power of data and numbers that draws me.”<br><br>Professor Kukutai is from the Waikato town of Ngāruawāhia and affiliates to Ngāti Tīpā, Ngāti Mahanga, Ngāti Kinohaku and Te Aupōuri. She has degrees in History and Demography from the University of Waikato, and a PhD in Sociology from Stanford University. She is Vice-President of the Population Association of New Zealand Council, a founding member of Te Mana Raraunga, the Māori data sovereignty network, and a member of the Chief Science Advisor Forum.<br><br>The Hamilton Public Lecture Series introduces our newest professors to the community and gives them a chance to demonstrate how their work is having a real impact on the world around us.<br><br>All lectures are free, open to the public and held at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts. Drinks and nibbles are provided from 5:15pm, prior to the lecture beginning at 5:45pm.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Ksenia to Atami Amica wat nong khiaw tha<br>vitia went on a ferry alkie<br>hi Meredith avocado er quenelle tomahto<br>everyone hang on a now Hamato me Toto<br>Pharma ultra-mobile wine tea company<br>tomorrow are muy nominee Aloha key<br>important to a kid in Africa take it in<br>year putin ring automata who are google<br>my name the poor named Tina Clinton<br>moderator<br>teleporter tena koutou tena de facto in<br>Padua thank you for coming Yankee this<br>evening I was a bit worried being on a<br>to break and just before Easter that I<br>might just be talking to a big row of my<br>own byline so I really appreciate you<br>coming<br>thank you so much I feel privileged to<br>have many of my fellow here tonight and<br>to see many so many fun many faces of my<br>colleagues and new faces as well when I<br>was preparing this talk I was given some<br>guidance on what I should aim for and<br>that is to give a seat<br>who are in my approach to the search and<br>the sorts of questions and issues that<br>are focused on throughout my career but<br>for me it's also a good opportunity to<br>give my my final and friends a bit of a<br>dozen - what is that I actually do which<br>is not just attending conferences and<br>nice places and my 11 year old to be see<br>tonight who's heard me talk before<br>perceived that I'm kind of boring so my<br>challenge is to give a non boring talk<br>on a decade of population research and<br>feeling minutes so I want to start by<br>noting that I never set out to be a<br>demographer and I didn't start my<br>working life<br>scholarly pursuits quite the opposite in<br>fact my first job was as a deep reporter<br>at the Oakland Star newspaper which once<br>was great but by the time I landed there<br>the late 1980s was quite a sad really<br>I started right at the bottom of the<br>newsroom leaking water alongside a young<br>someone kiddy reporter called hospitai<br>babies who moved on to have a bigger and<br>brighter things in belvane Ezard<br>and actor and a comedian as part of the<br>proof naked silence and also really<br>steep learning curve for me and it was a<br>world where they were we're here where I<br>grew up I was at 18 when I jump in the<br>open star which accounts for a complete<br>showman and terrible Jody Watley here<br>from the 1980s but I make sure my<br>children were mortified that I was photo<br>in a perfect or no but to be fair it was<br>the 80s and everyone had bed here when I<br>joined the star they would no other body<br>Dunamis on staff I was the only one so I<br>didn't have any wise lead tours to guide<br>me through the twisted racial politics<br>of a daily newspaper in the newsroom<br>mainstream news stories about Mali were<br>often negative in invoking the usual<br>stereotypes of maladies bed men said a<br>lazy violent wouldn't Jim ingredient<br>movie at the time there was also a huge<br>amount of paranoia about the treaty<br>about treaty settlements and the<br>Waitangi tribunal which had just been<br>empowered a 1985<br>14 and that paranoia was definitely<br>reflected and the newspaper coverage of<br>the time must have remembered most of my<br>time I was out of my depth and making<br>the experience and maturity to<br>articulate the gnawing discomfort with<br>what I saw on a daily basis<br>and they were early signs that I was<br>simply not cut out for a career in<br>journalism I really should my going to<br>keep my stories to 500 corgis I tended<br>to overthink the simplest of assignments<br>and perhaps most fatally I doesn't<br>really like talking to people<br>so this of course may be ideally suited<br>to pursue an academic life after the<br>Oakland star closed in 1991 I went to<br>work at mana News which was a pope<br>upper-body immediacy of us there<br>produced party news stories for Radio<br>New Zealand cheap point it was bold it<br>was brown and there was many ways it's<br>time there I got to work with some of<br>the beast and the business including we<br>know her on Twitter who - my - for the<br>best brood broadcast in the country<br>video marketer who's an authority among<br>younger on the Mathematica and web Corey<br>Shortland who is also an accomplished<br>actor and he'd often Mathare way they<br>were excellent journalists and<br>storytellers there were fluent Maori<br>speakers did not only spoke to their<br>body beautifully but they saw the world<br>through distinctively Moldy leans so<br>they were able to craft colorful vibrant<br>funny and nuanced portraits of charming<br>and the portraits had<br>in common with the toxic Marty news<br>stories we cycle through the mainstream<br>media at the time I didn't really fully<br>appreciate the depth of knowledge that<br>my colleagues carried with them all the<br>genius ways in which they were able to<br>flip the narrative by applying a<br>different lens but these rulings would<br>come to resonate with me much later when<br>I shifted from working with groups to<br>working with numbers so after a few<br>years in the UK tamping in the working<br>for a larger magazine company I've got<br>the poor home and involved here at this<br>university and BA majoring in history<br>and I was taught by some fantastic<br>historians here but then I was but - a<br>Tom Lord who's here at the Faculty of<br>Maori in the digital studies and Janean<br>Brown here with who follow and Peter<br>Gibbons who characteristically is hiding<br>behind everybody else book about some<br>fear like meaning for my generation my<br>college job of this country's history<br>was actually woefully inadequate and I<br>knew that that's what I did a degree and<br>history I had strong ties to putty haka<br>through my career into to double why way<br>when I threw my quarter away my fear so<br>I need something about the histories of<br>those two places but to a large yawning<br>gaps and my knowledge and the<br>depravations of<br>colonization we're not something that my<br>career in coral dwelled on or even spoke<br>about their focus was on working hard<br>and upholding the magma of the<br>Kingitanga and the vision North Korea<br>Aarohi there was also a painful past in<br>wonder was largely ignored or grossly<br>misrepresented been musing on textbooks<br>and indeed in the Maya society wider<br>society so these days I'm still very<br>much a wannabe historian but I ended up<br>taking quite a different path one that<br>made lead to population research and for<br>that I had our emeritus professor Ian<br>poor to think he is the comarca or<br>Altair door demography and his seminal<br>book TV moaning population has prism and<br>future's thortex then I make frequent<br>use of this these many things that I<br>love about demography which is defined<br>as the statistical study of human<br>populations I love those not as boring<br>as it sounds I love that population<br>level analysis enables us to identify<br>and track large-scale in long to<br>patterns and trends changes in returning<br>family formation and family structure<br>it's it's big picture stuff that helps<br>us to understand how society is changing<br>and attune how our lives are changing<br>and I will so provides the analytical<br>tools that helps us to identify and<br>rebel with some of them underline<br>drivers of change but also some of the<br>consequences so I had to squeeze in just<br>one breath just final round don't worry<br>there's no more so for me demography is<br>much more about data points and<br>population pyramids and mines on a grass<br>it's also about the rich stories that<br>lie beneath them the stories of the<br>people who comprise the populations so<br>here in the green of the blue line<br>represents change and the number of<br>Maori enumerated and the population<br>census between 1850 and 2030 and that's<br>the scale underneath the outside so it<br>traces a severe population decline that<br>body experience or the scale doesn't<br>really and there we just see it's severe<br>that just means severe the Maori<br>experience following the treaty to the<br>lowest point of 32,000 and the 1896<br>census these are the decades in which<br>partyer prepared to in to quote<br>physician dr. Isaac Featherstone smooth<br>the dying hollow of the Maori race and<br>then after 1901 we see gradual the<br>trooper asian and high rates of<br>population growth as life expectation<br>improved and if fertility rates reached<br>historic highs in the 1940s and 1950s<br>the population continued to grow at a<br>strong will be a slowing pace once the<br>Moldy fertility decline got underway<br>from the from the mid 1960s and was one<br>of the most remnant fertility declines<br>observed in any population<br>at that time which ian has documented<br>very extensively imagine their 2013<br>census there's the most recent wonderful<br>which we have dr. and it could be the<br>most recent one for some time yet<br>counted just under six hundred thousand<br>Maori by ethnicity and six hundred and<br>seventy thousand learning by descent so<br>it really has been a story of a<br>spectacular recovery or back from the<br>brink the red line here shows Maori as a<br>percentage of the overall population and<br>the scale is here so so you can see by<br>the blue smiley seats estimated the 58<br>already comprise about half of the<br>population but by the tune of the<br>century had reduced to just 5% the rapid<br>growth of the party population through<br>the high rates of immigration was key to<br>this change in population balance and<br>depended on the alienation of memory<br>learned this is a distinctive feature<br>the demography of indigenous peoples and<br>chloramine stateless States becoming<br>marginalized minorities and their own<br>homelands in the very short period of<br>time and experiencing dramatic<br>population decline but beneath these<br>numbers like a whole sea of complex<br>relationships the stories stories about<br>the impacts of disease on the public and<br>far know mines and the structures<br>stories have lost a political autonomy<br>of land theft but what's thieved<br>enduring<br>intergenerational poverty policies of<br>coercive cultural assimilation and<br>institutional and interpersonal forms of<br>discrimination but there's also stories<br>of incredible strength and resilience of<br>adaptation of innovation and recognition<br>so our demographic histories are so much<br>richer than a set of time series data<br>points on a graph but how to give<br>expression to these stories demography<br>the sciences picked us largely from the<br>using data that are collected by someone<br>else often a government agency a lot<br>about that ian is an exception here when<br>he was at least Africa he actually went<br>out and collected his own data but more<br>often than not the data collected<br>reflects the priorities and their<br>interests of those who are doing the<br>connection not those from whom the data<br>are being collected so guys without<br>saying that indigenous peoples including<br>Marty have has agreed to forge<br>experiences with data collection with<br>controlled by the state<br>now speak me two years poring over<br>historical Mali census volumes compiled<br>by colonial officials and it's very<br>clear that Mali were the objects of<br>surveillance and the motivation for<br>seeds is taken was one largely opposite<br>of domination and assimilation and<br>economic incorporation by calling an<br>Aboriginal social scientists many Walter<br>has written a link about the multiple<br>ways for what she calls a data<br>Mississippi and for this to occur is<br>efficient with the focus is on<br>identifying subpopulations for the<br>purpose of intervening and as Marty<br>we've often found ourselves as the<br>problem to be solved as the people<br>depict to be intervened upon so the data<br>narratives told about us and my<br>experience Otto often helping stories of<br>failure and this figure is strong<br>synergies with the newsroom narratives<br>of my past life at the ocean<br>so in recent years I've moved from us<br>focus on simply using data to trace<br>patterns and tell stories to the<br>analysis of the production and the<br>ethics of data it's a really fascinating<br>area and part because of the dramatic<br>changes that occurring of the last<br>decade of the data space technological<br>innovation has transformed both the ways<br>in which data are collected shared<br>integrated and exist in the ways in<br>which data are analyzed for example with<br>the emergence of machine learning we<br>live in an age where data is anywhere<br>smartphone and smart building smart TVs<br>how you can even get a smart fridge and<br>though the volume of data is growing now<br>at the mix potential rate but in the<br>21st century the power to decide we in<br>whether and how<br>Digitas people's accounted classified<br>analyzed and acted upon still continues<br>to live with the state so transforming<br>the focus of power over indigenous data<br>from the nation-state back to indigenous<br>peoples lies at the heart of indigenous<br>part of sovereignty<br>and after that I now want to turn for a<br>bit so in another 2069 a co-editor book<br>with my Australian colleague John Taylor<br>called indigenous service or 20 towards<br>an agenda and this is a cover here<br>Seville expanding our work through a<br>collaboration of a First Nations artist<br>Preston Singletary and allotted or based<br>after we remove tummy honey gardener the<br>books freely available on making your<br>website is had more than 20,000<br>downloads in the first three years for<br>me is really gratifying that it has<br>chapters from my master supervisor Ian<br>Paul from my PhD<br>I messed up at Stanford who's from the<br>Cherokee and Choctaw nations and also<br>from one of my current PhD students a<br>fierce battle warrior Disney Roger II is<br>lobia and who's from the Northern<br>Cheyenne nation so basic premise of the<br>book is that ditches peoples have<br>inherent and inalienable rights relating<br>to the collection ownership and the<br>application of data about them in like<br>waves and adhere it works and then we'll<br>try some theorize these rights and<br>interests in a rapidly evolving space<br>and ask the questions<br>what does thought of sovereignty mean<br>for indigenous peoples and how is it<br>being used in their pursuit of<br>self-determination and with the most to<br>naija questions that arranged a smaller<br>questions like who owns the dizziness<br>data who decides what sort of data are<br>collected and how it's used but how do<br>indigenous communities actually benefit<br>from the data that they provide and what<br>are the risks that they carry meaning<br>providing that data and these questions<br>are of course really germane<br>now in the context of changes occurring<br>in our Diadora and the wake of the 2018<br>census which had much lower<br>participation rates than anticipated and<br>now set to New Zealanders having to turn<br>to a much more extensive use of<br>government data to plug the data gaps<br>for the norms and expectations about<br>what the census entails are being<br>redefined where's the meeting New<br>Zealanders mean<br>you'll be aware of so I think we're in<br>for some very interesting conversations<br>and the years ahead about the same time<br>as the book was a train myself and a<br>group of other body dart lovers a new<br>sort of thing we establish the body data<br>sovereignty England even our own earth<br>and this brings together now all more<br>than 100 multi researchers practitioners<br>and entrepreneurs across the research<br>ite community and NGO sectors and but<br>ski purposes to advocate for Maori<br>rights and interests and data and for<br>the development of Maori eally and hapu<br>data infrastructure and capability and<br>because of the epidemics with my info on<br>trying to produce stuff that's useful<br>and accessible that our communities can<br>actually use so one of the things we<br>have done in the past years try to<br>produce practical resources including a<br>two-page brief of multi data sovereignty<br>principles to try and guide the ethical<br>use of data to enhance the well-being of<br>our people language and culture because<br>the regulatory framework doesn't allow<br>different other creative ways to do that<br>and these principles are under depended<br>by six male values including vanity<br>determined now what why the concept of<br>data sovereignty is the product of a<br>digital age and the concept of having<br>clicked of control over data is not at<br>all a recent creation dizziness people<br>to have long been damaged errors and<br> puffer in genealogies and<br>carvings and weapon chants in ceremony<br>and the wrong thing rights and<br>responsibilities consumed with the use<br>of this community health information<br>knowledge belong to the collector not an<br>individual and<br>to identity so moment out of sovereignty<br>in many ways is about the predictive<br>that's about moving from the state of<br>data dependency back to one of autonomy<br>so in that spirit I want to wind this up<br>by by talking a bit about project that<br>I'm currently involved in with my 92<br>preferred name but tries to weave<br>together these threads of demography and<br>history in indigenous data sovereignty<br>so it's a project that's funded by the<br>massive hunt and has focused on<br>measuring and understanding the effects<br>of colonization on the demography of 90<br>teper might help you and the 19th and<br>early 20th century now one of the big<br>challenges of doing this sort of<br>historical demography and our tune or<br>mister reliance on secretly data like<br>published census tables we don't have<br>really a single demographic demographic<br>databases that enable us to observe<br>these changing patterns of mortality<br>directly Indian Isis is original book<br>using and direct methods of estimation<br>but in other countries like Sweden and<br>Canada in the UK and the u.s.<br>researchers have reconstituted<br>populations themselves using records<br>such as church registries and individual<br>legal census data and this allows the<br>identification and the analysis of<br>petals of family formation fertility<br>mortality migration and population rose<br>so the European fertility project at<br>Princeton is probably the most well<br>known of those projects and it<br>quantified the European fertility<br>transition and also identify some of<br>that underlying causal drivers so it's<br>classic demography from the desktop but<br>we don't have anything like they're here<br>so there's a project arose from the idea<br>of population reconstitution to<br>reconstruct our generation of 19th<br>century not stupid<br>sisters and to try and create our own<br>demographic databases but in a really<br>different way so if this kind of<br>enterprise involves many hands make<br>light work and this is just some of the<br>people from my research team nithya<br>month week there who as an oral<br>historian nice to put on worked at all<br>he's based here in our history<br>department Man TT papaya and the Uni<br>Tommy who's here<br>dears khawatir who is an archaeologist<br>in the GIS technician John Bryant Park a<br>researcher who used to be a principal<br>analyst at States we see among these<br>will be danique spoon Bayesian<br>statistics my cousin benissa Clarke was<br>our technologist she's here tonight as<br>well another phenomena and Denis Healey<br>who soon who you main asked us thesis<br>and also play outta here that helps<br>guide our project and of course my dad I<br>mean I thought I'd be working with my<br>dad and it's been a wonderful experience<br>Dara's el comité or and pepper<br>ninja is what I brought up in there so<br>because this I say I about the<br>protein we need to just give us it<br>somehow we connected to other hominid we<br>and so this is our eponymous ancestor<br>deeper this is our connection to general<br>Walker through Vicky our connection to<br>the Knights of Malta our connections to<br>ho ducky through parlor who is tippers<br>father into tomatillo who was the<br>grandfather of Telugu so there's a<br>genealogical connection scorekeeper to<br>another hapu and aiming the Sun at et<br>was part of the Hubble and the Elio De<br>Palma ha a white cotton which is the<br>area where the why part of river rather<br>this year as an additive and the old<br>seats of Smith's though it was called<br>the mo of my cattle district<br>I said buffer between the white huttle<br>and southern will quote so this meant<br>from around 1860 six chairs or patio<br>block there was allocated to the 92-foot<br>I'm Latino white the property owners<br>tribe by the compensation court after<br>the confiscation that I put toward white<br>house Orleanians through the new zealand<br>settlement sect so for 45,000 acres<br>whoever turned in an achiever but by the<br>tune of the century much of it had been<br>alienated only a little fragment of the<br>land remains for farm ownership so the<br>construction of our Father Piper<br>database starts with two censuses<br>undertaken in 1844 and 1858 before 11<br>white couple we heard they brought in<br>Ely at the time and 90 people was one of<br>them into money of authority leave or<br>huh boom the first list was compiled by<br>a missionary I forgot one song and it<br>listed the names of 260 94 men woman and<br>children and the first also connects<br>wives to their husbands in children to<br>their mothers 1858 Francis Benton came<br>along anybody know who Francis B into<br>this my law students here though and so<br>Francis Wheaton was a wife at always in<br>a magistrate at their time but he later<br>went on to become the first chief judge<br>of the native being water so he came<br>along in 1858 he repeated and once or<br>census and he tried to account for the<br>number in each ear we they had<br>subsequently died or moved to other<br>areas those who had moved there those<br>who had<br>change their name and the intervening<br>period and those who were born between<br>1844 and 1858 so he basically was trying<br>to be a demographer and that 1858 versus<br>velocity per head a hundred eighty nine<br>men women and children this unless we've<br>looked through the mid they're not<br>perfect by any means they include people<br>who shouldn't be there they leave out<br>people who should be there they match<br>the wrong woman with the wrong husbands<br>of the bottle children with the wrong<br>parents and there's numerous time oh so<br>many about treated work due care and<br>diligence and interpreter toward the<br>width of the context of 92 but knowledge<br>of our total it's an amazing resource<br>that most other who Andy we don't have<br>and I really like that we've been able<br>to turn what was intended as kind of an<br>instrument of colonial surveillance to<br>know on his heat and main purpose that<br>data according to our own needs so we<br>also have an extensive upper<br>given by one of our to pronoun to today<br>and in the Potomac Rupert I was one of<br>the pitayas August grandchildren and he<br>gave this in 1868 they thought hearing<br>for the 140 o'clock and has upper<br>contains many of the adults and the<br>children from 1958 census along with<br>many others and so taken together these<br>three sources which are all publicly<br>available they formed the foundation is<br>about<br>database and from here we're integrating<br>material from historic newspapers<br>available through the wonderful papers<br>Pascal website and these are currently<br>being induced by one of our nigt per<br>undergraduate school new gold we have<br>holy name caught minute books and block<br>files which contains lists of owners and<br>successions we have information from the<br>prophetic document Bank we had hundreds<br>of Mets and CFA pens that Steve's<br>puppeteer has advocated and digitized we<br>have stacks of files from archives and<br>libraries we have listed some marriage<br>registrations photographs and even<br>information on headstones or for to<br>formality paths but most importantly our<br>Father had developed with an epi mo nica<br>who's our all of the story and a by far<br>know for final approach to capturing the<br>corridor to the we're all about home our<br>tour so for the past year currently<br>between Union County have been visiting<br>Hobart to it at near homes and on the<br>mat I in talking to them about some of<br>the stories that have been passed down<br>through the generations asking them<br>questions like who move the important to<br>ponder that you recall and why were they<br>significant what were the traits of<br>these two burner what do you know about<br>the marriages are crossed out to put our<br>minds and what are supported or about<br>our sites of significance in our<br>corridor to Louisville this has ended up<br>being a very significant exercise and<br>data in peh-chu ation digitization and<br>depression and repurposing as taken<br>fragments of us from public repositories<br>bringing it back to notes<br>trying to make sense of it under our own<br>people it's far bigger than I ever<br>imagined of simply not a three-year<br>research project in these no methodology<br>really so we making it up as we go which<br>is good and nerve-wracking at times so<br>what do we do we we focus on primary<br>source material public repositories we<br>locator we've digitized it all the files<br>are labeled to route the Clawd<br>provenance depending on the type and the<br>source of the content we transcribe it<br>and deke so there's a big task in the<br>store on going and we new source<br>contains direct about that<br>information and a number to put on<br>residence state of death we add this to<br>the up up a database Tony's an<br>off-the-shelf package but we're trying<br>to develop our own so we haven't<br>integrated all of the static yet and at<br>times it actually feels like it's going<br>to be a lifetime's work so this is not<br>demography from the desktop the data<br>belong to the people experience sisters<br>so we take it back to them we hold<br>regular Papa Lohmann at all night<br>when I visited my birth father I took<br>the initiative in mind for this<br>opportunity now how many five I know but<br>I took with Tony Taylor and I'll tell<br>you the world also total annoying and<br>now I purchase between to put all these<br>fragments of information together into a<br>matrix which is the imprinted out and<br>that becomes the focus of our number and<br>endeavor has been absolutely critical<br>here this is the matrix my children call<br>it the deep sea scrolls my husband and<br>he's been absolutely Chris Borden have<br>been able to pull this information<br>together and put it on the proper<br>context and this is where that martyrdom<br>of the knowledge of our family becomes<br>absolutely critical call it or about the<br>origins of names some photo names come<br>from the Muscat Wars but not a third<br>picked a Christianity on our naming<br>practices the listing of toppling from<br>the federal strategic marriage alliances<br>in our relationships with other we were<br>on Monday and then we update the matrix<br>for the next one so the methodology has<br>been day and over information not to<br>take it however now our final are coming<br>forward to provide us with the<br>popular information in via photos and<br>the in participating in interviews and<br>this information requires active<br>protection so it requires the duration<br>of keeping up with the technology with<br>the technology so ultimately this is<br>where we want to get to our own agency<br>both digital archive our digital<br>strategy has been led by cousin Vanessa<br>clerk who's here who's from Maddie Tebow<br>I spent we really have been spent a<br>decade of Silicon Valley managing large<br>IT projects but more importantly she<br>actually knows how to translate this in<br>a way that Nell farmer can engage with<br>so the approach she's designed can be<br>likened to a putter Kiki effects garden<br>which grows in clusters and the clusters<br>are a phenomenal amount achiever who<br>descended from the various tupuna lines<br>that all link back to our eponymous<br>ancestor deeper so at the bottom here is<br>our digitized data and then announce<br>second layer as the part it's the<br>physical container of the data and in<br>keeping with our body data sovereignty<br>principles we ever people are provided<br>they can guarantee that this server<br>which the data was thought will be here<br>in a year or we don't want our data<br>stored on a offshore data warehouse<br>somewhere we don't know where does the<br>third layer is that ikana<br>layer there's the systems the processes<br>the protocols and Vanessa's being<br>developed enough to come up alongside<br>our far no they are the ones deciding<br>evils of access for publicly source<br>information and also the private<br>information that they provide and in the<br>final layer as the applications layer<br>and that's most likely to be web-based<br>online because many of our descendents<br>out good Eve they do not know that<br>little here they can't come back to them<br>and I we already know from the research<br>we've done an idiot at least one of the<br>six maybe one in five Maori devotees and<br>there's a desire the disinformation to<br>be accessible so we have to integrate<br>technology into our proteins the slate<br>approach here the main paper in the<br>slide gives us the opportunity to<br>co.design the requirements for<br>really pregnant illegal and it enables<br>an igt / fireman to self-determine the<br>must-haves or the non-negotiable aspects<br>what this particle with a partner to<br>Kiki and then the nice-to-haves but not<br>necessarily necessary so multiple<br>technologies here seen as key enablers<br>but we need to take care that ninety<br>Tebow my mom wants to happiness asserted<br>to reroute and it guides you think that<br>we do and inline without a Molly data<br>sovereignty principles the database will<br>be owned but I'm going to super in<br>controlled by them is a ton of the<br>current of future generations so much<br>let me ask the last second to last line<br>and we've got so much more work to do<br>and will continue on for a few years<br>year we need to continue to integrate<br>and validate our information and develop<br>our statistical models using estimated<br>birth and death dates we need to create<br>an infrastructure that's sustainable<br>that lasts beyond the duration of a<br>three-year research project succession<br>planning is absolutely critical<br>I'm not 18 anymore I think the most so<br>we need to engage our undertaking are<br>entirely to be our future itop and we<br>need to create pathways and to connect<br>because of uh birth is our<br>strength so at the heart of this project<br>as well Papa there's our people<br>are our farm oh and I just want to end<br>by acknowledging the huge contribution<br>of our living in<br>Nikki this is what all to multiple<br>staying your time in any tea a concern<br>in nearly a meter they were right there<br>from the outset when this idea was first<br>developed and they gave generously of<br>the other half the time it was<br>symptomatic aroma and unfortunately they</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding:
