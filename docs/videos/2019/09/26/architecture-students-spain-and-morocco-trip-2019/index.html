I'm studying MArch(Prof) <br>at the University of Auckland.<br>Hi, I'm Tahara. I'm studying Master of <br>Architecture (Professional) at Auckland.<br>Hi, I'm Shikara and I'm doing the <br>same thing as these guys are doing.<br>So every two years, the University <br>of Auckland holds an international  <br>study tour and you get to go overseas <br>and study with a foreign university.<br>We just spent five weeks in Morocco and Spain.<br>A highlight was Morocco. Morocco was <br>amazing. I think culturally it was  <br>just something that I've never experienced before.<br>It's not just about like the architecture, <br>which is the reason we go obviously,  <br>but it's really like immersing yourself in those  <br>cultures and things like cuisine <br>and traditions, things like dance.<br>And these old cities, especially like the <br>Medina of Fez, they're very labyrinthine,  <br>they sort of weave together all these sorts of <br>spaces and so you find yourself getting lost  <br>in these streets. You know, finding dead ends and <br>running into all sorts of people that you probably  <br>wouldn't meet otherwise. Definitely an interesting <br>experience. It does feel like an adventure.<br>Yeah, it's just so incredible because <br>the architecture and sometimes the  <br>families that live in those places <br>are older than New Zealand itself.<br>You'll stumble upon these places that you've <br>studied or you've drawn in like a lecture,  <br>or you've seen on a lecture slide and there's that  <br>moment where it sort of clicks <br>and you're like, "oh, I'm there!"<br>That was one of my highlights was just <br>being able to analyse whether I liked a  <br>building or not and why I liked it and <br>being able to share the kind of amazing  <br>experiences like the Alhambra and stuff <br>like that with everyone and to kind of  <br>look around at everyone and think like this <br>is what the big deal was about, you know.<br>For me, the trip kind of solidified why I <br>wanted to continue studying in architecture.<br>Calculus definitely doesn't give me the same rush.<br>I did enjoy the Alhambra. I like <br>that a lot because I had written  <br>an essay about it and also...it was a Game of <br>Thrones location so that's also quite nice.<br>You kind of stop for a second, you look around <br>you're like, "am I really here right now?"<br>And I'll say like, "we ate at the Casa MilÃ ," <br>and they'll be like, "that's nice, dear,"<br>but I'm like, "no, no, you're not <br>listening. Look it up, Google it."<br>Yeah, so it's often like, <br>you kind of have a moment.<br>But that's what's so cool about sharing <br>it with seventy other people is that you  <br>have seventy sources to back you up to <br>say like, "yeah, we really did that."<br>"That was real."</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
