A portfolio demonstrates your creative work and your skill set to date.<br>So that could include anything from <br>drawings, models, photography, watercolours,  <br>one-to-one fabrication or buildings that you may have designed. SlideRoom is the <br>Creative Arts and Industries portfolio submission portal. It's the place where you will upload your work  <br>and where we will actually be reviewing <br>it. It's a relatively intuitive process,  <br>but there are guidelines online if you get stuck. The portfolio itself should be 12 to 15 pages of A3<br>that do not exceed 10 megabytes. It's important to remember that each page must have an image or  <br>more than one image on each page. Anything over 15 pages won't actually be assessed. <br>It's important also that you don't submit any hard copies, so if you've got physical artworks, sculptures and  <br>those sorts of things, you can take a photograph and submit that, or you can scan it if it's some  <br>sort of collage or something. <br>So in terms of labelling requirements, we really encourage you  <br>to use the SlideRoom function. We encourage you to keep those descriptions short as possible,  <br>because we're assessing so many portfolios every time, but in, it it's really helpful  <br>if you tell us why it relates to architecture <br>and why you use the techniques and media that  <br>you chose. It's important to bear in mind that some of the things you'll be actually studying  <br>when you come here include drawing, fabrication, digital technologies, sustainability, history,  <br>conservation, architectural theory and <br>architecture. So keep that in mind when  <br>you're curating your portfolio. That those are the kind of things and images that we'd like to see. <br>For example, Have you taken models of the city? Have you done your own building design in some of your  <br>earlier papers? That's the kind of images <br>we want to see. So general tips from me are:  <br>This is an application to the School of <br>Architecture and Planning, so we're really  <br>interested in your creative potential at the school, and also your unique perspective on  <br>architecture in the built realm. So unfortunately including things like Christmas tinsel,  <br>lego and other ready-made items is not going to be the best for your submission. In addition to the  <br>portfolio we actually ask for a written statement, and the purpose of the written statement is,  <br>it actually supplements your portfolio. So it's useful for you to tell us a bit about yourself,  <br>why you want to study here and those sorts of things, but it's also an opportunity for those  <br>of you that haven't necessarily got the strongest design portfolio. We're aware that you come from  <br>a variety of backgrounds and we're not expecting you to be artistic visionaries at this point. This  <br>is a School of Architecture, we teach you a lot of this stuff. So it's really a way of conveying any  <br>element that didn't get across in the portfolio. We know it can be an intimidating process,  <br>but it's really an opportunity for you to show off your creativity, and we'd love to see your work.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
