I'm a resource consent <br>planner at Auckland Council citizen team. <br>I studied a Bachelor of Urban Planning <br>at the University of Auckland.<br>Initially, I saw planning as all about <br>sustainability, sustainable development,  <br>about where bus stops go, where public houses go.<br>But I learned that it's <br>much more complex than that.<br>So we learn many different <br>urban theory and practices.<br>We learn to understand that every little thing  <br>could have a huge effect on <br>how people live in a city.<br>In my degree, it's quite a small class, <br>about 30 to 50 people so these friends  <br>that you meet at university also <br>become your lifelong friends.<br>Planning is such a small industry you get <br>to meet these people on a regular basis,  <br>whether as a client or working <br>alongside you so it's good making  <br>all these different friends that <br>really help you along the way.<br>Planning students were given a huge dedicated <br>planning studio space that mimicked a professional  <br>working environment you can present your ideas and <br>your project. So the University of Auckland really  <br>taught me some important soft skills, critical <br>thinking, team working and decision-making.<br>We had to help out a not-for-profit <br>organisation outside the University.  <br>So just helping coming up with some <br>creative planning solutions to their  <br>issues. Specialist is really important as <br>a planner to understand what they want and  <br>what we need and working together to reach <br>an outcome that we both want for our city.<br>So the degree had several papers targeting at  <br>the Resource Management Act and <br>the resource consenting process.<br>So this relates directly to what I'm working <br>on now at the Council to come up with creative  <br>planning solutions and outcomes to make <br>Auckland and New Zealand a better place.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
