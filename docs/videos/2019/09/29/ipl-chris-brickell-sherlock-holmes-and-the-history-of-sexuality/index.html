Royden Summerville to<br>each and every one of you know my had a<br>my welcome now the first time that I had<br>the pleasure of introducing Chris<br>prickle was right after his book mates<br>and lovers was published<br>and in the course of assessing his<br>application for promotion to Professor<br>many of his referees commented on mates<br>and lovers and it was a fantastic<br>opportunity for me to revisit why that<br>book was so fantastic I was absolutely<br>delighted to read their comments so much<br>so that I actually want to share one of<br>them anonymously with you this evening<br>so from my perspective one of Chris's<br>referees summed up both Chris and his<br>book beautifully and they said a great<br>deal of scholarly publication is arcane<br>esoteric and attended only for the<br>initiated in contrast professor Brickell<br>seems to have in mind what Virginia<br>Woolf called the common reader which is<br>particularly valuable when one is<br>dealing with such a terrific subject as<br>same-sex relations mates and lovers<br>demonstrates both Chris's industry and<br>the fertility of his intellect I'm<br>certain that tonight we are all going to<br>be treated to a bit of Chris's industry<br>and the fertility of his intellect<br>during his IPL in addition to his<br>scholarly research professor Brickell is<br>also a highly successful classroom<br>teacher and a very popular research<br>supervisor and he's provided exemplary<br>service to the University so Chris on<br>behalf of the University of Otago I<br>would like to warmly congratulate you on<br>your very very well-deserved promotion<br>to Professor Nami he knew iki aqua I<br>will now hand over to Professor Lisa<br>Smith who is going to tell us just a<br>little bit more about Chris's journey to<br>Professor Noir era tena koe totin okoto<br>Tana tato Pato<br>in amana NRL row rangatira ma no my<br>Haiti my Tati my Hema Hema Hema he tena<br>koutou katoa<br>it is my honor to introduce a little bit<br>more about Chris Brickell professor<br>Chris prickle for his inaugural<br>professorial lecture Sherlock Holmes and<br>the history of sexuality now as you<br>might expect Chris Kemp comes to us<br>tonight with the most impressive<br>academic record he earned a double BA in<br>1993 in geography and sociology from<br>Victoria University of Wellington a year<br>later Chris completed his BA Honours<br>first class from the department of<br>sociology and social policy also at<br>Victoria University and just five years<br>after that in 1999 chris earned his PhD<br>from the same department now following a<br>postdoc at the University of Canterbury<br>Chris joined the University of Otago in<br>2001 as a lecturer in the Gender Studies<br>Program he was promoted to senior<br>lecturer in 2006 associate professor in<br>2012 and professor this year currently<br>Chris is head of program for sociology<br>gender studies and criminology in the<br>School of Social Sciences now doing the<br>maths this represents a rather meteoric<br>rise from being a fresh-faced kids<br>starting out in the world 20 years ago<br>to a fresh-faced professor and head of a<br>major program at the University of Otago<br>I mean look at him when he gets up here<br>at least you could do Chris's start to<br>age unless you're hiding a portrait in<br>your attic I don't know let's turn to<br>Chris's research shall we<br>Chris's research explores sexuality<br>especially theories and histories of<br>homosexuality histories of sociology and<br>social research histories of adolescents<br>consumer culture and cultural politics<br>in short chris is a scholar of intimate<br>life and social change a substantial<br>amount of his work explores the<br>emergence of gay life in New Zealand<br>since the 19th century in particular he<br>studies the way sexuality has given<br>shape have been given shape across time<br>and place a look at his CV shows that<br>chris has published six<br>books 28 book chapters 43 refereed<br>journal articles and 17 book reviews now<br>these aren't just publications chris has<br>been honored with several awards and<br>distinctions for his work he received<br>the New Zealand Society of authors eh<br>mcCormick best first book award for<br>nonfiction for his book mates and lovers<br>a history of gay New Zealand mates and<br>lovers was also a finalist for the<br>Montana New Zealand Book Awards in the<br>history catalogue and was made into a<br>stage play Chris's book teenagers the<br>rise of youth culture in New Zealand was<br>shortlisted in the nonfiction category<br>for the 2018 New Zealand heritage book<br>and Writing Awards teenagers was also<br>long listed the same year in the<br>Illustrated nonfiction category for the<br>akhom New Zealand Book Awards Chris was<br>the recipient of the top achiever<br>doctoral scholarship supervisor award in<br>2008 and was awarded the University of<br>Otago ro Heath trust award and Carl<br>Smith medal in 2009 and he engages in an<br>amazing amount of service at all levels<br>in the university in the community<br>nationally and internationally chris is<br>currently on three editorial boards for<br>major journals in the USA and the UK and<br>is a member of the Editorial Board of<br>the Otago University Press and when<br>Chris realized that there weren't enough<br>outlets for books on gender and<br>sexuality he founded genre books but<br>wait there's more Chris's work expands<br>well beyond the written word he's given<br>nearly 50 interviews in the media and on<br>air many conference presentations and<br>public lectures in venues ranging from<br>the mine Jam series at Queenstown to the<br>Auckland art gallery so that's the<br>official professor Chris Brickell<br>however I wanted to add shall we say a<br>personal touch to this introduction and<br>so I embarked on a mission a mission to<br>dig up a wee anecdote about Chris<br>something amusing perhaps something like<br>Chris once went on sabbatical to Iowa<br>and was a<br>rested for tipping cows however that<br>would not be true Chris has never been<br>to Iowa he has never been arrested for<br>anything much less tipping cows so I<br>walked up and down the corridors and I<br>asked his colleagues and his his other<br>people that I came into him cross and I<br>said what can you tell me about Chris<br>and every single person said the same<br>thing Chris he's a really nice guy even<br>his former head of department professor<br>Hugh Campbell said Chris he's a really<br>nice guy now I've known Chris a long<br>time but I've only gotten to work<br>closely with him this past year and he's<br>a really nice guy<br>he's also an amazingly hard worker and<br>he's caring of others and he has a laugh<br>that can only be described as infectious<br>so it's time to turn this over to Chris<br>do your about Sherlock Holmes and the<br>history of sexuality I love a good<br>detective story and I'm ready for an<br>outstanding lecture so now please join<br>me in welcoming professor Chris Brickell<br>outstanding scholar brilliant teacher<br>and supervisor magnificent colleague and<br>you know takoto I'm not sure who that<br>was about but anyhow I think everyone<br>for coming this is really really cool<br>I'm really used to teaching in this room<br>if had lots of gender 102 classes in<br>here but everyone's so grown up looking<br>at the audience it seems a bit unusual<br>and slightly wrong but that's right<br>universities are made to challenge us<br>right today I want to talk a little bit<br>about my intellectual journey and then I<br>want to talk about the kind of detective<br>work that you have to do when you study<br>the history of sexuality so I arrived at<br>Otago in 2001 and I started working in<br>what was then the gender and Women's<br>Studies program and then became the<br>genius Studies program a little bit<br>later on and one of the things I've<br>always enjoyed about about working in<br>gender studies is that it's such an<br>incredibly interdisciplinary space and I<br>think the interdisciplinarity of it fits<br>quite well with me because as as Lisa<br>said I've got a bit of geography and a<br>bit of sociology in a bit of history<br>although the history I came across<br>almost almost by accident no say a<br>little bit about that I I guess I want<br>to start with the place I grew up which<br>is in Waterloo and Hart Valley and I<br>actually spend a bit of time looking at<br>this this afternoon thinking have I got<br>the perspective right and actually I<br>think I did choose the right photo<br>because you can see right in the middle<br>there's a patch of grass that's<br>Trafalgar Park and if you go to Ward's<br>the railway line you'll kind of hit my<br>house somewhere so in India in in in<br>lower heart not Johnsonville<br>Johnsonville was written by David<br>Pearson who was one of the several<br>people who influenced me very very much<br>at a time Victoria University so I've<br>been here so long one nice thing I come<br>from here possibly worrying and not and<br>so these kind of strands are very much<br>part of my kind of intellectual history<br>so I started becoming interested in<br>history because I did geography and in<br>geography we did<br>geography and there was a real kind of<br>historical strain to that and sociology<br>I work with David who's interested in<br>the histories of communities I work with<br>clear Toynbee who's interested in the<br>history of family and David Boardman who<br>encouraged me to do gender and Phil<br>Morrison and geography who really<br>encouraged that interest in urban<br>history so all of these things have kind<br>of come together to really get me<br>interested in thinking about history<br>space community and what this all means<br>in terms of how we might think about<br>eventually sexuality all those<br>sexualities sort of came later as I was<br>putting this together I realized there<br>are some curious little kind of<br>inspirations and my kind of intellectual<br>journey this one up on the writers New<br>Zealand yesterday's which my parents<br>bought when I was 13 and it's written by<br>Hamish Keith and it's the most cool<br>interesting accessible kind of New<br>Zealand history full of awesome<br>photographs and this word libidinous<br>which is now one of my favorite words<br>because I remember reading it when I was<br>13 thinking what does that mean probably<br>something rude<br>how interesting and I also became very<br>interested a partly under clear toybiz<br>influence that looking at sociology of<br>the family in the history of the family<br>and the woman on the left of this<br>photograph is my grandma who sadly died<br>but she leave me a really awesome<br>collection of photographs of her life<br>and her friends lives in the 1940s and<br>I'm gonna come back and talk about the<br>1940s soon now this is me at Victoria<br>University he's David on the Left he's<br>possibly very excited about Johnsonville<br>but<br>he may have moved on by by that point<br>Allison Kirkman my other supervisor in<br>me and then me at my parents place<br>sitting among some grasses as you do<br>with this lovely kind of art stole what<br>the so this was in 1999 I've never worn<br>the Hat who else hates this hair does<br>the herbal thing it's like a pin cushion<br>and black but anyhow I won't ask the VC<br>to change the head because I know Tigers<br>is the same so then our yeah I moved to<br>our Canterbury with my partner Geoffrey<br>and we took us a wee while to sort of<br>get over this Canterbury Christ Church<br>is so different from Wellington and a<br>whole lot of different ways one of them<br>is that I itch the purchase this<br>delightful blower of plastic cactus<br>which you can see in my office here in a<br>desperate attempt to liven up an office<br>that looked out upon a concrete wall as<br>you can see there however it was very<br>much more the deflating plastic green<br>cactus and so every week I'd go in there<br>after the weekend is that a kind of lost<br>all it's a year and hit to kind of be<br>resuscitated so you know you don't have<br>to water these things but you need a<br>good foot pump<br>so anyway in 1919 I mean look at that<br>whenever chief when I watch the TV and I<br>always say what's there does that mean<br>to be a computer and watching something<br>from 1995 and it looks like it should<br>have been thrown out quite some time ago<br>anyway I worked with Myles Fairburn at<br>Canterbury University and Myles<br>introduced me to New Zealand political<br>history and so I spent a lot of time<br>looking at the 1940s in particular<br>because we were trying to look at what<br>happened with the first Labour<br>government and I remember things about<br>dairy farmers and I learned about<br>Michael Joseph savage and Peter phrase<br>when it was all very exciting and miles<br>came across as quite Stern but actually<br>he really wasn't not not even in the<br>slightest and it was at this point when<br>I thought well given I've got an<br>interest in ginger and sexuality and get<br>it given I've got this new interest in<br>history what if I put those two things<br>together like it seemed to be the<br>obvious thing to do right so I sort of<br>started looking at that a little bit as<br>I was working at at Canterbury and then<br>I discovered this article by Brahmin<br>deli now my former research assistant<br>Louie Spearman is in the audience and<br>she knows how frustrated I have been<br>with this article by Bronwyn bronwen's<br>really cool incidentally this article<br>intrigues me because it's both right in<br>totally wrong all at the same time ramen<br>deli in 2001 is started looking at the<br>history of sexuality in New Zealand and<br>she suggests that often we find clues in<br>areas that aren't wholly related to the<br>history of sexuality in other words we<br>kind of find when we start talking the<br>family that we might see things or<br>cities city life urban kind of urban<br>communities we might find information<br>about sexuality and unusual places she<br>says we need to creep in sideways to<br>explore not only the reality content of<br>documents but also the ways in which<br>that reality was perceived and I agree<br>with her however when I started<br>gay history I thought they were actually<br>some giant areas where no one's really<br>looked and you can find bulk information<br>as well as little bits of information so<br>after a few years of kind of ferreting<br>around about this I produced this which<br>has probably got one of my favorite<br>photos in the entire world on the front<br>cover which I discovered at the<br>Alexander Turnbull library by accident<br>in the folder labeled men probably not<br>an accident I mean who could have<br>assists a folder labeled me anymore I<br>couldn't so I found these guys these<br>guys are more photographed by guy in<br>Whanganui called what I William Harding<br>who had a great big photographic swell a<br>tiny photographic studio and a great big<br>set of negatives lots and lots of photos<br>of men together and so I'll just let you<br>look at the cover a little bit the first<br>time I saw this I didn't realize that in<br>fact the guy's knees were touching and<br>it wasn't till I got at home I think I<br>just liked the men and then I also liked<br>the dog and then I thought well actually<br>there's the knees as well so that's a<br>little bit of a bonus so what's an ear<br>like what did I find me and I started to<br>look well they've been quite a few<br>interviews done with with with old gay<br>men but I could use and what I conducted<br>some myself and I'm very shame to say<br>that all almost all the me and I<br>interviewed died and I wanted to say<br>please don't let me interview you<br>because actually it may not end out well<br>and so I feel slightly bad about there<br>but also court records I'm going to talk<br>about court records a bit in a little<br>while you may not know that archives des<br>archives New Zealand Dunedin branch has<br>pretty much a complete set of court<br>records dating from 1862 it's very much<br>the most sophisticated and complete set<br>of court records in the country<br>there are many good reasons to do<br>research in Dunedin and live here while<br>you're doing it it's nice and also<br>archives is good and of course there's<br>the Hakan which is magnificent and I<br>used the hawk and quite a lot to Gale<br>aberration because including periodicals<br>but also photographs I might have been a<br>bit frustrated with brahmand dailies<br>argument about creeping in sideways but<br>an actual fact she wrote the most<br>amazing chapter in the book called<br>disputed histories on the use of<br>photographs in new zealand history and<br>she talks about the different ways she<br>sort of follows Peter Burke's kind of<br>outline on this the cultural historian<br>about the ways in which how people<br>appear in photographs tells us something<br>about their disposition their emotional<br>life be a work life social stress social<br>connectedness that they're actually a<br>really rich source not just an<br>illustration but actually something that<br>tells us something about sexuality<br>itself so these kind of connectedness<br>'as these photographs here range from<br>1888 the one on the lower left right<br>sorry to the nineteen and 90s on the top<br>right and so you can see both that my<br>early research in terms of sexuality<br>focused on men my current research<br>doesn't solely and I'm going to come<br>back to that in just a moment and the<br>visual is a really important part of<br>this set of connections that sort of<br>seed of intellectual for producing one<br>of the men I interviewed was Donnie<br>cross scurry and here he is in his wig<br>on the left-hand side of this slide this<br>is a photo I've never used before but<br>you've got to save things right just in<br>case you have an IPL one day what you<br>don't want to use all your photos all at<br>once I've become quite interested<br>recently in the work of Raymond Williams<br>in terms of thinking through the way<br>that social change and cultural change<br>happen<br>and I was reading the other week Marx as<br>I'm in literature again and there are<br>some really interesting little things in<br>there I think that tell us something<br>about<br>our everyday life and the emotional<br>connections of everyday life relate to<br>the bigger social stuff that goes on so<br>william suggests that social change as<br>the result of the ordinariness of human<br>experience as well as political and<br>intellectual agency so what he's saying<br>is the movements that we have for social<br>change are really important when we<br>write letters or have a blog or hold a<br>banner and have a protest that stuff's<br>really important but what's also<br>important is the way that people<br>experience their own lives and the way<br>that this can lead to a biggest set of<br>social changes down the track so he<br>talks about everyday practical<br>consciousness being different from<br>official consciousness embryonic and<br>informal structures of feeling he says<br>can be later on built on and turned into<br>institutions and I'm going to explain in<br>a minute what I'm what I think he means<br>flight by this he regarded effective<br>elements of consciousness and<br>relationships there is emotion<br>connection feeling at social relating as<br>important elements in social change so<br>in other words the lives that people<br>have lived in the connections they've<br>built up have themselves been really<br>important in subsequent movements around<br>politics in this case gay politics and<br>so as I collected photographs like these<br>ones these are from christchurch in the<br>1960s the two big ones in and from<br>Liefeld Beach this little one and you<br>might be wondering what emptying a<br>chamber pot out the window has to do<br>with social change was anyone curious<br>remotely this Liefeld Beach gives you a<br>bit of a sense actually if you realize<br>that the guy on the left hand side is<br>slightly obscured is holding a tea pot<br>so what we have here in in Christchurch<br>for instance in the 1940s and it was<br>replicated in other cities too was the<br>growth of a gay culture back gay culture<br>by the early 1960s would translate into<br>the first one of the first international<br>organizations for law form the durian<br>society's legal subcommittee and the<br>guys in that subcommittee came out of<br>the culture building that happened after<br>World War two so it wasn't like the 60s<br>or the 70s just happened I would argue<br>but in fact it was a process that<br>emerged out of social connection<br>emotional connection friendships the<br>guys in these networks were friends<br>until they died one by one by one they<br>lived through law reform they lived<br>through some of them civil unions and<br>actually those connections run right the<br>way through we often think of gay libous<br>kind of somehow starting in 1972 but in<br>Ch Leo I think it didn't and this is<br>where Williams ideas important their<br>idea that actually people's<br>connectedness before there was really<br>significant so even something like<br>having a barbecue under a willow tree on<br>a rock that actually blends in quite<br>nicely with the grass these kind of<br>things I wondered if the thing on the<br>right was somehow suspicious but<br>actually no I think it's a barbecue is I<br>think we're right even these kind of<br>social connections I think really kind<br>of lead us somewhere in terms of how<br>social change happens okay now I know<br>you're wondering where Sherlock Holmes<br>comes in well okay this is him or at<br>least it might be sometimes doing<br>history into doing the history of<br>sexuality does feel a little bit like<br>being a detective<br>because sometimes bulk photographs<br>interviews court records give you bulk<br>information but sometimes they don't and<br>you have to sneak in sideways and as<br>weird Ellie I think was right<br>Jared Davidson's book did letters which<br>the Magnificent Otago University Press<br>published justice<br>here has a really interesting discussion<br>of the way that liters another ephemera<br>of daily life actually tap into these<br>bigger social changes and so Davidson<br>suggests that fragments of everyday life<br>steers towards a larger and more complex<br>story I tell my students not to do this<br>larger than what I say you know that<br>thing and so what I mean is larger Ben<br>the stories themselves I was realized as<br>I was looking over this and the lecture<br>theater beforehand thinking actually<br>I've just quoted poor old Jared in a way<br>that kind of does that thing that I tell<br>my students not to do but anyhow so what<br>happens when we start sleuthing and we<br>start kind of looking and we look at<br>official documents what do we learn what<br>does it tell us well these are some of<br>the things I learned when I was<br>researching mates and lovers and I<br>discovered these from a range of<br>different sources not just court records<br>but but to some extent bit a language of<br>gender and sexuality appeared by the<br>signify an effeminate man who is<br>interested in passive sexual relations<br>can you say the word [ __ ] in an<br>IPL<br>because there was another word that<br>okay no drinks and nibbles for me<br>afterwards obviously this this language<br>was significant because what we started<br>seeing is New Zealand urbanized was a<br>kind of a growth of a set of kind of<br>cultures and understandings gay cultures<br>were well developed in New Zealand<br>cities by the 1930s and 40s they were<br>well developed in Australian cities 20<br>years earlier but an actual fact New<br>Zealand cities were smaller urban<br>ization you no kidding critical mass was<br>slower sexuality had a particular<br>geography this was in fact the if it<br>does anyone know where this's can anyone<br>recognize the very magnificent Auckland<br>fury building on the Left hand-side and<br>the steps around the Ferry Building were<br>a part of all them that me and meeting<br>and we know this because the court<br>records tell us so sex between men was<br>not always a big deal in everyday life<br>and what emerges in some of these kind<br>of places is that idea that natural fact<br>men might be particularly young men<br>going around rural life and then they<br>say basically how about it and they go<br>year and then they go off and go to a<br>dance or you go and get some food and<br>you know alongside this kind of really<br>sort of come back to the semi censorious<br>public foon condemnation there was also<br>something kind of lease a fear about New<br>Zealand life at the same time class and<br>social capital were important factors<br>and a beasts and convictions as probably<br>won't come as a surprise to you<br>particularly to was was remarked in<br>Christchurch where the probation<br>officers report say we would recommend<br>Lee didn't see because he comes from a<br>well-off and respectable family they<br>would actually say this at least so in<br>the other cities but it becomes very<br>clear when you look through the material<br>that the men who are usually arrested<br>were labourers itinerant workers<br>marginal figures they tended to be Pocky<br>hard there was very little if any<br>substantial policing of rural and rural<br>based Maori and they did not come to<br>attention until after World War two and<br>policing was reactive rather than active<br>in the decades before 1950 and this<br>became quite significant in the case of<br>a little kind of but quite famous case<br>I'm going to talk to you about next in<br>fact police would usually arrest people<br>when they tripped over them in alleyways<br>or if someone made a complaint or if a<br>policeman was particularly nosey and<br>might wait outside a window and then<br>listen through the window for like half<br>an hour noting down everything the guys<br>were saying and ingo okay it's time to<br>arrest them now I mean this might sound<br>random but actually over the weekend I<br>was reading this incredibly rare book<br>which of course our library has because<br>our library is magnificent<br>well it's magnificent archive it's<br>called Harry Daley this small cloud and<br>it's the autobiography of an openly gay<br>policeman who worked in London during<br>the 1920s 30s and 40s and one of the<br>things that becomes really clear in<br>Daly's memoir is that there was a<br>certain randomness really as to where<br>the police had other priorities that day<br>or whether they had decided that<br>something needed to be followed up and<br>they needed to start sort of being a but<br>directive what people came to them and<br>were quite pestering or whatever so<br>there was an in the UK a certain<br>randomness about policing practice which<br>was also viewed to some extent in New<br>Zealand and it helps explain this has<br>anyone seen this it was on newsroom a<br>few weeks ago by Steve Braun yes and<br>Steve rang me up and he said hey what's<br>um what's all this about Sarge's in'<br>there is very much a received version of<br>what happened to sarge a son in his<br>lover<br>Leonard Halle Byrne which is that they<br>were in a bedroom in a boarding house in<br>Wellington and 1927 the police had been<br>taking them out and in Burstyn and<br>arrested them and I couldn't work out<br>how this was because it didn't fit with<br>all the other policing I could find at<br>the time and then when I finally found<br>the court file I realized that the story<br>which was told by a family member of<br>Saracens was actually wrong the police<br>did not do that in fact holoband went to<br>them telling the police had been<br>blackmailed I mean he had had sex with<br>who are trying to extort money what are<br>you going to do about it and what the<br>police did is they arrested him and then<br>he told them where Norris Devi who later<br>became Frank so justin will be found and<br>so they went and arrested him as well<br>and that made a whole lot more sense in<br>terms of the pattern of policing but<br>what was really interesting was that the<br>story about the boarding house continued<br>to be really culturally popular and I<br>think that was because that story spoke<br>to the way people like to see social<br>change operating in the past it was dark<br>and terrible and now it's really really<br>good and so the sort of thing that would<br>have happened in a dark and terrible<br>past is that policemen monitored bought<br>bedrooms and boarding houses leapt out<br>from behind the door the reality was<br>perhaps more mundane but then I was<br>puzzling and I know others puzzled too<br>after reading bornus his piece on Sarge<br>Essen and they said but how would that<br>be how would you go and essentially daub<br>yourself into police in fact others did<br>that they would go to police and they<br>say these guys are blackmailing me in<br>one case the blackmailer was locked up<br>in prison but reading Delhi's memoir<br>about London and which in working-class<br>communities the police was seen often as<br>the helpers that people you would go to<br>to complain about your neighbor or get<br>help with some little issue that you<br>needed help with a find directions that<br>they weren't seen as the long arm of the<br>law or the oppressive state at all so I<br>thought this is kind of interesting and<br>where it takes us as<br>needing to look at lots of different<br>contexts and order to make sense of what<br>it is we're seeing now I want to talk to<br>you now about Florence Lance and Joseph<br>trachea these two women married in a<br>church in Sydney in 1890 with a minister<br>and everything how was this possible and<br>what did it mean the relationship soured<br>because Joseph whom Florence called<br>Josie committed bigamy and married<br>another woman in a church and everything<br>sent Matthews an Auckland not the<br>current Lisbon and gay rainbow myths and<br>Matthews but another one and then<br>Florence and Josie got divorced and then<br>Josie and Jean got divorced what was<br>going on with women marrying and<br>divorcing at a time when this wasn't<br>meant to be possible this is the most<br>awesome case and it's an again in the<br>most wonderful repository which was<br>archives New Zealand and Dunedin and<br>what this case includes is this great<br>big fat pile of papers held together by<br>lovely skanky old Pig ribbon anyhow<br>quite thick pile of papers fall of these<br>litres that were submitted as evidence<br>for the divorce of aunt Josie in<br>Florence and at this point they would<br>win that when these leaders were written<br>basically Josie was trying to get<br>Florence back after having admitted that<br>she had fallen with Gene in other words<br>married to an Auckland when she was<br>pretending to be going for a short<br>holiday at a boarding house<br>the boardinghouse turned out to be the<br>little cottage and how I work that she<br>was setting up her other life with Jean<br>and you know it's a bit of this films<br>with people have two families except in<br>this case it was two households one<br>amount Roskill and one and how I work<br>anyhow and these litres and which by<br>this point it was all starting to fall<br>apart and and Josie was begging was<br>begging to be you know to be let back<br>into Florence's affection since she<br>wrote things like did you miss me a<br>little bit today baby<br>you were never out of my thoughts once<br>and now I can cry easily and so on and<br>so on and so on this case is fantastic<br>because it actually allows us to do two<br>things firstly it allows us to draw kind<br>of slightly over complicated things like<br>this so where I got to here's I thought<br>I just wanted to show you the kinds of<br>records that you can use to pay to piece<br>together a case like this so it's not<br>just that we start with it with the<br>divorce records and then we kind of<br>tease them out from there but we've<br>actually got a whole pile of stuff in<br>the far the litres which I've mentioned<br>Josie's littered to her doctor the<br>doctor's bill which shows that Josie<br>spent quite a lot of money consulting<br>him a flour mill invoice whoever thought<br>a flour mill invoice would be useful for<br>studying the history of sexuality right<br>this was an invoice written out to me<br>Dom Lance intra care suggesting they<br>lived in their community as two women<br>may be widows don't know the marriage<br>certificate of course which marital took<br>place in Newtown and Sydney and then the<br>the divorce file of Jean mention and<br>Josie trachea which came to light of<br>course after their divorce that contains<br>a petition statement in a statement from<br>jeans sister who basically rumbled the<br>whole thing I think she found a return<br>address on a letter and then went over<br>and accosted poor old Florence Josie's<br>wife and said you're married to my wife<br>aren't you<br>anyway these are things that happen and<br>mount Roskill leaving off things that<br>happen and happen and how it - I<br>wondered though briefly whether in some<br>ways we could see the marriages and the<br>divorces are some kind of political<br>statement or would that be taking things<br>too far<br>we do know that Florence Lance was a<br>phys ed teacher at st. Hilda's why is<br>this important<br>girl's schooling of course was the<br>outcome of concerted feminist efforts<br>during the late 19th century including<br>in Dunedin of course by the most<br>wonderful Lea month Dalrymple who was<br>very important and the founding of Otago<br>girls and so looking at that kind of<br>background was interesting histories of<br>women's work and financial independence<br>so Josie dressed as a man and when<br>tapped in men's wages of course during<br>the 19th century Vic wait as that men<br>could earn a higher than the wages of<br>women incidentally I he's got a book<br>coming out on women and business later<br>this year which looks really awesome<br>that's right there's one more adverse<br>meant to come but it's right at the very<br>end so you've got 20 minutes being safe<br>from me spooking various products of oh<br>you pee the literature on sexology one<br>of the things that Florence seed that<br>was the most interesting after sorry<br>Josie after Florence had accused her of<br>being a Ameri diet which itself has a<br>really interesting history Josie said I<br>am a woman absolutely<br>but with the inclinations in passions of<br>a man if you know a lot about the<br>history of sexology the history of<br>psychiatry and the literature that came<br>out of that at the end of the nineteenth<br>century and early 20th century you would<br>know that that harks for the idea of<br>gender inversion bad idea that if a<br>woman likes another woman then there<br>must be something of the man about her<br>and vice versa was it that the doctor<br>lead lead joy see to think about his<br>sexuality in these ways we don't know so<br>what we sort of doing here is a form of<br>micro history this is a random<br>photograph from and the Turnbull by the<br>way I was going to use it in a book and<br>never did so I thought you might like it<br>hello McDonald wrote a paper and Lilith<br>the feminist history journal called a<br>dissection in Reverse and she says that<br>micro historians reach for the<br>magnifying glasses and reduce the scale<br>of analysis down to individuals or small<br>groups of individuals focusing on the<br>particulars of individual lives to learn<br>how such people lived and died with them<br>the rebus of relationships that bound<br>them to the broader culture of which<br>they were an illuminating part so my<br>argument is that these kinds of things<br>that we might find through detective<br>work tell us something really<br>interesting about the way that sexuality<br>happened more broadly it's not just<br>about the individuals that's about<br>something bigger even the smallest story<br>of an individual life I think speaks to<br>bigger social shifts and bigger social<br>changes so when MacDonald talks about an<br>illuminating part I think she means it<br>that it tells us something tells us<br>something bigger now the other thing<br>that I came across that I thought was<br>interesting and it's taken me a long<br>time to get to versus these women were<br>not supposed to marry women weren't<br>supposed to marry one another and men<br>weren't supposed to marry one another<br>but we know women did marry one another<br>in New Zealand and in Australia and in<br>the u.s. in particular because we know<br>such cases but what would be a legal<br>document that would record someone's<br>relationship because that document is<br>essentially gender-neutral it's the will<br>and I didn't think about this until<br>recently this is Janet mentions will she<br>leaves everything to her friend and<br>neighbor Annie O'Neill of 7:00 sharp<br>Road a memory of many kindnesses<br>vendored to me<br>Robert Gant was pictured on the left of<br>this photograph on the right in his vote<br>his partner Charles Haig who I have no<br>doubt at all were partners for over 20<br>years during the early 20th century when<br>you go to against well you're not going<br>to be able to read this because that's a<br>bit slow and that's sort of scrawly so<br>I'm going to read it to you oh god if I<br>can remember blah blah blah blah blah<br>the residue of my estate goes to Charles<br>Haig and then the very last number for<br>desire I desire my remains to be create<br>cremated and the ashes to be deposited<br>as Charles Hague directs thank you so in<br>the very last moment of one's life a<br>document a will expresses the wishes of<br>a relationship and it since ask for<br>recognition of that relationship now the<br>last example I'm going to show you<br>before I then do my shameless plug for a<br>product of oup is the just the thing I'm<br>currently working on which is overly<br>complicated but it's a little project on<br>psychology and prisons and homosexuality<br>and thinking about the psychological<br>input SIF you like him to mean arrested<br>for sex with other men in New Zealand<br>during that early decades of the 20th<br>century one of the things about New<br>Zealand is that it's small right because<br>New Zealand is small influential people<br>can have a lot of influence and so one<br>of the people who had a staggeringly big<br>amount of influence over what happened<br>to men who were in prison for homosexual<br>offenses was a man by the name of Sydney<br>Ellen Ellen hated psychoanalysis and he<br>distrusted psychology he said they're<br>all cranks and I thought what's going on<br>with Sydney Ellen suddenly you seem<br>slightly crankcase yourself<br>and then I realized that actually Sidney<br>Allen was a massive proponent of moral<br>therapy and I found out through this<br>most wonderful but deeply obscure a<br>document on all the history of the<br>history of all the New Zealand doctors<br>prior to 1930 that Alan worked with King<br>at our very own Sea Cliff Asylum King in<br>Sea Cliff was a total devotee of moral<br>therapy he didn't believe in drugs he<br>believed in exercise and fresh air in<br>concerts and self-improvement and the<br>idea that a few made people cultured<br>they would learn to resist their baser<br>instincts as it were and Alan took this<br>to new plymouth prison and he dogged Lee<br>he dogged Lee remained kind of obsessed<br>with it your planet Prison was important<br>because this was a prison that between<br>1917 and 1952 all new zealand men<br>convicted of homosexual offences were<br>and yes they may have made a nightclub<br>in the presentation and they may have<br>passed letters among one another and<br>they may have had clandestine love<br>affairs but they also broke rocks in the<br>quarry you know and they underwent this<br>kind of therapy with radios and books<br>and all these other kind of influences<br>but over time this kind of started to<br>wear out and certainly Allen's influence<br>waned and under the influence of a new<br>official in charge of prison Sam Barnett<br>the prisons the employed the<br>psychologist and the first of these was<br>a guy called Donald Mackenzie who was<br>very helpful to another guy called Ernie<br>Weber whose records of course aren Hakan<br>see it all comes back to Denis Denis why<br>have to do history here and actually<br>what we find happening over time is that<br>the move to desegregation New Plymouth<br>was closed down as a homosexual offenses<br>present in 1952 and been actually people<br>started to desegregate move back into<br>Mount Eden and the other prisons in<br>which Ernie Weber was asked by Donald<br>Mackenzie to consider his sexuality to<br>consider his relationship and ask if he<br>was maybe a little bit like Oscar Wilde<br>I think there's quite an honor to be<br>asked and actually only said basically a<br>year now like sort of but not really and<br>so anyway he eventually got out but you<br>can you can see a couple of interesting<br>things I think as you dig around you can<br>find the information in odd places and<br>then you do these crazy kind of charts<br>gfn I joke that actually the six hundred<br>dollars we spent on buying Adobe<br>InDesign was one of the best six hundred<br>dollars we spent in their entire lives<br>because that lets us do these kinds of<br>things<br>I don't know if I could do this on<br>Microsoft weird but maybe maybe not<br>okay so just before I sort of head<br>towards closing just to say that the<br>detective better veces that you really<br>do need to look at all manner of<br>different corners or manner of different<br>places and bring to be all the knowledge<br>that you've got so Lisa mentioned my<br>interest in the history of social<br>science in New Zealand this has been<br>really useful for this project because<br>you can see the interactions of<br>psychology psychoanalysis psychotherapy<br>sociology social work all of these kind<br>of strands starting to come together and<br>making some kind of sense of all these<br>people all these places and these kinds<br>of phenomena so yeah I haven't finished<br>with this yet but I wanted to show you<br>as I sort of work in progress about how<br>I would go about kind of ferreting my<br>way through these things okay right so<br>oh actually<br>here are some photo here are some<br>drawings out of that same file in the<br>Hakan that I thought you might kind of<br>like and just the file out of the<br>restricted no this is the non-restricted<br>file but I did not show you restricted<br>one in there National Archives in<br>Wellington which helped us to build up a<br>picture of ideas about sexuality<br>official practices and then we can think<br>through that about what kind of social<br>changes are taking place and how<br>individual lives relate to those broader<br>social strands and social kind of<br>processes alright<br>so there is one photograph here that is<br>not related to the book queer objects<br>which is coming out very soon can you<br>it may involve a wooden phallus in it<br>may have been taken in the sex machines<br>Museum in Prague<br>so there were no things on aerosol<br>involving kettle lisa but there were<br>involving one of the most fascinating<br>kind of museums you may have heard of<br>the sheep gut condom if you ever want to<br>know how people washed and dried those<br>things go to six machines Museum in<br>Prague and you find the dinky little<br>condom drying vex so there are things<br>about the world you never knew about<br>which you can discover when you start<br>ferreting the reason I wanted to mention<br>queer objects is firstly because it's<br>fabulous<br>secondly because it's just about coming<br>out and thirdly because it was basically<br>banned and China went over there and we<br>think the objection was to organs among<br>some of the pages now I'm hoping this is<br>making you slightly intrigued about<br>waters in the book but I think we think<br>they were several spreads that got AB<br>and so anyway it's being there's print<br>being printed in Hong Kong which itself<br>tells you something interesting about<br>the geopolitics of publications and also<br>the geopolitics of sexuality social<br>struggle and social change okay<br>I'm going to stop there if I may I will<br>leave this slide up here<br>and I would like to thank you all for<br>coming and I'd really like to thank all<br>the people at OU Targo and there were so<br>many of you who supported me through my<br>career here it's a really fantastic and<br>supportive place to work and I'm really<br>very pleased to be here and really happy<br>that I could share with you today some<br>tender culture culture my name is Tony<br>ballantine<br>I am the pro-vice-chancellor humanities<br>here at Otago and I'm also a historian<br>and that's significant because I make a<br>few comments about history in a moment<br>and it's with great pleasure that I'll<br>deliver a vote of thanks to Professor<br>brickle he is delivered an excellent<br>lecture and it's reflected on the ways<br>in which we might think about the<br>history of sexuality and he has offered<br>us a compelling sketch of some of his<br>key pieces of research I think the kind<br>of gendered historical sociology that he<br>has introduced us to does very important<br>work in the world it helps us understand<br>both the human dimensions of the past<br>and the weight that is invested into<br>cultural identities into social<br>categories it has for granted the<br>interplay between the private and the<br>public both I think in those stark<br>moments where the coercive power of the<br>state is deployed on people who are<br>believed to be undermining the authority<br>of normative social relationships but<br>also in those more ambiguous moments and<br>social connections that leave small but<br>crucial traces in the archive whether<br>that is in the form of a comment to the<br>police a snapshot or a declaration of<br>personal commitment in the will<br>professor Brickell has demonstrated some<br>of the strategies that he has honed in<br>his own work to show us how we might<br>understand these archival traces and I<br>think he is truly excellent at teasing<br>out their significance both at the time<br>and how they complicate were in richer<br>understandings of the past today I think<br>it was also fascinating to hear about<br>Professor buckles own intellectual<br>journey stretching back to his schooling<br>and reading as a youth and in a way I<br>think he's offered us two lines of<br>intellectual descent or [ __ ] papa the<br>first being his teachers in colleagues<br>including Victoria University of<br>Wellington and sociology and the in<br>history at University of Canterbury and<br>then of course<br>as colleagues and collaborators here at<br>the University of Targa Oh Judith<br>collage it's co-editor the second line I<br>think other scholars whose work have<br>been important touchstones for cress and<br>these perhaps not anymore and better<br>than the talk but Raymond Williams<br>particularly but also someone like the<br>historical social adjust Geoffrey weeks<br>I think but what I think really came<br>through and Chris's lecture were two<br>features that I always think of has been<br>absolutely fundamental to what he does<br>the first and it was very very clear is<br>that chris loves archives and he handled<br>sources very difficult drawing out the<br>texture and using them to explore the<br>complexity and the tension of the past<br>now just to make this clear that is very<br>high praise coming from a historian as a<br>rule we often take a dim view on how<br>other folks from other disciplines think<br>about and handle our closing materials<br>if you say to most historians what is a<br>historical sociologist we think of them<br>as unsubtle model builders<br>no offense Chris but Chris has a rich<br>historical imagination and is so very<br>deft and exploring the granularity of<br>individual life histories and historical<br>events that we couldn't either accuse<br>you of being and then subtle<br>modelbuilder<br>although that second last slide wasn't<br>quite a complex model the second feature<br>I think as Chris's amazing eye for the<br>visual in his analysis and I'm aware as<br>I speak that I'm living with this behind<br>me he does it very well and it is a real<br>hallmark of his work now if you've ever<br>been to Chris's office here the<br>prominence of these two threads the<br>archive and the visual would not<br>surprise you at all as his office<br>features a striking range of objects and<br>images although I think the inflatable<br>cactus didn't make it so professor<br>Brickell I know that all of us here<br>students colleagues from sociology<br>Gender Studies in criminology colleagues<br>and the school of<br>scientists from across the division and<br>the water university and rural many<br>friends of course are delighted to be<br>sharing this special occasion with you I<br>would invite everyone to join me and<br>thanking Chris I have a gift to present<br>him but after that I would encourage you<br>to follow us to the staff club for some<br>refreshments but could you join me in<br>thanking Chris for one collection</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
