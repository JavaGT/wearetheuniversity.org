Royden Summerville who is<br>a regular attendee of these very<br>important events to each and every one<br>of you know my how to my welcome so to<br>set the stage for tonight's event I<br>think it's really important for us to<br>just spend a moment and reflect on the<br>fact that the path to professor here at<br>the University of Otago is not an easy<br>one in order to be promoted to the rank<br>of Professor the individual must<br>demonstrate excellence in teaching in<br>research and in service to the<br>University and the broader community in<br>terms of research George is a world<br>leader in the field of biomaterials he<br>has an outstanding track record of<br>research publications of patents and<br>of extramural funding George is also an<br>outstanding classroom teacher and a very<br>popular postgraduate supervisor and last<br>but certainly not least George has<br>provided exceptional service to his<br>department to the University and to the<br>wider research and academic community<br>George on behalf of the university of<br>otago it gives me great pleasure to<br>personally congratulate you on your very<br>very well-deserved promotion to<br>Professor over the years I have<br>certainly valued not only your teaching<br>and your research and your service but<br>I've also valued your incredibly<br>positive attitude towards everything<br>that you do Namie he knew a key aqua I<br>will now call on professor Vernon ward<br>to tell us just a little bit more about<br>George's academic journey to Professor<br>noreda tena koe toto no koto tena Tata<br>Tata Thank You Vice Chancellor tena<br>koutou katoa<br>I'm a new 18-acre Cato welcome everybody<br>it's really nice to see you here this<br>evening the audience is looking<br>particularly anatomical the so one of<br>the privileges of my role as dean of the<br>school of biomedical sciences as I get<br>to introduce our new professors to the<br>audience and it's a real privilege to be<br>able to do this and so I have the<br>privilege of introducing a little bit<br>about George d'Este today he is has<br>already stated a very valued member of<br>the department of anatomy wheeze and the<br>clinical Anatomy team and again his<br>input is really broad across the<br>spectrum and that's very much<br>appreciated by everybody<br>his background I find it particularly<br>interesting and fascinating he graduated<br>originally with a Bachelor of Dental<br>Surgery from the University of Sri Lanka<br>in 1977 and then he had a number of<br>professional qualifications since he's<br>these include a master's at the Intel<br>surgery and his training in oral and<br>maxillofacial surgery so he's very<br>well-qualified and there's a number of<br>other qualifications and amongst that as<br>well with that broad training background<br>as you'd expect<br>here's a range of professional<br>appointments he started as a house<br>officer in the Dental Institute in<br>Columbo this was a series of progressive<br>steps there he then moved on and did a<br>lot of work in the sri lankan air force<br>eventually becoming the consultant<br>dental surgeon for the Sri Lankan Air<br>Force he spent some time in the UK we<br>might have to share some stories of<br>Southampton so the and from then he<br>decided to do PhD studies and he came to<br>Otago for those PhD studies receiving<br>his PhD in 2003 he said of his work life<br>here as a junior academic and has then<br>progressed through the academic ranks of<br>the University and again contributes<br>across the spectrum the one area I'm<br>going to focus on for this introduction<br>with particular note is this work in and<br>around the translation of research he is<br>a very applied aspect to his recent<br>scientific research he looks at<br>biomaterials in particular he is a very<br>enquiring mind and he looks to how do<br>you apply this so I'm not gonna that<br>wasn't me so I'm not going to go preempt<br>his talk because I think I don't take<br>him you the Thunder away from what he's<br>going to present to you but he<br>contributes in the area of high-value<br>functional foods into there are<br>technology industries and again it's all<br>as workers he's gonna see tonight is<br>around how you translate<br>he's been funded by numerous agencies<br>these include the Health Research<br>Council with the Ministry for business<br>innovation and employment always want to<br>say everything but employment AG mat and<br>the world industry his research output<br>you'd expect of a professor and<br>commensurate with his translational<br>research focus I draw teach to attention<br>to the actual actual real impact and<br>commercialization activities that he<br>does his patents have been bought by<br>companies they've received royalty<br>payments so that real is that a company<br>established based on the work that he<br>does and I know there's further<br>negotiations and commercial<br>opportunities in the pipeline he's a<br>scientific adviser and a consultant to<br>industry and to government bodies and<br>along the way he's never forgotten his<br>roots he provides expert translation and<br>le's for the police the Ministry of<br>Justice and Andy for the University of<br>Otago so there are many things I could<br>go on with his career but the do so<br>would take away from him actually<br>speaking to you and so we need to move<br>to that point and so for this inaugural<br>professorial lecture professor Dias will<br>explore his personal history he's going<br>to move into translational research and<br>some of the ideas that he's developed<br>the sicán the securing of intellectual<br>property and the commercialization of<br>that research I'd now like to invite<br>professor Diaz to present as inaugural<br>professorial lecture entitled anatomical<br>adventures with making faces<br>bone-building wolf foods and corroding<br>plates nor a Latina to mehe Keiko to<br>katoa tena koutou tena koe de night<br>arter Katara this switched on thank you<br>for say him Thank You professor Ward for<br>your kind introduction I'm humbled by<br>your words thank you everyone for your<br>person this evening to share with me<br>this special occasion in my academic<br>career and also thank you my to my<br>family with being here my wife throw any<br>Asura and my sister I'm going to tell<br>you about the journey that I took to<br>arrive at this position okay so a lot of<br>people helped me along the way a lot of<br>people worked with me my mentors my<br>colleagues collaborators and also not<br>forgetting the students so I'm going to<br>acknowledge them as I go along and also<br>I'm going to show you how the these<br>words in the title of my talk came to be<br>I was born in this this island here in<br>the Indian Ocean it was called Salaam we<br>are the good the world's best he come<br>from Ceylon tea and the place of birth<br>was it was close to call<br>the capital somewhere here and so I grew<br>up in Colombo this is Colombo in the 60s<br>and 70s there are some double-decker<br>buses etc very British and in 1972 the<br>country change its name to Sri Lanka and<br>this is Colombo today it had gone very<br>big and it has gobbled up my home<br>village my home lady song we are here<br>now is part of the city yes and now I'm<br>so this is my ancestral home from my<br>paternal side where I spend a number of<br>my early years by the way nowadays it<br>doesn't exist in this place there's a<br>tower block you know apartments have<br>come up these are my grand my grand<br>terrace pattern of grandparents you can<br>see very Victorian<br>they are very homecoming and these are<br>my parents my late mum and dad Sheila<br>and Herbert this yours truly here and me<br>with my two brothers there are<br>altogether seven offers my two brothers<br>and these my maternal ancestral home<br>they spend lot of my early years in this<br>house again<br>it also doesn't exist anymore we're<br>looking very pious at my First Holy<br>Communion and I also played in a band<br>I'm sure you'd know I played in a band<br>and would you believe this band is still<br>going strong in these previous ago and<br>that's today so maybe I would have had a<br>carrier in like the Bee Gees until<br>either playing in this band not as good<br>as Bee Gees but we also went through our<br>F row stage this is a these my sister<br>and my two brothers and my dad was a GP<br>in London at that time and I had to trim<br>my afro down for my wedding maybe<br>Ronia some degree with it sure enough<br>first with four other four sisters and<br>two brothers and one of my sisters are<br>here Mark Hunt is here and he's my<br>family Rowena and Ursula these my<br>schools that I went to st. Joseph's<br>College and in fact Black Caps just<br>finished the tour of Sri Lanka the<br>captain cricket captain and I think<br>three players come from this school so<br>I'm just bragging a little then I<br>entered the university as from the water<br>mentioned you know sort of parody Nia<br>it's a very picturesque campus similar<br>to our Dunedin campus that's the<br>registry building the amphitheater and<br>also when the flowers are blooming<br>flower within the the campus the old<br>medical faculty building so I did my<br>first degree my dental degree at the<br>Faculty of Dentistry then I had my<br>clinical training first at the natural<br>Dental Hospital the Dental Institute<br>Colombo did my postgraduate degree at<br>the postgraduate Institute of Medicine<br>University of Colombo there that<br>obtained my master of surgery as well as<br>later on the board certification in<br>maxillofacial surgery after that again I<br>had my surgical training at the National<br>Dental Hospital as well as the Colombo<br>Cancer Hospital<br>there I went to UK and did my also<br>training at the Kenny's<br>and hospital these are specialized in it<br>bad they'd do only plastic surgery and<br>maxillofacial surgery these are just the<br>staff again and the trainees they also<br>run a number of training programs these<br>after one of those training programs I'm<br>in the back you can see me now beeping<br>that's right down there and also I had a<br>beard once and and that's me doing a<br>surgical procedure I think most probably<br>at the cancer hospital I want to thank<br>these two gentlemen I'm very grateful to<br>mr. Khursheed moose and mr. Tony Gabriel<br>if I die I trained on that under them I<br>learned my maxillofacial surgery under<br>them in fátima Supraja is this the only<br>photo I could find off Tony Gabriel I<br>can assure you he was much more mature<br>when I trained under him<br>these are think when he was about 18<br>years old then I came to New Zealand<br>join their atomy department started a<br>PhD on looking at the temporal<br>mandibular joint these coming from my<br>clinical background my supervisor was<br>first Phil Horton associate provost Phil<br>Horton but about one day into my PhD<br>Phil decided to retire so then and I was<br>supposed by professor Garrett Jones from<br>then onwards so the topic of my PhD was<br>the temperament been a joint our looking<br>at the temporomandibular joint because<br>this is a major temperamental joint<br>disorders are very common about 10% of<br>the general population suffers from some<br>degree of TMJ dysfunction so I was<br>interested in looking at the joint it<br>because the major public health issue<br>now one of the questions I want to<br>answer was that whether the joint has a<br>specific morphology specific shape as it<br>is described in the textbooks or does<br>the shape of the joint changes with the<br>functional environment because that time<br>people with people with TMJ dysfunction<br>we used to go going to the joint and try<br>to chisel off the so-called perfect<br>morphology so want a question that<br>whether it is correct nowadays we don't<br>do it anymore so for this part of my<br>study I did a animal study<br>I used the Kunekune II Pig it's a small<br>rare breed of not rare it's a breed of<br>pig found in New Zealand it's quite<br>small and very docile I think to my<br>knowledge this is the first time the<br>Kunekune pigs have been used in a<br>research project because as you know the<br>American mini pigs<br>extremely expensive and almost nobody<br>can afford to use them so I've been<br>trying to advocate using koni koni pigs<br>and one of our beasts starting another<br>project very soon so I divided the<br>animals into two groups one group of<br>animals were kept on a soft diet like<br>porridge dad and the hard dad group<br>which received the same amount of<br>nutrition a same amount of food but in<br>the form of hard pillars where they had<br>to chew crushin through the food so the<br>kid kept animals for seven months from<br>these two different diets so as you can<br>see at the end of the study the weights<br>of the animals didn't vary so that means<br>they had the similar amount of nutrition<br>so during the study I injected the<br>animals with vital stains that's these<br>these are stains that mark the bone that<br>is being deposited at that point of time<br>so that you can later on see the the<br>amount of bone that has been deposited<br>so there were three injections to two<br>doses of oxytetracycline that stained<br>the bone later on in under the<br>fluorescent microscope it glows green<br>and alizarin red which grows green so<br>there were two traits oily or oxidized<br>cycling and alizarin red those and also<br>we used this technique backscattered<br>electron imaging to quantify the degree<br>of mineralization so the results what we<br>found was that the hard dad group had<br>significantly more bone deposition in<br>that temporomandibular joints compared<br>to the software<br>we also found that the degree of<br>mineralization in the hard a group was<br>significantly higher compared to the<br>soft-eyed group so this was published as<br>part of my PhD so I moved on at the end<br>of my PhD Mike bio anthropology<br>colleagues in Coimbra you know see doc<br>Coimbra in Portugal it's a very old<br>University about 800 years old they<br>invited me to join them to collaborate<br>with them on this area of research the<br>facial approximation<br>the reason they call me is because not<br>because I knew lot about this area<br>because of my expertise in the<br>craniofacial anatomy so this facial<br>approximation is a technique where you<br>construct a face on an unknown skull for<br>forensic purposes we get an unknown<br>skeleton you want to make an<br>identification you can put a face on<br>this on the skull and that may trigger<br>the the identity of the person from us<br>witness that's the main reason the<br>forensic facial approximation but it is<br>also very popular with the general<br>public where you can put faces on<br>historical figures such as Cleopatra or<br>Tutankhamun and so so it is very popular<br>in programs such as meet your ancestors<br>kind of thing so so that is this area<br>and I'm very thankful to Col Stefan now<br>he's at the University of Queensland<br>he was extremely helpful to me at the<br>start of introducing me to this area of<br>research so I'll show you few cases that<br>we did this is the Egyptian mummy that<br>is exhibited at the otago museum and the<br>museum staff has CT scan the mummy and<br>these scans were made available to me<br>long time ago these about mid 2000 these<br>are not very high-resolution CT scans<br>but we use the 3d software program to<br>extract the digital image of the skull<br>of the mummy and although there are a<br>lot of artefacts the details on the the<br>bony details was<br>I thought it was sufficient to do a<br>facial reconstruction then we 3d printed<br>the skull now this was in mid 2000s at<br>that time this was cutting edge work in<br>fact it was not even called 3d printing<br>it was called rapid prototyping and I<br>had to go to one of the specialized<br>companies in Chrysler to do get this<br>done so then so we got the skull now put<br>have to put a face on on a skull you got<br>to know the soft tissue depth at<br>different positions on the facial<br>skeleton now these soft tissue dips are<br>available in the literature people have<br>measured these soft tissue dips from<br>cadavers etc for different ethnic groups<br>these are available they have ranges<br>such as this but we thought this is not<br>very scientific<br>especially for a court of law to make<br>our unification so therefore we duel up<br>there a model I work with my colleague<br>professor payments under from<br>accountancy Department we deal up this<br>model the model to predict the soft<br>tissue dips based on the bony<br>measurements of the skull the<br>craniometrics measurements so first we<br>train this model using cadaver ik bone<br>measurements and swell as soft ratio<br>measurements and then we tested the<br>model to find out its accuracy it was<br>pretty accurate so then we put in the<br>born measurements of the mummy skull and<br>it predicted the soft tissue depth so we<br>use these measurements to do the<br>reconstruction so I get these I set<br>about doing I will not go into much<br>detail so here I'm drilling holes at<br>different points on the cast of the<br>skull to position the pigs to indicate<br>this indicate the soft tissue depth and<br>also the position of the eyeball the<br>nose projection all that was done based<br>on anatomical and surgical specially<br>plastic surgical principles same<br>principles then to get in the mouth with<br>the lip thickness the position is very<br>important getting the position of the<br>eyelids the nose width and also the<br>muscles of facial expression including<br>the glands found in the face parotid and<br>etc but Khepera<br>all that so you be used I used all that<br>and reconstructed the face then the auto<br>museum commissioned makeup artist to do<br>the skin tone and the eyebrows and the<br>hair inside the hairstyle and the skin<br>tone what came from the the the painting<br>on the the sarcophagus of the mummy from<br>that it was generated so of course it<br>created a lot of media interest and<br>making faces in the title of my talk<br>come from this from this media article I<br>did few other cases with my colleagues<br>in Germany from you know to our<br>Dusseldorf we did a facial<br>reconstruction on a foreign see case<br>unknown scar also I work with my<br>colleague and friend later probs a juice<br>squeezer Jews was contacted by the New<br>Zealand police regarding this car but<br>later we found it is not foul play but<br>as part of Charlotte Ross comes<br>postgraduate project we did a facial<br>reconstruction and also Steven swindle<br>also assisted in this on this project<br>and also the families my colleague whose<br>Honda no strong guard from Turkey you<br>know Co Anadolu she sent me a cost of<br>this skeleton about two and a half<br>thousand year old skeleton and we did a<br>facial reconstruction this was part of<br>Louisa Louisa Bailey's postgraduate<br>program and we did the reconstruction<br>these are the members of the team and<br>this offer here we use some newer<br>material at that time silicone etc and<br>this face was sent to Turkey it was<br>exhibited in a exhibition in Istanbul at<br>that time so at this stage and I know<br>it's Louisa is carrying on in this area<br>of research because at this stage I<br>change the focus of my research I<br>started doing more translational<br>research now what is translational<br>research it's nothing no there's no<br>difference known<br>in the university we do research and<br>then we publish our research disseminate<br>the information to improve the knowledge<br>now in translational research you just<br>add an additional step before you<br>publish you Catron capture if there's<br>any intellectual property you capture<br>the intellectual property and then<br>convert that the knowledge into a<br>product or service to assist for example<br>in clinical practice you add you<br>translate your findings to clinical<br>practice to improve the health of the<br>people<br>okay that is translational research and<br>also you can commercialize this your<br>finding because the research costs money<br>because the money somebody has to pay so<br>if you can generate more money you can<br>do more research and it's good for the<br>university also so that's translational<br>research so we in the university so an<br>other research organization we do a lot<br>of basic research but only if some of<br>that basic research is suitable to be<br>translated out of that again only a<br>small proportion will ultimately end up<br>as a product or service so not every<br>time you come up with the idea doesn't<br>mean that you'll be successful with a<br>final product or service but it's with<br>the attempt so you know nutshell<br>commercialization is where you convert<br>your research your discoveries into<br>products and services you can do this by<br>several means you can license your<br>invention to the commercial sector for<br>all the payment or with the university<br>you can establish a startup company you<br>add more value to your discovery before<br>you transfer it to the commercial sector<br>or you can sell it off outright to the<br>commercial sector for a lump sum payment<br>so that's in a nutshell about the<br>translational research I got into now<br>some of the those ventures that I took<br>part a building bone from sheep soul as<br>you know we have lot of sheep in this<br>country in fact a 10-15 years ago we had<br>more<br>and and we are the second-largest<br>wool exporting the world but<br>unfortunately about 60% of our wool clip<br>is low valuable it commands very low<br>market price okay especially the medium<br>and coarse wool has very low market<br>price was only the fine fiber has a good<br>value so one of the aims of our project<br>in this range I collaborated with Rob<br>dr. Rob Kelly at that time he was<br>working for would research organization<br>of New Zealand that's the success of the<br>old wool board so all the wool farmers<br>are members of wool board is like a<br>cooperative so that's now is called bull<br>research is Ron's bull research<br>organization of New Zealand so I would<br>collaborated with him now about carotene<br>now wool here horns hooves including the<br>rhinoceros horn is all made of carotene<br>it's a protein it's a fibrous protein<br>similar to collagen so proteins are made<br>of amino acids okay so these are my<br>newest it's come together forms chains<br>peptides polypeptides and form proteins<br>now keratin protein is very rich in the<br>sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine so<br>now these sulfur groups forms very<br>strong disulfide bonds covalent bonds<br>between these protein chains and between<br>chains now here bull horns etc gets<br>their screens get their strength due to<br>these disulfide bonds and this is one of<br>the reasons so you can't because bullies<br>ninety-five percent protein but we can't<br>eat and eat it because of these<br>disulfide bonds<br>you can't digest it of what there are<br>funguses we can do it so when you look<br>at a wool fiber these are the<br>constituents down to the the peptides<br>peptide chains for first pro project we<br>extracted this group of proteins the<br>intermediate filament protein so certain<br>molecular weight so we extracted that<br>protein<br>now carotene is a very versatile<br>biopolymer because you can cleave these<br>disulfide bonds and solubilized so you<br>can make the carotene soluble and you<br>can reverse this reaction you can reform<br>these disulfide bonds and you can<br>control the formation of these disulfide<br>bonds you can control the polymerization<br>by controlling the polymerization you<br>can make number of different products a<br>lightly polymerized state you can<br>produce hydrogen's you can produce<br>membranes you can extrude into filaments<br>electrospinning etc or the highly highly<br>polymerized state you can produce strong<br>plates and screws so it's a very<br>versatile biopolymer so our first<br>venture was developing a bone graft<br>substitute carotene divided Bowl graph<br>substitute so why what was the read near<br>and what is the reason for this because<br>every day New Zealand spend a lot of<br>money in the health sector treating bone<br>fractures now number of these fractures<br>requires bone grafts now there is a<br>limit where you can harvest born from a<br>patient autologous bone so there is a<br>group huge need for bone graft<br>substitutes so that's the reason that we<br>got into this area so we developed this<br>porous carotene scaffold this porous<br>scaffold with regular pose okay these<br>are no ran not random pose because bone<br>cells do not like to get into dead ends<br>located it requires these channels<br>running running through so we produce<br>this porous scaffold incorporated the<br>hydroxyapatite that's the mineral found<br>in bone to mimic cancellous bone then we<br>carried out the the standard in-vitro<br>investigations took to make sure it's<br>non non toxic start with biocompatible<br>also integratable and the viability of<br>osteoblasts all that we did then we<br>implanted this scaffold<br>in the long bones in the high limbs of<br>shape in fact we did three<br>sheep runs if this was funded by the<br>wool board what did he find<br>now you can see this orange colored<br>scepter that's the carotene scaffold the<br>pink material that's newborn now at four<br>weeks you can see the newborn is growing<br>into the carotene scaffold and also this<br>dissection doesn't look angry for the<br>histologies there is no lymphocytes<br>there's no giant self etc so this is and<br>also now you can see the bone growing<br>into the scaffold and also you can see<br>bone growing along this septa carotene<br>septa now here the carotene scaffold is<br>acting as a template for newborn<br>regeneration so this is thought that<br>bone regeneration that's a really good<br>thing you can you can target where how<br>the bone you want the bone to form so at<br>eight weeks you can see most of the<br>carotene is gone replaced by bone okay<br>and so also what we found was that the<br>our carotene scaffold was behaving<br>almost like Auto love this born so we<br>were very excited by these findings so<br>we captured the intellectual property<br>with a PCT international patent and then<br>jointly with Ron's<br>we launched national platens in patents<br>including a US patent so at this state<br>we transferred the IP to the commercial<br>sector now this intellectual property is<br>owned by Kiera PLAs technologies it's a<br>u.s. bar materials company but they<br>still manufacture their product there<br>are few products in the market in<br>Lincoln in in New Zealand and also we I<br>know the bull board is trying to buy<br>back this IP we want to bring it back to<br>New Zealand so after we captured the<br>intellectual property I published all<br>this data so this is a good clear case<br>of you can have the cake and eat it we<br>got all the publication's plus we got<br>intellectual property it's just that we<br>are it slightly delayed their<br>publication until you capture the<br>intellectual property<br>so these we are the the wooly and the<br>bone builders in my title of my talk<br>comes from so just showing you how this<br>title came to be we my I also worked on<br>another bone graft material this time<br>cattle bone derived bone graft material<br>bovine deride xenograft now in this<br>project i worked with my colleague at<br>University of Waikato Michael McConnell<br>and this was part of Dougal Leeds ph.d<br>program now the inorganic<br>part of the bone in organic phase<br>component of born with this<br>hydroxyapatite the inorganic part of<br>cattle bone and human bone is very<br>similar okay it's hydroxyapatite and<br>morphology is also similar the porosity<br>etc and also it is not pure calcium<br>phosphate it has all the other tracy<br>liberates amounts of other materials<br>such as carbonate calcium carbonates<br>sodium salts magnesium magnesium ions<br>fluoride silicates ups etc so this is a<br>good match for us<br>and there's another other reason is that<br>as we know in new zealand we have an<br>extensive meat industry and bone is a<br>waste product so these are winter we<br>so briefly what we did was we of course<br>cut the bone into cubes pressure-cook it<br>to get rid of essentially the fat in the<br>bone then we Center it at very high<br>temperature thousand degrees to burn off<br>all the organic phase of the bone<br>resulting in the inorganic phase which<br>is hydroxyapatite but there's a problem<br>and you remove especially the collagen<br>fibers from born it becomes very weak<br>this right this hydroxyapatite is<br>extremely fragile very poor mechanical<br>property especially tensile properties<br>so what we did was to we inflate these<br>scaffolds these hydroxyapatite scaffolds<br>with polymers natural polymer as<br>krytus an and synthetic polymers such as<br>polycaprolactone so these are<br>biodegradable polymers these polymers<br>brakes are in the body so we use these<br>polymers for two purposes one is to<br>improve the mechanical properties the<br>second reason was to improve biological<br>properties and again this again we<br>captured the intellectual property here<br>with the PCT and University of Waikato<br>established a startup company grafters<br>limited in 2007 to commercialize this<br>product so that's but we kept on<br>improving this material we ought to<br>improve this material because we know<br>new that that there is scope for<br>improvement so this work has been done<br>as part of détendre my former PhD<br>students didn't drop that dr. Roth<br>markers and Niranjan Ramesh's PhD<br>programs we are improving this material<br>so we added two additional steps for<br>this process the manufacture we added a<br>step we have we treat the the bone cubes<br>with the sodium hydroxide for two<br>reasons one is to bow efficiently remove<br>the fat from bone second is the sodium<br>is to destroy abnormal proteins such as<br>prions two to be so that later on we can<br>guarantee the our product will not<br>transmit any any diseases second is that<br>we added another step subcritical water<br>extraction now water at very high<br>temperatures about 180 degrees under<br>pressure you can keep it as water it<br>becomes an excellent solvent so we use<br>this sub little water extraction to more<br>efficiently remove organic matter from<br>from bone so that later we resulted in<br>from very pure hydroxyapatite that then<br>we of course we characterized it made to<br>make sure it has not changed that it has<br>not changed from hydroxyapatite because<br>it can change into other phases of<br>calcium phosphate so we did all this<br>characterization and also image to make<br>sure the pore structure is maintained<br>then we did another treatment<br>now when you look at the hydroxyapatite<br>molecule you can substitute the<br>calcium's the the phosphate and the o H<br>groups with other ions such as silver<br>magnesium silicon etc so now these these<br>substitutions are done to improve the<br>mechanical properties and biological<br>properties in fact there's one product<br>where it's only the some of the which<br>groups have been phosphate group have<br>been replaced with silicon and it's a<br>multi-million dollar business it's<br>called active use done by your academic<br>in UK and now it's a massive company<br>just it exponentially improved the<br>biological properties of hydroxyapatite<br>so so therefore now these substitutions<br>into synthetic hydroxyapatite has been<br>done there are a number of products in<br>the market but the novelty in our<br>project is that we did subcision from<br>natural hydroxyapatite so that's the the<br>novelty and so this is the product that<br>we ended up with with all these<br>properties I will not go into detail so<br>but our product is comparable to these<br>these products which are already in the<br>market comparable or superior especially<br>liked by us now we we buy hospital and<br>maxillofacial surgery they will use lot<br>of BIOS is about $6,000 a pack and we<br>think that our product is a similar or<br>better than bio so we are in the process<br>of capturing the intellectual property<br>of our product so I moving on to another<br>project developing a dietary protein now<br>this here the knowledge the know-how<br>comes from our previous work develop in<br>the carotene base bone graft material so<br>don't not that I suddenly decided to go<br>into food science it's just that is we<br>carried the translator that knowledge<br>into another area Cherubini right<br>protein protein powder so this work was<br>done with my colleague collaborates my<br>colleague Aladeen Beckett from<br>Department of Food Science and I must<br>acknowledge these people<br>Eric worked with me and we're at the<br>very beginning I'm sure you remember<br>every had a time trying to get some<br>funding people almost laughed at us and<br>also Lux illumination and Harold Bernard<br>they also were part of the team so we<br>came up with this protein powder so why<br>another protein because there's a reason<br>where our reasoning was this now 67% of<br>protein in our diet comes from<br>traditional animal products so there's a<br>problem there's a renewed for another<br>protein new protein because of these<br>problems increase production cost animal<br>welfare issues environmental issues with<br>this intensive farming health concerns<br>with consuming fat because protein comes<br>with fat animal protein and also the<br>food safety issues antibodies etcetera<br>etcetera so there is a need for novel<br>proteins so in our project what we did<br>was we found a method to cleave this<br>desire at bonds now if you break these<br>disulfide bonds you can make carotene<br>digestible okay because having these<br>dyes but that's the reason these strong<br>bonds is the reason that we there are<br>proteases can't break the carotene<br>molecule down so we cleave these<br>disulfide bonds and make the carotene<br>digestible we did that without using<br>harsh chemicals we just used food food<br>ingredients so we treat the wool in the<br>presence of water and expose it to high<br>temperature and pressure using microwave<br>energy and in the presence of food acids<br>you convert the wood will get converted<br>into this emulsion make like product and<br>this can be separated into three<br>fractions a soluble fraction and two<br>insoluble fractions so we use these two<br>insoluble fractions right and we get<br>this powder similar to whey protein or<br>soy protein etc analyze the amino acid<br>profile it's a quite a<br>complete protein it has all the<br>essential amino acids very rich in<br>certain amino acid low in some other<br>amino acids such as lies in metals bit<br>low now then we had the problem now we<br>had to find a way to deconstruct the<br>wool fiber you can because what we did<br>was you on a laboratory bench so we had<br>to make find a way to do this you know<br>bigger scale so I worked with this<br>company microwave New Zealand itzhak<br>Auckland company with very close we<br>don't hold them and Yocum rowing we had<br>to design from scratch because this I<br>keratin didn't exist so we had to design<br>and fabricate build the microwave<br>machine to deconstruct the wool fiber so<br>initially we produce a we built a<br>prototype machine which can handle about<br>hundred grams or hundreds of grams of<br>wool later we scaled it up because part<br>of this MB grant we had show that this<br>can be scaled up built a bigger machine<br>this which can handle kilograms of wound<br>at a time using this we produce about<br>more than 125 kilograms of this wool<br>protein powder for the subsidy or<br>subsequent investigations and these are<br>housed at our Soyuz VA facility or Tago<br>facility these machines are kept there<br>because they generate a lot of microwave<br>it can disturb Wi-Fi supplied with<br>clothes the university then we compared<br>the wool dried protein with the other<br>bulk protein which are in the market<br>like whey protein and soy protein you<br>can see the carotenoid protein is very<br>rich in certain amino acids arginine<br>cysteine glycine and also it's rich in<br>the mineral selenium now as we know<br>arginine is important as a precursor for<br>nitric oxide the body body parts just<br>for vasodilatation so vessel dilation is<br>important for muscle recovery after<br>exercise<br>to recover to recovery of muscle for at<br>least and also in type 2 diabetic<br>patients you know to improve their<br>tissue perfusion they are a cysteine<br>glycine and and selenium these are all<br>cofactors in the body's built-in<br>antioxidant mechanism to mop up the free<br>radicals okay so therefore these are<br>important ingredients to be having our<br>diet so this protein has all that we<br>analyzed the protein content it is a<br>very rich protein it has about 86%<br>percent protein later we improve it<br>further so it is comparable to the<br>premium proteins in the market such as<br>whey protein isolate the the more<br>expensive whey protein then we want to<br>test where this protein is bioavailable<br>can they can this protein be digested<br>absorbed and utilized by the body so we<br>did number of animal trials mouse trials<br>28-day mouse trial the control diet<br>contained casein protein that's the gold<br>standard protein and the experimental<br>that had carotene D right protein you<br>can say at the end of 28 days there was<br>no significant difference between the<br>two animals groups so that indicated<br>that of a carotene dried protein is been<br>digested absorbed and utilized by the<br>body we also did 95 a much longer rat<br>growth trial with similar results to<br>then this confirmed that this protein is<br>digestible and utilized by the body we<br>also want to show that the selenium and<br>also by the way they it also contains<br>zinc that selenium and zinc found in the<br>carotene protein is bioavailable because<br>it could be bounded then it may not be<br>able to be digested and absorbed so we<br>formulated a special diet rat that<br>selenium and low selenium diet and when<br>the animals on the low selenium diet<br>their blood selenium levels serum<br>selenium levels dropped and stayed low<br>but the animal supplement with<br>supplemented with the Carradine<br>protein there selenium levels are<br>recovered same it with the zinc control<br>animals is ink level dropped and state<br>the low we are as the experimental<br>animals with KDP it recovered so this<br>proved that this selenium and and zinc<br>found in the keratin protein is readily<br>available in the diam bioavailable so<br>this is our pitch high yield in fact<br>most of the protein we lose only about<br>15% that also could be recovered is too<br>expensive to recover that so or<br>practically all that rule can be<br>converted into this protein it's a high<br>called a high quality because it has all<br>the essential amino acid and its novelty<br>fat and carbohydrate free and quite<br>versatile it can be incorporated into<br>different foods relatively cheap to<br>produce very comparable comparable<br>comparative price point compared to whey<br>protein and soy protein we have captured<br>the intellectual property for the<br>process we capture the intellectual<br>property and recently we transfer the<br>intellectual property to food research<br>organization of New Zealand that's the<br>rule board so I'm very happy I staying<br>in New Zealand and now I'm working with<br>them we are lodging the National Peters<br>to protect the IP in European Union<br>United States etc so so this is the only<br>the process that we were captured we<br>also tested this protein for his<br>so here I work with my colleague Alan in<br>a little bucket at the Department of<br>Food Science and we incorporated the<br>protein in to incorporate the protein<br>into different foods into muffins and in<br>the muffin knock it off is it maybe had<br>crush therefore we incorporate the food<br>into<br>into Buffon's and and corn chips into<br>muffins and corn chips 4% carotene<br>protein 8% carotene protein and we<br>tested it using volunteers of 120<br>volunteers and they scored the perm the<br>the texture the color and the flavor<br>as you can see specially carotene<br>protein in corn chips was caught very<br>high almost comparable to the the<br>control so it's a exhibit acceptable by<br>the the public we also did a another<br>human trial with type 2 diabetic<br>patients both male and female we had<br>about 35 36 participants and we can be<br>they've been through a 14-week program<br>and they were they were provided that<br>they took about 16 grams or 17 grams of<br>carotene protein per day<br>I have to apologize I I'm not in a<br>position to do details about this<br>because we are in the process of<br>capturing the intellectual property<br>because this is a quite a we have in<br>fact we we found some very interesting<br>results so hopefully once it's captured<br>I will be able to talk to you about it<br>and now of course here I worked with my<br>colleague professor David Rawlins from<br>Massey University doing this human trial<br>so finally the food or she is back comes<br>from these all these protein stuff and<br>finally we have been working I've been<br>working with my colleague max Tiger you<br>know at University of Canterbury the<br>department of mechanical engineering we<br>have been doing this project for about<br>10 years the project got slightly<br>delayed due to the earthquake and the<br>laboratories got affected we are now<br>since Alexis sorry Alex is she was a<br>postdoctoral fellow she worked with us<br>at the initial stages of this project<br>and Nick Kirkland and jemima Walker<br>there are there are PhDs contributed to<br>this project<br>now when bone fractures are commonly<br>treated with<br>boon plates and screws okay it's a very<br>common method of treatment for fractures<br>to fix and immobilize the fracture so<br>now the material these plates and screws<br>are made of permanent materials such as<br>stainless steel titanium and other types<br>of alloys so but the shortcoming is that<br>once you put this permanent material<br>they stay inside the body<br>once the fracture is healed still the<br>the plates and the screw stays on if you<br>want to remove it you do another second<br>surgery go in and remove it sometimes is<br>almost impossible to remove specially<br>titanium because broop bone grows over<br>these plates and screws it's almost<br>impossible to remove it so what we are<br>developing is metal alloy which is as<br>strong as titanium but the beauty is<br>that it will degrade and break down in<br>the body and the body will excrete it<br>through the kidneys and the gut it's a<br>magnesium alloy so that's the so it is a<br>we think is going to make a<br>revolutionize this area of research this<br>treatment and also there are additional<br>advantages magnesium alloys the<br>mechanical properties of magnesia and<br>all these alloys is very close to that<br>of bone now with another problem with<br>these very strong metals is that it<br>retards the newborn formation if you put<br>stainless steel the steel carries the<br>load bone will never recover so but with<br>the magnesium because the mechanical<br>properties is closer it will stimulate<br>new bone formation so you don't have the<br>stress shielding and another another<br>advantage is that newborn requires<br>magnesium so as this plate breaks down<br>it it feeds the the bone formation so<br>it's a win-win<br>in all aspects so that is our setup so<br>you are be careful when you melt<br>magnesium because it's explosive the<br>whole place can go up in so you'll do it<br>under argon inert gas environment after<br>we cast these alloys BM we treat them<br>thermo mechanically what we do is that<br>the cast alloy is extruded through<br>narrow openings into rods and plates by<br>doing so you can improve the mechanical<br>properties<br>and also the corrosion properties<br>tremendously you can almost we you can<br>have it completely different properties<br>in your in product by doing these<br>different treatments now this work is<br>done as part of rinds<br>Ryan Wilkes PD program which curse<br>surprising otaku and Canterbury so<br>altogether we produced about 60<br>different magnesium alloys now from this<br>sixty we had to finally come down to one<br>for our device so initially what we did<br>was we screened them by looking at their<br>bio corrosion we expose them to into to<br>simulate the body fluid and assess their<br>corrosion using that taking thatting<br>into account we narrow it down to 17<br>alloys now these 17 alloys we checked it<br>there are mechanical properties as it<br>corrodes I said by ochre degrades in the<br>simulated body fluid taking this<br>criteria into account we reduce it down<br>to four alloys of magnesium to magnesium<br>calcium alloys Magnum and manganese<br>alloy and a magnesium zinc alloy we<br>tested this with cell culture methods<br>compatibility cell proliferation cell<br>viability using osteo fibroblast like<br>cell lines and osteoblasts like say<br>lines and also we implanted these alloys<br>subcutaneously as well as<br>intramuscularly now this is a novel<br>method which we develop as part of<br>jemima as phd intramuscular location is<br>a far more bio dynamic location compared<br>to subcutaneous now lot others are using<br>this method so we we implanted them and<br>then looked at the interaction with the<br>surrounding tissues both positive and<br>negative<br>were there any inflammatory reactions<br>any giant cells lymphocytes or and your<br>Genesis positive and also we were<br>looking for when magnesium degrades it<br>produces hydrogen gas so we want to make<br>sure that there's no excessive amount<br>it's at a certain rate the body can<br>handle it<br>so it shouldn't want to be too excessive<br>in fact if I can show<br>time there's nothing wrong and nothing<br>new about this research 100 years ago<br>they tried magnesium at that time<br>unfortunately they couldn't have yet<br>pure magnesium so they put into patients<br>and patient the blew up as balloons and<br>that's why the it went out of fashion<br>100 years ago so we resurrected this<br>this knowledge so we by doing this we<br>narrow it down to two alloys and we did<br>implanted these alloys in the long bones<br>in shape studied looked at their<br>interactions the degradation<br>interosseous lee the bone to implant<br>contact looked at the histologically how<br>it implant this reacts with the<br>surrounding bone taking all that into<br>account we selected one alloy magnesium<br>zinc alloy now at this stage these two<br>bartosh Noack is a design engineer join<br>that group and also he's bigger now we<br>have Anton good is doing a PhD in this<br>aspect of the study so we spend a lot of<br>time modeling these devices okay we have<br>to do make sure the these devices will<br>not fail the finite element analysis<br>analysis all that to make sure that this<br>screws and place won't fail and then we<br>thought that we had to send it to<br>Germany to get this mini-me plates and<br>screws made but we'd be skilled<br>ourselves now we are manufacturing it<br>here I've got high-precision lathes and<br>milling machines so we are producing<br>these plates and screws tested them for<br>bio corrosion of the screws and plates<br>ability to insert them into into pig<br>bone in kind of abattoir bone and also<br>we tested these these plates and screws<br>on pig heads received from abbatoirs we<br>carried out osteotomies on the cheek<br>bones zygomatic arch as well as the<br>supraorbital margin because these are<br>common areas for fractures and tested<br>these and another few months we will be<br>starting a animal<br>trial with pigs and the they'll be<br>assessed for 12 months to assess the<br>bone healing as well as the degradation<br>of the plate so that's my journey and as<br>his senses this took a lot of metal and<br>I'm very thankful for my colleagues my<br>students and my collaborators who made<br>this journey enjoyable journey before I<br>finish I would like to introduce another<br>fellow Sri Lankan now he came to New<br>Zealand long before me about 150 years<br>ago that saw somebody I took this<br>photograph myself somebody here was<br>introduced to New Zealand from Ceylon in<br>1875 and with that thank you very much<br>bonus 13<br>well thank you George my name is Lisa<br>Madison Smith I'm the head of department<br>of anatomy and it's a big job it's big<br>department it's an incredibly diverse<br>department and I have to say one of the<br>first things that I did when I took up<br>this role was tried to get my head<br>around the diversity of the department<br>and what people did and in the<br>department of anatomy I knew my<br>colleagues but I didn't really know that<br>much about what they did in clinical<br>Anatomy was the group that I started<br>working with first and that this<br>included getting to watch George<br>particularly in teaching and teaching in<br>the dr and the dissection room where his<br>teaching meds 2 and 3 students and and<br>and seeing the enthusiasm that he shares<br>with the students and then watching the<br>them interact was truly a lovely thing<br>to watch and and then hearing your your<br>interactions with the PG DEP the<br>surgical Anatomy students the young<br>doctors who are coming and who George<br>has been organizing this program and<br>training the students and and hearing<br>their feedback and watching that<br>interaction I think you know you're an<br>amazing researcher as we have heard but<br>certainly an outstanding teacher and and<br>a great colleague I have to say but one<br>of the real high points of being the<br>head department is getting to<br>participate in these IPL's and I think<br>George demonstrated both the diversity<br>of research that gets done uh-huh and in<br>the department but really the fact that<br>that he takes that research from that<br>basic basic knowledge all the way<br>through translational and developing new<br>products but I would expect that you all<br>also enjoy the personal aspects of these<br>IPL's and getting to know a little bit<br>more about the the background of our<br>colleagues of of our friends and and<br>hearing about their families hearing<br>about how they actually got to where<br>they are today which is<br>truly fascinating it makes you realize<br>things you know that you never knew<br>about your colleagues knew about your<br>love of cricket but I didn't know that<br>you were a rocker and we're gonna have<br>to get you to display some of that<br>expertise for us sometime soon I was<br>thrilled to hear that somebody else has<br>studied couldn't you can he pigs I've<br>done the sequences of kanuda Cooney pigs<br>so again we've got we've got much more<br>in common than our ability to have an<br>afro and and your involvement in<br>biological anthropology which is which<br>is always fun to see but I think really<br>we can all appreciate that that George<br>and and the talk that he's given us<br>today this this IPL just shows how he<br>really not only thinks outside of the<br>box but he would probably create a whole<br>new box out of biomaterials that were<br>tasty and like corn chips<br>so this truly is an amazing amazing<br>skill and something that we value hugely<br>both in the department and in the<br>university and so I would just like you<br>all to join me and thanking George for<br>this amazing IPL and congratulating him<br>and we have a small gift so George thank<br>you so much thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
