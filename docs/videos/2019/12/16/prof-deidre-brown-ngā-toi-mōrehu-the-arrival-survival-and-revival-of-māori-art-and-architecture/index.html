But what happens to Māori art and architecture when whenua (land) and tikanga (values) are under threat? How have these practices survived, changed, recovered and, in turn, reclaimed land and maintained values over the past two centuries? For more than 25 years, Professor Deidre Brown (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Kahu) has been seeking answers to these questions through her research and teaching on Māori art and architecture. Her Inaugural Professorial Lecture reflects on this journey, acknowledging the people, places and events that have shaped her academic career.<br>---<br>Visit our website: https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/creative.html<br>Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/uoacreatives<br>Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/uoacreatives</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Good evening. Welcome to this evening. Welcome to <br>our tikanga that is evolving as I speak because we  <br>are a place of innovation and enterprise in the <br>top-ranking university and this is what we do.<br>So welcome as we work things out as we go.<br>And unfortunately, you're in the <br>hands of Ngāti Porou right now so  <br>it could go long, but I'll try not to.<br>We'd just like to acknowledge the whānau as <br>you bring into our midst our new professor.  <br>What a great honour for us as a university. <br>To my in-laws from Ngāti Kahu of whom I  <br>am always so proud, but the sooner you <br>settle and get rich for me the better,  <br>please. Same for our Ngāpuhi whānau. But <br>really, you honour us this evening by  <br>bringing coming here in strength to support <br>Deidre and her amazing work. So thank you  <br>for the honour that you do us tonight. Nō <br>reira, ki a tātou katoa, tēnā koutou katoa.<br>Tēnā koutou. The privilege I've got tonight on <br>behalf of my cousin, I was given the opportunity  <br>to speak in English, and this is going to be <br>the only part I'll speak in English. I'll do  <br>my best kōrero Māori. And so before I start, <br>I'd just like to back up something you've said,  <br>Hirini. My biggest critic is a daughter of <br>mine. Where are you? There she is. Pretty  <br>much English oratory school, second to none, they <br>document. So everything I do and say in English  <br>she calls it pidgin English and I just thought <br>of something Hirini that, I hope it's in context,  <br>and I was thinking about what I'm about to say in <br>Māori and it's kōrero kereru, that's me in Māori.<br>It's interesting. I used the word wahine <br>toa. I think there's such a word. Toa's not  <br>just a warrior. I think you you have written <br>approximately eight or nine books co-authored.  <br>Mostly Māori and Pacific, Polynesian influence, <br>and when you think about it when Pākehā and  <br>Māori read what you produce, to write a book you <br>will get scrutinised by both Pākehā and Māori,  <br>for sure. And so that takes courage. I'm in awe <br>of you as my cousin. I always call you Number One,  <br>Number One Cousin. Always, and she knows it. We're <br>very close friends, and it's odd because you're  <br>so articulate, you're gentle. I'm uncouth. I'm <br>serious. We're the opposite, yet we both love each  <br>other. Arohanui, my cousin. I will do my best with <br>my pepeha. I have to say, though, before that,  <br>my uncle Dick over here, he is our kaumātua, he's <br>our rangatira and I've always respected him. And  <br>he was getting uncomfortable to do this, what I'm <br>doing now, and so it was an honour that you asked  <br>me and to do it for both you and our whānau. If <br>I don't look nervous, I am, so tihei mauri ora.<br>Ko Mātaatua te waka.<br>Ko Ngāpuhi te iwi. <br>Ko Ngāti Rēhia, Ngāti Kahu te hapū. <br>Ko tau te rangimarie whare tipuna.<br>Ko maunga e te marae, <br>Ko Emiemi te maunga.<br>Ko Mangatete te awa.<br>Ko Whangaroa te moana.<br>Ko Puhi Moana Ariki te tangata. <br>Ko Rawiri Henry David Slater. Thank you.<br>Promotion to professor at the University <br>of Auckland is a mark of distinction  <br>recognising professional and academic <br>eminence at an international level.<br>The woman I'm about to introduce to you <br>began her academic career as a lecturer  <br>in Aotearoa New Zealand art history at the <br>University of Canterbury in 1998 before  <br>returning to the University of Auckland <br>in 2003 where she's worked for the last  <br>16 years teaching New Zealand, Oceanic and <br>indigenous architecture and studio design.<br>She is a specialist and widely respected <br>scholar in the fields of Māori and Pacific  <br>architecture and art history and indigenous <br>architecture and cultural property rights.<br>Her CV is a testament to her consistent <br>record of quality publications, a wide  <br>range of achievements in teaching and outstanding <br>service to the University and the wider community.<br>Among those achievements are her <br>work on behalf of Māori advancement,  <br>the scholarship of her teaching recognised <br>by top teaching excellence award,  <br>over one million dollars of external research <br>grants for her work here at the University of  <br>Auckland including three Royal Society of <br>New Zealand Marsden grants, through one of  <br>which she has produced and co-authored Art <br>in Oceania: A New History which received  <br>the 2014 art book prize for the best English <br>language art or architecture book in the world.<br>She has recently completed Toi te <br>Mana: A History of Indigenous Art,  <br>a co-authored and substantial a mere 200,000 words <br>manuscript for the Auckland University Press.<br>This was the major outcome of the Marsden grant <br>on which she was the lead principal investigator.<br>Her book Tai Tokerau Whakairo Rākau: Northland <br>Māori woodcarving won the EH McCormick Best  <br>First Book Award for Nonfiction at the 2004 <br>Montana New Zealand National Book Awards.<br>Another book Maori Architecture won the art,  <br>architecture and design category in the <br>2009 Nga Kupu Ora Māori Book Awards.<br>Other recent significant research <br>distinctions and awards include three  <br>visiting fellowships to the University <br>of Cambridge between 2015 and 2017.<br>She has received high-level peer <br>recognition through invited lectures,  <br>plenary and keynote addresses and appointments <br>to the editorial boards of three international  <br>peer-reviewed journals, one of which she <br>has also edited and that is Fabrications,  <br>the Journal of the Society of Architectural <br>Historians of Australia and New Zealand,  <br>a journal of exceptionally <br>high standard in this area.<br>Prior to her current post as the Head of <br>the School of Architecture and Planning,  <br>she served many leadership roles within the <br>School, Faculty and wider University community.<br>She has made significant contributions to the <br>research culture as Associate Dean Research  <br>and Performance Based Research Fund, Associate <br>Dean Postgraduate and Associate Dean Equity.<br>She was the co-director of the Te <br>Whare Kura: Indigenous Knowledges,  <br>Peoples and Identities Research <br>Initiative based in the Faculty of Arts.<br>She has also undertaken significant service and <br>leadership in stakeholder and allied organisations  <br>outside the University. The most pertinent current <br>and recent roles are membership of the Humanities  <br>Panel of the Marsden Fund, governorship of <br>the Arts Foundation of New Zealand, Māori  <br>Trademarks Advisory Committee membership and an <br>Assessors role for the Science Investment MB fund.<br>After Professor Brown's <br>lecture, there will be a waiata,  <br>and then Professor Margaret Mutu <br>will present closing comments.<br>It now gives me great pleasure to <br>introduce to you, Professor Deirdre Brown.<br>Thank you, Diane, for your kind words. David, <br>for your mihi. Hirini, for your karakia,  <br>Lena and Helen for your beautiful welcoming <br>karanga and for allowing me to wear this  <br>enormous korowai that I am managing, but it's <br>beautiful, thank you. It's a great honour.<br>And Professor Margaret Mutu <br>for your words to come.<br>I would like to welcome whānau <br>members who are attending tonight,  <br>some of whom have come a long <br>way to be here this evening.<br>And also to my uncle Digmy as the kaumatua of our <br>whānau. I also welcome friends and their families  <br>and especially my sons' friends from school <br>and their parents and teachers. I thank past  <br>and present students for being here, colleagues <br>from the School, faculty across the University  <br>and other institutions and organisations <br>and members of the architectural profession.<br>And I would especially like to thank Many Zhu from <br>the Faculty Communications and Marketing team and  <br>Emma Porritt from the Event Services team for <br>organising this wonderful evening for all of us.<br>Last but not least, I have a special thanks to <br>my two children, Max and Oscar, and my husband,  <br>Grant, who have provided unwavering <br>support, understanding, love and kindness.<br>The kaupapa of my inaugural professorial <br>lecture this evening is to situate my  <br>research and teaching philosophy within my <br>academic journey, not just to demonstrate  <br>what I have discovered and why I have <br>been so fortunate to be made a professor,  <br>but also to provide encouragement and signpost for <br>others who may also want to walk an academic path.<br>The four key concepts that I want to <br>discuss tonight are within the whakataukī,  <br>or proverb, "Toitū te whenua, toitū <br>te tikanga, ka ora ngā toi." Or,  <br>"When we hold fast to our land <br>and values, our arts flourish."<br>Emerging from these wise words of the <br>concepts of whakapapa, or lineage;  <br>rangatiratanga, or leadership; tikanga, or <br>values; and whenua, or cultural landscapes.<br>My research work has been to seek all <br>four within Māori art and architecture,  <br>and to examine how these practices <br>respond when whakapapa, rangatiratanga,  <br>tikanga or whenua are under threat.<br>My teaching work is to mitigate these <br>threats and enhance creative practice  <br>by educating and mentoring our talented students.<br>Because I am a Māori staff member the start <br>line for my academic career is a little bit  <br>further back in space and time and is located at <br>the beginning of time in my ancestral homeland of  <br>Whangaroa which is about 20 minutes' drive <br>north of the Bay of Islands in Northland.<br>Ka pai.<br>Whangaroa is the landscape and harbour <br>manifestation of Hine-nui-te-pō,  <br>the goddess of life and death among many <br>other ancestors who form her towering cliffs.<br>Within these cliffs, we interred our dead, <br>returning them back to Hine-nui-te-pō in and  <br>special waka kōiwi, or carved bone <br>caskets that take a female form the  <br>great Polynesian culture hero Māui who is <br>remembered in our naming and stories of the  <br>landscape as performing his most important <br>tasks at Whangaroa including the ensnaring  <br>of the sun to slow down its passage <br>across the sky and his failed attempt  <br>to end Hine-nui-te-pō in order to seek <br>immortality which ended in his own death.<br>The Whangaroa Heads at the mouth of the <br>harbour are named after Hine-nui-te-pō  <br>and Māui, and the ebb and flow of <br>the tides and the entry and exit of  <br>watercraft emulate the cyclical nature <br>of life and death and day and night.<br>It is this incredible place that <br>my whānau come from and where my  <br>brother Michael and his children still live.<br>It is through my mother Rosine that I inherit <br>my whakapapa Māori. She left school and  <br>home after she matriculated at age 15. My <br>father Jim who was English was not able to  <br>complete his university studies and Chemical <br>Engineering because of the Second World War.<br>They wanted me to have the university education <br>that they were denied and my mother was  <br>particularly concerned that I should never work in <br>a field that included cooking, sewing or cleaning  <br>because these were the jobs that she had <br>done and received little recognition for.<br>Being older parents, they both <br>retired when I was in my early  <br>teens which meant that our family's main <br>form of income was the government pension.<br>Being raised in a welfare-dependent household has <br>its challenges, but it also makes you resourceful,  <br>resilient and thankful for what you <br>do have. All good skills to have if  <br>you want to be one of life's survivors or <br>perhaps work in a university. Because you  <br>exist within a web of state bureaucracy, <br>as a young person you soon learn to fill  <br>out an application form like your life <br>depends on it because it so often does.<br>This skill has been very useful later in life <br>when filling out Marsden Grant applications.<br>My pathway to architecture was probably <br>not much different to those than most of  <br>the practitioners and students in this room. I <br>had wanted to be an architect from a young age,  <br>and I was sent a copy of the 1983 prospectus and <br>pored over its pages. I was an all-round student,  <br>and I worked hard on my school intermediate <br>year grades to gain admission. My first year  <br>at Architecture School in 1989 was not what <br>I had expected, and I seriously considered  <br>transferring to the law school, but didn't <br>because a friend and engineering told me  <br>that they put all the bad teachers in <br>first year and I should hang in there.<br>Incidentally, teaching first year was my first job <br>when I came back to the Architecture programme and  <br>I have since learned that this is not the <br>rationale for the placement of teachers.<br>Although just over half of the School's <br>students are now female, the proportion  <br>was much smaller back in the 1980s. A few of <br>the largely male staff were still finding their  <br>feet as facilitators of gender equity and <br>empowerment, sometimes with unintentionally  <br>hilarious results. I remember being one of a <br>small group of female students who approached  <br>a male staff member at the end of a class to ask <br>for more information about an upcoming assignment  <br>he responded by saying that he had anticipated <br>that the women would need further assistance.<br>"I'll make this simple for you," <br>he said in slow clear words.<br>"My assignment is just like baking a cake."<br>"The lectures are like the ingredients <br>and the assignment question is the recipe.<br>"You just mix the information up as directed."<br>I was shocked. My mother had sent me to university <br>so I could avoid having to make cakes, and here I  <br>was at the University of Auckland, now revealed <br>to be the Edmonds Cookbook of knowledge.<br>More seriously, there were only three other  <br>Māori students in my year - Keri <br>Whaitiri, Saul Roberts, and [?].<br>Rau Hoskins was in the year ahead of me.<br>My first critique session was a <br>disaster, albeit an influential one.<br>The tutor berated me for incorporating <br>Māori designs into the early learning  <br>centre I had presented and accused <br>me of cultural misappropriation.<br>The culturally sensitive approach, as he said, was <br>to leave Māori architecture on the marae where it  <br>belonged. I took this as a provocation and I did <br>hang in there and I incorporated Māori culture  <br>into as many projects as possible and found <br>acceptance under the tutelage of Mike Austin,  <br>Mike Lindsay and Sarah Treadwell. Other inspiring <br>teachers at the school with John Goldwater,  <br>Jeanette Budgett and Peter Sheppard. Mike <br>Lindsay's lecture in the Myth and Metaphor  <br>course on Ringatu buildings unlocked <br>an interest in Māori religio-political  <br>architecture that propelled me <br>through the rest of my degree.<br>With his encouragement, I undertook a <br>post-professional master's degree that  <br>focused on Māori architecture under Sarah's <br>supervision and a doctorate under his and Mike  <br>Austin's supervision on the architecture of Mōrehu <br>movements. Mōrehu is the Māori word for survivor,  <br>and a term that is sometimes used to describe <br>the followers of 19th and early 20th century  <br>Māori prophet leaders. At that time, I was very <br>fortunate to make a friend and co-author of Bill  <br>McKay, who was in practice and was undertaking <br>research in the same area. And also to have  <br>the mentorship of Patu Hohepa, Matiu Rata, <br>and Matiu's brother-in-law Jerry Ihimaera.<br>My PhD was written at a time when the <br>historical contribution of Māori prophet  <br>leaders and the Mōrehu movements had been the <br>topic of sustained academic investigation by  <br>the historians Judith Binney and Bronwyn <br>Elsmore, in a topic of artistic research  <br>by the ethnologist Roger Neich who was <br>my doctoral external examiner. Their  <br>work had been motivated by earlier ontological <br>pivots towards indigenous and social history  <br>by University of Auckland academics like Keith <br>Sinclair and Ranginui Walker, who was one of my  <br>intermediate year teachers, and more generally <br>through the development of contemporary social  <br>anthropology and participatory research.<br>Linda Tuhiwai Smith's groundbreaking book  <br>Decolonising Methodologies which established <br>relevant ways of undertaking indigenous  <br>research was not published until the year <br>after my PhD was conferred, so I had to  <br>invent my own Māori research methodology <br>for the thesis, and that was whakapapa.<br>Now, these Mōrehu movements <br>established the social,  <br>political, spiritual and architectural <br>infrastructure for tino rangatiratanga,  <br>or Māori self-determination, before, <br>during and after the New Zealand Wars.<br>Before colonisation, Māori society was <br>primarily organized as hāpu, or sub-tribes,  <br>and had distinct regional, artistic and <br>architectural practices. Through their  <br>resistance to colonisation and steadfast <br>determination to hold on to their lands,  <br>Mōrehu movements sought the amalgamation of <br>hāpu and iwi into pan-tribal and national  <br>groups. Some such as Pai Mārire mobilised <br>to fight back during the New Zealand Wars.<br>Others such as the Paremata Māori, <br>or Māori Parliament movements,  <br>such as Papawai Pā that you can see here, <br>created independent political systems or  <br>as the Rātana movement did, entered <br>parliament as ministers of parliament.<br>Leaders such as Te Whiti o Rongomai, Tohu Kākahi, <br>Rua Kenana, Te Puea Hērangi, and Tahupotiki Wiremu  <br>Ratana established their own autonomous <br>towns on Māori owned and contested lands.<br>My doctorate identified about 300 Mōrehu buildings <br>and associated structures from interviews,  <br>site visits, archives, sound recordings and <br>primary pictorial and manuscript documents.<br>And this was in the age before digital <br>databases, so I spent a year in the library  <br>just using the card catalogue. The thesis <br>and the publications that followed on from  <br>it have demonstrated how the mana of movements <br>shifted between them through the passing on  <br>of symbols and architectural forms, and that <br>the appropriation of Western European design  <br>elements was not a sign of assimilation, but a <br>strengthening of culture against colonisation.<br>Thus, the mana of the Kīngitanga and Pai Mārire <br>flags informs the iconography of Ringatū painted  <br>meeting houses, the 1907 Hīona courthouse at <br>Maungapōhatu and our Ratana Temepara o temples,  <br>and many other Mōrehu buildings around <br>the country to demonstrate spiritual,  <br>cultural and political continuity.<br>The uniquely Māori arts associated with <br>whare whakairo, or decorated meeting houses,  <br>that developed around the 1840s in <br>Turanga, also known today as Gisborne,  <br>are spread across the East Coast by the Ringatū <br>movement - and here we have an Also, into the  <br>Waikato Tainui region of the central North Island <br>by Te Puea Hērangi and the Turangawaewae carving  <br>school and across the North Island by Āpirana <br>Ngata and his School of Māori Arts and Crafts.<br>Access to train and road travel increased in speed <br>and coverage. The spread of new ideas about Māori  <br>communal architecture across the country of which <br>the whare whakairo was only one of many styles.<br>However, the focus of Ngata's school on <br>training experts empowered to teach the next  <br>generation of practitioners how to decorate <br>meeting houses with carvings, kowhaiwhai  <br>paintings and tukutuku panels ensured that the <br>whare whakairo became the predominant style.<br>Such was the success of the school in this regard <br>that the whare whakairo and the marae in which  <br>they sit are regarded as the bastions, <br>and some might argue the final bastions,  <br>of tikanga and te reo Māori around the <br>country, and more recently in urban centres.<br>Two lifelong personal lessons <br>emerged from this work.<br>First, the mission of Ngata and the School of <br>Māori Arts and Crafts underlines the importance  <br>of teaching and learning. As an architect, you <br>can change the city one building at a time.  <br>As a teacher of architecture, you can change <br>the world 100 architectural graduates a year.<br>If you want to make a real difference,  <br>start by being a teacher, even if it is <br>part-time or as a critic or examiner.<br>Whereas a masters degree is a <br>requirement to become an architect,  <br>a doctorate is a license to teach and <br>research full-time in a university.<br>There are few opportunities in <br>one's life when you can spend  <br>three years doing something <br>truly novel and innovative.<br>To that end, Dr Sarosh Mulla has been <br>strategically placed in the room for  <br>any PhD inquiries, Dr Andrew Douglas for <br>any studio teaching inquiries. Dr Mohsen  <br>Mohammadzadeh can take questions on both if you <br>really want to rule the world and be a planner.<br>Second lesson. This doctorate and subsequent <br>research projects have left me in no doubt  <br>that the only way to understand this <br>country is to understand what happened  <br>in it during the 19th century. The New <br>Zealand Wars had a devastating effect,  <br>extending far beyond the conflict zones <br>and it will take centuries to repair.<br>This is why the recent announcement that <br>Aotearoa New Zealand history will become  <br>compulsory in schools represents a transformative <br>moment for our society. The suppression of this  <br>history has been a form of social conditioning <br>that has made many New Zealanders blind to so  <br>much of that which surrounds and affects them, <br>including their built and natural environments.<br>Architectural students and practitioners sometimes <br>speak of Māori culture as something that has been  <br>buried underneath the city and proposed projects <br>to excavate it like an archaeological dig.<br>As I point out to them, we are surrounded <br>in Tāmaki Makaurau by 50 volcanic cones,  <br>some of which were fortified Māori pā that dwarf  <br>almost all of the city's buildings <br>and are still very much visible.<br>Māori construction is everywhere. Our culture <br>and our ancestors surround us like a korowai,  <br>and all we need to do is open our <br>eyes and our minds to see them.<br>When this new generation of history-enabled <br>students reaches the university,  <br>we must be prepared to build on <br>their knowledge and enable them  <br>to create something truly responsive out of it.<br>After my PhD, I successfully applied <br>for a position as lecturer in Aotearoa  <br>New Zealand Art History at the University of <br>Canterbury School of Fine Arts in Christchurch.<br>It was here that I was mentored by <br>Jonathon Mane-Wheoki, also of Ngāpuhi,  <br>and learned how to become an academic <br>and a curator. He was, by this stage,  <br>an already internationally acclaimed art <br>historian who was working all over the world.<br>Two of the advantages of being his <br>wing wahine was that he introduced  <br>me into his networks and I got to <br>pick up the local speaking gigs and  <br>writing opportunities that he <br>didn't have time for anymore.<br>This created an ideal platform to begin building <br>a strong academic portfolio which is an absolute  <br>necessity for securing large-scale research <br>grants. The first of which was a Marsden  <br>Grant with Annie Potts and Philip Armstrong for <br>a cultural history of animals, published in 2014  <br>as the New Zealand Book of Beasts: Animals <br>in Our Culture, History in Everyday Life.<br>My work on the project involved investigating <br>the animal in Māori and non-Māori art and has  <br>led to a long-term interest in the spatial role <br>of zoos and other collecting institutions such  <br>as botanic gardens, art galleries, libraries <br>and museums - an imperial expansion - and their  <br>effect on particular New Zealand plants and <br>animals and indigenous peoples and knowledges.<br>Next year the project will focus <br>on the redistribution of harakeke,  <br>or New Zealand flax, hence <br>the presence of harakeke in  <br>the room tonight. Thank you very <br>much, Emma, for organising that.<br>At Canterbury, I extended my field of interest <br>beyond architecture to all Māori creative  <br>practices through my teaching, bookending <br>the work on Mōrehu architecture with new  <br>research on customary and contemporary Māori <br>art and architectural histories and practices.<br>A lot of the mahi involved creating <br>a curriculum that pieced together  <br>narratives of Māori arts within the periods <br>and looked for enduring threads between them.<br>Whenua, or land, and the cultural landscape;  <br>and tikanga, or customs and values; <br>emerged as dominant recurring themes.<br>While land was lost through confiscation, the <br>activities of the Native Land Court and various  <br>acts of parliament, tikanga was steadfastly <br>maintained across Māori communities and  <br>became an important source of inspiration for <br>Māori artists from the 18th century onwards.<br>This is clear from the earliest engagements with <br>Pākehā and their media, beginning in 1793 with the  <br>first Māori drawing, Tuki Tahua's egocentric map <br>which you can see here in this image on the left,  <br>that illustrates the passage of pounamu and also <br>people's spirits from the south to the north.<br>And the Māori madonna and child sculptures, <br>an example of which can be seen on the right,  <br>that sought to reconcile Christianity <br>within a Māori worldview using Māori means.<br>While tikanga can be about ensuring <br>that art practices such as carving,  <br>painting and weaving stay the same, <br>tikanga also allows them to change  <br>with the times while still ensuring <br>that they remain fundamentally Māori.<br>Art and architectural history seeks to find <br>critical intersections - moments and turning  <br>points that redirect making. Through research, it <br>is possible to chart the emergence and progress  <br>of contemporary Māori creative practitioners <br>from the first Māori architectural graduate  <br>William Bloomfield in 1913, and the first Māori <br>artist to graduate from an art school who was  <br>Pauline Yearbury in 1949. She was the first of a <br>vanguard of Māori modernist artists and designers.<br>While their work was not entirely accepted as <br>Māori by all other Māori they felt emboldened  <br>to address Māori themes and concepts in <br>their practice and encourage teachers and  <br>students to do the same through the <br>New Zealand educational curriculum.<br>This flowthrough of tikanga-based conceptual <br>thinking was evident in the Māori art collectives,  <br>urban marae and tertiary training initiatives <br>established from the 1970s onwards, and tikanga  <br>is certainly a lens through which scholars analyse <br>and discuss Māori architecture and art today.<br>My research has also been concerned with the <br>relationship between tikanga and technologies.  <br>This found expression through the exhibition-based <br>research I undertook with Jonathan as a new  <br>century and millennium dawned in people's minds <br>turned towards the future. Together we curated  <br>the group shows Hiko! New Energies in Māori Art <br>at Christchurch's Robert McDougall Art Gallery  <br>in 1999, and Techno Māori at Wellington City <br>Gallery and Porirua's Pataka Museum in 2001.<br>As part of the Art and Industry Biennials, I <br>also curated an exhibition called Whare at the  <br>SoFA Gallery the following year, and Lightscape in <br>2004 which was installed at multiple sites around  <br>Christchurch City and had contributions <br>from both Māori and non-Māori artists.<br>A standout contributor to the latter was <br>Paul Hartigan whose beautiful neon work is  <br>also outside this theatre. The exhibition <br>showcased the work of a new generation of  <br>emerging Māori artists many of whom have <br>gone on to establish vibrant careers,  <br>and some of whom are in this room tonight such <br>as Olivia Haddon, Eugene Hansen, Darryn George,  <br>Lonnie Hutchinson, Rueben Patterson, Rachael <br>Rakena and Areta Wilkinson, among others.<br>Key findings from these exhibitions were that <br>artists who had grown up in a pre-digital age  <br>like me in older made art concerned with <br>technology as concepts including the early  <br>internet and surveillance, whereas younger <br>digital natives regarded technology as a  <br>medium to express other ideas, particularly <br>those associated with tikanga and also forms  <br>of Māori futurism that imagined a different <br>and self-sustaining way of being Māori.<br>Comparing this to the mahi of our ancestors,  <br>we can see a similar divide in the different <br>ways that 19th and early 20th-century tohunga,  <br>or customary experts, and Mōrehu artists as <br>new generation radicals treated materials  <br>like commercial paints, corrugated <br>iron and machine-manufactured fibres.<br>The media changes but the <br>tikanga remains the same.<br>Thus the digital artists of <br>the new millennium could be  <br>located alongside their ancestors on taura <br>whakairo, or the continuum of Māori art.<br>The six years I spent at Canterbury were indeed <br>formative. It resulted in my first book Tai  <br>Tokerau Whakairo Rākau, which identified and <br>documented Northland Māori carvings and museums  <br>across the world and challenged the idea that <br>Northland did not have a carving tradition.<br>This project impressed on me the <br>rather desperate fate of taonga Māori,  <br>or Māori treasures. Held in museum <br>storage and unlikely to be ever put  <br>on display or connected with their <br>communities in any meaningful way.<br>It also brought to my attention the <br>problematic definitions of provenance  <br>or determining where a taonga is from. Of the <br>800 Māori wood carvings identified and museum  <br>records as being from Northland, I could <br>only find evidence that about a hundred  <br>of them actually came from Northland. The <br>other 700 could have been from anywhere but  <br>were given Northland attributions based on <br>a restricted set of visual style indicators,  <br>such as sinuous bodies and particular surface <br>patterns, as part of a well-meaning but ultimately  <br>unhelpful attempt during the 1980s to give <br>identity to taonga languishing in storage.<br>I am currently exploring with Dr Ngarino <br>Ellis from Art History an opportunity to  <br>develop imaging software to attribute <br>maker identities to taonga that have  <br>no provenance. As my recent research work <br>at the University of Cambridge has shown,  <br>taonga travel and they attain mana through their <br>exchange and movement across tribal boundaries.<br>So the question of where they are from <br>is really only an academic one. Knowing  <br>who made them can help us to reconstruct their <br>journeys and build a better - and we might argue,  <br>more Māori - way of understanding their stories.<br>At the end of 2003, I returned to Auckland <br>as Senior Lecturer in Architecture at our  <br>School of Architecture and Planning. At the <br>beginning of this year, I became its Head.<br>Most of the country's architects, urban planners <br>and urban designers are trained in our school,  <br>which in 2017 celebrated its centenary. Chances <br>are that the neighbourhoods and buildings that you  <br>study, work and live in, the roads that you travel <br>on and the parks, public spaces, and shops that  <br>you go to were designed and planned by someone <br>trained in our School. The students currently  <br>in the School will, during their careers, design <br>buildings and infrastructure that may still be  <br>operational in the middle of next century. Ours <br>is a school that shapes the city and the country.<br>Whereas art brought me closer to tikanga and <br>taonga, returning to architecture brought me back  <br>in touch with the whenua, or cultural landscape, <br>it also lead to a long-term teaching collaboration  <br>with Rewi Thompson until he passed away in 2016. <br>Rewi believed that all essential truths could be  <br>found in the whenua and the architect's role <br>was to design buildings that responded to  <br>them. Good architecture could, in his words, <br>improve the land by relating to its rhythms,  <br>form, scales, stories and needs - a <br>philosophy that's found expression in  <br>many of his residential projects and perhaps <br>more influentially, in his teaching. For him,  <br>the land was not just a surface, nor the <br>sea a boundary, nor the sky a backdrop.<br>I had the privilege of supervising thesis <br>students and teaching studio with him,  <br>one of them based in my hapū's former tribal <br>home of Te Puna in the Bay of Islands. Here,  <br>we encouraged our students not to touch <br>the landscape lightly but to respond to  <br>its majesty with big transformative <br>schemes with ihi, wehi, and wana.<br>More recently, I have taught studio with <br>Te Ari Prendergast on a brief to create a  <br>pōwhiri space within Auckland Council's <br>Albert Street high-rise headquarters,  <br>nicknamed the Marae in the Sky - a project <br>that tackles the ongoing design problem faced  <br>by many architects attempting to imbue <br>tikanga into small or unusual spaces.<br>During my first five years at Auckland, I wrote <br>more books, including Māori Architecture in 2009,  <br>which is a condensed version of <br>The History of Māori Buildings.<br>In 2012, I embarked on my most ambitious <br>research project to date, Toi Te Mana:  <br>An Indigenous History of Māori Art and <br>Architecture, with colleagues Jonathan  <br>Mane-Wheoki who had recently become a <br>professor at Elam School of Fine Arts  <br>and Dr Ngarino Ellis. Sadly, as many of you <br>know, Jonathan passed away about eighteen  <br>months into the project but was able to complete <br>some work which will be published along with all  <br>our chapters in a major Auckland University <br>Press book in either late 2020 or early 2021.<br>A major finding from our Marsden-funded <br>research for Toi Te Mana is the centrality  <br>of whenua to all forms of Māori <br>art and architectural production,  <br>a point that comes into sharp focus when we track <br>what happens when land is taken away from its  <br>traditional owners or when art and architecture <br>is taken away from its site without permission.<br>Land alienation and unsustainable felling <br>practices from the 19th century onwards has  <br>reduced access to and the availability <br>of timber for carving and meeting house  <br>construction. By the 1920s, the School of <br>Māori Arts and Crafts struggled to source  <br>timber of adequate lengths for major structural <br>members and had little choice but to use steel  <br>frameworks for some of its larger projects <br>such as the one you can see in this image.<br>Furthermore, the silting of waterways <br>through deforestation and draining of  <br>wetlands to create farmland diminished <br>reserves of harakeke, raupō and toi toi,  <br>affecting the supply of materials <br>for Māori clothing and buildings.<br>While there were sufficient reserves of <br>raupō and other thatch materials to build  <br>the large numbers of whare at Parihaka in <br>the 1880s, by the turn of the 20th century,  <br>these cladding materials <br>had become harder to source.<br>As many Māori men were drawn into work as paid <br>farm labourers from the mid-19th century onwards  <br>life as a carving expert in a koha-based <br>arts economy became less appealing, and by  <br>the early 20th century, there were few experts <br>in this field outside of the tourism industry.<br>If it had not been for the customary <br>arts revival begun by Te Puea Hērangi  <br>and Apirana Ngata in the 1920s, Māori art and <br>architecture would look very different today.<br>Until this time customary <br>Māori art survived in the  <br>pockets of land that remained in Māori ownership.<br>Pataka, or storehouses, continued to be <br>built in the areas where Māori life ways,  <br>particularly around the hunting and preserving <br>of storage of foods, could be maintained.<br>However, by the late 19th century some whānau were  <br>on the verge of starvation due <br>to inadequate land holdings.<br>During my research, I came across this <br>quote by Hoane Kahu from Ngāi Tahu which  <br>summed up the desperate situation of the period.<br>"In former times our whata, or storehouses, <br>used to be full of food but now we do not need  <br>storehouses because we have nothing to put in them <br>through everything being taken by the Europeans."<br>The distance between Māori communities on <br>Māori land and Pākeha settlements however  <br>was also a factor in the survival of moko <br>which was worn by Māori women whose lives  <br>had little intersection with the <br>Pākeha world and its prejudices.<br>Māori women in rural areas also retained <br>the knowledge of raranga in whatu fibre  <br>arts which became more widely practised <br>in the revival led by Rangimārie Hetet <br>from the 1950s.<br>Some arts did not survive land loss. <br>In South Canterbury and North Otago,  <br>rock art required seasonal hunting <br>and gathering access to caves,  <br>plains and wetlands that quickly became private <br>property with the arrival of European settlers.<br>The whenua has certainly <br>underpinned other research  <br>projects that I have been part of recently.<br>The most important project I have ever <br>been involved in of this nature is the  <br>2014 repatriation back to Te Puna of the silver <br>medal given by the governor of New South Wales,  <br>Philip Gidley King, to my ancestor Te Pahi <br>in 1806. Te Pahi was murdered in 1810 with  <br>a number of our whānau in their homes, and <br>Te Puna looted by marauding European sailors  <br>after he was erroneously blamed for the Boyd <br>massacre. I am descended from one of his four  <br>children who took refuge in Whangaroa where <br>they established their own hāpu, Ngāti Rua.<br>The medal reappeared in 2014 in an auction at <br>Sotheby's Sydney, and in the space of a few weeks,  <br>I and the kaumatua, Hugh Rihari, and Ngāpuhi in <br>Sydney began a high-profile legal direct protest  <br>action, as you can see here, and Museum <br>lobbying campaign to have it returned.<br>My input was my research work on Te Puna,  <br>particularly on their prefabricated <br>house that was also a gift from the  <br>governor and my still continuing search <br>for all the taonga that were taken.<br>The medal was purchased at auction with the <br>support of our people by Auckland Museum and  <br>Te Papa for 300,000 Australian dollars, <br>and its return to Te Puna was the first  <br>opportunity in 2004 years for Ngāti <br>Rua to return to our ancestral lands  <br>and re-engage with Ngāti Torehina who are the <br>descendants of the survivors who stayed behind.<br>And I'd just like to acknowledge Herb <br>Rihari in this room from Ngāti Torehina  <br>and Linnae Pohatu from Auckland Museum who is also <br>in this picture. Thank you very much for coming.<br>A number of us, and I think you'd <br>agree, were in the right place with  <br>the right knowledge at the right time <br>to make this happen and to be part of  <br>the reunification of hāpu on the whenua is a <br>highlight of my life and my research career.<br>Other recent projects based on whenua <br>include collaborative work with the  <br>James James Henare Māori Research Centre <br>and Civil Engineering that also involves  <br>our postgraduate students on the impact of <br>the Earthquake-prone Buildings Amendment  <br>Act on meetinghouse strengthening which can <br>be unaffordable for some Māori communities.<br>In this work, Ruamoko, the god of volcanoes and <br>seismic forces, and Papatuanuku, the Earth Mother,  <br>personify the whenua. I have also assisted <br>in a project led by the University of Otago,  <br>investigating the links between rheumatic fever,  <br>child poverty and housing in Māori <br>and Pacific urban communities.<br>As I have argued elsewhere, <br>the intergenerational pathway  <br>to houselessness and homelessness <br>begins with landlessness for Māori.<br>Patching roofs and walls and administering <br>preventative antibiotics are temporary fixes  <br>that only keep us one step <br>ahead or behind the problem.<br>Remediation rests in restoring the relationship <br>between the people, buildings and land.  <br>Returning to Auckland also brought me into <br>contact with a much more diverse group of  <br>students than I had taught before or learned <br>alongside as a former student of the School.<br>Many were not born in New Zealand. There were more <br>Māori, although there was always room for more.  <br>And there were Pasifika students, indeed four of <br>them in the first class I taught here in 2004.<br>Karamia Müller, Lama Tone, Sēmisi <br>Fetokai Potauaine and Charmaine 'Ilaiū.<br>All four went on to undertake <br>fifth-year dissertations with me  <br>and then post-professional masters degrees <br>under my supervision, becoming role models  <br>for other Pasifika students to much acclaim from <br>their communities. Charmaine went on to complete  <br>her PhD at the University of Queensland, and Dr <br>Karamia Müller at the University of Auckland.<br>Working with them and other Pasifika students <br>inspired me to expand my teaching curriculum  <br>and undertake research on the art and <br>architectural traditions of other parts of  <br>the Pacific. This led to the Marsden-funded <br>collaboration with Doctors Peter Brant,  <br>Sean Mallon, Nicholas Thomas and others <br>on the Art in Oceania project and book.<br>My contribution through these <br>projects was threefold. First,  <br>the migration of monumental stone and earth <br>architecture across the Pacific during the  <br>long-range voyaging period from the canal village <br>of Nan Madol in Micronesia which you can see here,  <br>to the Langi of Lapaha in Tonga, <br>and the volcanic pā of Aotearoa.<br>Second, the relationship between fibre arts,  <br>particularly feathered objects and sacred <br>sites and the political transformations  <br>that occurred in the Society Islands <br>in Hawaii during the 18th century.<br>And third, 19th and early 20th-century indigenous <br>art and architectural responses to the colonial  <br>presence which extended my earlier thesis <br>work to other parts of the Pacific.<br>The book was well received by <br>communities and critics and even  <br>made the cover of The Times Literary <br>Supplement which is probably how it  <br>came to the attention of the judges for the <br>Art Book Prize that Diane mentioned before.<br>The money that we received for the prize <br>was used to purchase copies of the book  <br>for libraries around the Pacific. I've <br>always written about the Pacific from  <br>the perspective of a Māori scholar whose <br>culture is teina, or younger sibling,  <br>to others in the Pacific. As a supervisor of <br>Pasifika students, my role is to be the tuakana,  <br>or older sibling, that enables them <br>to become experts in their fields.<br>Occasionally I am asked by other teachers <br>about whether it is appropriate to supervise  <br>students from one indigenous culture who are <br>exploring their identity when you come from  <br>another. My reply is that a supervisor <br>is not the kauri tree to which all other  <br>plants should aspire to in size species. <br>The supervisor is instead a gorse bush.<br>Their role is to be the nursery <br>plant that keeps all threats and  <br>distractions away from the student <br>and allows them to thrive and grow.<br>Once a student has reached their potential by <br>submitting their thesis, dissertation or studio,  <br>the supervisor, like the gorse bush, will <br>recede. When there are enough completed  <br>graduates of a particular culture that <br>can create a critical mass of supervisors,  <br>critics and examiners, then one's job <br>is done. They can take it from there.<br>We still have a way to go for <br>Māori and Pasifika graduates,  <br>and that goes for all architecture and planning <br>programmes across the country. The challenges  <br>are no secret to most of the staff here. <br>Recruitment into the undergraduate programme,  <br>retention in degrees, and pipelines into the <br>doctoral programme, all of which have complex  <br>dynamics that invite innovative solutions. <br>In 2017, there were over 1,000 professors  <br>employed by universities, and of these, <br>35 were Maori, and five were Pasifika.<br>The average age of Māori doctoral graduates is <br>50 which is much higher than for non-Māori and  <br>reflects the fact that many Māori staff <br>have had careers in other professions  <br>before they join the University. I <br>received my doctorate when I was 28,  <br>and my journey to becoming a professor <br>fits within the 20-year average span  <br>to reach that rank, noting that not all <br>academic staff will become professors.<br>We need more Māori and Pasifika people <br>completing doctorates and entering academia  <br>sooner and in larger numbers, if we are to <br>achieve equity within the professoriate.<br>My whenua of Whangaroa might <br>be a four-hour drive from here,  <br>but sometimes it seems much further away <br>than life at the University of Auckland.<br>It has high rates of unemployment, high rates <br>of youth suicide, low rates of educational  <br>attainment. My research, and that of others, has <br>uncovered the large-scale looting of waka kōiwi,  <br>and human remains from the cliff-side <br>resting places by Pākeha collectors  <br>for sale to museums which violates the <br>tapu and tikanga of the burial caves and  <br>the rangatiratanga of Hine-nui-te-pō. Poor <br>ecological management has led to recurrent  <br>serious flooding in the principal town of Kaeo <br>and one proposed solution is managed retreat.<br>What would the managed retreat of humans from the  <br>place where Maui slowed the <br>sun say about this country?<br>Sometimes I stand in the main street <br>of Kaeo knowing the 200-year historical  <br>path that took us from being <br>a prosperous kāinga Māori to  <br>this point and I wonder about the <br>future and what I feel is hopeful.<br>Partly because feeling otherwise is unacceptable. <br>Mostly because I know that I and many others are  <br>committed to increasing Māori participation <br>rates in higher education and these people  <br>will work with or be the kaumatua that <br>will find solutions to these problems,  <br>as my esteemed colleague Professor Margaret <br>Mutu is doing. Also, because I currently  <br>have the privilege of leading a School of <br>Architecture and Planning that at any one  <br>time has eight hundred enrolled students <br>who believe that they can change the world  <br>individually and collectively, and they are <br>supported by 40 academic staff and a team  <br>of professional staff who are committed to <br>equipping them with the skills to do this.<br>And these staff through their own research and <br>service to the University and community are also  <br>making the world a better place to be in. Thank <br>you for this gift of the professorship. I do  <br>not underestimate the mana of this mantle you <br>have put upon my shoulders. It places me in a  <br>whakapapa of academics who I greatly admire <br>and positions me to assist in the School,  <br>Faculty and University's missions. I share this <br>korowai with my whānau, friends, current and  <br>former students and colleagues who have supported <br>me on this academic journey, and I will ensure  <br>that the mana that comes with this professorship <br>is used for the benefit of our many communities.<br>I conclude my inaugural professorial lecture with  <br>the challenge set down for all of us <br>by the Ngāpuhi leader Sir James Henare.<br>Kua tawhiti kē to haerenga mai,<br>kia kore e haere tonu.<br>He nui rawa o mahi, kia kore e mahi tonu.<br>You have come too far not to <br>go further you. have done too  <br>much not to do more. No reira <br>tena koutou, tena koutou, tena  <br>tatou katou.<br>This is why we are so proud of <br>this descendant of Ngāti Kahu.<br>I'm just so pleased to see how full this lecture  <br>theatre is tonight and it just <br>makes Ngāti Kahu even prouder.<br>Now, I really focus in on Ngāti <br>Kahu because you've heard a pepeha,  <br>a couple of pepeha tonight. Ngā mihi <br>atu ki a koe Rawiri i to kōrero.<br>But they were Ngapuhi ones. <br>So I'll give you another one.<br>Ko Maungataniwha te maunga.<br>Ko Tokerau ko Whangaroa ngā moana. <br>Ko Kahutianui tōku tupuna engari ko Kahukuraaaiki  <br>a hoki Kahutianui te tupuna.<br>Ko Te Parata te tangata. <br>Ko Māmaru te waka (Mamaru is the canoe),<br>Ko koutou ko Ngāti Kahu te iwi ko Ngāti  <br>Ruaiti te hāpu.<br>No reira ngā mihi.<br>And that places Deidre and her whānau back <br>in Ngāti Kahu where she is a descendant of  <br>Hapeta Renata, who is from a place <br>that we call Waiaua or Waitetoki.<br>And I think if you look from your place there and <br>you looked straight across the sea then you see  <br>my place at Karikari and the way you talk about <br>Whangaroa and the way things are at Whangaroa,  <br>well at least you've got mussel farms up <br>there. They are mussel farms, aren't they?<br>Yeah, okay. We haven't even got those <br>yet at Karikari. We've set places aside  <br>for them but... yeah, they keep telling <br>us we're not allowed to do it. But it's  <br>more to do that we can't afford it. <br>We'll do it, all right. We'll do it.<br>So for us of Ngāti Kahu, when we found out that <br>you had... I must say, University of Auckland,  <br>finally appointed her to professorial <br>rank, Ngāti Kahu was just over the moon,  <br>and so it went all over our Facebook or whatever. <br>I'm not allowed near those things. My children  <br>won't let me near them. But Ngāti Kahu does. So <br>we put it all over there. But Deidre's work over  <br>the years in this university in particular, <br>to me, has just been stunning, and I remember  <br>sitting on the Māori Knowledge and Development <br>panel in 2006 and Deidre's work came before us,  <br>and I went, "wow, that tiny little one <br>from down the road has done all this?"<br>Now, there were two things about that. First of <br>all, whew! We finally had people who understood  <br>how important it is that the tikanga, <br>who we are, was being passed on. And,  <br>you know, I know how good books are by how <br>often they get pinched out of my house,  <br>and Deirdre your books get pitched out of <br>my house. I give them as gifts because there  <br>is so little written on the Tai Tokerau. And <br>our people are hungry for that sort of stuff.<br>So there was that, but what stunned me was <br>the brilliance of the work she was doing  <br>back then -- which, to me, I was just sitting <br>in there going, "wow!"-- wasn't recognised,  <br>and that made me angry. It made me really angry <br>because Deidre's work is brilliant. Brilliant  <br>in its simplicity. Brilliant in just saying, <br>"this is how it is, and this is what there  <br>is around you. Look, open your eyes. Have <br>a look. It's beautiful, but it's there."<br>And so like you, Deidre, I was actually in Canada <br>when they announced that they were going to teach  <br>the Māori history of this country starting from <br>- when is it? - 2022 or something like that.  <br>I think finally...finally! But then I worry <br>about what is actually going to be taught so,  <br>you know, we've got to get it. This is <br>the place the universities are the place  <br>where we have to get that right. <br>We really really do so that what  <br>I do here out there getting thrown back <br>at me we can just put that to one side.<br>Because, like Deirdre, I know that if this <br>country and all of those who come here and  <br>have come in the past and are still coming now <br>understood what had happened in this country,  <br>understood all the stuff that <br>Deidre was talking to us about,  <br>we wouldn't be fighting with them all the <br>time. Like Ngāti Kahu is very good at doing.<br>Okay, so up home, yeah, we've lost. We <br>lost 70% of our lands before 1860. We've  <br>got five percent of it left. 80 percent of us <br>cannot live in our own territory because we  <br>don't have enough land. But I love what's <br>happening in this...not your generation,  <br>maybe the generations slightly below yours, they <br>are fearless! Now, we teach them, okay? And then  <br>away they go. And so when they read through the <br>histories and find out what was done with their  <br>land and how their land was taken and how there <br>is not one Waitangi Tribunal report, but two  <br>Waitangi Tribunal reports saying that the land is <br>still theirs, well they just go and take it back.  <br>They're very careful about what they... well, <br>some of them are careful what they take back. You  <br>really can't get away with trying to take back an <br>airport and think you're gonna get away with it...  <br>as my husband did. But there is a lot of land at <br>home that just sits there under the mantle of an  <br>outfit called the Department of Conservation <br>which is in fact just sitting there. For us,  <br>it's full of wahi tapu. It's full of sacred places <br>that we hate seeing desecrated. It's our tikanga  <br>that says you've got to look after these places, <br>the places where things have been stolen out of  <br>the caves. We have those as well. We try to build <br>relationships with the Pākehas who have those  <br>lands now to say, "please just stay away from <br>that area there. It's full of not only our koiwi,  <br>not only our bones, but also our taonga as <br>well. If you take the stuff out of there,  <br>you will get hurt. You won't necessarily recognise <br>it, but you will get hurt. That's tikanga.<br>And if we can teach our graduates the way Deidre <br>is teaching the graduates in architecture,  <br>if we can teach throughout the University how <br>our professionals can approach these things,  <br>then Margaret won't have to keep taking <br>them through the courts to try and get it  <br>recognised and then come across a judge who <br>doesn't know the first thing about tikanga.<br>So, you know, to me, a lot of time wasted doing <br>that sort of stuff. Where if we get it right,  <br>the way Dierdre has laid it out so clearly <br>here, then we can live as we were meant to  <br>under Te Tiriti o Waitangi which said we <br>would all live together in harmony. So,  <br>it's a huge and important job that those <br>of us who come into the University have,  <br>to train those who are coming up. But when <br>I've got people like Deidre here training  <br>up heaps of you, I'm happy to stand <br>back and go, "go for it, Ngāti Kahu.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
