Because the level of iodine in New Zealand soil is low, the amount of iodine that we get in food, and the health consequences of not getting enough iodine, has been the focus of Sheila's research.<br><br>With colleagues, she has measured the iodine status of children, adults and pregnant women, demonstrating the re-emergence of mild iodine deficiency in the 1990s, likely due to changes in food habits and practices. More recently, she has evaluated the effectiveness of government strategies to increase iodine intakes, such as the mandatory use of iodised salt in commercial breads, and the recommendation for all pregnant and breastfeeding women to take iodine supplements.<br><br>Sheila is an enthusiastic educator about nutrition, including iodine, gaining national recognition with an Ako Aotearoa tertiary

Akio koto<br>noreda tena koe tu<br>tena koe tow tena tato katoa good<br>evening everyone my name is Harlan hain<br>and I had the great privilege of being<br>the vice chancellor here at the<br>University of Otago and it is my special<br>pleasure to welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>professor Sheila's Keefe now as you know<br>these lectures are a time of great<br>celebration for the University and I'm<br>so happy to see so many people here to<br>mark this really important point in<br>Sheila's career on behalf of the<br>University<br>I would like to extend a particularly<br>warm welcome to members of Sheila's<br>family who have joined us this evening<br>her mother is currently in Canada and<br>we're hopeful that she will either be<br>watching us online live this evening or<br>potentially watching us delayed in the<br>future but I note that her mother-in-law<br>is in the audience as well as her<br>husband emeritus professor Maurice Keefe<br>Murray it's fantastic to have you here<br>and their three daughters are here as<br>well Laura Carmel and Alicia now the<br>presence of family members at these<br>IPL's is such a clear signal of their<br>importance so it is fantastic to have<br>all of you here now in addition to these<br>special guests who are seated near the<br>front as I look out on the audience this<br>evening<br>I see staff and students from throughout<br>the university as well as members of the<br>wider Dunedin community who continue to<br>use these IPL's<br>as a part of their ongoing education so<br>to everyone who is here tonight know my<br>how to my welcome now the other thing<br>that I often say at the beginning of<br>these inaugural professorial lectures is<br>that the path to professor at the<br>University of Otago is not necessarily<br>an easy one<br>in order to be successful an applicant<br>for the rank of Professor must<br>demonstrate excellence in teaching in<br>research and in service to the<br>university and the wider community now<br>as you will undoubtedly learn through<br>her lecture this evening professor<br>Cephas an award-winning teacher and<br>she's an outstanding researcher she has<br>also provided exceptional service to the<br>department to the University and to the<br>wider research community so Sheila on<br>behalf of the University of Otago I<br>would like to warmly congratulate you on<br>your very well earned promotion to<br>Professor I will now call on the PVC of<br>Sciences Professor Richard Barker who<br>will tell us just a little bit more<br>about Sheila's path to Professor noreda<br>tena koe tota no koto tena tato katoa<br>Vice Chancellor tena quai deputy<br>vice-chancellors tena koe to Professor<br>Seif dinner Queen emeritus

professor Sheila's Keith<br>to give her inaugural professorial<br>lecture at University of Otago as<br>indicated by our vice-chancellor<br>professor Cephas one of our newer<br>professors at the University of Otago<br>having received the world deserved<br>promotion its position in February of<br>this year<br>professor Cephas born in Canada in<br>Northern Ontario in fact in a town<br>called Sudbury a reliable source at was<br>Sheila actually tells me it was the<br>nickel nickel capital of the world<br>at the time not sure what to do when she<br>left school but knowing she liked<br>science which was a good choice<br>she enrolled at the University of Guelph<br>which is known for its science program<br>it was there and the company of<br>influential peers<br>this included Marie Sheila discovered a<br>love for nutrition professor Seif<br>graduated BSC honours from the<br>University of Guelph in 1984 and then<br>worked in the department of nutrition<br>sciences at that University firstly as a<br>technician and then as a Teaching Fellow<br>during which time she completed her<br>master's degree it was our good fortune<br>that saw professor Seif the University<br>of Otago in 1989 as a member of our<br>department of human nutrition starting<br>as a half-time assistant lecturer before<br>being promoted to lecturer in 1997 the<br>in senior lecturer in 2006 going to full<br>time in 2008 promoted to associate<br>professor in 2014 and finally professor<br>this year so work through the full<br>spectrum of academic appointments which<br>is quite remarkable while employed as a<br>lecturer professor skee found time to<br>complete her PhD graduating in 2004 and<br>during this she looked at the iodine<br>status of vulnerable populations<br>infants pregnant woman those who are<br>nutritionally stressed and we'll hear a<br>bit more about that later<br>with teen book chapters and around 60<br>fully peer-reviewed publications<br>professor Seif as a productive<br>researcher and then reading through his<br>CV I was struck by how well connected<br>she is across the universities and I saw<br>publications that were jointly authored<br>by people from most of the departments<br>and the division of Sciences and and<br>Health Sciences her research focuses on<br>iodine and in particular the<br>consequences of a low level of iodine<br>prevalent and the New Zealand diet and<br>her research into iodine deficiency led<br>to iodine fortification and Britain so<br>we all get our iodine things to Sheila's<br>work with this expertise<br>professor Cephas sought after as an<br>adviser to government and other bodies<br>both New Zealand and Australia and<br>elsewhere she has the longest-serving<br>member of the New Zealand nutrition<br>society and has been an expert advisor<br>for several nutrition at national<br>nutrition surveys as alluded to by the<br>vice-chancellor professor Seif is<br>recognized for her outstanding<br>commitment as a teacher both in the<br>classroom and as a postgraduate<br>supervisor she has supervised more than<br>50 masters or PhD students and has also<br>found the time to supervise a number of<br>French exchange students she is an award<br>winner in 2009 she was the ous a<br>recipient of a top ten supervisor award<br>in 2015 and owe us a top ten teacher<br>award in 2016 was on the long list for<br>best teacher in you know in 2018 she won<br>a University of Otago excellence in<br>Teaching Award followed in 2018 by a New<br>Zealand tertiary teaching excellence<br>award an award of the highest<br>significance tonight we're going to hear<br>about her work on iodine deficiency that<br>spans more than two decades as well as<br>her thoughts on food literacy and its<br>role in the health of our people and our<br>planet please join me in welcoming<br>professor Sheila's Keefe<br>so I've got some props here and I see<br>that somebody oh there's a lot of people<br>there we are Thank You Ann Louise<br>somebody has brought some of the other<br>props that I was looking for it in the<br>last minute before I came along I've<br>also brought my goiter got the pink<br>Himalayan salt the iodized salt and all<br>the bits and pieces that I tend to have<br>I usually start my lectures by just<br>looking around usually for students to<br>see who I can see to pick on and ask<br>names so I see a lot of people here and<br>I can't Jack it would take me so long to<br>look but thank you I can see all of you<br>here and I'm really really very grateful<br>that did not only only only hope that<br>the first three rows were finished were<br>filled up so I am going to start my<br>lecture I thought I should start with<br>just a little image that shows the globe<br>I know that you know from Richards talk<br>that I was born in Canada and that we<br>travelled here in 1988 and I began<br>teaching at the University of Otago<br>part-time in 1989 thank you very much to<br>professor Mann for employing me at that<br>time I've put a couple of key dates here<br>which are important just so that you<br>have an idea of what's happening in that<br>kind of journey so 1996 when I began my<br>PhD 2004 when I finally finished it 2009<br>is an important date with regard to my<br>IDing research and then 2019 and what I<br>want you to note is that there is a<br>little green it's purposely green that<br>comes off somewhere kind of around 2011<br>2012 so when you're preparing one of<br>these lectures you kind of think about<br>all the people that are kind of helped<br>whoops all the people that have helped<br>you over the years and thinking back to<br>how it all started and you know the<br>journey in the whole process and where<br>it's ended up and one of<br>things of course is and we always think<br>about our parents and you mentioned my<br>mother who can't be here and who won't<br>say anything more about watching the<br>lecture but I think it's very unlikely<br>and my father who died so many years ago<br>but I think it's important maybe I'm<br>going to try and start with a Pepe ha<br>because Marie and I have been doing at<br>econo course and I saw Peter somewhere -<br>where is Peter oh there you are and he's<br>in our t-con of course so I feel even<br>more obligated to do that so please bear<br>cork our bell tamanna' core here on Tama<br>Huata<br>bhai ke we core Jeffrey toka papa<br>Cornell took a momma or Marie<br>tokoha wrong a tera Co Laura righto<br>Cole Carmel Co Alicia oku tamariki core<br>Gabriel takuma kupuna Co Keith toku Fano<br>Co Sheila Tokugawa noreda<br>tena koutou tena koutou tena raw Toto<br>khatola<br>so the title of my talk is balancing<br>food fact and fiction and so of course<br>it's going to have some nutritional<br>themes in it and I thought how am I<br>going to kind of introduce the talk and<br>move into my area of research which is<br>idean so I'm going to kind of give a<br>little bit of beginning and then we'll<br>move into idea and then we'll move out<br>so I thought let's talk about the<br>choices that people make when they get<br>up in the morning what do they have for<br>breakfast what do you decide to have for<br>breakfast well when I was in Canada<br>growing up it was very common for people<br>to have cereal I mean that's common in<br>New Zealand but it's particularly common<br>in New Zealand is a very usual breakfast<br>and Cheerios was one of my favorites so<br>there we have Cheerios in a in a bowl<br>with some milk but it's not the<br>breakfast I eat now well it's not the<br>breakfast I eat now is my family knows<br>is quite different ok this is the<br>breakfast I eat now an egg some<br>mushrooms some tomatoes a bit of rocket<br>on a piece of bread ok that's my<br>breakfast I've been eating that<br>breakfast for the last 12 years I know<br>it's a long time yes and so why what's<br>what's what's caused a change why do we<br>choose the foods that we eat to eat when<br>we make a simple decision just about<br>having breakfast I mean obviously it's<br>partly travel it could be there's all<br>sorts of things that that influence our<br>choice could be cost could be taste<br>could be our culture could be our<br>environment there's a variety different<br>things that have it influenced that but<br>of course we are also influenced by lots<br>of things around us our own knowledge<br>and hopefully as health professionals<br>some Kay and I work in the department of<br>human nutrition we're also also<br>influenced by nutrition and food<br>guidelines and I look at some of the<br>colleagues that are here in the<br>department and I know they've put a huge<br>amount of time here in the room looking<br>a huge amount of time into coming up<br>with food and nutrition guidelines so<br>New Zealand has a set of eating and<br>activity guidelines which are produced<br>by the Ministry of Health and which came<br>out in 2015 in a revised version and<br>these eating and activity guidelines<br>have a series of eating statements<br>activity statements as well as a body<br>weight statement<br>and I didn't I initially had all the<br>eating statements up but I don't think<br>you'd probably want to to read through<br>them with me and I think this particular<br>schematic which is produced by the New<br>Zealand Heart Foundation sort of really<br>summarizes those eating statements eat<br>most vegetables and fruit and vegetables<br>are on top of the fruit because we want<br>you to eat more vegetables and fruit eat<br>some grain foods and starchy vegetables<br>then we've got legumes fish seafood and<br>then meats at the end so those words are<br>actually placed in that order for a<br>particular reason okay milk yogurt and<br>cheese and then our healthy oils nuts<br>and seeds so that looks fairly<br>straightforward Canada of course has<br>come up I thought I'd better allude to<br>Canada a little bit it's come up with a<br>new revised a set of food guidelines and<br>they've bought this in this plate shape<br>which makes it a little bit easier for<br>people to visualize and again you all<br>probably most of you know this eat a<br>variety of healthy foods a day half of<br>your plate should be vegetables and<br>fruits and the fruits are small we've<br>got a quarter of the plate which are our<br>protein foods you can see there's not<br>much meat there make water your drink of<br>choice and then choose whole grain foods<br>okay and you can see on that plate<br>there's not a lot of white food not that<br>that's necessarily a terrible thing but<br>that is interesting just to think about<br>that the other thing that the Canadians<br>do it did this year is they they took<br>dairy products out as a food group okay<br>so they made a change that way so just<br>to be aware of that now this is all<br>about eating healthy foods and a healthy<br>diet but what about the planet so I'm<br>sure many people are aware that this<br>document came out is called food planet<br>health and this was produced by the eat<br>Lancet Commission and this is about a<br>healthy diet that's also been developed<br>by and is linked to sustainable food<br>system so it's a healthy diet and a<br>healthy planet so they go together and<br>since the kind of these kind of<br>guidelines and this report was launched<br>earlier this year there is repeated news<br>items that are on coming up all the time<br>because that's part of my lectures I try<br>to have kind of news clips that have<br>been coming on that show or suggest that<br>we should be reducing the amount<br>meat and dairy products in the New<br>Zealand diet or in all diets across the<br>world this the guidelines are very<br>similar<br>now of course whenever nutrition<br>information comes out like this and<br>these reports come out we always have to<br>hear the other side don't we we do we<br>hear the other side so yesterday when I<br>went to the supermarket a lot of things<br>happen at yesterday in the supermarket I<br>found these two magazines and of course<br>they both have nutrition often we see<br>these nutrition things so I'm going to<br>show you I bought them but I didn't need<br>to because I could have gone online I<br>will send the bill so this is the recent<br>one inside north and south new issue in<br>defense of meat and dairy so of course<br>we're going to have the reverse so the<br>in defense of meat dairy and then the<br>listener is maybe more if I've done a<br>psychology latest science on how to beat<br>your brains reaction to fat in sugar<br>okay so when we're deciding on the foods<br>we can eat we're also influenced<br>obviously by what's in the local media<br>and kind of magazines and things like<br>that however a lot of people actually<br>don't look at any of that they go onto<br>the web and they look on the web and<br>they just google things on Google and if<br>you were looking at salt okay you can<br>see how this is gonna move on if you're<br>looking at salt and you google that you<br>might come up with a website okay and<br>this is an example of one and I just<br>googled that and it's about different<br>types of salt so why is salt important<br>it's a really simple choice that we make<br>every day about what kind of salt we<br>might or might not put on our food so if<br>I have my breakfast here's my breakfast<br>could I put the pink Himalayan trendy<br>sea salt on there or should it be this<br>iodized white I die salt kind of the<br>boring stuff which choice should I make<br>and doesn't matter now every single<br>student I've ever taught well no okay<br>about this kind of salt okay because we<br>talked a lot about whether we should use<br>this salt or this salt saying that I<br>don't put either of those salts on my<br>on my breakfast because I put my spicy<br>Cholula which is salty enough ok sauce<br>which is from Mexico so don't worry I<br>still putting sodium on there ok so why<br>does it matter what choice we make about<br>the type of salt ok well that's because<br>this salt our white salt has iodine in<br>it and this salt this pink Himalayan<br>salt really doesn't have any idea in it<br>ok and that's important from a New<br>Zealand context because iodine is an<br>essential micronutrient that is found in<br>the soils in New Zealand that is found<br>in our foods that we need that the body<br>needs and we need iodine and very small<br>amounts to make something called thyroid<br>hormones I'm not going to get into a big<br>discussion about what thyroid hormones<br>do but they're very important one of the<br>key functions they do is they maintain<br>the body's metabolic rate and they're<br>also needed for normal growth and<br>development particularly for the brain<br>ok so just keep those in mind so what<br>happens when you get too little idean<br>well you develop goiter a lot of people<br>know that if you don't get enough i<br>didn't your diet you'll get a goiter ok<br>and if for those of people who are quite<br>young in the audience ok if you don't<br>know that much about goiter if you ask a<br>grandparent or a great grandparent<br>they'll tell you about good at<br>particularly if they grew up in New<br>Zealand and what is a goiter well a<br>goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid<br>gland ok so when you don't get enough<br>iodine in your in your diet the thyroid<br>gland picks that up and decides that it<br>is going to become a much more efficient<br>organ at capturing the amount of iodine<br>that comes into the diet ok and it gets<br>a little bit larger in it enlarges okay<br>and so also make sure that there's<br>enough thyroid hormones that get into<br>the blood okay so we get this<br>enlargement at the base of the neck okay<br>but there's a lot of other things that<br>happen as well not just Gorder so<br>there's a range of consequences and the<br>term that is used to describe the range<br>of consequences is something called<br>idean deficiency disorders or idd now<br>this term was first described by<br>Professor basil<br>Hetzel and this is a great picture a<br>basel with Christine Thompson he came to<br>visit our Department of Human Nutrition<br>and you can see that Christine was also<br>and Christine unfortunate think she's<br>here she said she's got very very bad<br>back so she's literally flat on her back<br>and so she wasn't able to come but she's<br>done a lot of work of course in trace<br>elements in New Zealand particularly on<br>selenium and Heidi and professor Hetzel<br>has done he did some key studies looking<br>at iodine he was from Adelaide he's died<br>about four or five years ago but he did<br>some studies in Papua New Guinea looking<br>at iodine and pregnant women and so he<br>coined the term iodine deficiency<br>disorders because people are always just<br>thinking about goiter so what I want to<br>describe to you with regard to iodine is<br>that you have increasing levels of<br>severity with IDing you can have mild<br>IDs efficiency moderate and severe<br>iodine deficiency okay and a series of<br>things happen as we go from mild to<br>moderate to severe so as we get less and<br>less IDing in the diet the number of<br>people who have a goiter increases okay<br>so maybe and mild iodine deficiency<br>there might be five or ten percent but<br>as we become more severe that kind of<br>goes up to maybe 20 30 40 percent of the<br>population another thing that happens is<br>remember I said that I Dean was very<br>important for brain development we get<br>some impaired motor and mental abilities<br>are affected and then eventually when<br>you get quite low so moderate to severe<br>iding deficiency you get what's called<br>hypothyroidism so this is when your<br>thyroid hormones drop below kind of the<br>normal range now one thing I just want<br>to point out is because you don't get<br>changes in your blood okay until sort of<br>later on we have to use other ways of<br>working out idean status and whether<br>people are getting enough iodine<br>now if a woman okay is living in an area<br>with very low amounts of iodine in the<br>diet okay and so she's got severe iding<br>deficiency doesn't happen to every and<br>she gets pregnant doesn't happen to<br>every pregnant woman she may have a baby<br>who is a okay and how so here is<br>a picture I can see the consistency<br>Kirsten there<br>they've seen all these pictures these<br>are some of the lectures that I give so<br>here's a picture of four brothers okay<br>the two brothers in the middle okay are<br>both cretinous and the two brothers on<br>either side are not credence and the<br>difference between the brothers is that<br>their mother was obviously very severely<br>iodine deficient when she was pregnant<br>and gave birth to these and<br>cretinous have very low IQ about 30 okay<br>they're often stunted they may be deaf<br>mute they may have a squint okay and<br>these are all irreversible symptoms and<br>then their mother was given a bolus dose<br>a big dose of iodine again when she was<br>pregnant before she had these two other<br>brothers and they're perfectly fine okay<br>so that just shows you that the the<br>dramatic effect of one simple nutrient<br>that can have on health particularly<br>during pregnancy the other good thing<br>about this picture is you can see that<br>these four brothers are standing in<br>front of a pile of pink Himalayan salt<br>so it's kind of all it kind of comes<br>together okay so what about New Zealand<br>now I've got this picture here of this<br>MALDI woman with a very large goiter and<br>I do have to say that we don't know for<br>a hundred percent whether this woman has<br>a goiter because of iodine deficiency or<br>not because other things can cause a<br>goiter<br>and I've got a neurologist I can see<br>professor man over there looking at me<br>but other things can cause greater than<br>just iodine deficiency and in looking at<br>the diets<br>particularly diets of Maori people kind<br>of wore in this region I would be<br>suspicious to think that they would<br>actually develop goiter so and maybe<br>this woman lived quite inland okay maybe<br>up in the north on it I'm not sure but<br>it does sort of show you that<br>historically we've had problems with<br>iodine and iodine deficiency in New<br>Zealand and that's because New Zealand<br>is sort of unique but not this happens<br>in lots of other parts of the world we<br>have low levels of many trace elements<br>in our soil and some of the examples of<br>some are IID selenium which Christine<br>Thompson's did a lot of work on in<br>fluoride okay so those are quite low and<br>that's important to know because if we<br>are getting low levels of these in our<br>soils they're made<br>low levels in our diet in our foods and<br>there may be some adverse health<br>consequences that we have to check and<br>make sure that we address in a<br>population particularly at a government<br>level so the typical and I use that in<br>brackets the typical New Zealand diet<br>okay<br>historically I had I say is probably<br>should say was low in ID okay<br>historically it was low in IDing the<br>foods that are the richest source of<br>iodine are foods from the ocean sea<br>wheat New Zealanders don't eat much<br>seaweed okay fish and shellfish and we<br>do eat those but not enough of those and<br>probably infrequently often particularly<br>fish due to cost other foods that are<br>moderate sources of iodine are dairy<br>products and eggs and poor sources of<br>iodine are your vegetables and fruits<br>okay so just to keep that in mind okay<br>so a little bit about the history of<br>iodine in New Zealand so it's not super<br>technical slide but I'll just going to<br>go through this so I don't know if you<br>probably may not remember but it is<br>difficult to do a blood test to work out<br>whether your mod ly IDing deficient or<br>even moderately iodine deficient for<br>some nutrients we can just do a blood<br>test<br>you know vitamin D is not too bad and<br>and iron is pretty good but for iodine<br>and some other things like silly sodium<br>we can't just do a blood test it's not<br>that easy for those kind of nutrients<br>potassium iodine sodium what we do is we<br>measure the amount of iodine that's<br>excreted in the urine about 90% of what<br>you eat gets excreted into the urine<br>okay so that's a good indirect way of<br>working out how much iodine is in the<br>diet okay so what you can see here from<br>this figure is in the night early 1900s<br>we were well below or a level of iodine<br>in our urine was well below that red<br>line<br>okay now that red line is where we want<br>to be and I always say to the students<br>it's such an easy number to remember<br>because it's a hundred okay we want to<br>be above 100 micrograms per liter and<br>what you can see is that we are quite<br>low back in the 1900s and that was work<br>that was done by people at the<br>University<br>toggle in the medical school so they<br>just some some work on that and that was<br>happening around the world in 1939 the<br>government introduced iodized salt now<br>that I'd I saw that they introduced was<br>really for use at the table and in<br>cooking okay the iodine salt could have<br>been used in kind of processed foods<br>like tinned tomatoes and things like<br>that but it wasn't it was just used<br>really at the table so at home by women<br>or men who were cooking and not used in<br>other food products so just keep that in<br>mind but what it was introduced in 1939<br>in New Zealand at a level about 50 parts<br>per billion per million by the 1950s the<br>number of people who had Gorder which<br>was about maybe somewhere between 10 and<br>30% dropped down to less than 1% by the<br>1950s so it was very effective okay and<br>then in the 1960s in the 1960s we had<br>another increase in iodine coming into<br>the diet and that's because I'm sure you<br>know that item is a disinfectant okay<br>you can put it on your skin and<br>disinfectant but so what happened is the<br>dairy industry started using an iodine<br>containing solution as a disinfectant<br>and that contaminated now that sounds<br>very not good but in fact it was a good<br>thing that contaminated milk products<br>and as a result the amount of iodine<br>went up in milk products okay so we got<br>two sources during that time of IDing<br>coming into our diet we had from the I<br>died salt and from our milk products<br>okay so we were went from deficiency to<br>sufficiency but then something happened<br>we went down to deficiency again and how<br>did how did we find out about this well<br>professor Christine Thompson was doing<br>study looking at selenium and she<br>decided that she'd measured the amount<br>of iodine in the urine samples that<br>they've done and she found that they<br>were low and that was the beginning of a<br>whole lot of research which involved me<br>professor Gibson as well as others in<br>the department looking at the idea<br>status of New Zealanders from the 1990s<br>onward so I put this picture back up<br>okay so now we're kind of around<br>1996 okay so just to keep that in mind<br>that's when I started my PhD so my PhD<br>was as Richard said titled the ion<br>iodine status of vulnerable groups of<br>the population and looked at a very<br>small study of pregnant women and their<br>newborn infants at toddlers and then at<br>children and the children study looked<br>at the iodine status of children living<br>in Dunedin in Wellington and we found<br>about one in ten children had Gorder at<br>that time okay so this was work this my<br>two supervisors marvelous supervisors<br>were Professor Christine Thompson and<br>professor Rosalyn Gibson and I'm very<br>thankful that I had had a great<br>supervision and I was able to finish I<br>did it part-time while working part-time<br>it takes some time they were very<br>patient so when I graduated in 2004<br>continued to do with colleague studies<br>and so I'm just gonna talk to you about<br>a few little studies that we did that<br>are particularly I think they were quite<br>fun I really like these fun studies so<br>one of them was this study this was done<br>in kind of 2005 2006 we have Amy<br>Pettigrew Porter there with the the pink<br>top she was a dietitian who came back to<br>do a masters of science and beside her<br>is Stephanie she's an ultra scenographer<br>and we got this van called the Thyra<br>'mobile which i think is a really cool<br>name okay and then we had to come up<br>with this kind of acronym so we came up<br>with the trip study because basically we<br>took the thyroid beale and amy drove it<br>all the way from auckland all the way<br>down to Dunedin okay the pharma Beale is<br>equipped with a fridge so we can store a<br>blood sample a little small blood sample<br>and a urine sample and ultra also has an<br>ultrasound machine in it so that we were<br>able to sort of assess the iodine status<br>in this case we looked at iodine status<br>of pregnant women all the way down the<br>country it wasn't a big study but it was<br>a quite a fun study and you'll know it's<br>hard to tell that they're in front of<br>two big piles of salt<br>okay so again yeah I'll just keep that<br>in mind so this is the paper took some<br>time to publish but this is a paper that<br>was finally published and it says our<br>pregnant women<br>in New Zealand IDing deficient and yes<br>they were they were all iodine deficient<br>so let's just keep that in mind now in<br>2002 the government did a national<br>children's nutrition survey and iodine<br>was included in this survey and this<br>survey found pretty much what we had<br>found in a smaller study as part of our<br>part of my PhD but this was a survey of<br>children from much many more places<br>throughout New Zealand than just the<br>study that I did which was just innate<br>in the Wellington seeing that found<br>exactly the same thing ok so here what<br>you can see were a bit hard to see is<br>they've gone on the y-axis we've got the<br>urinary iodine concentration it's in<br>micrograms per deciliter that's why it<br>says seven point five and seven and six<br>point five so if you multiply by ten<br>you'll get it back up to those other<br>numbers we were talking about and where<br>we want to be is ten micrograms so that<br>would be at the top of the slide<br>okay and what you can see here is<br>regardless of whether we group the<br>children either by age okay or by<br>ethnicity all the children had mild<br>iodine deficiency okay so that was kind<br>of confirmation that mild iodine<br>deficiency had reached New Zealand then<br>in 2008 in 2009 okay there was another<br>nutrition survey this was called the<br>adult nutrition survey and in adults 15<br>years and over again just look at what's<br>in the boxes you can see that we're at<br>55 this time it's in micrograms per<br>liter and 50 and what this is showing is<br>again that New Zealand adults across the<br>country were also iodine deficient so we<br>pretty much confirmed I'm sure I've<br>convinced you that idean deficiency was<br>prevalent throughout the throughout the<br>country so we've gone from deficiency to<br>sufficiency the deficiency but why why<br>did this happen why did we have a reamer<br>gence of mild iodine deficiency well<br>there's a few things first of all<br>remember that I said that these iodized<br>salt wasn't really used in any processed<br>food products okay and so probably what<br>happened between the early 1900s up<br>until the kind of 1990s and be<br>is that people started using or eating a<br>lot more processed food okay because<br>people were making less food in the home<br>and as a result because Malta that<br>processed food at the time contained<br>non-iodized salt that was a bit of a<br>drop the other thing is of course more<br>people were using this pink Himalayan<br>salt which doesn't contain or it<br>contains negligible amounts of ID<br>another thing was the dairy industry<br>stopped using those IDing containing<br>disinfectants so that dropped the i-beam<br>in the dairy products and then finally<br>of course we have our quite a few public<br>health physicians in the room who said<br>that we needed to use less salt because<br>of it's linked with hypertension and<br>Stroke so we think that kind of<br>combination of factors resulted in the<br>re-emergence of iodine deficiency in the<br>1990s<br>okay so I've convinced you as I said<br>that we had idean deficiency mild in<br>every group studied in New Zealand now I<br>just want to make sure you're very clear<br>that we've never seen ISM in New<br>Zealand okay so we know we don't have<br>severe iodine deficiency we've never had<br>a problem with cretton ism so we're<br>looking more along that edge okay so<br>what you have a little bit of two little<br>iding in urine does that actually mean<br>anything so the next kind of phase of<br>research was to look at the implications<br>of not getting enough iodine in your<br>diet what are the implications what are<br>the effects particularly on the brain so<br>one of the studies that we did again I'm<br>just picking a couple of key interesting<br>studies it's called from something<br>called the Fink project the think<br>project was the second randomized<br>control trial that I undertook and I<br>really love randomized controlled trials<br>they're one of my favorite kinds of<br>research designs and in this randomized<br>control trial we had two masters<br>students Meredith Petty and Rosie Gordon<br>and then we also used head Rockman from<br>psychology to give us some help with<br>picking out these kind of tests that we<br>were going to use and we we recruited<br>children living in Denis North<br>intermediate and at Val McHugh and<br>intermediate and I was pretty sure they<br>were all iodine deficient and they were<br>okay as a group and then what we do in a<br>randomized control trial is we randomly<br>put half into a placebo group and half<br>into a treatment group and so these<br>children were given and that's where I<br>got my props these pills okay and I can<br>tell you you won't be able to tell the<br>difference between the placebo pills or<br>the or the ID pills because that's the<br>whole point of a randomized control<br>trial so in this study we recruited the<br>children into the study we I should say<br>Rosie and and Meredith the most most if<br>not all of the work and we took a urine<br>sample from the children they did a<br>finger prick blood sample and then with<br>Ted's advice we looked at four different<br>kind of tests of cognition and those<br>tests of cognition are part of the IQ a<br>develop or working out children's IQ but<br>we did not do the full range so we<br>cannot make any comments about IQ and I<br>just thought I'd talk about one study<br>probably Kylie you're very familiar with<br>these tests one of them is called<br>picture concepts so here is this is our<br>brochure for trying to recruit the<br>children and this is one of the tests so<br>in picture concepts you have rows of<br>pictures and then the children have to<br>match a picture in the bottom row with a<br>picture in the top row by concept so<br>it's relatively straightforward I think<br>this one I find easy okay as they go<br>along they're actually quite difficult<br>and I couldn't do them even though<br>they're for children so this one is easy<br>this is this is a torch in a lamp okay<br>so that's just an example of some of the<br>kind of tests that we did so what did we<br>find so we did four only four tests<br>because Ted thought that they would be<br>the best test to respond to an increase<br>in iodine and this is what you can see<br>here is the children did better on all<br>of the tests okay because they're all on<br>the right-hand side particularly better<br>in picture concepts and matric reasoning<br>and when you put all the tests together<br>okay we get an overall improvement in<br>cognitive score so this tells us that<br>giving mildly iodine deficient children<br>a little bit of extra writing did seem<br>to in the short-term improve<br>their cognition and we wrote this up in<br>the American Journal of Clinical<br>Nutrition and it's been viewed as sort<br>of a landmark study so that's<br>interesting but of course we didn't<br>follow the children we don't know what<br>happened to them after they stopped and<br>that is unfortunately one of the kind of<br>downsides about wish we had had to<br>continue to follow them it would have<br>been interesting to see of course when<br>does the brain develop the most in<br>pregnancy okay so if we're seeing some<br>sort of effect in intermediate aged<br>children it would be I thought it would<br>be very good to do a randomized control<br>trial in pregnant women and I really<br>wanted to do a randomized control trial<br>in pregnant women and this is from the<br>thyroid Foundation of Australia it says<br>Get Smart protect your baby's brain<br>remember I said what the final 'mobile<br>study most pregnant women that we had<br>measured had quite low lighting cities<br>so what was you know interested to look<br>at that it was difficult at that time to<br>get enough funds we got a little bit of<br>money from the University of Otago but<br>er not enough to do the trial here we<br>went to India we tried to do the trial<br>there but we didn't get epical approval<br>I managed to to work with some people in<br>Adelaide murmuring ah creedy's and Joe<br>Xu and they got some money from NHMRC to<br>do a randomized control trial but when<br>we were just about to start that study<br>we also lost the ability to continue<br>because you can see that ethically maybe<br>it's a little bit tricky to do this kind<br>of study and in fact that has been a<br>problem around the world to get approval<br>to do a randomized control trial giving<br>women placebo which has got no ID in a<br>treatment group so even though we've got<br>this money from the Australian<br>Government we couldn't do an RCT but we<br>turn that into a cohort study and so<br>this was just finally published it's<br>long time we recruited I think seven or<br>eight hundred pregnant women and<br>followed them through<br>up until their children were 18 months<br>and so this paper has finally been<br>published and looks at the Association<br>so underlying that between maternal<br>iodine intake and pregnancy and child<br>neuro develop at 18<br>months and this is a figure I thought<br>this was a sort of simplest figure to<br>put up is from the supplementary<br>information for this particular paper<br>and so what you can see here is we have<br>the cognitive composite score which is<br>on the y-axis and along the x axis we<br>have pregnancy iodine intake and what I<br>want you to see is it's so common with<br>lots of nutrients that we have a sweet<br>spot right in the middle so somewhere<br>between 200 to 400 micrograms of iodine<br>we have the highest cognitive score if<br>you have too much ID the cognitive score<br>that means it's worse and if you have<br>too little it's worse okay so there's<br>been a couple of these cohort studies<br>that have shown this same kind of<br>relationship but we can't really be<br>definitive until we do a randomized<br>control trials so I just want to make<br>sure that we're clear about that and<br>they are doing such a trial now in<br>Sweden and they've tried many times to<br>get money to do it in the UK but I not<br>sure how far that's gonna reviewed a lot<br>of grants from the UK suggesting we do<br>that okay so this is an article that was<br>published by three news and 2009 so I'm<br>just trying to think about going back to<br>2009 I did not suggest the title of that<br>article I Dean deficiency dumbing down a<br>generation of New Zealand children so I<br>don't know if I should say this but<br>between the nine early 1990s up until<br>2009 we had some problems with iodine in<br>the New Zealand diet and I often say to<br>the students okay and I say when were<br>you born but we know lots of things at<br>that cognition than just one nutrient so<br>family dynamics genetics environment<br>schooling lots of things okay so 2009 is<br>important year because a lot of the work<br>that we had done with colleagues in the<br>Department of Human Nutrition finally<br>came to fruition and in 2009 the bakers<br>were told that they needed to put I'd i<br>salt in bread okay so that why do we<br>pick something like<br>because it's a staple food salt is a<br>staple food most people eat bread most<br>people used to eat bread okay at the<br>time most people ate bread okay and it<br>looked like it was a good food to add<br>some I'd i salt too because lots of<br>people would then like children and<br>adults and elderly would all increase<br>their iodine intake saying that the<br>World Health Organization does recommend<br>that I die salt is put into every<br>processed food okay but New Zealand took<br>a more conservative approach and decided<br>just to put it into bread I say so just<br>sort of keep that in mind so I guess the<br>question is okay has it worked okay so<br>after 2009 I've been involved again with<br>colleagues and number of students<br>looking at the effect of increased<br>iding coming for bread in particular<br>what we call post fortification okay so<br>there's a picture of Brier she's at one<br>of the schools up in auckland collecting<br>a urine sample you know they don't<br>really want to do it but then they kind<br>of get into it after a while<br>understandably he's smiling there and<br>this is taken from the paper so it's not<br>a great reproduction but what I want to<br>point out to you is if we look at the<br>median urinary iodine concentration okay<br>what you can see is in the children's<br>nutrition survey it was 68 then in a<br>small city we did in 2011 it was a<br>hundred and thirteen and then in the<br>study that Breyer was involved when<br>which is this study it was 116 and we<br>want to be above 100 so it has seemed to<br>work and there's been other studies done<br>by myself other people from around New<br>Zealand as well as by the Ministry of<br>Primary Industries showing that there<br>has been an improvement in iodine status<br>it's not perfect but it has work and<br>it's just sort of above that so we've<br>gone from deficiency to sufficiency to<br>deficiency back up to sufficiency so<br>research over career finished<br>what's next for ID well how much added<br>salt do we actually use do we actually<br>need ID i salt anymore okay so this is<br>something we've got there she is right<br>in the middle and seen weighing from<br>Singapore has just arrived and she's<br>going to be using a method to look at<br>added salt both at the table and in<br>cooking and that will tell us whether we<br>with Rachel McClain whether we how much<br>sodium we're getting from that salt and<br>how much iodine we're getting and also<br>because I've spent a lot of time<br>collecting urine samples and working<br>with children in particular I have and<br>of course I Dean is you know continuing<br>down and we've had a success story with<br>iodine I've now moved into fluoride or<br>fluorine okay<br>yeah and that's been interesting because<br>that kind of ties into a little bit<br>about nutrition misinformation no<br>surprise and food literacy which I'll<br>talk about more okay so here we go now<br>here I have that little green okay that<br>little green and it's purposeful that<br>it's green okay because this is getting<br>into sustainability and nutrition and<br>sustainable diets now to be honest I<br>have to be honest because you've got<br>family members here and you know you<br>just can't you know I'm not the most<br>sustainable person okay I do try to try<br>and they do they do have to take a lot<br>of flack for me about things and poor<br>Bailey not to take a lot of flack<br>because I said look they're ordering<br>these things afterwards I said we don't<br>want any food waste okay we can't have<br>any food waste so let's not order as<br>much okay and she said people will eat<br>everything so you must eat everything<br>okay so I'm gonna talk very briefly<br>about sustainability okay in four<br>different topic areas and then then I'll<br>be I'll be finished so first of all I<br>want to talk about work at the<br>University of Otago work in the food<br>supply chain with primary school<br>children and then finally with parents<br>so at the University of Otago so I can<br>see Kerry he's up there and this is<br>really work that was initiated by Kerry<br>Shepherd in Ag DC and he got a very<br>multidisciplinary group of people<br>together to look at the Graduate<br>attributes that we have at the<br>University of Otago<br>and one of those attributes is<br>environmental literacy okay and this is<br>defined as a basic understanding of the<br>principles that govern natural systems<br>the effects of human activity on these<br>systems and the cultures and economies<br>that interact with those systems so I<br>was very interested in environmental<br>literacy we get a number of different<br>studies collaborative with people from<br>tourism from surveying from marketing<br>from food science from math and stats<br>zoology a whole range of different<br>different areas and we Carey was very<br>much overseeing that looking at whether<br>there was a change in students in<br>environmental literacy over the time<br>they were at university I was<br>particularly interested in human<br>nutrition students in that link with<br>sustainable diets and we introduced a<br>module teaching sustainable nutrition<br>and aspects about sustainable diets to<br>nutrition students and then we evaluated<br>that and I can see Sarah Marie's up at<br>the back and Sarah Marie Ennis who also<br>has a degree in psychology and human<br>nutrition wrote up a fabulous paper<br>called greeting the curriculum to foster<br>environmental literacy and tertiary<br>students studying human nutrition and<br>this was a I think you know it just kind<br>of shows you that hopefully by coming to<br>university students do learn some things<br>possibly take away some of this and that<br>may change behavior when they leave so<br>that's one aspect just want to talk<br>about briefly we've written lots of<br>other different papers which carrie has<br>overseen the next area is the food<br>supply chain so the person who's really<br>kind of tagged on is Miranda so<br>Miranda's right in front of me associate<br>professor from food science and it's<br>mostly been doing stuff on food waste<br>and Miranda is the expert I've just kind<br>of tagged on there with more more<br>recently Miranda has been involved in<br>this national food waste prevention<br>product project which is a partnership<br>between the waste men's behavior change<br>sector group and the University of Otago<br>okay and so what the project is doing is<br>aiming to quantify food waste so I'm<br>sure most of you know that about thirty<br>percent of food is wasted globally okay<br>and it's interesting to know where<br>that's happening along the food supply<br>chain there's been a number of projects<br>that have taken part household food<br>waste has been done that was done in<br>2013 and some of you may have seen those<br>infographics cafe and restaurant food<br>waste was done in 2018 and supermarket<br>food waste is where I sort of got<br>involved particularly with a student<br>that we Co supervised Francesca Goodman<br>Smith so here is a picture okay<br>there's a great picture now<br>unfortunately can't see Miranda because<br>my brand is the one who took the picture<br>we did have a ball that afternoon<br>measuring all this rotten not too rotten<br>vegetable isn't trying to work it out<br>and stuff it was quite good fun that was<br>just the pilot and then Francesca went<br>across New Zealand and measured the<br>amount of food that was waste it's a<br>fairly small study amount of food that<br>was wasted at different supermarkets<br>around New Zealand and what did she find<br>well I can tell you right now that pigs<br>in New Zealand are very well fed so just<br>to let you know that's where a lot about<br>50% of the retail supermarket food waste<br>is going to the pig farmer but what<br>about the quantity okay so the total<br>food waste per atom per annum these are<br>just estimates okay for at the<br>supermarket is about fourteen thousand<br>tonnes and household is a hundred and<br>twenty two thousand five hundred tonnes<br>so a lot more at the house that people<br>really are very top on supermarkets okay<br>and if we look at that per capita again<br>it's a rough estimate it's about three<br>kilograms per person per year okay<br>compared to ten times more so most of<br>the waste is happening at the hole okay<br>supermarkets let's let's not be too hard<br>because when they throw away food<br>they're throwing away money so this has<br>been written up and we haven't heard yet<br>have we Miranda we've been waiting a<br>really long time for this we're um<br>fingers crossed right probably shouldn't<br>put it up there but as I put it up there<br>okay it's under review it's gone through<br>I think it'll be fine food ways through<br>the supply chain so Francesca produced<br>this diagram and we've looked at the<br>distribution and retail in her study and<br>now the next step is we're going to look<br>at post harvest or crop loss okay so<br>this with what another study student<br>that we're Co supervising and she's<br>going to be looking doing a little kind<br>of a trial of methods in December<br>looking at Tomatoes okay and then she'll<br>be looking and measuring that in New<br>Zealand in next year so that's kind of<br>the next step so that's food supply in<br>the chain<br>what about primary school children so<br>primary school children is an<br>interesting area having worked in<br>nutrition for 20 years and you can kind<br>of glean this from what I've been saying<br>yes there's a lot of nutrition<br>misinformation and sometimes it is a<br>challenge to we don't want to say if I<br>want to use the word convinced to change<br>adults perception about foods and diets<br>okay it's hard to change behavior<br>Caroline you're doing that course maybe<br>you've got more success hopefully it<br>changing people's behavior but it is<br>difficult okay people have particular<br>ideas and it is difficult to to sort of<br>inform people about the science so I was<br>thinking about that kind of got a bit<br>discouraging after 1020 years working in<br>nutrition to think that you know as as<br>much as I know or anyone knows in this<br>room about nutrition that people are not<br>always perhaps all that receptive so my<br>thought was perhaps we need to go back<br>okay we adults are fine they can<br>continue on let's go to school children<br>let's work within the school system so<br>that led to some more<br>looking at food literacy so food<br>literacy where is Laura there she is<br>food Lois is the knowledge skills<br>attitudes and behaviors that are needed<br>to have a diet that is environmentally<br>sustainable and conducive to health so<br>food literacy is knowing something about<br>food how it's grown what's in it how to<br>use it so that you can have a healthy<br>diet and make choices okay but also it<br>does have an environmental aspect so it<br>kind of covers everything and obviously<br>if we improve food literacy particularly<br>in anybody okay cuz I I would say that<br>on the whole a lot of people in the<br>public are not particularly food<br>literate but if we can improve food<br>literacy across the scope of<br>particularly in school children improve<br>food choices that should improve health<br>so but how do you measure food literacy<br>so we've come up with a very I would say<br>a little bit of a rough tool it's a<br>survey that was designed by Theresa<br>O'Sullivan in 1919-20 2014 and what this<br>involves is an online questionnaire okay<br>for a nine to eleven year old children<br>and it has three different sections the<br>first sections on food origins so how<br>food is grown it's a bunch of<br>multiple-choice questions but often with<br>pictures so it's quite child friendly<br>and it asks questions the first section<br>asked questions about how food is grown<br>seasonality that kind of thing the next<br>session is of on section is on nutrition<br>knowledge so you know how many servings<br>do we need of different foods about<br>nutrients things like that which is<br>typically what we used to assess not so<br>broad and then the last section is on<br>food skills like you know how do we<br>store our food how do we cook food that<br>kind of thing okay and this<br>questionnaire there's an example this is<br>from Laura who is an MSC student who<br>worked on this project is one example of<br>a question that the student that the<br>children would have to answer so I'm<br>hoping probably shouldn't have put the<br>little ticks up<br>I'm hoping that you all really could<br>answer that question select all the<br>foods that count towards your 5 plus a<br>day<br>canned peaches and apple frozen peas not<br>hot chips and not raises okay and<br>there's a series of questions like that<br>so we have used this food literacy<br>questionnaire okay - and Laura was Laura<br>is the one who did it with four masters<br>of Dietetic students to actually get a<br>baseline value for food literacy in New<br>Zealand children living in Auckland<br>Wellington and Christchurch and their<br>mean score this was work was done with<br>Murray is 68 percent so 68 out of 100<br>they did slightly better in food origins<br>a little worse than the nutrition<br>knowledge and then they did okay in the<br>food skills this gives us a baseline<br>because now we want to go out or I'd<br>like to go out and use this online food<br>online food literacy questionnaire to<br>assess the impact or the improvement in<br>food literacy in school children where<br>they're introducing school garden<br>programs and I'm currently working with<br>the garden to table trust which is a<br>registered charity that is about<br>establishing school gardens at schools<br>and then we're going to use that<br>particular tool to measure their food<br>literacy before and after the<br>introduction of the garden to table<br>where they do at kind of a garden and<br>then they they grow things and they they<br>harvest it and they cook it and then<br>they eat it together so hopefully we can<br>see an improvement and that the whole<br>point of doing that is so that the<br>garden to table trust can hopefully and<br>the government will and will inform the<br>the government the Ministry of Education<br>to put some money here into this area<br>because right now there's not a lot of<br>money going into this aspect of<br>Education so finally just about finished<br>the last bit parents so this is very new<br>where's Emily so there she's up there<br>she knows you must know this is coming<br>so and Louise Heath okay this is with<br>Ann Louise got HRC grant earlier this<br>year looking at baby led weaning one<br>aspect of that application that's caught<br>a lot of attention is baby food pouches<br>and thank you and Louise somebody must<br>have brought these because I couldn't<br>find them when I<br>we've got these baby food pouches have<br>you seen these before okay so the baby<br>food pouches are interesting and branded<br>myself in an Louise<br>we have where's Maddie I saw her<br>somewhere much oh there you are<br>okay there's Maddie there we've got<br>someone who's going to be looking at the<br>baby food pouches initially we're just<br>interested in the kind of sustainability<br>of this kind of single-use packaging<br>okay but you can see for parents okay<br>that the only organic is a little that's<br>good that I got the same ones that's<br>good<br>the only organic it's gonna have a bit<br>of a you know it looks like it will be<br>super healthy but then we've got the<br>packaging and everything so we're going<br>to be looking at that so it's kind of an<br>interesting area and these I went to the<br>supermarket as I said yesterday and at<br>fresh choice I would say probably I<br>don't know most of the shelves were<br>these this is how most of the foods are<br>being sold okay<br>and this is relevant particularly for my<br>little grandson Gabriel I know he's cute<br>this is at Allen's bi2 put him up there<br>it's so gorgeous<br>and so that kind of ends my talk but not<br>before I say something which is about<br>what I'm wearing okay so you know when<br>you give me know I know it's a feminine<br>thing you know what should I wear should<br>I buy a new dress and my daughters would<br>say no but in fact earlier this year<br>they gave me this beautiful Jersey okay<br>and this Jersey is all about single-use<br>can you see the pattern single-use<br>plastics and its effect on the<br>environment so I really thought it was a<br>perfect thing to wear today okay so that<br>is the end I've gone from 1989 all the<br>way through to 2019 I'm thinking<br>probably gone over my 45 minutes and I<br>just wanted to have a couple of last<br>slides of people who I particularly like<br>to thank hopefully you see yourselves in<br>their supervisors colleagues who have<br>helped me and supported me in particular<br>for various different ways throughout<br>the last 30 years the person who's<br>probably helped me the most is my<br>husband Marie that's why he gets the<br>biggest picture because he's really been<br>right from the beginning to the end okay<br>so he's<br>tremendously maybe you could also have a<br>look at the slide okay if you'd like to<br>see that for those of you who are not<br>sure whether you should replace butter<br>with a polyunsaturated vegetable oils<br>just have a look at that slide and maybe<br>talk to him later there's also so many<br>other people that I like to thank and of<br>course when you're doing this you walk<br>by today I walk by got them all forgot<br>that so I've got a whole range of other<br>staff Kate beraud who's read so many of<br>my grants Teaching Fellows which could<br>fill the whole page Clinton<br>statisticians technical staff<br>administrative staff and then at the end<br>I've got megan marie and pam those are<br>the cleaners you know what I don't even<br>know their last names and I thought that<br>it's not good but anyways they they have<br>been there and they're always there at<br>night my international collaborators<br>okay from both Australia New Zealand and<br>abroad and finally the best for last<br>everybody I don't have everybody here<br>and I don't have all the students here<br>but really it's all for the students I<br>Chioda my name is Janice Murray I'm the<br>deputy pro vice-chancellor for the<br>Division of Sciences and it is my<br>distinct pleasure to say thank you to<br>Sheila for a fascinating and informative<br>talk that she's presented to us today<br>Sheila I think it's as I was sitting<br>there I was reminded of the value of<br>these professora lectures and they<br>remind us each and every time I think of<br>the significant contribution that our<br>top researchers at the university make<br>to not only their own field and the area<br>of which within which they're working in<br>the university but to the to the greater<br>community and to the benefit of all and<br>your work on iodine and your now work on<br>sustainability is a testament to that<br>contribution that many of our<br>researchers do make at the University so<br>thank you very much for that I also<br>promised Sheila I'd be very short on the<br>thanks because it's important that we<br>have opportunity to retreat to the staff<br>Club at the University where we I would<br>invite you all to come and have a little<br>bit of refreshment and plenty of<br>conversation with Sheila she stole my<br>line I was going to say things like I'm<br>sure there's iodine and the salt over<br>there and we will do our utmost to eat<br>every nibble that's being provided so as<br>to minimize any food wastage whatsoever<br>what remains for me is to present you<br>Sheila with a small token of<br>appreciation of University this is to<br>thank you and recognize your significant<br>promotion to Professor it's well<br>deserved as Harley and indicated and all<br>the best</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
