He gained his PhD in Motor Learning at Manchester Metropolitan University in 2000. He worked at Edinburgh University before moving to Otago in 2003. The processes by which humans learn to move skilfully is the central theme for his research. Chris is passionate about movement and he uses models from sport and physical activity to explain skill acquisition. His research outputs cover a broad range of topics including the assessment of movement competence in children, individual differences, movement variability, and perceptual skill. <br><br><br>Monday,

Adama<br>Turner Cotto Tenneco tow<br>tena tato katoa good evening everyone my<br>name is Harlan Haines and I have the<br>great privilege of being the vice<br>chancellor here at the university of<br>otago and it is my pleasure to welcome<br>each and every one of you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>professor chris button these lectures<br>are always a time of celebration for us<br>here at the university because it gives<br>us all the opportunity to take just an<br>hour out of our incredibly busy schedule<br>to just really sit and listen to the<br>brilliance that is a university of otago<br>professor it's fantastic to see so many<br>people here to celebrate this incredibly<br>important milestone in Chris's career on<br>behalf of the university I would like to<br>extend a particularly warm welcome to<br>members of Krista's family who are here<br>to support him this evening his wife<br>Angela his daughter Melanie his mom<br>Bronwyn who is here from Devon and his<br>mum and loss sue who is here from Wales<br>to the four fantastic women in Chris's<br>life no my Hut am i welcome I'd also<br>like to acknowledge the presence of<br>academic and professional staff from<br>throughout the university and members of<br>the wider Dunedin community who are also<br>here to support this fantastic event now<br>the path to professor here at the<br>University of Otago is not an easy one<br>and it's it's probably an interesting<br>coincidence that we are having this IPL<br>on the eve of the next professorial<br>selection panel which convenes tomorrow<br>so in order to receive this promotion to<br>Professor the individual applicant must<br>demonstrate excellence in teaching in<br>research and in service to the<br>University and the wider community now<br>as you will learn from Chris's lecture<br>this evening he is an effective and<br>evading teacher a very popular<br>postgraduate supervisor and an<br>incredibly successful researcher<br>professor button has also provided<br>exceptional service to his department to<br>the University and to the wider research<br>community so Chris it is genuinely my<br>pleasure to congratulate you on your<br>very well-deserved promotion to<br>Professor I will now call on the pro<br>vice-chancellor of Sciences professor<br>Richard Barker who will tell us just a<br>little bit more about Chris's journey to<br>Professor noreda tenneco totin okoto<br>tena tato katoa<br>Vice Chancellor tena quai deputy<br>vice-chancellors tena koe to Professor<br>button in our Quay Professor Hodge<br>denna Quay friends and colleagues tena<br>koutou tena koutou tena koutou katoa it<br>is my great pleasure tonight to<br>introduce our speaker professor Chris<br>button to give his inaugural<br>professorial lecture at the University<br>of Otago come on in as was indicated by<br>our vice-chancellor professor button is<br>one of our newer professors at the<br>University of Otago receiving a well<br>deserved promotion to the position in<br>February of this year<br>Chris grew up in a town called Hana Tong<br>in the southwest of England and with<br>parents who were both teachers and a<br>father des it was a PE teacher we can<br>guess where Chris's interest and Sport<br>and Exercise began and and football we<br>might also guess that this is where his<br>gift for teaching comes from ever the<br>pioneer on finishing school Chris<br>traveled north to Manchester<br>Metropolitan University where he studied<br>a relatively new degree at the time a<br>BSC with honors in exercise and sport<br>science he funded this working in nearby<br>Chester at Britain's oldest wine<br>merchant business as an interesting<br>aside such was his passion for matters<br>of the grape he completed a post<br>graduate diploma in wine and spirit<br>education at Liverpool University and he<br>added a note about the immense amount of<br>graduating with his honours degree in<br>1995 Chris stayed on and Manchester to<br>complete his ph.d on motor learning<br>which he did so in 2000 having also<br>worked as a lecturer from 1998 more<br>importantly at about this time Chris<br>wrote this<br>he met his wife-to-be Angela who was<br>also studying for her PhD in sports<br>psychology and talent development post<br>PhD Chris and Angela moved further north<br>Chris taking up employment as a senior<br>lecturer at the University of Edinburgh<br>they both enjoyed life north north of<br>the border with the incredible scenery<br>and outdoor activities on offer so it<br>seems natural that chris was enticed to<br>Dunedin for more of the same to take up<br>the directorship of the human<br>performance center which he did so in<br>2002 with four books seventeen book<br>chapters and 92 peer-reviewed journal<br>articles professor Burton is a highly<br>productive researcher and I'm proud to<br>say that sitting at number 42 in his CV<br>is a journal article that I helped Chris<br>write back in 2011 his research<br>interests are in the field of motor<br>learning specifically the issue of water<br>safety education which he will tell us a<br>little bit more about in a few minutes<br>as noted by the vice-chancellor<br>professors professor buttons promotion<br>reflects much more than his personal<br>scholarship he is also an outstanding<br>teacher and leader at the postgraduate<br>level he is currently supervising six<br>PhD students and has supervised 13 to<br>completion<br>he has also supervised 6m fed students<br>to completion in mentor five postdocs<br>his undergraduate teaching has been<br>translated into three books on motor<br>learning pedagogy but my final remarks<br>if I may on Chris as a leader he was<br>appointed Dean of the school of physical<br>education Sport and Exercise Science in<br>2017 he came in at a challenging time<br>but he was chosen for the role because<br>of his personal qualities which were<br>seen as necessary to lead the school<br>into the next phase of its history he<br>has thus far risen to the challenge and<br>under Chris's leadership the school is<br>continuing to position itself as a<br>center of excellence in Sport and<br>Exercise Science is it we're building on<br>the strong foundations of the old in<br>establishing than you<br>tonight the focus will be on his journey<br>of personal scholarship from Honiton and<br>the north to Dunedin in the south please<br>join me in welcoming professor Chris<br>button<br>tena koe Thoth na koto tena Tartu katoa<br>tena koe voice Chancellor tena koi<br>Provost Chancellor tena koe e members

to all<br>my family friends and colleagues<br>gathered here both physically and<br>virtually a warm thank you for attending<br>and enjoying hopefully this little<br>shindig for the next 45 minutes it's my<br>intention to try and entertain you and<br>for those brave souls who are<br>live-streaming from the UK right now<br>I'll be doing my best to try to keep you<br>awake because it's a ridiculously early<br>time in the morning back there my name<br>is Chris button and I have the honour as<br>Richard has just said of being the Dean<br>of the school of physical education<br>Sport and Exercise Sciences if I was to<br>ask each of you the question what do you<br>think about when you recall physical<br>education a bit a fair amount of my<br>hard-earned salary that the most common<br>response would be our running around a<br>gym or a field whilst being shouted at<br>by my teacher I hope to convince you<br>over the next half an hour or so that<br>physical education is and can be so much<br>more than that outdated viewpoint like<br>our finger prints movement defines us<br>uniquely as individuals across our<br>lifespan humans move in a wide variety<br>of different ways to fulfill tasks goals<br>we move to fee<br>we move to play we move to communicate<br>to travel to work and to relax how we<br>learn movement and how we learn motor<br>skills has been the focus of my research<br>for just over 20 years<br>the remarkable capacity that humans<br>possess to learn to be taught to<br>remember and to adapt to their<br>environments has served our species well<br>for millions of years do you think<br>you're fit interestingly from an<br>evolutionary biology perspective the<br>word Fitness doesn't refer to how fast<br>you can run or how far you can go but<br>instead to how well we as a species<br>exploit the environmental niches that<br>are offered to us hence the well-known<br>saying survival of the fittest<br>hence humans are among the fittest<br>living species on earth because of our<br>capacity to adapt regardless of an<br>ethnicity socioeconomic status and our<br>physical education which actually begins<br>many years before we set foot in a<br>school and arguably never ends we can<br>open up a rich landscape of opportunity<br>should we choose to accept them so do<br>you think that society is changing the<br>way that we move emerging technological<br>advances such as the internet social<br>media wearable sensing devices virtual<br>reality are all very much on our<br>doorsteps if not already here these<br>simultaneously enhance the capacity for<br>us to explore our environments and learn<br>new skills whilst at the same time<br>providing distractions and potential<br>barriers to physical activity an<br>important question I'd like us all to<br>consider is whether our physical<br>education czar still relevant for the<br>future that lies ahead of us and in this<br>talk I'm going to use the specific<br>example of water safety education in New<br>let's rewind the clock to one of the<br>most crucial periods of our lives<br>acquiring so-called foundational<br>movement skills from approximately the<br>ages of four to eight years old as my<br>daughter Melanie here is demonstrating<br>forms the building blocks upon which<br>more complex movement skills can be<br>constructed as we mature so movement or<br>motor competence is a child's capacity<br>to move both effectively and efficiently<br>motor competence plays a pivotal role in<br>the physical and psychological<br>well-being of children during<br>development although we can learn new<br>skills at any point in our lives our<br>capacity to learn is greatest in our<br>childhood and that's manifested by the<br>highest rate of neural plasticity<br>relative to other phases in our lives<br>hence while it's never too late to learn<br>a skill such as kicking a ball or<br>learning to swim it's certainly easier<br>and maybe advisable to do it when we're<br>still young I'm glad to say that Melanie<br>is selectively learned how to kick a<br>ball here rather than how not to wear<br>her shorts like her dad does in this<br>clip you might ask the question well<br>does it matter that chilled young<br>children learn to move well or<br>competently and the answer to that is it<br>clear yes it does matter for several<br>reasons children with poor motor<br>competency are less likely to be active<br>during childhood but also for our<br>adulthood also children with poor motor<br>competence<br>or more likely to be excluded from<br>social groups or even be bullied and<br>they may have lower self-esteem<br>as I will discuss in a few slides time<br>not being able to swim or recreation<br>water at a young age is a sad and<br>worrying trend around the world and<br>particularly in an island nation like<br>this one emerging data from across the<br>world suggests that children's movement<br>competency in general is decreasing and<br>here's one example drawn from a very<br>large body of literature which contrasts<br>children from our neighbours Australia<br>with Belgium children alarmingly<br>close to 40% of Australian children<br>showed very poor motor competency in a<br>range of skills like running jumping<br>catching throwing and kicking and as I<br>highlighted here in the abstract of this<br>article the authors suggest that the<br>very low levels of movement competency<br>reported by Australian children may be<br>the result of cultural differences in<br>physical activity contexts such as<br>physical education and active transport<br>when compared to norms for both samples<br>the Belgian and Australian children<br>scored significantly worse than children<br>forty years ago<br>hence the decline in children's motor<br>competence is a global issue and it's<br>one that's largely influenced according<br>to these authors by increasing to the<br>entry behavior and a decline in physical<br>activity in recent years motor<br>competency has been linked with the<br>broader multi-dimensional concept of<br>physical literacy this model which was<br>published just this year a few months<br>ago links the concept of physical<br>literacy acquired early in childhood to<br>other important<br>developmental factors including<br>environment social factors and<br>individual differences the model<br>suggests that acquiring physical<br>literacy in childhood is an integral<br>several studies in the last couple of<br>decades have shown some of these<br>relationships to be to be true and to be<br>confirmed they demonstrate for example<br>poor motor competency in childhood with<br>less physical activity both in childhood<br>and then later in life and some of the<br>negative associated health risks that<br>come with that such as obesity diabetes<br>and poor mental health so this is data<br>from across the world but what about<br>from here how to how do our Kiwi<br>children stack up and the reality is<br>that there isn't a lot of data that's<br>New Zealand specific to rely upon<br>certainly in regards to a movement<br>competency however we can look to the<br>amount and the quality of physical<br>activity that children get up to and we<br>have some information here that's<br>collected from sport New Zealand on a<br>fairly regular basis and they've been<br>collecting and monitoring self-reported<br>data from New Zealand children for<br>several years what this slide tells us<br>is that on average children's weekly<br>activity levels rise until around about<br>the age of 12 to 14 with approximately<br>11 hours a week of sport play and other<br>forms of physical activity reported 11<br>hours a week if we assume that children<br>sleep for 12 hours per day which is a<br>conservative assumption I would say for<br>some parents in the audience here then<br>these data suggest that children are<br>active for only about 13% of the time<br>that they're not sleeping the pie chart<br>on the right here depicts how that 11<br>hours of physical activities<br>I'd like to draw your attention to the<br>two largest slices of pie about four of<br>these eleven hours are spent playing<br>with family and friends demonstrating<br>the importance of a good social network<br>around children encouraging them to be<br>active and just over two hours per week<br>on average as spent in physical activity<br>or PE lessons at school perhaps because<br>of some of these worrying data New<br>Zealand children have been targeted by<br>the government here with something<br>called the physical literacy approach so<br>the government recognized back in 2016<br>that New Zealand children do seem to<br>have decreasing levels of physical<br>activity and increasing amounts of<br>screen time sat in front of devices or<br>computers or TVs and this concerning<br>trend is actually been confirmed by<br>Sandy Mandich and her team here in the<br>school of physical education so over<br>eight million dollars worth of funding<br>has been injected into this physical<br>literacy programme and that's primarily<br>been through sport New Zealand supported<br>by the Minister of Education and ACC the<br>vision of the physical literacy approach<br>as you can see here is to value and<br>choose to be physically active for life<br>it's worth again highlighting the<br>physical activity is a multi-dimensional<br>concept it's not just being about<br>physical a range of dimensions here<br>including cognitive spiritual social and<br>emotional benefits to human movement<br>that should not be overshadowed by that<br>physical dimension this holistic<br>approach to physical literacy is also<br>represented when we consider the<br>Ministry of Education recommendations<br>for the New Zealand school curriculum<br>for at least<br>20 years now health and physical<br>education have been taught together and<br>they encompass free different but<br>related subjects health education<br>physical education and home economics<br>so these subjects share a conceptual<br>framework and achievement objectives as<br>depicted in the slide here by a very<br>nice into woven tapestry the seven key<br>areas of learning that are listed here<br>are interwoven through four strands<br>namely how order health promotion the<br>socio ecological ecological perspective<br>and attitudes and values just take a<br>moment to look at some of these key<br>areas of learning do you think they're<br>important I think they're about as<br>important as they could possibly be and<br>when one considers the significance of<br>each of these learning areas for<br>developing developing children it might<br>be argued that health and physical<br>education as a subject area<br>bears considerable weight upon its<br>shoulders how broader the shoulders of<br>health and phys-ed the school curriculum<br>is packed with numerous important<br>learning topics but does health and phys<br>ed get a fair share there's considerable<br>variation across schools but two to<br>three lessons per week would be the<br>typical load and at least that's through<br>primary and intermediate schools one<br>might question whether for example two<br>to three PE lessons per week is enough<br>and also whether health and physical<br>education should be a mandatory topic<br>throughout high school<br>I certainly have views on that and you<br>can probably guess what they are<br>perhaps another contentious topic is the<br>convenient linking together lot of my<br>internet is they're convenient linking<br>together of health and physical<br>education within the<br>school curriculum in my honest opinion<br>there's actually a lot to be gained from<br>the cross-disciplinary study of health<br>wellness and physical education indeed<br>if I've done one thing in the school of<br>physical education here over the last<br>couple of years is to really promote and<br>try to include those cross-disciplinary<br>linkages in our new curriculum and it's<br>something that I believe the school is<br>prospered for over 70 years in terms of<br>its philosophy is health and PE taught<br>well well the reality from my<br>perspective having looked at a few<br>different schools and chosen one<br>recently for Melanie is that schools<br>generally do a pretty good job with<br>physical education whereas others maybe<br>don't give it sufficient emphasis within<br>their curriculum there's a fair amount<br>of variation from a limited perspective<br>of the Dunedin schools that I've been to<br>and and some of those PE teachers that<br>I've spoken to on the whole I've been<br>quite impressed by the range the quality<br>and the amount of physical education<br>that's offered to children but as I said<br>here in the slide it's not just about<br>how much phys ed you provide the<br>students you've got to teach it well<br>let's just take a look at a typical<br>lesson and this is from a class in<br>Singapore<br>the ten-year-old girls here are being a<br>beginning learners and they're being<br>taught as you can see how to play tennis<br>strokes<br>notice the mechanical technique focused<br>way in which the teacher is getting them<br>to replicate certain types of movement<br>pan analysis of physical education<br>lessons around the world suggests that P<br>teachers do tend to favor and adopt<br>these direct styles of teaching that<br>include a high level of instruction<br>demonstration and corrective feedback<br>for example a recent study in Europe<br>found that approximately 88 0 % of<br>typical PE lessons were taught<br>predominantly in this fashion and you<br>might say well maybe there are good<br>reasons for that direct teaching styles<br>like these help to organize and control<br>big groups I think there was 30 to 40<br>children in that group there it's<br>perhaps safe to teach in this way we<br>know what they're all doing they're all<br>trying to do the same thing they're not<br>hopefully going to hit each other nicely<br>spaced apart maybe it's done to ensure<br>that physical activity is undertaken by<br>all one-size-fits-all is commonly used<br>when people talk about physical<br>education a much smaller percentage of<br>lessons involve indirect teaching styles<br>styles that allow the children to play<br>and to learn to solve problems by<br>themselves and this is an area that I<br>would like to spend a little bit of time<br>talking to you about but as I say bear<br>in mind that what we typically see in<br>physical education and the way that that<br>that topic is taught these types of<br>approaches so in recent years myself and<br>a few colleagues have been working on a<br>new approach to teaching phys ed which<br>is much more individual focused as<br>opposed to reproducing a certain type of<br>technique when adopting a non-linear<br>pedagogy approach physical education<br>teachers must consider a few things<br>they must consider the key constraints<br>on the learner learner center of this<br>model is the important person and each<br>individual brings with them different<br>attributes and qualities key constraints<br>shape how people move things such as the<br>equipment that you give them the<br>instructions that you provide them and<br>their motivations shape the way that<br>they prefer to move is that teachers<br>will be well advised to try to be aware<br>of some of these key constraints on<br>learners attentional focus or what<br>learners pay attention to when they're<br>practicing is very influential in terms<br>of the quality of their learning so for<br>example should your attention be<br>directed internally to guiding your limb<br>as you're moving a tennis racquet for<br>the air in terms of your posture should<br>you be thinking about how to control<br>your balance or instead should be you if<br>you'll be thinking it externally about<br>the effects of your action on the<br>environment where the ball is and where<br>you'd like to place it so this is a<br>tensional focus and it's something that<br>it's known to be fairly important for<br>learning information movement coupling<br>is developing close linkages between the<br>information that's available in the<br>environment like an approaching ball and<br>how the how the human body<br>couples movements to receive that ball<br>to control it and then to move it in a<br>functional way many species of animals<br>are very good at information movement<br>coupling just like humans but this is<br>something again which maybe is<br>downplayed a little bit in some of these<br>physical education lessons finally and<br>importantly nonlinear pedagogy<br>emphasizes something known as<br>representativeness as you can see in the<br>model representative learning design is<br>where teachers looked at carefully<br>designed their Pratt<br>environment so that it mimics or<br>simulates the performance environment to<br>which the skill should eventually be<br>reproduced indeed this theoretically<br>informed pedagogical approach has<br>informed some of my most recent research<br>looking at how children should learn<br>water safety skills and I'd like to<br>share that with you now in 2015 a<br>nationwide study into aquatic education<br>for schools was conducted by the New<br>Zealand Council for Education Research<br>the study found that only about a<br>quarter of schools 27% to be precise<br>provided a minimum acceptable<br>combination of eight or more water based<br>lessons of about half an hour duration<br>per year whilst somewhat shocking<br>in fact the statistic is probably an<br>underestimate because based on sector<br>knowledge water safety New Zealand<br>advocates the minimum should be in fact<br>10 lessons of at least 30 minutes let's<br>briefly return to the health and<br>physical education curriculum where the<br>following guidance is given to schools<br>it is expected that all students will<br>have had opportunities to learn basic<br>aquatic skills by the end of year 6 age<br>11 do they achieve that or not well the<br>data from this report suggests maybe not<br>how and where these opportunities happen<br>is left to the discretion of the schools<br>of course some schools have ready access<br>to a pool and teachers who qualified<br>maybe to deliver the cortex but the<br>reality is that a growing number of<br>other important results that emerge from<br>this review in Klaw included that<br>schools need to adopt a perhaps a more<br>consistent national approach to aquatics<br>education<br>they need more schools that are meeting<br>less recommended minimum adolescence and<br>greater emphasis is needed on teaching<br>survival skills alongside teaching<br>children the traditional swimming<br>strokes and finally and most importantly<br>for the project I'm about to talk to you<br>about the majority of teaching occurs in<br>swimming pools with very little exposure<br>to other environments recall what I said<br>about the representative learning design<br>and the importance of mimicking the<br>environment in which you intend to<br>perform that skill in it's important<br>because we know that more children and<br>teenagers drown in open water than in<br>pools a tragic statistic in New Zealand<br>recently over 80 percent of preventable<br>drownings were in open water<br>environments we know and that's been the<br>case for many years now that New Zealand<br>has one of the highest fatality records<br>for drowning amongst developed countries<br>it's well known that the majority of<br>drowning drownings happen not in pools<br>but in open water environments so one of<br>the focuses of my research recently has<br>been to try to encourage us to consider<br>where we might teach and educate<br>children because clearly there are<br>numerous differences between open water<br>environments and swimming pools and<br>here's a few of them you might recognize<br>this image from Dunedin so open water<br>environments if we're at the beach or<br>the ocean we have to deal with things<br>like waves and currents if we're maybe<br>in a river we have to deal with cold<br>temperatures over here in New Zealand<br>it's commonly the case we have to deal<br>with depths of water that may be<br>unpredictable difficult to read multiple<br>entry and exit points in contrast to<br>swimming pools which are almost the<br>exact opposite well we have supervision<br>we<br>have sterile environment the waters<br>clean you can see through it usually and<br>there are various rules about what you<br>can and you can't do in that environment<br>so certainly there avert there are very<br>big differences between open water and<br>swimming pool environments assuming that<br>it's difficult to simulate and recreate<br>some of these features in open in<br>swimming pools I wanted to see whether<br>it was possible and indeed more<br>effective to teach children aquatic<br>skills in open water so in a recent<br>project I ran here with Professor Jim<br>Cotter and associate professor Amory<br>Jackson we've been asking the question<br>is it more effective to teach water<br>competency skills to children in open<br>water environments so quite recently we<br>took a hundred and twenty children from<br>Dunedin and some of them are here<br>tonight<br>from the ages of seven to eleven years<br>old and we recruited them in<br>world-record time less than two weeks<br>thanks to the wonders of Facebook it's<br>not good for many things but it's very<br>good for recruiting participants we had<br>a hundred and twenty children performing<br>three different tests in a swimming pool<br>and in between those tests we had them<br>participate in an educational program in<br>different environments so we had them go<br>down to the target harbour and spend a<br>morning or an afternoon working with<br>some lifeguards we had them go to a<br>local river and understand and<br>experience what it's like to be immersed<br>in a river and we also had them go down<br>to a local beach this is footage taken<br>from as you can see wonderful Brighton<br>Beach on a sunny day I don't know how we<br>managed to find some sunshine it was in<br>the middle of January so you can see a<br>beautiful environment here for the<br>children to be<br>engaged in the children had a range of<br>competencies to begin with some were<br>good some were not so good and we you<br>can tell we had quite a few lifeguards<br>and different organizations involved<br>with their supervision to make sure that<br>things were safe but we practiced a<br>range of different skills in nursing you<br>saw submersion they're floating on their<br>backs and just being competent and<br>confident in these environments so this<br>formed the basis of our educational<br>program and we're really interested to<br>see to what extent it would improve<br>their competency in some key core skills<br>the six water safety skills that were<br>tested were giving in and out of deep<br>water and floating for up to five<br>minutes without touching the sides of<br>the bottom or without grabbing on to<br>someone they needed to be able to fit a<br>lifejacket and simulate a rescue with a<br>partner they also needed to complete an<br>obstacle course whilst they were clothed<br>they were asked to swim non-stop for up<br>to five minutes again and we conduct a<br>little quiz with them to see what<br>knowledge they had about risks and<br>emergency procedures and finally we got<br>them to do an underwater swim for about<br>six meters to try and retrieve a<br>submerged object there's a busy slide<br>here and I don't continue to try to take<br>everything from it but notice the red<br>bars these are the participants who<br>could complete the task without any<br>assistance for all six of these skills<br>at the beginning less than 50% of the<br>children were fully competent in avoids<br>they couldn't achieve these tasks<br>without some help there was wide<br>variation as I mentioned the beginning<br>in terms of competency across the group<br>but the majority by the end of the<br>program were able to complete the tasks<br>without help or assistance<br>encouragingly significant and<br>movements in five out of six of these<br>tasks by post-test and that in fact<br>increased to all six tasks by the end of<br>a three-month retention test we're about<br>three quarters of the children were now<br>fully competent we were overwhelmed by<br>these results and overwhelmed by the<br>response of both the children and some<br>of the caregivers we asked the<br>caregivers what they fought because they<br>were of course talking to their children<br>whilst they were involved in the program<br>and here are some of their thoughts and<br>comments we asked them is your child<br>more aware of dangers now around natural<br>water environments does your child have<br>a greater understanding of how to keep<br>safe when in different water<br>environments does your child as they<br>improve their swimming ability and has<br>your child improved important water<br>safety survival skills and you can see<br>overwhelmingly that most of the<br>caregivers agreed with that do those<br>statements so we were very happy with a<br>program and its impact upon the children<br>and importantly that programs been fed<br>back to water safety New Zealand and is<br>incorporated in their new nationwide<br>program water skills for life so this<br>one week remember just one week water<br>open water program was successful in<br>improving and maintaining water safety<br>competency some considerations may be to<br>think about format content location<br>where swimming teaching should happen<br>what it says suggests to me is one area<br>where we can perhaps have a real impact<br>is in school camps where children often<br>taken into lakes rivers and other open<br>water environments we only tested these<br>children recall in swimming pools and we<br>need to do more research just to confirm<br>as I suspect that the transferability of<br>these skills is there those are some of<br>the next steps for the next coming years<br>the key question I originally posed in<br>the title asks whether<br>children are physically educated for the<br>21st century and whilst the future is of<br>course uncertain the literature on<br>education and employment trends suggests<br>that the idea of a single long-lasting<br>career or speciality in something or<br>other may become a thing of the past one<br>way to think about jobs for example in<br>the 21st century is to use the metaphor<br>of a surfer we catch a good wave or we<br>find a good job early on out in our<br>lives but it may be short-lived and as<br>it crests and fault<br>we need to look for the next wave we<br>need a paddle out back and find a new<br>wave we need to get gain new skills and<br>new experiences<br>we need to retrain and educate ourselves<br>along the way even experts today are<br>finding themselves disrupted fewer<br>professions today are hotter than that<br>of a software engineer for example yet<br>many foresee automation taking over the<br>work of coding in the near future<br>artificial intelligence is doing the<br>rote work of lawyers<br>it's simplifying the work of doctors and<br>it's changing skills in jobs from right<br>through from truck drivers to financial<br>analysts hence in the 21st century it's<br>predicted that the workforce will need<br>to learn and they'll need to learn<br>quickly they'll need to adapt their<br>skills and become more multidisciplinary<br>in their expertise the physical<br>education curriculum at Otago was<br>recently restructured with some of these<br>future focused graduate attributes in<br>mind because speed learning is upon us<br>like it or not learning new skills<br>typically takes a long time but<br>sometimes it's necessary to speed up<br>that process learning complex motor<br>skills which are difficult to automate<br>sometimes we need to recover but from<br>injury or from disease and we need to<br>relearn skills and in evolving<br>technologies our own power<br>rapid learning and this is a fascinating<br>field of research to be involved with I<br>want to return as well to the idea of<br>physical literacy which I mentioned<br>obviously early on the talk and how it's<br>important for the 21st century several<br>authors have written about physical<br>literacy and linked it to the importance<br>of being active in our natural<br>environments this nice quote is lifted<br>from a very good book if you've never<br>read it last child in the woods which<br>suggests that the generation of children<br>are growing up today have less exposure<br>to nature and they even talk about a<br>concept or idea called nature deficit<br>disorder I think children need<br>opportunities to be active to play and<br>to discover how to move and that's<br>insane that maybe they're playing more<br>organized sports they're playing more<br>inside in some cases even in virtual<br>worlds the reason I think that's a shame<br>is the natural environment offers an<br>abundance of opportunities and benefits<br>to learn so some of the key messages I'd<br>like you to take home from today that<br>children should learn foundational<br>aquatic skills based on the common<br>causes of drowning that's something that<br>I'm committed to pursuing whilst I'm<br>here in New Zealand practicing aquatic<br>schools skills in a pool is typically<br>just the start of our learning journey<br>but it doesn't fully develop skill<br>transfer motor learning principles can<br>be used to design rich practice<br>environments in physical education<br>lessons and I urge you with your<br>children and your friends to think about<br>exposing learners to a range of practice<br>environments if you wish to optimize<br>their transfer their athletic skill so<br>are our children physically educated for<br>the 21st century<br>drum roll for the big answer there's<br>large variation I think some aren't but<br>in fact some probably are particularly<br>in a country like New Zealand I think<br>that's a big if<br>that's why I've made the font on my<br>screen here as big as they can for ifs<br>if they can develop physical literacy<br>through play and they're interacting<br>sufficiently with nature and if they<br>learn to love physical activity Sport<br>and Exercise then yes they may well be<br>physically educated for the 21st century<br>but beware if they're not well that's<br>the end of the formal part of this talk<br>I want to say a few thank-yous for<br>people who mean a lot to me and who've<br>supported me in this little journey as<br>Richard said from the Honiton of the<br>north to Dunedin of the south and first<br>of all I'll call out the members of this<br>school of physical education Sport and<br>Exercise Sciences I've never met a group<br>of more passionate more intelligent and<br>fantastic people to work with and for<br>whether its staff whether its students<br>researchers educators they're an<br>incredible bunch of people and I'm truly<br>truly honored to be able to represent<br>them so thank you to all of your support<br>from the school thank you also to my<br>research collaborators people from<br>across the world as well as from hear us<br>as well and in particular to the two<br>fellows at the top it started at all<br>professor Keith David's and professor<br>Simon Bennett my PhD supervisors from<br>Manchester these were the people that<br>set me off on this path and I feel again<br>truly grateful for the opportunities<br>that their wisdom and their supports<br>provided me nothing ever happens on your<br>own in research and I've been fortunate<br>again to share<br>and cross paths with so many wonderful<br>postgraduate students and some of them<br>are here today and in recent years I've<br>been working particularly hard to bring<br>more postgraduate students into the<br>school so I'm really pleased to see some<br>fantastic new talent here which will be<br>doing exactly what I'm doing in a few<br>years time<br>Richard briefly alluded to a passion of<br>mine as well as my family here I have<br>another far now and the football far now<br>that live and grow with me and on<br>Saturday afternoons occasionally run<br>around sweat and occasionally swear at<br>each other some of these people are very<br>young as you can see and some of them<br>are extremely old some of them should<br>not be running around a football pitch<br>but they still do that and I'm so<br>pleased that they do because I get a lot<br>of fun and enjoyment out of playing with<br>them and those that are circled may be<br>particularly familiar to university<br>staff here I've poached the talent from<br>the University I don't know if there's<br>any more talent available but if there<br>is I will try to find it so thanks to my<br>football far now but most importantly<br>thanks to the far know that means the<br>most to me my parents and my family back<br>home in the UK who I don't see ISM that<br>regularly as I would wish to and of<br>course Angela and Melanie here with me<br>on a trip recently to the Commonwealth<br>Games since I've been to New Zealand<br>I've been very fortunate to be adopted<br>by another set of grandparent or parents<br>Patti and Mary who have looked after me<br>whilst I was here on my own without my<br>wife so again I want to send out big<br>thanks big love to all of the family<br>who've helped me from the very start<br>helped me realize just how important<br>physical education can be I'll leave you<br>of one of my favorite quotes about<br>teaching which I think says an awful lot<br>thanks for listening now me he Nui ki<br>I need to look quite so relieved Chris<br>cure good evening my name is Ken Hodge<br>and it's my honor to think Christopher's<br>presentation normally this task will be<br>completed by the head of department or<br>an air case the Dean of the school but<br>as you heard earlier from Richard Chris<br>is the Dean of air scope so it's my task<br>to offer the thanks for Chris's<br>provocative talk a couple of personal<br>things that really had harm from what<br>Chris said many of you who are you<br>Zealanders like me grew up so learning<br>to swim in school pools and learning<br>homage drowning and South and rivers and<br>other places and fortunately I had some<br>friends pass away from preventable<br>drowning so that had time very important<br>part of life and you zealand on a loyal<br>and with so many lakes and rivers when i<br>was privileged enough to be on the board<br>of trustees from my kids primary school<br>in danger Bay we fought hard to retain<br>our school pool and a lot of fundraising<br>went into that and a lot of effort so<br>thank you very much for the work you're<br>putting into that important topic Chris<br>I think you'll agree Chris's<br>presentation was quite provocative<br>attires about the physical activity or<br>more accurately physical inactivity of<br>most people in the developed world which<br>is a sad fact of modern life but it's<br>even more important now given the health<br>issues that confront all of us so I<br>think some of the work that Chris talked<br>about is absolutely crucial for us I<br>just want to say a couple of things to<br>thank Chris as a colleague we've been<br>colleagues since 2003 when Chris joined<br>staff at the school we've done a little<br>bit of research together I've done some<br>teaching together<br>I haven't played football maybe your<br>speed learning thing could help it was<br>my golfing incompetence because I'm not<br>learning that sport very quickly at all<br>chris has been the dean nanak for almost<br>exactly two years as of today or<br>tomorrow and he could not have taken<br>over those reins and more challenging<br>circumstances many of you will know but<br>some of you won't - three years ago our<br>school went through a mess of change<br>both in terms of our curriculum<br>and some staff turnover and it was a<br>very difficult and painful period for us<br>so Crystal Cobra in a very difficult<br>time and he has done an outstanding job<br>as our Dean and we're very grateful he's<br>been a great leader he's pissed a few<br>people off and I mean that as a<br>compliment<br>seriously because if you don't take hard<br>decisions you don't actually get things<br>to move along and how decisions usually<br>have some people who weren't agreeing<br>with you a little annoyed and I was one<br>of those that a few times but I<br>appreciate that Chris was brave enough<br>strong enough of a leader to actually do<br>those things and help our school<br>progressed and very difficult<br>circumstances we're extremely grateful<br>Christopher all of that all it leaves me<br>now is to present a little gift that I<br>to thank all of you for attending some<br>of my colleagues and other folks I<br>recognized some around campus and also<br>from the neaten community and especially<br>Chris's family an extended family and<br>folks who are watching from from over<br>the water so those of you are here the<br>virtual people can have a virtual drink<br>for Chris but we're going to we're going<br>to adjourn over to the staff club now<br>the ground-floor the staff club's room<br>for some refreshments so please feel<br>welcome to join us over the year to<br>share your thoughts on Chris's talk and<br>other things thank you very much for<br>attending and Steve</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The
