of Maggie's keynote it is now my<br>great pleasure to and I invite you to<br>join me in welcome welcoming Maggie air<br>Aloha Aloha I love that it's just<br>wonderful thank you so much do you know<br>today feels really special for me and it<br>wasn't going to share this but I want to<br>but thirty years ago I gave my first<br>keynote speech at my cuttle University<br>and some of you will know this woman who<br>is my dear friend and mentor who worked<br>here<br>professor Marilyn Waring she phoned me<br>and she said I need your help Maggie our<br>speaker has pulled out and that speaker<br>was Keri Hulme and I said I cannot step<br>in for Keri Hulme there is no way and<br>then she told me I'll pay you $600 and<br>those days it was a lot of money so I<br>got my best dress on and I got the bus<br>and I said Marilyn I'll only do this if<br>you coach me she was trained as a<br>professional singer in London and she<br>knew all about breathing and I said have<br>never given a keynote this is ridiculous<br>they're all academics luckily I just had<br>a documentary made about me she said<br>bring the doc oh I said yep tacos too<br>outrageous and most of the audience a<br>mean it won't work Marilyn anyway it did<br>work but she spent three days teaching<br>me about key messages teaching me about<br>breathing from the diaphragm the voice<br>teaching me about expressive body<br>language and I always create at Marilyn<br>because she's one of my dearest friends<br>and she's one of my mentors and when I<br>got the call from Nicky Thomas where are<br>you thank you so much for everything<br>you've done to get me here I thought of<br>that day because I was terrified I've<br>come a long way in 30 years I'm no<br>longer afraid of public speaking it's<br>become a part of my career and my life<br>and I loved it when you talked about<br>knowing who you are and making a stand<br>because in a way that's what my new book<br>was about being you which came out this<br>year in May what I didn't realize when<br>the publisher came to me and said would<br>you write this book about personal<br>browning first of all I said no there's<br>thousands of bucks particularly American<br>books about personal branding I don't<br>want to be just another book and he said<br>but for years that's what you've been<br>doing you've been working on<br>Helen Clark's personal brand and he<br>named all the people his brands I've<br>been working on for years so I decided<br>to do it but what I didn't realize was<br>how confronting it was for me to write<br>about being you and authenticity and<br>there were times when I looked in the<br>bathroom mirror and I didn't like what I<br>saw I thought oh my gosh at times I'm<br>actually an authentic and it felt like a<br>year of therapy with myself being me so<br>I started interviewing people but I<br>about how I come across and my brother<br>who's an accountant a prolific writer<br>works in Dunedin said to me Maggie you<br>were fantastic last week on TV breakfast<br>one and I said thanks Tony he said you<br>were really authentic and I said but<br>what about all the other times he said<br>you weren't being authentic this is<br>family huh in my account and I said well<br>what do you mean he said the other times<br>you were performing you have been larger<br>than life and you're performing because<br>you're a trained actress and I really<br>thanked him and acknowledged him because<br>I got it so I started to realize that<br>when I was on radio or television I was<br>performing and acting but thought I was<br>being authentic what is the difference<br>so for being you a personal brand yes is<br>about everything you see but it's very<br>much about your values it's about who<br>you are being in the world and for me<br>it's a lifelong job just to find out who<br>I am being me and making a stand for<br>something so I had a very humble<br>beginning and there was violence in my<br>home and I care about kids at risk<br>so I'm very involved with children at<br>risk on a board could Tyler turn your<br>life around Tyler so our kids live out<br>west out of Auckland and they live out<br>South for me my values have shaped me<br>and they have a trip<br>me what I would like I would like to<br>before I actually get into really<br>digging deep you've been sitting all<br>morning and everything about your<br>presence and your body language and your<br>voice is very tied up with your brand<br>and your clothing and everything and I<br>would like one generous person to come<br>up here I will keep you safe and I'm<br>going to just demonstrate a simple<br>exercise they're not going to get<br>everybody up to do it so it's it's about<br>confidence and it's about your own being<br>so could one person come up here please<br>I've heard you're in a fantastic<br>audience Oh give her a clap okay so I'm<br>just going to go hello I am the letter X<br>and she's going to give it back to me<br>give her a clap thank you okay so what<br>you to stand out somebody you can use up<br>here but somebody behind you at the side<br>of you for two people or three people<br>just go hello I'm the lyrics where you<br>go up you get I dig it hello I am the<br>letter X<br>thank you thank you thank you okay and<br>one more generous person to come up here<br>don't be shy Oh give her a clap by the<br>way I don't know whether it's true but<br>there's a whole lot of research done<br>about that that posed you know with a<br>sociology is that Amy Cushing Amy<br>cutting<br>who says this is like the power post and<br>to stand in front of the mirror I<br>haven't ever done that but I like that I<br>like that you know I am being myself<br>okay and now I'm being inauthentic I'm<br>lacking presence I'm not enjoying my job<br>hello I am the letter O can you give it<br>but there is the best old anybody's<br>event done I love you she makes me look<br>good great one are the last person up<br>here please one person yeah you're right<br>we're right and now I'm full of energy<br>I'm being authentic and I'm full of life<br>great eye contact nice posture I'm gonna<br>say my name hello my name is Maggie and<br>you give it back it's your name great<br>thanks<br>okay right first of all I just want you<br>to get up and I want you to go and find<br>an oh just go and find a no and say<br>hello I'm the debtor Oh everybody up<br>don't find a no and now I want you to<br>turn to one person preferably that you<br>don't know and just letter X and your<br>name where you go one person and I just<br>wanted to do that exercise so you if you<br>see somebody having an OD please go up<br>to them and make help them encourage<br>them to to be an X yes okay how many of<br>you are shy or you'll see yourselves as<br>introverts thank you for your honesty<br>yeah and thank you for sharing that<br>because I have four brothers and three<br>of those are very very shy and I feel<br>like the world is not geared for shy and<br>introverted people so I'm an ambassador<br>for all of you<br>it was shy so in terms of a personal<br>brand what is a personal brand there<br>were three areas that are really really<br>important and authenticity is absolutely<br>very important and knowing what your<br>values are and also your reputation is<br>how people perceive you and then your<br>legacy what are you going to leave<br>behind when you leave this university or<br>you'll leave this lifetime but before we<br>go into those three areas I just want to<br>ask you to call out or write down<br>somebody just give me three words that<br>would describe who you are or your<br>personality so mine would be like open<br>cheering and loyal my PA who's on<br>maternity leave who I miss so much would<br>say something like vibrant empathetic<br>and honest but three words that would<br>describe who you are so in other words<br>to work out what your personal brand is<br>you know you need to know who you are<br>you need to know what you stand for in<br>life like in life I won't tolerate<br>sexism I won't tolerate racism I won't<br>tolerate homophobia I mean I'm very in<br>my family I have Tommen and I have<br>someone so diversity is really important<br>to me but who would be willing to call<br>out three words that describe who you<br>are thank you George stand up that would<br>be lovely<br>no pressure yep yep<br>wonderful great and there was summer<br>behind you<br>yes great so turn to the person next to<br>you or behind you and just three words<br>that would describe your personality<br>your personal brand just do a little<br>chitchat now okay so let's just dig a<br>little bit deeper let's dig a bit deeper<br>what is your Rick tation just think<br>about that now what is your reputation<br>and what would you like it to be so just<br>think now what is your reputation and<br>what would you like it to be I promised<br>Nikki I would show up I did show up I<br>like my reputation is very much about<br>being reliable turn to somebody next you<br>what is your reputation out what would<br>you like it to be just have a chitchat<br>where you go okay<br>thank you this is good this is a good<br>sign<br>it's Jetta anybody willing to be brave<br>enough to say this is what my reputation<br>is an hour we've got some strong people<br>in the room strong room anyone willing<br>to share that did you say timid yes as<br>yes what would you like it to be I love<br>this give her a clap and I really<br>acknowledge you because who finds it<br>hard to stand up in a forum like this<br>and actually speak out yeah absolutely<br>so well well done yeah so I've just been<br>working with somebody who I'm allowed to<br>talk about he waits for KPMG he's the<br>CIO there and he came to me and he said<br>Maggie I'm so scared about giving this<br>keynote address I'm terrified and I said<br>well it start talking about that let's<br>start working on your content and he<br>gave me the presentation it was<br>mind-numbing it was dull and boring<br>gosh you're recording this<br>we might enter this edit some of this<br>and but he doesn't mind right so he<br>works in the cyber space catching<br>criminals at KPMG<br>and I said Cowan what did you do for a<br>living<br>before you worked in corporate he said I<br>was a cop on the beat in South Auckland<br>now I was getting interested tell me<br>about your child's but are raised by<br>single mum very tough time humble<br>beginnings and he had these beautiful<br>tattoos that he was hiding under this<br>white shirt and so I said so you were<br>catching Crim's in like gangs on<br>motorbikes and now you're catching<br>Crim's here in the cyber world let's<br>weave this into a story at the beginning<br>of your presentation because you want to<br>work on your personal brand the other<br>partners don't even know what you did<br>the other the Chairman doesn't even know<br>what you did and they certainly don't<br>know you had a tough beginning you're<br>only a huge amount of money now compared<br>to being a cop so he waved it all in and<br>he even went away and got that song you<br>know bad boys that's really conservative<br>conference and he had it blaring and he<br>walked on I mean I spent about four<br>times and what was lovely was his wife<br>for next week met me and she said Meggie<br>thank you for helping Cohen to be<br>himself and be more authentic in this<br>presentation because now he's actually<br>at home and now he's feeling comfortable<br>but his key messages about catching<br>criminals were still there so in my<br>career I've been helping people shine on<br>the stage I've been helping people to be<br>true to themselves I never used to tell<br>people there was violence in my<br>childhood I never had the courage until<br>they actually meet me to movement came<br>up to tell people I was raped at 12 by<br>my girlfriend's brother I was hiding it<br>until the what Australian Woman's Weekly<br>said Judy Bailey you know Judy Burleigh<br>she said at about time we told that<br>story I was just not wanting to share so<br>much so<br>than for me at my age I'm learning to be<br>more open<br>going back to Cowen he's now cooking<br>with gas he's speaking all over New<br>Zealand he's speaking in the Pacific<br>Islands and he's now starting his<br>presentations with his stories so my job<br>is to help people humanize their<br>material at the beginning I wit with a<br>lot of academics particularly the peer<br>in academics for TED Talks<br>just make sure I've got the right class<br>here and I worked with one academic and<br>she her thesis was and it was about<br>failure and it was a bit dull and I just<br>said this is a bit dull you can't do a<br>TED talk you can't have all these<br>academic long words I call them $15<br>words human capital human capital human<br>capital I said you're talking about<br>people people people and you know so<br>opposed to five-dollar words leap<br>dancing like we want everyday plain<br>English so I said when did you feel like<br>a failure and she said well when I was<br>living in India India I had an arranged<br>marriage I gave the man the ring back I<br>wanted to choose my own partner and a<br>which of the airport flew to New Zealand<br>but my mum and dad would have nothing to<br>do with me<br>and as I stood there before I got on the<br>plane I felt like a failure I said that<br>she beginning of your TED talk ring mom<br>and dad in India tell them you're about<br>to go live with a TED talk don't scare<br>all the final a bit scary everybody all<br>the family and she started off her TED<br>talk but with a personal story so she<br>felt relaxed she felt really authentic<br>and professor Marilyn Waring said to me<br>years ago maybe you've got to start<br>being more real about your childhood<br>you've got to start sharing up you've<br>got to start telling your real story so<br>it doesn't matter what your real story<br>is but in terms of your brand people<br>know when you're faking it they<br>absolutely know and to be fully<br>expressive in our lives we need to<br>actually share our story we need to know<br>who we are what we stand for I am on<br>another board called star gem some of<br>you may have seen the lotto ad at the<br>moment tell<br>cadiz with disabilities yeah so my in<br>terms of my values I've always been<br>around compassion so that's really<br>hugely important for me the Tyler thing<br>I'll fight for kids who have nothing of<br>fight for one of our kids at Tyler<br>she was self arming self harming self<br>harming and I took her on and I said<br>darling Prince Harry's coming to New<br>Zealand he's chosen Tyler and he you're<br>going to talk to him<br>and she said what yep you're gonna stand<br>there TV cameras and you're going to<br>tell Prince Harry your story she was<br>petrified and she was 16 so I coached<br>her and I coached her and I coached her<br>she was amazing on the day so amazing<br>that TV 3 interviewed her and gave her<br>an exclusive so it's absolutely finding<br>the confidence to be true to who you are<br>and if you don't feel confident then<br>it's something that you really really<br>truly need to work on turn to somebody<br>next to you and I want you to ask that<br>person when just ask that person what's<br>the one word what would you use to<br>describe your personal brand what would<br>you say you are as a human being<br>just one phrase one word what would it<br>be like you might say I'm a game changer<br>or I'm I asked an academic yesterday<br>what she did and she said I'm a<br>because I was working with her on an<br>elevator pitch and I said I like that<br>you babysitter that's cool and I said to<br>another academic what are you doing she<br>said I'm a fairy godmother I'm just<br>trying to get people to use different<br>different terminology and get away from<br>the academia but just turn to somebody<br>how would you describe your personal<br>brand just have a little chat someone<br>behind you in front of you would anybody<br>be willing to stand up and just share<br>what how they would describe their<br>personal brand would anybody be willing<br>to share yes<br>like nonconformist I like there anyone<br>else yes they're both great like it<br>anyone else okay there's just a little<br>he comings and she's a poet and of<br>course an author and I like what she<br>says about authenticity to be nobody but<br>yourself in a world which is doing its<br>best night and day to make you like<br>everybody else<br>means to fight the hardest battle which<br>any human being can fight and never stop<br>fighting and that's just does anybody<br>relate to that does it have resonance<br>with you yeah so it's really important<br>to look at am i being authentic I want<br>you next week to start interviewing each<br>other and I want you to do several<br>things when you come out of meet of a<br>meeting it sounds odd but was I<br>authentic in that meeting when you come<br>out of and maybe you're giving a speech<br>or talking to the students was I being<br>authentic I want you to start asking all<br>the time and ask people that you really<br>really respect all the time and start to<br>notice when you're not being authentic<br>somebody said to me in London once<br>you're being very and authentic I didn't<br>even know what she meant I was shocked<br>and I was actually bad-mouthing New<br>Zealand and she said I don't like what<br>you're saying about your country I<br>challenge you I don't like you talking<br>that way and she challenged me about my<br>conversation I'm totally in love with my<br>country by the way I don't want to live<br>anywhere else<br>and I want you to start interviewing<br>each other don't make a booking like in<br>the diary just make it be spontaneous<br>how do you see me how do you perceive my<br>personal brand just start asking people<br>all the time and thinking about those<br>areas authenticity reputation and legacy<br>just start interviewing people I did<br>that all around the world I was shocked<br>and amazed<br>it what came back and and choose those<br>people really really carefully people<br>often say to me how important is image<br>how important is clothing now I work<br>with a lot of high-performing athletes<br>and I love it it's a really important<br>part of my work preparing them for<br>television preparing them for a speech<br>and they always turn up in their in the<br>sport gear and an Olympic winner the<br>other day called me last month and said<br>maybe I'm going into a school shall i<br>wear my wasn't nike but shall i wear my<br>you know sports clothing or shall i wear<br>my black trousers and a jacket and I<br>started talking to her about a personal<br>bread you decide what you feel<br>comfortable in and I always say to<br>people whatever you do don't work ho<br>thing that isn't you so in England I<br>worked with them you google this woman<br>you'll love her Angela eagle the eagle<br>twins which is amazing credible gay<br>woman who is brave so brave and you know<br>and she said to me right from the<br>beginning Helen Clarke organised this<br>work and she said Maggie don't put me in<br>skirts I don't want to wear skirts and<br>this is what I love this is what I don't<br>love she was very clear but what she was<br>paid to wear and not wear and I love<br>that about her that she was she said I'm<br>happy to wear nail polish I'm ever to<br>wear makeup but just don't put me in<br>clothes that I don't want to wear<br>Marilyn Waring tells every former MP<br>don't let Maggie heir take your shoe<br>shopping and I was years ago when I took<br>her shopping I I didn't know that<br>politicians were always on the grass and<br>she said she got me wearing his little<br>heels and they were so uncomfortable<br>they dug into the grass and she's never<br>ever forgotten it so it's really really<br>important to wear clothing that<br>expresses you you know I spent years and<br>years working in a top public relations<br>agency and I was an Account Director I<br>was the cash cow I was a top biller and<br>my boss said to me one day I will black<br>suits by the way Brown so it's gray so<br>it's very conservative<br>and he said when are you going to start<br>being you you're from the theater you're<br>actually very flamboyant<br>so I said to bring pink orange just<br>wearing lots of bright colors I'm not<br>wearing black color today but I wear a<br>lot of orange which is part of my<br>personal brand so I started being more<br>real what I was doing was trying to fit<br>into a culture I wanted to be loved and<br>wanted to be liked wanted to be accepted<br>and also I've been an actress for so<br>many years and was used to just putting<br>on a costume by the way I died in<br>Shortland Street five years ago so if<br>any of you are studying I think I think<br>I've seen her before I did Diane<br>Shortland Street it's a great role I was<br>an alcoholic I accidentally ran over a<br>child on the street I divided all my<br>work to the community and my nearest the<br>lesbian News it was in love with me<br>and tried to bring me back to life and<br>it was very dramatic over-the-top and<br>going off on a tangent so what I would<br>like to do now is to have one person<br>come up here and I'm just going to give<br>you an opportunity for one minute to<br>tell the audience what it is that you do<br>here what is your job the reason why I'm<br>doing that is a huge part of my work is<br>getting people to tell his stories in an<br>interesting way and getting them away<br>from all the academic jargon that we use<br>so I have a lot of jargon in my life I<br>know that this is about personal<br>branding but everything you see is about<br>your personal brand like as soon as I<br>met you I just thought you're amazing<br>you were so warm and just I don't know<br>just you were very real and<br>down-to-earth the greeting I had here<br>from Nicky was Amanda when I came in<br>here it just there was all thing to city<br>all around me I love being here it was<br>the feeling or the vibra was the people<br>just really really but anyway let's have<br>one person look I'm expensive one-on-one<br>so take advantage of me<br>use me up come up here I will make you<br>look good so don't worry about it<br>whatever happens up here will be<br>fabulous and if you hate talking in<br>front of groups grab this moment nudge<br>someone next year God give a clap right<br>how are you feeling<br>I like that how you feeling yes like I'm<br>just showing up from life it's really<br>really good so all I'm gonna get you to<br>do is look at this wonderful people I<br>know you can't see the back bro great<br>friendly faces who love and adore you<br>and just tell us what it is that you do<br>so just a few tips around being distract<br>and we don't want this we don't anything<br>that's closed we don't want this we<br>don't want dancing dancing fingers or<br>fiddling with the ring we don't want<br>playing with the hear but what we do<br>want is feet power up the shoulders nice<br>and strong and powerful and then your<br>breathing from your diaphragm you're not<br>breathing from up here which is shallow<br>breathing all right so it's like you're<br>looking like a champion you're not<br>looking like a monkey or a victim or<br>you're like a champion in life but just<br>great<br>tell us tell us tell us a little bit<br>on a computer for another student<br>it's very client centered so it's what<br>the student needs great give her a clap<br>stay here so give us some feedback how<br>did you were you engaged why tell her<br>why<br>someone put your hand up she smiled<br>we're 30 muscles in our face I wit with<br>somebody once never smile I was<br>just really smiling invites people great<br>what else<br>she looked oh ok she said when she said<br>Alice Alice she started gesturing after<br>a while yeah got it<br>yeah Alice yes yeah so this is yeah this<br>is like because everything has a<br>language like clothing has a language<br>everything has a language it's like well<br>I'm not really quite confident here so<br>what do you do with your hands if you<br>stand here and then even like this<br>you'll start to gesture so it's natural<br>like I love doing that because it feels<br>comfortable but we don't want you to do<br>that we want you to have open body<br>language what else what was she doing<br>well we were engaged she had eye contact<br>she was looking she wasn't looking at<br>the ceiling or looking at the floor<br>because I can't see Becky anything else<br>voice what was she doing with her voice<br>she yes so what we want in a voice is<br>highs and lows shade and color when<br>we're natural and we're enthusiastic we<br>will not speak on one level like this so<br>it's engaging with your voice<br>yeah and having some feelings what would<br>you like her to do that would make her<br>even larger than life or just more<br>move what else<br>anything else what could you do volume<br>okay the main thing I want you to do is<br>turn up the volume turn up the volume<br>okay so just so it's a little bit louder<br>do the same script again and and this<br>time you're allowed to act you're<br>allowed to fake it till you become earth<br>and it's just really even if it feels a<br>bit an authentic just a bit louder<br>people will listen to you if we can hear<br>that voice okay so yeah y-you got do it<br>again and even louder what what was the<br>difference in there we could energy<br>thank you it's just energy and that's<br>what we want people move toward energy<br>throw me some really curly questions and<br>anything about personal brand because<br>this is my favorite part and also but<br>what I want to say is after today when I<br>leave I am very accessible if you want<br>to take my card which is out the back on<br>the table<br>email me have contact with me and also<br>if you want some material like Maggie<br>can you send me a couple of videos could<br>you send me some tips from the book or<br>whatever I will do that for you I don't<br>want this to just be a a moment here of<br>talking about your personal brand but<br>before I do that in the back here many<br>of you will know about Elisabeth<br>kübler-ross who I have a lot of respect<br>for and I really really like what she<br>has to say here and she says people I<br>like stained-glass windows they sparkle<br>and shine when the Sun is out but when<br>the darkness it'san their true beauty is<br>revealed only if there is a light from<br>within so you<br>or the only one who can turn the switch<br>on you're the only one who can turn the<br>light on you decide whether you want to<br>refresh your personal brand you decide<br>what you want to do if you're shy and an<br>introvert and you're happy stay with<br>that do you decide whether you're happy<br>with the way you come across with with<br>you know I mean perception is reality<br>but you have to really be at home with<br>yourself and a lot of people when I say<br>in classes who can you think of a New<br>Zealand who's a strong personal brand<br>who do you think they say yeah just<br>Sunday I do and I say why and they say<br>because she's natural and when I saw her<br>and I know Jacinda and 1/4 Club Lounge<br>with her baby<br>and Clark trotting along with an<br>earpiece a little bag and I gave her a<br>big hug and I watched her go around that<br>lounge with baby and talk to everybody I<br>thought wow we've got it down to earth<br>Prime Minister he's so real and I was<br>just watching her body language and<br>listening to her and and just Clara can<br>I thought I never thought I'd ever see<br>this you know and and I can see why<br>people trust her so the more real you<br>are to your values and she's got strong<br>value it's the better but just thank you<br>for being here<br>may this be the beginning of a<br>conversation but I hope you also throw<br>me some hard questions<br>this just sit down here any questions<br>so before you talked about I'm leaving a<br>legacy behind I just want to know what<br>legacy you would like to leave behind<br>I'm so glad you asked that because I get<br>up every morning to make a difference<br>and on my grave I would like that she<br>made a difference she touched people's<br>lives<br>she moved touch and inspired people and<br>for me my mother has strong personal<br>brand she was kind and compassionate she<br>lives got 12<br>she had no education 13 kids in the<br>family and she was the most honest<br>person I've ever met in my life<br>the most compassionate and she was my<br>role model and I carry her she died with<br>me four years ago and and I want to be<br>known as someone who really changed<br>people's lives who helped people so I<br>work with people who have phobia of<br>public speaking I work with people who<br>have you know social anxiety who are<br>very scared and very shy I'd like to<br>know that I just touched people and and<br>and and I'd also like to be I just like<br>to say in their what I'm mostly proud of<br>in my life it's not the seven books<br>sorry not my books that are in seven<br>countries it's the way I was as a human<br>being around my mother and the way I<br>left London and came back and live with<br>her and looked after her so I'd also<br>like people to be able to say she cared<br>hi<br>thank you thank you and I think that is<br>so important to be vulnerable after mom<br>died I'm not a mother I became a mother<br>I didn't understand unconditional love<br>I understood getting up four times in<br>the night to get mom to the commode<br>that's caught unconditional love so just<br>going back to your question I cried when<br>I gave my first speech after she died I<br>just cried in front of the audience I<br>thought so embarrassed and then I looked<br>up they're all crying and it was<br>wonderful because it was a very<br>Polynesian Pacific Moldy audience who<br>just embraced me and when I left oh my<br>gosh I showed them how vulnerable I am I<br>said no Maggie you were real you showed<br>your human side so I think vulnerability<br>it's really important it's so important<br>so I say to clients I coach clients<br>often for the eulogy you know at the<br>funeral and I say if you're going to cry<br>that's fine but just pause and breathe I<br>my brothers were told don't cry don't<br>cry don't cry and that's what I saw I my<br>brother lives next door we often have<br>dinner together and he always cries when<br>it's something said about a child on the<br>news and I love it show your<br>vulnerability you know it's just water<br>show your vulnerability people you want<br>an audience to relate to you my job is<br>to not impress you my job is to you know<br>reach you and connect with you so I<br>yes I have I I film people play it back<br>film people play it back and I have to<br>do tough love I have to say look at that<br>you look like a robot and you sound like<br>a robot I love you but I want to know<br>who you are so I start interviewing them<br>I start interviewing tell me about tell<br>me about the children tell me about that<br>child and things come out my child is<br>being bullied at school and this is<br>what's happening so I drag I'm knowing<br>for someone who I get real things out of<br>people and then I go see who you being<br>now fantastic at the moment we're<br>working with academic who's about to go<br>to Canada make a speech there's so much<br>jargon in his speech it's frightening<br>it's terrifying<br>so my colleague Elly Weber is getting to<br>know who on the phone tell us who you<br>really are<br>and then she's saying I want more of<br>that woman in the speech I want more of<br>that you're afraid you know 10 years ago<br>I wouldn't have come in here and said I<br>had a phobia of public speaking and 30<br>years ago I gave my first keynote<br>address I wouldn't have done that I was<br>too into looking good but it was Marilyn<br>Waring who just started challenging me<br>and saying isn't it about time you were<br>truthful so what I do is I just keep on<br>talking to people and say particularly<br>with them in it's okay to be vulnerable<br>it's okay it's just because I see<br>awesome answer oh we have another<br>question right there yes well this is<br>very interesting I in the Australian<br>Women's Weekly<br>I told Judy Bailey a lot of things that<br>I've never talked to anyone in public so<br>in my family there is a lot of<br>depression mental health issues and so I<br>started talking about my battle with<br>depression my struggles with depression<br>my father's struggles with depression<br>and I said all Judy I don't know whether<br>I want you to talk about that oh gosh<br>and she said Maggie you will help people<br>you will help people and I could not<br>believe that here I was still afraid to<br>talk about the dark times and I've lost<br>so many friends to suicide to many<br>friends to suicide and I thought Maggie<br>honor those people honor those loved<br>ones on a CATIA<br>who hung herself honor her and left<br>behind two little children so that was<br>huge for me when it came out I just<br>wanted to shrink away and I thought<br>Maggie you just you you just wanting<br>people you're just trying to look good<br>and then I had CEOs and general managers<br>saying Maggie I had no idea I had no<br>idea you were battling depression for<br>all those years so it's just important I<br>think to think why am I here because I<br>make a stand around mental health it's<br>it's huge I've been to too many funerals<br>yeah I've got so many clients who are on<br>medication and in suffering from<br>depression so I have to remind myself<br>Maggie this is not about you right now<br>you need to reach people and help people<br>I don't know whether that answers your<br>question in a roundabout what around it<br>that way<br>thank you so in other words taking risks<br>taking risks and not worrying I love<br>this phrase it's none of my business<br>what anyone thinks says or does someone<br>gave it to me years ago<br>because as an actress as an actor I was<br>obsessed<br>we've got people thought of me it was<br>all about looking good any other<br>questions about no we might have time<br>just for one more question<br>yes yes oh I like this in the University<br>of lots of meetings in public relations<br>film we're always the meetings it's very<br>important in a meeting your personal<br>brand Shane's or doesn't shine know what<br>it is you're going to contribute to that<br>meeting plan it before you go in what is<br>my key message what are my three key<br>messages if there are three things that<br>I want to raise in this meeting like say<br>you want to talk about double standards<br>or something know what it is that you're<br>bringing into that meeting and and if<br>you're really nervous about saying<br>things roleplay it with somebody role<br>play it with somebody and I do a lot of<br>that because I do job interview<br>technique but also I believe it or not a<br>role play with people when they want to<br>ask for a raise want some more money so<br>actually know what it is and don't be<br>afraid to speak out but also think what<br>am i bringing to the meeting don't sit<br>back and expect to take take take it's<br>about networking I always say to people<br>think about what you're going to give<br>the other person think about what you're<br>going to think about serving the other<br>person not what can I get at that<br>networking event what can I contribute<br>and I always have a motto like leave<br>meetings leaving people great don't<br>blame no blame no shame no guilt don't<br>put people down I mean I'm on your side<br>Aloha I love that I'm gonna steal it I<br>mean I'm gonna steal that when I<br>facilitate I hope that answers your<br>question and I'm going to stay around so<br>you can come and talk to me<br>thank just want to say thank you I know<br>that you were running a little bit<br>behind so I had to cut some of the<br>speech short which I feel fine about<br>but come and talk to me and just keep on<br>being you just keep on being yourself<br>keep on being authentic and keep on<br>reaching out and asking for support from<br>but I hope you all have been as uplifted<br>as I was by this presentation<br>it's touching that once maggie stood<br>here perhaps a little trembling the way<br>that many of us feel at times and yet<br>you can see that she's clearly a force<br>of nature oh and her vulnerability yes<br>it is really quite a strength and it<br>takes quite a big person to share so<br>much of themselves with the room of<br>strangers and I'm really touched by that<br>some of the things that I took away is I<br>will be practicing my ex in the mirror<br>and we'll see how that going and what my<br>eleven-year-old son thinks of me when I<br>do that or my husband I love that she<br>brought up that instance of failure as<br>the beginning of a story and I think for<br>many of us we've had that experience and<br>and that is something to channel that's<br>something to harness as failure as the<br>beginning of a story I also love that<br>she gave us homework and so I hope that<br>you're mindful and that we have been<br>given homework it's actually the sign of<br>a really great leader and developer that<br>she wants us to go away and not just<br>think about how nice today was but go<br>and do something about that and keep<br>developing ourselves so I hope you take<br>that on board and lastly I also notice<br>the factor of legacy and it's a strange<br>thing that I have often looked at<br>gravestones and just as you were saying<br>and I've thought somebody else put that<br>on the gravestone but what will people<br>put on my gravestone and I hope one day<br>that that'll be a good thing and then<br>somebody puts on my gravestone so I<br>actually feel an affinity there and I<br>really love that but I hope now that<br>you'll join me in just giving her one<br>more big clap because I'm really<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
