Doctoral Winner and People’s Choice Award Winner, Yi-Han Wu (Auckland Bioengineering Institute) presents his research on “Recreating the tissue and cell damage after traumatic brain injury in vitro and in silico.”  Yi-Han goes on to the 2019 Asia-Pacific 3MT Competition at the University of Queensland.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I remember a few years ago<br>spirulina father moments after he began<br>he does again for kids around here this<br>is one of several experiences that I've<br>had with concussion a multiple of<br>traumatic brain injury or TBI what a<br>Steve Young exactly<br>simply put his brain damaged clothes<br>from an external force that leads to<br>brain deformation it negatively affects<br>memory and behavior where the most<br>common causes are false unintentional<br>trauma convivial for the twins TV eyes<br>are leading cause of death and<br>disability for people under 45 worldwide<br>there are 10 million hospitalizations<br>fatalities in its Estimator than an<br>additional fifty seven million people<br>have also experienced it it turns out<br>newsela has the highest incidence of TBI<br>which means that's almost certain that<br>each of us here will know someone has<br>experienced this injury today there is<br>no medication that can promote brain<br>fear or reduce brain damage and despite<br>decades of research we have failed to<br>successfully translate this into human<br>clinical trials and thus the need to<br>improve brain injury models that can<br>better predict the effectiveness of<br>therapeutic solutions that is why the<br>goal of my research is to reproduce TBI<br>in the lab and in a computer model the<br>focus of my research is looking at one<br>key feature of TBI scar formation it<br>thus confirmation plays an interesting<br>role initially where it contains the<br>damage and site of injury but later on<br>the sky become a barrier to for<br>recurrent before - we put a TV on the<br>lab to make these green devices could<br>actuators now these things are made of<br>unless the material sandwiched between<br>electrical components and when turned on<br>there a two strips things once made I<br>take it over to the brain lab where I<br>put human rat cells in them in their<br>strengthen themselves once damaged<br>I've been used variety of techniques to<br>analyze that study the biological<br>changes that occur due to the injury now<br>everything that's then my preliminary<br>results has shown significant gene<br>changes involved in Scott formation<br>which suggests that these devices can<br>model TV on earth what's up completed in<br>my experience work or then take all that<br>data and then using machine learning<br>I will produce a computer model that can<br>make accurate imagery prediction for<br>those who have suffered TB are ladies<br>and gentlemen is my phone then my<br>research can contribute to the game plan<br>that would not only defeat TBI but<br>hopefully one day knock out once and for<br>all</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
