font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>in November 1934 on a farm on the water<br>river<br>a 52 year old Scottish migrant had a<br>sudden and fatal heart attack she lived<br>behind a devastated young family her 19<br>year old daughter would grow up<br>positively like her mother she would not<br>survive little edge their daughter was<br>my Nana she eventually passed away aged<br>97 complaining she was surrounded by too<br>many old people every 90 minutes another<br>New Zealand another New Zealand family<br>loses a minute of cardiovascular disease<br>but how do you learn about<br>cardiovascular disease and now the key<br>science information for most people<br>their only opportunity to learn about<br>science is during the compulsory school<br>years even allowing for lifelong<br>learning opportunities for most adults<br>to learn about science a few and hard to<br>come by this is we museum exponent<br>museums can bridge that gap and provide<br>a unique learning opportunity to take an<br>extended people science literacy way<br>beyond the limits of the compulsory<br>school years my research looks at the<br>ways of museums contribute to science<br>literacy and communicate science<br>information by looking at the processes<br>and motivations of science museum staff<br>and visitors I'm doing this using in<br>case the owner of the Medical Museum<br>trusts pop up traveling exhibition brave<br>hearts the New Zealand cardiac story the<br>test the history of cardiac medicine<br>announcer or these notes are from that<br>exhibition and then we're visitors have<br>stuck this tourists to the wall of the<br>exhibition and they share these stories<br>of survival of loss and pleading with<br>the reader to care for the heart when<br>interviewed the exhibition developers<br>they say their goal was to see these<br>little haddock stories and how we live<br>the world for nearly 60 years pioneering<br>new technology with brave staff and even<br>braver patient my task and all of this<br>is to evaluate all that well this has<br>being done and how can be done better in<br>the future I'm amazing I'm doing this<br>using a mixed-methods approach I'm<br>observing this is an exhibition to find<br>out where the hot spots are and what<br>draws the<br>and following this up with a<br>questionnaire that uses a convenient<br>sampling method that allows me to assist<br>how does it have learn the data for<br>today comes from my first of three sites<br>the visitors sampled self-reported an<br>increased knowledge of cardiovascular<br>medicine as a result of visiting this<br>exhibition of 11 percent this seems very<br>impressive given that visitors generally<br>spend less than 30 minutes in the<br>exhibition now most of the research<br>that's being done on science<br>communication in museums before has been<br>done in North America it's absolutely<br>imperative that we do our own research<br>so we can find out what works for New<br>Zealanders that way New Zealand museums<br>have become more effective and more<br>engaging and communicating key science<br>information so hopefully one day in the<br>future would have fewer stories of loss</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
