Royden<br>Summerville who is also a regular<br>attendee of these incredibly important<br>events to each and every one of you know<br>my Hut am I welcome now in setting the<br>scene for tonight's event I think it's<br>really important that we all remind<br>ourselves that the path to professor<br>here at the University of Otago is not<br>an easy one<br>in order to achieve this promotion the<br>individual must demonstrate excellence<br>in teaching in research and in service<br>to the University and the wider<br>community now as you will learn through<br>his lecture this evening James is an<br>inspirational and motivating classroom<br>teacher he is also a very sought-after<br>and popular postgraduate supervisor in<br>addition to his teaching ability James<br>is also an award-winning highly cited<br>and very well-funded scientist and<br>tonight we will all have the opportunity<br>to learn more about his groundbreaking<br>research in the area of synthetic<br>chemistry and last but certainly not<br>least<br>James has provided exceptional service<br>to the university and to the wider<br>academic community so James on behalf of<br>the University it gives me great<br>pleasure to congratulate you on your<br>very well earned promotion to Professor<br>and I will now call on the pro<br>vice-chancellor of Sciences professor<br>Richard Barker to tell us just a little<br>bit more about James's academic journey<br>to professorship noreda<br>tena koe tena koe tow tena tato katoa<br>Vice Chancellor tena Quay deputy Vice<br>Chancellor Tina clay professor Crowley<br>in aqua professor Gordon teen aqua<br>friends and colleagues tena koutou tena<br>koutou tena koutou katoa it is my great<br>pleasure to introduce our speaker<br>tonight professor James Crowley to give<br>his inaugural professorial lecture at<br>the University of Otago as indicated by<br>the vice-chancellor professor Crowley is<br>one of our newer professors at the<br>University receiving a well-deserved<br>promotion to the position in February<br>earlier this year<br>born in Wellington professor Crowley has<br>a keen interest in Lego it appears so<br>from the building blocks of childhood<br>and adulthood as I understand it to the<br>building blocks of chemistry this began<br>with a BSc honours and from Victoria<br>University before going on to receive a<br>masters from Victoria and then to a PhD<br>from the University of Chicago while at<br>Chicago he won the Joan XI award for<br>student service and the Department of<br>Chemistry and awards will be a theme<br>that runs through this introduction<br>after completing his ph.d he then<br>crossed the ditch taking up a<br>postdoctoral fellowship at the<br>University of Edinburgh followed by a<br>second one at the University of<br>Edinburgh but this one with the title of<br>the Ramsey Memorial postdoctoral<br>fellowship this is the most prestigious<br>UK postdoctoral fellowship available to<br>chemists from the Commonwealth at the<br>end of his time in the UK professor<br>Crowley joined the University of Otago<br>as a lecturer in 2008 and began a speedy<br>journey through the academic ranks<br>seeing him awarded promotion to full<br>professor just ten years later professor<br>Crowley is a synthetic chemist which I<br>think means he makes stuff in particular<br>he and his research group design and<br>synthesize new functional molecules that<br>have uses as antibacterial and<br>anti-cancer agents he also works on a<br>range of solutions to problems and jerk<br>drug delivery<br>in catalysis applications which I think<br>means making things work faster or<br>better<br>professor Crowley has received<br>significant grant support along the way<br>including from the Marsden fund from the<br>New Zealand Royal Society twice the<br>Otago Medical Research Foundation and<br>the Royal Society through his leadership<br>he has won a number of awards including<br>the New Zealand Institute of chemistry<br>morris wilkins center prize for chemical<br>science of 2017 this prize is awarded<br>annually to the top chemist in New<br>Zealand he won the Royal Australian<br>chemical Institute organometallic<br>chemistry award in 2015 this is awarded<br>annually to an early career<br>organometallic chemist in Australia or<br>New Zealand professor Crowley is the<br>first and only New Zealander to have<br>received that award The Chemical Society<br>of Japan Asian international<br>distinguished lectureship award was won<br>in 2015 and in 2013 the Royal Society of<br>Chemistry and the New Zealand Institute<br>of chemistry Easter field medal<br>professor Crowley was made fellow of the<br>New Zealand Institute of chemistry in<br>2014 and then a fellow of the Royal<br>Society of Chemistry in 2016<br>he's an associate investigator in the<br>McDermott Institute and as a member of<br>the New Zealand Institute of chemistry<br>national council has been for seven<br>years and he is the current president of<br>that Institute in addition to his<br>research he is also an outstanding<br>teacher at both undergraduate and<br>postgraduate level he has every reason<br>to be proud of his postgraduate<br>supervision record 16 PhDs 5 master<br>students 15 honours students in just 10<br>years as outstanding in 2015 and then<br>again in 2017 he was a finalist in the<br>Otago University Students Association<br>supervisor of the Year awards in<br>addition to time spent as an academic<br>professor Crowley is also quite the<br>coach he was the assistant coach of the<br>under 7 whites<br>than Rugby Club which he coached to rip<br>a rugby team of the year assistant coach<br>and coach of the Sinclair rippers t-ball<br>team assistant coach team Watson grade<br>four Albion junior cricket assistant<br>coach strikers grade 9 and then grade 10<br>with melchester Rovers tonight professor<br>Crowley is going to describe his<br>personal and academic journey and<br>enlighten us on his research into<br>molecular scale construction please join<br>it's working<br>fantastic it's but worrying to be<br>standing up front here because most of<br>that when I started out a long time ago<br>as an undergraduate didn't think I'd<br>either end up as a professor so it's um<br>it's nice and it's yeah something to<br>live up to I guess so my talks going to<br>outline a little bit about what we do in<br>my group and as people have said some<br>theater chemists we make stuff and this<br>is a quote from a long time ago and I<br>started Otago and I was on the Enz I see<br>the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry<br>Tiger branch and a new PhD student and I<br>both join the branch and the students<br>said to me Oh what is it that you don't<br>Sarma synthetic chemist and they'll also<br>you just make stuff in a kind of I<br>thought derogatory kind of way and I<br>think it's a misunderstanding that<br>actually making stuff is not that easy<br>and it's kind of important and so I<br>start with this slide a lot to try and<br>get across the importance of synthetic<br>chemistry the quote there is not mine as<br>it says George Hammond said the most<br>fundamental and lasting objective the<br>synthesis is not the reduction of new<br>compounds but the production of new<br>properties and so that's what we try to<br>do in my group and so you can see from<br>the slide that you know there's a lot of<br>areas where as a chemist you can<br>contribute to you can contribute to<br>biology and we have some excellent<br>collaborators and biological departments<br>around the university and contribute to<br>material so your iPhones and computers<br>are made up of synthetic molecules that<br>synthetic chemists built obviously you<br>needed physicists and engineers and<br>other people to help out but chemistry<br>is central to all that and so that's<br>what we do and there are many things<br>that we can continue to contribute to<br>catalysis and energy are both very<br>important current problems in the world<br>and so that's where some theater<br>chemists can be useful and that's that's<br>part of what we we spend our time doing<br>and Richard Orie stole my thunder<br>and my children who are there help me<br>make this and this is<br>perhaps how I ended up as a chemist<br>maybe not but I'm lucky that my parents<br>when I was little bought me some liquor<br>maybe the previous generation of some<br>theater chemists that was Mikado but in<br>my generation it was Lego and so I had a<br>lot of Lego sets when I was little I<br>didn't realize that would turn me into a<br>synthetic chemist but apparently it did<br>and basically synthetic chemistry can be<br>thought of as like Lego that you can use<br>building blocks to build up new<br>materials now of course that's you know<br>Lego and there's I think the guy from<br>the lego movie whose name escapes me and<br>he's building something with that Lego<br>and that's basically what we do but we<br>do it with atoms and so we're using<br>atoms as building blocks to make new<br>materials so that's our lego building<br>block set that's the periodic table and<br>of course it's the International Year of<br>the periodic table and so there's now<br>118 elements in the periodic table many<br>of the ones right down the bottom are a<br>bit useless to some theater chemists<br>because they don't last long enough but<br>further up the top particularly that one<br>in the middle with the C on it and the<br>one that I'll about circle now carbon is<br>what most people think of is the most<br>important element for synthetic<br>chemistry and so synthetic chemistry<br>really came out of organic chemistry and<br>that's the chemistry of carbon and<br>carbon only has four electrons it has<br>three different kinds of geometries<br>really but it's a pretty versatile and<br>amazing element most of us are made up<br>of carbon team molecules and so organic<br>chemistry particularly was the<br>foundation of synthetic chemistry and<br>and still remains the major part of it<br>and so we have a fantastic chemistry<br>department with a number of organic<br>chemists and they continue to build<br>brilliant molecules using just carbon<br>and these elements around the side of<br>carbon mostly and the reason that they<br>do that even now is because biological<br>molecules and most of make a carbon and<br>a lot of the drug molecules that we make<br>come from nature and so those organic<br>chemists and my department often try and<br>make these natural products and look at<br>them for their drug interactions sadly<br>I'm not an organic chemist so we can't<br>just use carbon or at least my group<br>doesn't just use carbon we use a bit<br>more of the periodic table probably that<br>although even that's an over estimate<br>and we so we try and tie in organic<br>chemistry and coordination chemistry or<br>the chemistry of the d-block which is<br>that but that's circled transition<br>metals and the like to build more<br>complex molecules now unlike natural<br>products a lot of these molecules we<br>don't know what the properties will be<br>when we start out we try and designed in<br>interesting properties but we're not<br>always successful and you'll see that as<br>I talk about some of our systems today<br>so how did I get here I got told I had<br>to say this and so this is how I ended<br>up at least an academic at Otago as I<br>said well Richard said I was born we're<br>not Wellington but in Lower Hutt so<br>pretty close and it's basically<br>Wellington but cooler and I started<br>school and lower heart were in tighter a<br>long long time ago I'm not gonna say<br>when but I was lucky my dad who's for<br>some reason taking a photo of me at this<br>very point in time was in the army and<br>so we moved around a bit and I lived in<br>Singapore and then why roof great place<br>white roof good for skiing and then<br>Palmerston North name we moved back to<br>Wellington so I had lucky to be in a<br>number of different schools a lot of<br>different teachers all of whom pretty<br>inspiring we moved back to Wellington<br>Lowe went to college at Wellington<br>College and that's probably where I got<br>into chemistry I had a really good<br>chemistry teacher at Wellington College<br>and they encouraged me to do chemistry<br>at University and so I went on to<br>undergraduate in Victoria Victoria the<br>University of Wellington despite them<br>trying to change the name I'm not going<br>to and I did my undergraduate there my<br>dad wouldn't let me just do chemistry he<br>thought that there was no way that you<br>could end up with a job if you were a<br>chemist so he insisted that I do first<br>year law which I did I hated every<br>minute of it but I did get into second<br>year law and then decided that it really<br>wasn't for me and stuck with the<br>chemistry and then of course I had to<br>make a career out of chemistry and I<br>still didn't really do that as an<br>undergraduate I got to third year<br>chemistry and I got inspired by one of<br>my lecturers or professor Jim Johnston<br>he was I think his actual title was<br>professor of industrial chemistry and<br>it's definitely not what I do but he was<br>interested in trying to take silicate<br>materials from geothermal fields and<br>fine<br>for them and I was very lucky I got to<br>do a third year project with Jim and<br>that got me interested in research it<br>also made me realize I didn't want to do<br>that for research but it got me<br>interested in research and so as a<br>fourth-year state honored to honors and<br>I did that with this this guy here dr.<br>David with a burn and he's a<br>coordination chemistry is how I ended up<br>I guess an inorganic coordination<br>chemist that I am now so I worked in his<br>research group for a year and then I<br>decided I'd quite like to do a PhD but I<br>didn't want to do it at Victoria so I<br>started looking for PhD overseas and<br>then I did them same time but a master's<br>with David and then David blessin<br>decided that he'd take sabbatical and<br>left me all alone in my masters and so<br>that's why there's another face on that<br>slide there professor jim john spencer<br>sorry he he helped me out on my masters<br>and allowed me to finish that and then i<br>somewhat fortuitously having met this<br>guy here bryce Basler she had a<br>conference whilst doing my Master's got<br>a PhD scholarship to go to the<br>University of Chicago and so that's how<br>I ended up doing a PhD all the way on<br>the other side of the world going from<br>Wellington which was nice and safe and<br>interesting over the period of Chicago<br>which was completely different kettle of<br>fish and I see David Warren up there and<br>he knows what I'm talking about<br>the American PhD system is not like the<br>New Zealand one it's well minimum five<br>years and this coursework and that part<br>was okay but also those candidacy exams<br>and various other hurdles along the way<br>and it was a bit of a change of pace<br>from New Zealand to to Chicago when I<br>got there also there was an expectation<br>although luckily not on my group<br>although he was a little bit crazy he<br>wasn't completely crazy and he only<br>expect me to work six days a week<br>whereas most other groups expect you to<br>work seven days a week<br>somehow I survived my time in Chicago<br>and ended up moving to the UK and doing<br>a postdoc with Professor Dave Lee who's<br>shown there and at the time dave was an<br>Edinburgh and it was great<br>expen two and a half years there my<br>postdoc with him and because of then I<br>ended up getting this job here at Otago<br>which<br>is very nice and basically what I do now<br>is a conglomeration of things that they<br>taught me along the way so what my<br>research group does now is shown here we<br>think of with a lot of different areas<br>and we have a lot of collaborators who<br>make this possible it says on the top<br>synthetic inorganic super molecular<br>chemistry so not organic chemistry but<br>organic chemistry plus metal ions and<br>plus super molecular chemistry which is<br>non covalent and we try and apply it in<br>different areas we try and make macro<br>cycles and we do that so that we can<br>make these interlocked architectures and<br>that's what I learned when I was in Dave<br>Lee's group that's what his research<br>group does and they're interesting to<br>try and make molecular machines based on<br>biological molecular machines but I<br>won't touch on that today the other<br>things that we do a lot of is these<br>self-assemble cages here's one here what<br>I'll discuss later and catalysis and<br>photoactive materials and that's all we<br>make the materials and then we study the<br>properties through collaboration and<br>then the last thing and this is<br>something that I started when I got to<br>Otago we're trying to apply some of our<br>molecules and medicine now we haven't<br>been particularly successful but we're<br>working towards developing new kinds of<br>drugs or new drug delivery agents and so<br>that's what the group does and a lot of<br>it has seen it around this reaction here<br>which I'll talk about in a second but<br>it's a click reaction and the reason<br>that we like that is because it's easy<br>to do Cinthia to chemistry if you want<br>to make new functional molecules you<br>want to be able to make them easily and<br>change them easily and that's what the<br>click chemistry allows us to do so<br>because I would forget normally and get<br>to the end of be rushed and panicked I'm<br>gonna thank all my collaborators who've<br>helped us out over the years and more<br>importantly all of the students know as<br>Richard said I've been real lucky I've<br>had a lot of students and a lot of very<br>good students and they're all listed<br>here I'm not going to name them all but<br>these ones at the top they've all worked<br>on my group either as honor students or<br>masters students and I've been really<br>lucky to have good honors and good<br>masters students those are the ones who<br>haven't gone on to PhDs<br>the ones below this bunch here are all<br>PhD students either in the group at the<br>moment or past PhD students many of them<br>started out as honest students most of<br>our students come from Otago we've had a<br>few international students but we've<br>been really really lucky in the<br>so we had in my group and then in<br>addition to that also had some research<br>assistants Pauline when I started she's<br>still in the chemistry department she<br>helped me out at the beginning kelly<br>kalpen and dr. Schaffer both of them<br>came here for short research assistant<br>positions before moving on to jobs<br>elsewhere in chemistry and then Henry<br>third-year student so there's my group<br>currently I think most of them here it's<br>a glorious photo that we took the other<br>day outside my periodic table that I've<br>been trying to build on the wall in the<br>chemistry department and so these two<br>here Sam and Tristan are current honor<br>students dan Quinn James Finley Jeff and<br>Rowan and Lynne are all current PhD<br>students although James is just<br>graduating or will be next Saturday and<br>then net and Henry and so that's my<br>current group and I think them for all<br>the things they're doing at the moment<br>but I won't talk much about what they're<br>doing because we haven't finished it the<br>other people have helped me out a lot my<br>collaborators and as I said some theater<br>chemists make stuff and there's no point<br>making stuff of it doesn't do anything<br>that's interesting and most of the time<br>we just do the making part and then we<br>need help to find out whether it's<br>actually interesting and so we have a<br>lot of good collaborators many of them<br>just in the chemistry department so<br>Keith Gordon who is the current head of<br>department in law Hampton is our past<br>head of department both collaborate with<br>my group social producer Nigel Lucas<br>makes some fantastic organic materials<br>that we are then joined together with<br>our materials and he's been a<br>long-standing collaborator David Morin<br>John macadam and and a garden all helped<br>with in the chemistry department to make<br>our science better and so I think them<br>for their help over the years outside of<br>the chemistry department but still<br>within the university I've got a number<br>of biological or collaborators to help<br>doing biological experiments so dr. Greg<br>Giles and pharmacology and associate<br>professor Heather Brooks and in<br>pathology and then Joel Tyndall and<br>Brian monk have also helped us out over<br>the years as well and then outside of<br>the university all of these people and<br>this is not an exhaustive list these are<br>the people that we've got grants or had<br>published papers with but we collaborate<br>with other people as well but all of<br>these people have helped our science out<br>over the years and so I thank them<br>because without them it wouldn't be as<br>good as well it wouldn't be as nice as<br>it is and in many funding agencies<br>somewhat to my surprise over the years<br>have decided to give us money so we<br>thank them as well so what do we do well<br>we've got several major areas of<br>research but one of which is this click<br>chemistry and so click chemistry is an<br>our idea it was developed by a number of<br>people it's an idea of doing synthesis<br>in an easy kind of way where you can<br>bring two components or more together<br>and high yield without having to do any<br>purification really that's the idea<br>behind it so but like Lego and the<br>molecular sense nice straightforward<br>reactions one of those reactions is this<br>one shown in the slide here it's the<br>reaction between an alkyne in an azide<br>and if you have a copper 1 catalyst they<br>will form this 1 2 3 tries or and<br>certainly before I started a Targa this<br>was well known it was first rediscovered<br>I guess in 2001 by two different groups<br>folk and Sharples and mid owl discovered<br>this independently and people used it to<br>make polymers make organic molecules<br>bring bioactive materials together but<br>one thing that we thought we could use<br>it for that other people hadn't really<br>touched on you was to make ligands for<br>metal complexes which is what we do and<br>so these ones down the bottom pyridine<br>by pyridine and 2p things that are used<br>a lot of and my PhD and in my postdoc<br>very common nitrogen donor ligands that<br>will bind to metal ions and they're<br>great but they're difficult to<br>functionalize sometime more importantly<br>sometimes they're expensive to<br>functionalize you need to use sometimes<br>palladium catalysis to make new ligands<br>from these so what we hope to do was to<br>try and use click chemistry because<br>copper is very cheap in chemistry is<br>very robust and we were very concerned<br>when I started our target I'd never get<br>any funding from anyone and so we needed<br>an inexpensive way to access our<br>molecules and so we thought since no one<br>else has been using these in<br>coordination chemistry maybe we could<br>look at the fundamental chemistry behind<br>that and see if they were coordinating<br>metals and see if we could then make<br>functional metal complexes using this<br>approach so we developed a couple of<br>well a method to making these ligands<br>and we chose a ride range of different<br>functionalities to tack off the Scion<br>biologically interesting functionality<br>like steroids and sugars to just normal<br>organic functionally arrows and other<br>things to tune both hysterics and<br>electronics and other components of of<br>the ligands and so this one was meant to<br>be bit be like bidentate ligand and<br>these ones true to peel I tried in tape<br>and so you can access them from<br>relatively cheap starting materials then<br>we needed to know would they bind metal<br>ions the other thing that we did this is<br>all one pot and so if you're a synthetic<br>chemist these yields don't look that<br>impressive fifty percent is pretty<br>terrible ninety-five is much better and<br>sometimes we only got fifty percent but<br>that's because we're doing two reactions<br>in one pot we're making the azide and<br>then we're clicking onto the azide to<br>make the triazole and you say well why<br>do you do it that way why don't you make<br>the A's Ivan isolate it and the reason<br>is and this is the one wrinkle under<br>this whole story is there's either<br>explosive I didn't really want to<br>destroy any undergraduates when I first<br>got to Otago so we developed<br>methodologies using other people's ideas<br>to make the azide and such you and then<br>click onto them so that we didn't<br>destroy any reaction flasks and in this<br>particular case where there are only<br>mono azide so it wasn't such a problem<br>but we also had this goal of making more<br>complicated ligands like shown here and<br>these are poly ezard's and these are not<br>a little bit explosive these are very<br>explosive and so you don't want to<br>isolate any of these and so we would<br>have developed those methodologies and<br>other people's ideas to make these<br>ligands and that was our first goal and<br>then we're able to these pictures that I<br>keep flashing up on crystal structures<br>so their molecular structures this is<br>what the molecules look like and that's<br>really the only data I'm going to show<br>today but so we're able to access these<br>ligands and then we had to look to see<br>whether or not we could coordinate<br>anything to them and so we started with<br>some pretty simple things silver<br>palladium and we took the mono triazoles<br>just to see if they'd behave like<br>pyridine now the chances are they<br>weren't going to because there's two<br>nitrogens and these trials only one<br>nitrogen and pyridine and perhaps<br>unsurprisingly what we found was silver<br>will bridge and form these bidentate<br>metal complexes which was not what we<br>were hoping<br>but another metal lines like caladium<br>which is one of our favorite on its use<br>middle ice use forms a hurting like<br>complex and monodentate interaction so<br>they got versatile coordination<br>chemistry which was nice from a<br>chemistry standpoint we're also able to<br>show that if you methylate these tries<br>ice you can make these trials Illidan's<br>which are cationic and then you can<br>deprotonate them and make carbine like<br>with a metal liners bound through a<br>carbon atom here and here to the midline<br>which is a different kind of way that<br>these triazoles can form metal complexes<br>which is kind of cold as well<br>now that's great that's new chemistry<br>that stuff that no one had known<br>beforehand we're able to grow crystals<br>of various different things prove that<br>we had the right thing but really what I<br>see at the beginning is the whole point<br>for making these compounds wasn't just<br>to make new compounds that's not what<br>we're into we wanted to find new<br>properties and so we were quite lucky<br>these gold complexes related gold<br>complex is well known to be could tell<br>our catalysts and for organic<br>transformations and I as a postdoc and<br>Edinboro had a collaborator the<br>colleague they're now professor Eileen<br>Lee who's at heriot-watt University in<br>the UK and we were postdocs together and<br>we met up at a conference and she was<br>looking for new gold catalysts she was<br>upset with the ones that you can buy<br>from chemical suppliers they weren't<br>very good they didn't do the things that<br>she wanted them to I said ah we've just<br>made these new gold carbines you want to<br>take a look at them and so Eileen and<br>Kelly and James Wright who was a joint<br>student with Nigel Lucas made a family<br>of these gold carbine complexes and<br>studied there they could tell us us and<br>the upshot is that they are careless<br>they do a number of different normal<br>gold transformations<br>Eileen showed that they're good<br>catalysts actually better than the<br>commercially available ones but what was<br>disappointing was he made a family where<br>we could change these to bits<br>we sterically and electronically altered<br>them James Wright and this did a<br>fantastic job but none of that making a<br>library and having a whole series of<br>catalysts to look at actually improve<br>the initial catalysis and so they're<br>good catalyst but they're not great<br>catalysts which is a little bit<br>disappointing but it shows the<br>versatility of these triazole compounds<br>and james acid' was a joint student with<br>Nigel Lucas in Nigel as<br>it really makes these fantastic<br>carbon-rich materials and so as part of<br>that program James made this fancy HBC<br>linked triazole material it's got this<br>huge benzene like core super benzene<br>attached off the side and just the<br>crystal structure of the Salone is a<br>fantastic feet and then James looked at<br>the catalysis of these palladium<br>compounds as well we were hoping again<br>that the the large organic unit would<br>allow these compounds to be recycled but<br>also to change the catalytic properties<br>unfortunate in this case whether these<br>are these materials and the smaller<br>materials are palladium catalyst for a<br>very common suzuki coupling reaction<br>they're not any particularly better than<br>commercially available materials so we<br>can make new materials and they are<br>catalytically active but not always<br>better than what's known already then we<br>got back on to trying to look at by<br>dente and try dentate materials and we<br>made a whole family of new materials<br>based on these by dentate Perl triazole<br>ligands needed to know how they would<br>behave and so they behaved in general<br>how we would think take a midline that<br>likes to form a square planar geometry<br>shown here that's what you get with<br>these ligands just silver likes to form<br>tetrahedral geometry that's what you get<br>with these ligands octahedral metal you<br>get three ligands around the middle and<br>they form in this particular case<br>isomers but they behave pretty much the<br>same way that the burfi ligands do and<br>so all the chemistry is like poppy<br>chemistry but with this functionality<br>off the side and so then we started<br>thinking well can we do something useful<br>with these materials and so that's when<br>I was very lucky professor Keith Gordon<br>as a has a group where they're<br>interested in spectroscopy emission<br>spectroscopy Raman spectroscopy and so<br>they in collaboration with and this<br>series of compounds in collaboration<br>with take him who was a 390 student<br>studied these rhenium complexes and<br>found that their missile which is what<br>rhenium complex has tend to be but<br>interestingly when we made a library of<br>these table 2 library would change the<br>Sagar about the side we found that the<br>mission properties don't change at all<br>and so that was an interesting<br>dissapointing initially but interesting<br>because we were hoping by changing the<br>group off the side we would tune the<br>emission properties but it doesn't do<br>that at all and we found this is<br>relatively common in these materials you<br>can change that<br>a group off the side of the pebble<br>triazole without changing the photo<br>physical properties now that might not<br>be particularly useful for a lot of<br>things but in biology and we haven't<br>done this but other people have run with<br>this you can therefore change the<br>solubility of your a massive group this<br>ruthenium Iranian sorry peridot triazole<br>change the solubility by putting<br>something else out the side or even<br>target these materials by putting<br>biologically targeting groups off them<br>and then use them as biological probes<br>and missions and emission spectroscopy<br>and so even though we've not done it our<br>methodology is allowed other people to<br>move in that direction and we have gone<br>on and looked at other materials photo<br>physically active materials and this is<br>a compound that Jeff will was Jeff yeah<br>I can't see how yes Jeff made this when<br>he was an honor student and other people<br>in our group have gone on to study these<br>photo active materials in conjunction<br>with Professor Gordon's group so that's<br>one area where these materials are quite<br>nice quite interesting the other area is<br>actually for biological activity and<br>when I got here I knew very little about<br>biology but I was very lucky that a<br>number of people have collaborated over<br>the years with us and so I went to<br>another conference and professor Janis<br>Aldridge right who is the long-standing<br>interest in platinum anti-cancer agents<br>came up to me said I could you make us<br>some platinum complexes will screen the<br>activity of those materials for you<br>because I think they could be really<br>cool and so we made these platinum<br>complexes here it's a platinum there<br>there's our ligand and then Janus has<br>these dire menus that she puts on the<br>other side of these materials and so<br>made again a family of Perl trials or<br>complexes because we can turn that our<br>group using the click chemistry very<br>easily and we showed that all of those<br>compounds have high activity many of<br>them are more active than the well-known<br>anti-cancer agents cisplatin<br>unfortunately and Dan helped out with us<br>and he's sitting there with his hat on<br>smiling away because he knows the story<br>unfortunately they're not more active uh<br>sorry they're not selective for cancer<br>cells and that's a reoccurring theme and<br>a lot of our work we were able to make<br>materials that kill cancer cells but we<br>don't have any selectivity and so that's<br>a work on but these materials can be<br>tuned due to the robustness of the click<br>chemistry that we use to make them<br>and that brings me to this which is all<br>about antibacterial resistance and so<br>we've been really lucky because if we<br>have these compounds and we can tune<br>their properties by changing the the<br>clip symmetry we fought or we got very<br>optimistic and we thought that we could<br>use it to attack this antibacterial<br>resistance problem now obviously<br>antibacterial agents are very important<br>bacteria caused a number of diseases and<br>we've had great antibacterial agents<br>based on organic materials for a very<br>long time but the issue is that people<br>misuse don't take the whole course of<br>the antibiotics and bacteria just in<br>general developed resistance by<br>themselves and so over the years we<br>haven't been developing enough new<br>antimicrobial agents and so we've got<br>now this resistance problem and you can<br>see here these are all well known<br>organic and ipoh perak agents and the<br>starting point on the graph is when they<br>were introduced to the market and the<br>other daughters when resistance occurred<br>and every single one of them resistance<br>develops sometimes quicker sometimes<br>slower but resistance develops in all<br>cases because we never destroy all of<br>the bacteria with these individually so<br>really we need to be developing more and<br>more antimicrobial agents as we go<br>through and as I said all of these ones<br>were purely organic but there was some<br>old literature and then some more recent<br>literature that suggested that maybe<br>metal complexes might be able to be<br>antimicrobial and we thought given we<br>have this click approach and we can make<br>libraries of compounds maybe we can add<br>to this and so some very nice work from<br>a group in the UK they developed this<br>thing that looks a bit like some of our<br>ligands and they made mineral complexes<br>all but they made iron complex ruthenium<br>complex showed it will bind DNA and more<br>importantly they had a paper where they<br>measured its antimicrobial activity now<br>this is pretty rubbish it's not very<br>good but it's active and so we thought<br>maybe we can get and into this and build<br>on what they insured because we can<br>change bits of our molecules certainly<br>the central space of it and the various<br>parts of our molecules to improve the<br>activity and just as we were starting to<br>do that another group made a series of<br>compounds where they did alter the<br>central space of it and they found more<br>impressive activities the lower that<br>and Herbert tree concentration is the<br>better those numbers are starting to get<br>towards useful so we thought maybe we<br>could contribute to this and also my PhD<br>supervisor Bryce Posner she worked for<br>this guy<br>Dwyer and back in 1952 Dwyer showed the<br>ruthenium complexes with these<br>financially ligands for antimicrobial<br>agents actually had quite good activity<br>and because of the emergence of<br>resistance richard keen who's an<br>Australian chemist started to relook at<br>those who are Atheneum complexes and<br>found that some of the start whether<br>some of the materials that doir<br>developed and also these die metallic<br>materials have good activity against the<br>range of bacteria including mosa so<br>based on that we thought we must be able<br>to do something here with our click<br>chemistry<br>I'll let the cat out of the bag and say<br>that we haven't but we tried so we<br>started with this and this was with a<br>PhD student that I had from India Sri<br>Sri her vellus so Sri and he made this<br>family of compounds where this unit<br>looks a lot like the Hana materials but<br>we because we had the click approach we<br>could change the central space you know<br>we thought there's bound to find a more<br>active material when we do this and we<br>didn't know too many biologists back<br>then but Joel Tyndall offered his help<br>he's a computational model of mainly but<br>he often to help calculate whether these<br>materials would bind into DNA and<br>silicon and also he knew Brian monk and<br>so Joel and Brian had a student test<br>these materials against not bacteria but<br>a yeast and the long story short is we<br>made this vast library of materials and<br>not a single one of them was active<br>against yeast or indeed bacteria when we<br>went on a test of that and that was a<br>bit disappointing and we were but<br>puzzled by at all because they're very<br>similar to the known compounds but they<br>don't they're not at all active so we<br>had to fiddle around and try and trace<br>the reason why they were inactive and it<br>turns out in our case that the spirital<br>trials of our teef is a little bit<br>weaker donor and so the ligands are just<br>pulled off the ions and therefore the<br>compounds disintegrate before they get<br>anywhere near the bacteria to show any<br>activity so we thought we could get<br>around that and the simple way to get<br>around that is just to choose a<br>different metal eyelets more inert or<br>more stable and misc in the sense of<br>biological materials and so we went to<br>ruthenium which of course had all<br>have been shown to be biologically<br>active but the problem with that is that<br>if you go to ruthenium it's harder to<br>make these dye metallic materials so Sri<br>was able to make one compound for this<br>one here there's the crystal structure<br>of it so we know we've made it and<br>luckily at this stage we had talked to<br>here the Brooks and she helped us to<br>test the antimicrobial activity of this<br>material showed no activity against<br>gram-positive bacteria but it showed<br>some still not great activity against<br>common gram-negative bacteria coalesce<br>and we thought we might be on the right<br>track so then we went and we looked at a<br>another series of metals this tastes<br>cobalt and this is work that was started<br>by an old friend of mine from when I was<br>a PhD who came here to do a brief<br>sabbatical Mike's remit was finished off<br>by Rowan who's sitting up there and then<br>we tested these compounds he made a<br>small library of these cobalt compounds<br>and test them against bacteria and again<br>none of these materials were active in<br>this case it wasn't because they<br>decomposed we were able to confirm that<br>we're not really sure exactly why but<br>other people in literature suggest that<br>the high charge this is now six plus<br>charge means that those compounds won't<br>cross the bacterial membrane and get<br>into the bacteria to show activity which<br>was kind of disappointing so then most<br>normal people would have given up at the<br>stage because clearly we're not very<br>good at this policy but not my group so<br>we decided with backtrack and die<br>metallic wasn't any good we'd go mono<br>metallic um tree started this work he<br>built a whole library of ruthenium based<br>systems that are a lot like the Dwyer<br>and Keene systems where we just changed<br>that nature of the our group and I think<br>he made about twenty compounds and two<br>of them turned out to be active but when<br>you had a hit rate of almost none that<br>was pretty good<br>and so the two that turned out to be<br>active or when the our group was a hexyl<br>chain or an aqua chain and those had<br>pretty good activity had mi seas of<br>about eight which isn't terrible and<br>then when we screened them against<br>stefan aureus when we screen them<br>against the wider variety of bacteria<br>they had even better activity against<br>methicillin-resistant Staph aureus about<br>one when out seemed pretty good it was<br>an issue with these materials that<br>they're a mixture of isomers and didn't<br>we separated the isomers that didn't<br>matter which one we had they're both<br>active to the same level but they're<br>also chiral and we couldn't separate out<br>in the amount<br>and therefore we couldn't really pursue<br>them any further because can't give<br>people Cairo materials that aren't that<br>aren't pure so we thought we could get<br>around that we could just change the mid<br>line use a different MEDLINE see if we<br>could get other compounds that are<br>active so we looked at rhenium again<br>because we made lots of reading<br>compounds and we found their if they're<br>neutral so there's a chloride or a<br>neutral ligand on the bottom of the<br>rhenium they're not active at all if<br>they're mono cationic one plus then they<br>have some activity but they're not<br>particularly active again it was the<br>ones with alkyl chains Hicksville chain<br>they were active but the charge seems to<br>be important to have activity in these<br>compounds so then we thought well we can<br>get around the Iceman's while making a<br>tried into ligand which we know how to<br>do and or we can use a different metal<br>liner platinum in this case we're<br>playing a metal ion which gives the same<br>charge and inertness in a different<br>shape and both of those approaches work<br>Quinn and Dan and Sanur who's not here<br>but all contributed to making these<br>materials and the Platinum compounds are<br>active antimicrobial agents as are these<br>Rephaim Ian the strident eight compounds<br>but the the strident eight ones are not<br>as active as the platinum materials and<br>of course at this stage we thought would<br>probably need to know something about<br>how they work so we did some preliminary<br>biological mechanistic studies and we<br>found that these compounds here seem to<br>penalize the cell membrane of the<br>bacteria at least in gram positive<br>bacteria that's a lot like what happens<br>with these cationic surfactants and<br>maybe that wasn't a huge surprise we<br>thought whoa k that that makes sense but<br>what's a little bit puzzling to us at<br>the moment and this is an ongoing<br>ongoing story is that these materials<br>which are very similar in a cationic and<br>it's have the same chain length to<br>peanuts it's the ones with six seven and<br>eight chains that are really active they<br>don't seem to term you lies the membrane<br>in the same way so they seem to have<br>multiple modes of action and the<br>Platinum compounds are even more<br>interesting they're the most active ones<br>they have a different shape they're flat<br>with chains off them and we don't really<br>know how they work at all so this is an<br>ongoing story and that platinum stuff<br>was unpublished as we're trying to piece<br>together exactly how the compounds<br>actually can invoke the antimicrobial<br>activity but unfortunately biology I've<br>discovered is very extreme<br>and I have no funding to to pursue the<br>mechanistic study so I need some grants<br>in order to to get this to move forward<br>if anyone wants to help so that brings<br>me the second part of the talk and<br>second part of the group it's all metal<br>based chemistry again and this is what's<br>known as self-assembly and again this is<br>an area of chemistry and my wife now<br>giving me rolled eyes and yawning that's<br>good to know is to make macro cycles and<br>cages using metal ions and the lability<br>the metal ions means that you can<br>assemble these macro cycle cage like<br>materials you can do this with organic<br>chemistry but the mid lines allow us to<br>do it on much higher yields and a number<br>of groups around the world do this<br>certainly not just my group and the<br>people shown at the bottom really<br>developed this area and the one person I<br>want to point out is sitting over there<br>dr. David Morin who's you know putting<br>his head down and pretending like he<br>didn't do it but this material here at<br>the bottom is one of the most common<br>approaches to making cage-like materials<br>and that's the approach that my group<br>users now as well to make these into L<br>for cage materials and Dave developed<br>that when he was a postdoc at the<br>University of Canterbury so you can use<br>these caged materials to bind other<br>molecules that's why they're interesting<br>you can buy pollutants you can bind<br>reactor molecules here's white<br>phosphorus you can just buy in random<br>things because you feel like doing it<br>look at the electronic properties<br>they're very versatile he's got these<br>cavities and through super molecular<br>hydrogen bonding other forces that are<br>non covalent you can assemble things<br>inside them and you can even do<br>catalysis that's what this one here so<br>that's why we're interested in these<br>materials for what isn't shown there is<br>that just as we started attacker group<br>made a cage material that they found a<br>drug in and it wasn't really a drug but<br>it was a drug like molecule and they<br>showed that it would carry that molecule<br>into cells and so we thought maybe if we<br>were clever we could use one of these<br>cages to bind a real drug a known drug<br>and use that to deliver a drug molecule<br>into cancer cells and so the drug we<br>chose was cisplatin because mainly<br>because with coordination chemists and<br>the most or anti-cancer drugs organic<br>but cisplatin is a plate<br>an anti-cancer drug there's three that<br>are well used platinum drugs that are<br>well used in the clinic with cisplatin<br>is probably one of the most famous and<br>the reason it's famous is it's one of<br>the drugs that helped Lyon sound strong<br>when seven Tour de France's one of the<br>drinks yeah anyway we designed this cage<br>based on some chemistry that we've been<br>doing with these ligands and we thought<br>from molecular modelling that it would<br>fit cisplatin and it does well in the<br>modeling at least so we have seen with<br>this cage it's easy to do and there's an<br>end of my early I don't really want to<br>talk about that and we were able to show<br>there's a crystal structure so that's<br>how we tell a lot of times now the anime<br>just confirms that the cage is intact<br>and solution but more importantly the<br>anime also tells us that if we throw<br>cisplatin then that this peak here which<br>is that proton in there and the NMR<br>spectrum shifts and moves and that means<br>cisplatin binds inside this cage cavity<br>which was pretty exciting because<br>cisplatin a set of actual drug this was<br>the first example of someone buying an<br>actual drug inside a cage cavity and<br>then we're able to even more excitingly<br>get a crystal structure to show how it<br>binds and we're somewhat surprised but<br>also happy that we've actually finally<br>put two cisplatin bound with in this<br>cage cavity it wasn't what we thought<br>modeling looked like it would fit one<br>but Jamie Lewis who did this work<br>crystallized this material has two<br>cisplatin bound in the cage that was<br>pretty cool Jamie went on to show that<br>we can also then release those cisplatin<br>so if we add a nucleophile in this case<br>either demamp or chloride<br>dmap not at all biologically relevant<br>that just shows that we can disassemble<br>our cage and chloride which there is<br>plenty of in the body also just the<br>symbols the cage and allows us to<br>recently release this us planning and so<br>that would be really cold and I'd love<br>to tell you that that works an actual<br>biological media but it doesn't those<br>with eagle eyes will see that all of<br>this was done in a seat of nitrile which<br>is most definitely not what is our blood<br>is made of and so we needed to improve a<br>few things and the problem is the system<br>itself was held into this cage through<br>hydrogen bonding and water is very good<br>at hydrogen bonding so we needed to<br>improve the water solubility of this<br>cage we needed to make it more stable in<br>the presence of biological nucleophiles<br>chloride being one but many others as<br>well this cage rapidly disintegrates and<br>so although being able to release the<br>suppress and is important we need to be<br>able to do it<br>I'm scale that actually is slower than<br>what we currently had and then also we<br>need to enhance the host casement<br>direction so the cisplatin doesn't just<br>fall out when you put it on water so my<br>group spends a lot of time trying to do<br>all of those things and this summarizes<br>a lot of person hours in the lab<br>building new materials and unfortunately<br>there's no good finish to this story but<br>I'm going to summarize some of it anyway<br>because some of the people who did it<br>are sitting here we took the starting<br>lead material and we made a whole bunch<br>of different compounds by using our<br>click chemistry and we could alter the<br>properties of the cages we could make<br>them photo physically interesting<br>Keith Gordon's group again helped us to<br>study those who could make the redox<br>active but most importantly eventually<br>we could make them water-soluble and<br>when we did that cisplatin no longer<br>bound in the cage cavity which was a bit<br>disappointing it does still work and I<br>see tonight Roy as you can see here this<br>is a crystal structure if you do the<br>assembly and then do the binding of<br>cisplatin and see nitro still works just<br>fine but in water when we finally made<br>the cages water-soluble doesn't work at<br>all and that's because we using hydrogen<br>bonding for the cisplatin in there so<br>we've got a real problem we're trying to<br>fix that we took an alternative approach<br>to make these materials water-soluble<br>thinking that maybe it was the triazole<br>that was causing all the problems so Dan<br>put these Pig or I call like water<br>soluble eyes and groups off the side of<br>the cage and he showed that we still<br>make cages and they still bind cisplatin<br>to see the nitrile but as soon as put in<br>the water again<br>no cisplatin binding which is kind of<br>disappointing but that's the way it goes<br>sometimes<br>that cage in its own right though we<br>found another interesting property led<br>to a Marsden granite we can switch that<br>cage between cage and a macro cycle and<br>we can potentially then turn on and off<br>catalysis which is what the Marsden<br>grant is about now with something that<br>we're trying to work with so it's not<br>all bad news I guess we then also took<br>it even though we were struggling with<br>the binding we looked at some other cage<br>materials where we could try and improve<br>some of the other properties we were<br>looking at trying to improve the<br>stability of the cages and so this is<br>again work from Dan Preston but also<br>Rowan who's there as well they both<br>looked at putting either electron<br>donating groups off the cages or<br>sterically blocking groups off the cages<br>to try and improve the stability of<br>these cages<br>against biological nucleophiles and in<br>both cases that successful these cages<br>are now<br>more stable against biological<br>nucleophiles we even tested their<br>anti-cancer activity and they're<br>actually active anti-cancer agents in<br>their own right but unfortunately when<br>you do this kind of material you get<br>this twisting of the cage so even though<br>they're more stable now they're no<br>longer biases plating at all so that's<br>kind of a bummer and then also an<br>attempt to try and enhance the<br>host-guest and direction hold the<br>cisplatin and more tightly we altered<br>these groups here which are alkynes two<br>air aisles and then also to enter scenes<br>which are just even bigger arrows and<br>I'm trying to fully enclose the<br>cisplatin within the cage cavity network<br>was all done by take him in<br>collaboration with a social proof of<br>Nigel Lucas and I made a lot of nice<br>cages that way and none of those biases<br>play neither so this is this is where<br>the story in this particular case ends<br>it's all a bit disappointing and we<br>probably will never do use any of these<br>palladium cages to deliver cisplatin<br>unfortunately but that doesn't mean that<br>other people haven't had more success<br>taking this cage approach and looking at<br>different drugs so having failed<br>miserably to deliver any cisplatin to<br>cancer cells you start desperately<br>looking for other applications that you<br>can use a cages for and so we were lucky<br>again I went up to a conference and I<br>meant associate professor Brendan Abrams<br>who's a chemist at the University of<br>Melbourne and he said have you tried<br>binding co2 in your cages looks like<br>it'll bind co2 really well no not try<br>binding I don't know how he said I've<br>seen them to me we'll we'll have a look<br>at them and so Dan made a series of<br>cages and these materials surprisingly<br>to us but maybe not on hindsight buy and<br>co2 reasonably well co2 of course is a<br>greenhouse gas have been able to bind it<br>it's kind of important and it doesn't<br>bind a lot in palladium being very<br>expensive probably suggests that it's<br>not the best way to bind co2 out of the<br>atmosphere probably needs some of this<br>but cheaper but it's a starting point it<br>shows the kind of things you need to<br>design these materials and so again it's<br>hydrogen bonding with the co2 units<br>calculations showing this that allows us<br>to suck the co2 into the cage cavity so<br>it's a starting point for maybe looking<br>at different applications and another<br>thing that again takes advantage of the<br>hydrogen bonding array that these cages<br>provide is this as what's known as a<br>diels-alder reaction and this is not<br>work from my group but when<br>working with this group so another old<br>friend of mine Paul Lusby who was also a<br>postdoc in the lis group and Edinburgh<br>when I was there he discovered that our<br>cage does the Steel's order reaction so<br>Rowan's been to paws group a couple of<br>times now and we're starting to try and<br>apply some of our cages to see if we can<br>alter the dealer's order reactivity and<br>our materials probably shouldn't go on<br>forever but so Dan was able to show from<br>some of the materials that we did make<br>that we're able to do things that people<br>hadn't been able to do before so we<br>wanted to use these cages for doing<br>useful things one of the things that<br>actually most cages that are developed<br>in the literature are at the moment is<br>they're made up of the four same ligands<br>and so what we found because we have a<br>family of ligands that we could look at<br>dan looked at these different amino<br>substituted ligands and showed that one<br>of them just the two amino one could<br>lead to hit r electric ages than made up<br>of two different types of ligands and<br>that was the first time that people have<br>been able to show this normally what<br>happens is you either get a horrible<br>mixture as shown in this cartoon or you<br>get self sorting for one kind of ligand<br>over the other because it's a bit of<br>donor ligand but when Dan took the two<br>amino ligand this one here and ty traded<br>it in with a preformed cage we made this<br>kind of material it's the first time<br>that anyone was able to do that and we<br>weren't able to prove it initially and<br>ended and I've glossed completely over<br>the horrendous amount of work that went<br>into this and Dan smiley because he<br>knows it's true we weren't able to grow<br>crystal structure of a very long time or<br>so keith gordon group again helped us<br>out jonno Barnsley did a calculation<br>that showed us that we were getting<br>probably a sis orientation with these<br>ligands around the Palladium which is<br>kind of cool and the referees weren't<br>happy with that so then Dan did probably<br>a thousand titration experiments and in<br>a more experiments to prove the sis<br>orientation of the ligands and we<br>finally got it published because it was<br>the first example having two different<br>ligands on a cage and then of course as<br>the way it always works Dan was able to<br>crystallize it to prove that indeed it<br>had this sis orientation now the reason<br>that's interesting from host-guest<br>chemistry standpoint is now we can alter<br>the actual cage cavity or the outside of<br>the cage and a more fine-tuned kind of<br>way before we had only high symmetry<br>either all proteins or not<br>means here you can see in this one we've<br>got per Dean's and benzene groups and by<br>using this chemistry we hope to be able<br>to do more specific molecular<br>recognition kind of events and then one<br>thing that would be useful and drug<br>delivery but that is also very difficult<br>to do is to make big cages that bind<br>lots of drugs and so there are lots of<br>people and you can see some here who<br>have made very large cages but none of<br>these really hold on to gas molecules<br>very well and so we wanted to try and<br>design some systems that we could bind<br>multiple guest molecules and with the<br>idea of doing drug delivery in the<br>future and we actually made something<br>similar when I was a PhD student others<br>have made these kinds of linear<br>complexes where they have multiple<br>cavities and so Dan and Jamie Lewis took<br>this challenge on and it made these two<br>ligands here and made these multi cage<br>assemblies where you've either got two<br>cavities or three cavities joined<br>together in these cages now we're able<br>to crystallize one but it's multi cavity<br>Architects you can see it binds and the<br>solid-state guess molecules but it's<br>this one that's far more interesting<br>because it's got a pyridine Lyon cavity<br>here and here in a benzene line cavity<br>there and what Dan was able to show and<br>he don't have to go into the details of<br>the data and how it shows you but what<br>Dan was able to show is that we can put<br>cisplatin in the pyridine line cavities<br>at the ends and cisplatin will not go<br>into the central cavity because it<br>doesn't have the pyridine to hydrogen<br>bond to but what we can put in the<br>central cavity is a different guest<br>molecule in this case is a pretty dull<br>guest is triflate which is a common an<br>iron we also put two triplets on the<br>outside and so in this new multi cavity<br>architecture we're able to bind to<br>different kinds of guests in different<br>places selectively now again in this<br>particular case there are guests and<br>also exciting and cisplatin is but<br>truthfully it's not but it allows us to<br>start thinking about can we do a<br>reaction or one cavity and then transfer<br>that to the different cavity and do<br>cascading type reactions using these<br>multi compartment host case compounds so<br>we think that has great potential in the<br>future and so I've been watering on for<br>a very long time and it's time to finish<br>this is the last tour slide on my<br>science and this again is larger cavity<br>cages that by multiple guests and so<br>this is where we're going with a lot of<br>this material this is a big cage that<br>binds these guests here that shows<br>interesting guest binding behavior in<br>the sense that it'll blind guests when<br>water is present but not when it's not<br>and that's because you need the<br>hydrophobic effect to drive these geese<br>in but the cage will blow multiple<br>guests and that opens up a possibility<br>of bringing in two different kinds of<br>guests and interacting together to do<br>some kind of catalytic reaction so<br>that's where we're pushing forward now<br>and again that was work jointly done<br>with Nigel Lucas and might take him and<br>this to show that we can actually do<br>some kind of catalytic reaction this was<br>an idea of an Preston's just the what it<br>was finishing his ph.d he brought<br>together the two different parts of our<br>research program cages and triazoles<br>because why not and he showed that if<br>you take this ligand with a platinum<br>here and use palladium you can assemble<br>these large so the doughnut shaped<br>materials now they're kind of cool in<br>their own right if you're a said<br>synthetic chemist but they're also kind<br>of cool because they were these panels<br>will interact with aromatic units and<br>and one particular aromatic unit of a<br>bond was anthracene and Dan was able to<br>show that will actually absorb light and<br>photo activate oxygen in turn that enter<br>scene into this endo peroxide it does<br>that catalytically now I have to tell<br>you that it's really good at that but<br>it's not does that for a little while<br>and then it decomposes because it's<br>quite harsh reaction conditions but it<br>shows that not only can you do drug<br>delivery and that kind of thing but you<br>can also think about using these cages<br>as enzyme like materials and do<br>catalysis as well and that's pretty much<br>it we make a lot of metal complexes we<br>try and do something useful with them if<br>we use clique approaches we use cages<br>and sometimes if we're lucky we get cool<br>reactivity or biological activity we<br>certainly like it to be better but<br>that's a work on for the future and we<br>we're not done yet hopefully so we'll<br>keep going and keep practicing and<br>thanks again to all of my collaborators<br>and all my students and coworkers<br>you know without them I wouldn't have<br>any of this to talk about but there's<br>also some other people I want to thank<br>because it's not all about the research<br>that you do sometimes this is about you<br>know learning how to do the job and<br>learning how the university works you<br>know I was really lucky there as well<br>I started professor Keith hunter was<br>that Cody and he gave him my job and so<br>very thankful to him and all of the<br>things that he told me when I started<br>out also thanks to Lyle<br>I hid after Keith and definitely helped<br>me learn how to be an academic help me<br>with teaching help me with trying to do<br>the right thing around the department<br>and Keith as well as been a great mentor<br>but also Dave Larson who's sitting there<br>and is in the office next door to me<br>taught me a lot about how to do teaching<br>both in lab and elections and made me a<br>bit a far better a teacher than I was<br>when I got here and so thank you Dave<br>and for all of the help that you've<br>given me over the years and then there<br>are other people who are here when I<br>started who also helped out get into lay<br>of the land I'm not there all without<br>retired but I think all of them for<br>their input early on in my career we're<br>very lucky in the chemistry department<br>have a number of excellent technicians<br>Ian and Ginny and also at the moment<br>China is helping out as well and then we<br>also have a fantastic glass blower John<br>Wells who helped us out with materials<br>that we needed in the lab when we<br>started out things that we couldn't<br>access easily we had excellent<br>administration people unfortunately they<br>both now moved on but Teresa and pup<br>always helping us out and our admin team<br>and everyone else in the Department of<br>Chemistry who've been there along the<br>way and also these people somewhat<br>foolishly gave me their own money to<br>help do some of our anti cancer research<br>Charlotte Dobson is actually an 8 year<br>old and she's the niece of Palermo<br>boundry who's a lecturer or a senior<br>lecturer in the chemistry department<br>Charlotte donated me $20 to do our<br>anti-cancer work and so that was very<br>kind of her Pauline Lane and ocean<br>bridge donated us considerably more<br>money to continue that kind of work<br>which is very kind of them<br>and their most importantly these people<br>over the years<br>my mum and dad her up there have<br>supported me even though dad's probably<br>still not forgiven that I quit law<br>hopefully thinks that it didn't work out<br>too badly and my sister who's not here<br>emma has also been there for a long time<br>for me and then my wife and my children<br>who put up with me going away to<br>conferences especially my children put<br>up with me going away to conferences<br>when their birthdays are cuz northern<br>hemisphere conferences are on when their<br>birthdays are and have to bring back<br>very large presents to say sorry thank<br>thanks very much James my name's Keith<br>Gorham the intuitive chemistry I'm just<br>going to give a vote of thanks and it's<br>just amazing what James is done I mean I<br>think what I was thinking I was writing<br>down some notes I thought were two<br>things sprung to mind one was nano Lego<br>which I quite like the idea of I'm in<br>chemistry especially the ability to make<br>materials is a really cool thing that<br>chemistry can do that frankly no other<br>subject can do it's as simple as that<br>so that's kind of cool but what was I<br>think James's talk really showed that oh<br>please getting nature to do it for you<br>doesn't kind the the one of the<br>interesting things I think that James<br>talked about a Lobos actually as<br>interaction with Jim Jonsin because it<br>really reminded me that that Jim I know<br>Jim Johnson quite well as James does and<br>Jim's very applied scientist and<br>although much of what what really drives<br>James's research is quite well is is<br>fundamental one can always see him look<br>to try and engage with other areas and<br>and enable other Sciences with the the<br>innovative work that he's done I think<br>in looking at what he's done I think the<br>first thing is remarkably almost<br>ridiculously modest about how difficult<br>some of these things are to make I mean<br>there and it's it's of course for those<br>of us who study materials you can't make<br>solar cells or photo catalysts with like<br>new materials you can't make mobile<br>phones without new materials so they the<br>ability to make new materials that have<br>new properties is incredibly important<br>and I think James sort of took us<br>through that entire area is very nice to<br>see is his frugal nature and the use of<br>the click reaction using copper one<br>chemistry although generally as a Judy<br>of chemistry I don't like to use the<br>word explosive also because of my accent<br>I don't like to use the word explosion<br>either we like to call them very<br>reactive materials and James of course<br>is demonstrated beautifully click<br>chemistry incredibly powerful<br>methodology and in developing new<br>catalysts and then working with<br>collaborators to to shew that and then<br>in developing the by dentate complex ARB<br>identity<br>to make complexes that he did he really<br>kind of stumbled upon something he's<br>been far too modest about not as the<br>ability to make a compound that has one<br>property here and then when you fiddle<br>with it over here it doesn't screw<br>everything up<br>that's actually really those who don't<br>know any chemistry that is really<br>difficult really really difficult to do<br>so it's fantastic that he was able to<br>use that Shore tune if you like tune the<br>nano leg over here while not interfering<br>with the properties that were quite<br>important I think also in the story of<br>James's antimicrobial work I mean this<br>is a real the first lesson I was ever<br>taught by a postdoc when I started was<br>that the first lesson of researches<br>disappointment and there is obviously a<br>lot of disappointment that work but it<br>also really demonstrates the<br>determination of James and as her search<br>group to just keep digging away until we<br>find something useful and in that case<br>they were able to show indeed they were<br>able to show that sure their initial<br>compounds didn't work but then when they<br>went back and tried these other<br>ruthenium compounds they actually are on<br>the cusp potentially of finding a new<br>way in which the metal complexes are<br>going to disable bacteria and then in<br>the final part the self-assembly to the<br>self-assembly is rather like you just<br>you just ask the nun or I go if thought<br>itself together you don't really do<br>anything that sounds awfully easy but I<br>think there's a little bit more to it<br>than that but that that's a wonderful<br>way to actually create molecular<br>encapsulants so and so you can obviously<br>the target was to look at cisplatin and<br>that again an awful awful lot of work a<br>lot of things didn't work but then of<br>course discovering that you could switch<br>between a Mac recycle and a cage and<br>therefore switch on and switch off<br>catalysis and then of course we don't<br>have to encapsulate cisplatin you can<br>try co2 and you can encapsulate reagents<br>that you're going to actually facilitate<br>things like the diels-alder reaction so<br>I think that and then of course in the<br>final part that ability to make hetro<br>applications the idea that no you're not<br>just asking the leggo to self-assemble<br>but you're asking certain colored Lego<br>to assemble on this side and a different<br>color to assemble and that side I mean<br>that's a remarkable breakthrough in term<br>of high that self-assembly works and<br>really offers materials which<br>effectively have different phases that<br>have different properties so it's an<br>incredible I think story through a whole<br>series of really quite difficult and<br>challenging chemistry on a real I think<br>not only fantastically innovative<br>thinking<br>but such sheer determination to get it<br>to work it gets something useful out of<br>it by reaching out across science and<br>across with other scientists to make the<br>most of what is really very clever<br>fundamental chemistry so if let me just<br>finish by I we sure appreciation for<br>Jim's and I think I'm going to give him<br>a gift not yes in a few James can come<br>up I will give them a gift why do you<br>applaud</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
