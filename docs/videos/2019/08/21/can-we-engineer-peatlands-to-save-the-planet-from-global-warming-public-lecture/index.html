against working here at the<br>University of Waikato and I see a lot of<br>faces that I suspect they're not from<br>the University so a very big welcome to<br>you thank you for coming along this is a<br>a series that is a relatively new series<br>of the Environmental Research Institute<br>and so we're very lucky today to have a<br>Chris Freeman from Bangor Wales here<br>Chris and I met we were just talking<br>back in about 1996 or so when we were<br>will find another one<br>we met in Perth at a our conference on<br>on wetlands and ever since then our<br>paths have kind of crossed back and<br>forth and Chris's probably best known or<br>at least one of the main things that<br>he's known for is the endemic latch<br>theory and I think we'll hear more about<br>that today and also observations of<br>increases and dissolved carbon coming<br>out of aquatic ecosystems fingers<br>crossed and that work has led to several<br>papers in nature through time so he's<br>like just for a minute so if I can<br>download another copy of this have you<br>okay folks thank you very much for your<br>patience we have beaten technology I'll<br>keep it short let's go professor<br>Chris Freeman thank you thank you Louie<br>and thank you all for hanging around<br>rather disturbing moment there whether<br>we're gonna see anything at all but<br>great to see that we've got something at<br>least so what I'm going to be talking<br>about today is something called the<br>enzyme ik latch and one of the ways that<br>we may be able to use this mechanism<br>called the enzyme ik latch in all of our<br>lives going forward so here's a picture<br>of a typical welsh peatland just a few<br>miles away from my home University in<br>Bangor in North Wales and there's lots<br>of work on these wetlands out there as<br>this work was going on in the very early<br>years something quite unusual was found<br>in a pea plant quite close to this one<br>and basically in that peatland<br>a severed head was discovered in the<br>peat buried in the peas the local police<br>were so concerned that they went around<br>doing house-to-house inquiries convinced<br>that a murder had taken place locally<br>and sure enough they went to one of the<br>houses and the the guy who lived there<br>well his wife had gone missing about<br>five years earlier and they put two and<br>two together and charged him with the<br>murder of his wife and the guy actually<br>confessed to this murder but while all<br>this was going on the home office<br>scientists the government scientist is<br>from routine tests on this head and<br>basically they wanted to test whether<br>the head was actually put into the bog<br>in the same timeframe that his wife was<br>reported missing so they did carbon-14<br>dating and when they did this the<br>results were rather surprising it was<br>actually a head of over a thousand years<br>of age so this guy obviously confessed<br>to totally the wrong murder well you're<br>probably thinking what has all this got<br>to do with the peatlands themselves and<br>what I'm going to show you as we go<br>through my presentation today says it<br>has absolutely everything about it and<br>the reason is that peatlands show<br>something really incredible what they<br>display is a spectacular failure of<br>something that we would take for granted<br>in any other ecosystem and that's the<br>process of decomposition when you put a<br>severed head in a peat bog it basically<br>doesn't break down and after a thousands<br>of years you could be in real trouble at<br>some point in the future so what I'm<br>going to do as we go through this is to<br>look at this rather unusual property<br>so I'll start off my presentation by<br>explaining of this about what we believe<br>is causing this failure in decomposition<br>and how we discovered this mechanism<br>that we've called the enzymic ledge<br>and I'll move on to explain what the<br>implications of the enzyme 8 latch are<br>and why's of significance to all of us<br>here in this room today so let's think a<br>bit about this failure in decomposition<br>that we've seen there that's clearly an<br>interesting scientific topic to do<br>research into and basically sort of<br>thought the best way of tackling this is<br>to go right back to fundamentals and to<br>look at what it is that brings about the<br>normal process of decomposition and as<br>we all know it's all about<br>microorganisms microorganisms break<br>things down<br>ultimately into carbon dioxide but they<br>have to have this rather important<br>ability to be able to achieve that and<br>that ability is the production of<br>extracellular enzymes the extra so your<br>own size take the high molecular weight<br>material like the severed heads in the<br>outside world break them down into small<br>low molecular weight chunks that they<br>can then get into the microbial cell and<br>allow the complete process of<br>decomposition to takes place and<br>discover why it is really that<br>decomposition doesn't take place very<br>effectively in other words if we can<br>understand what is controlling the<br>production of these engines<br>extracellular enzymes we can understand<br>this whole unusual process that we can<br>now normally in most ecosystems when we<br>want to measure enzyme activities it's<br>actually a very simple process we just<br>use something called a a model substrate<br>it's a chemical compound consisting of<br>two halves half of it it's some kind of<br>marker and the other end is a target so<br>take for example an enzyme like<br>phosphatase which is an enzyme that<br>breaks phosphates off of organic matter<br>the marker would be some kind of<br>chemical that changes its properties<br>when its bond between that and the<br>target compound the phosphate is broken<br>so an enzyme comes along breaks that<br>bond the properties of the marker<br>compound change and we simply measure<br>the rate at which that marker is<br>released into the chemical solution to<br>get an idea of how quickly the enzymes<br>are operating in these weapons barbies<br>sounds very simple very straightforward<br>and certainly in every other ecosystem<br>this has been a standard approach that<br>everyone has been able to use very<br>effectively so whether you're looking at<br>agricultural soils or the depths of the<br>oceans this is the way that you would do<br>it time to try this in a peatland<br>and it just didn't work and part of the<br>reason for that is that when we look at<br>the water in a people and it tends to be<br>this rich deep brown color now can you<br>imagine that if you are trying to<br>measure a change in the properties of a<br>solution that marker compound abundance<br>against a dark brown background it<br>becomes very difficult to measure a<br>color change because very difficult to<br>measure fluorescence release so in a way<br>that's part of the reason why it was so<br>difficult to measure enzyme activities<br>in these environments<br>so much in the way of these interfering<br>phenolic compounds in the soil solution<br>these compounds are phenolics you may<br>know them by other names like tannins or<br>hue mix or polyphenols essentially all<br>the same sort of thing these brown<br>colored chemicals that are so abundant<br>in this type of wetland and obviously we<br>realized that if we were going to stand<br>any chance at working out what was<br>controlling the enzyme activities in<br>this system we needed to find a way that<br>we could get rid of that brown color and<br>study the release of the probe that the<br>model substrates target compound without<br>that interference and after a couple of<br>years we managed to come up with a nice<br>technique using high-performance liquid<br>chromatography which basically separates<br>out the interferences from the marker<br>compound that we're interested in in<br>measuring so this slide just shows now<br>these are showing me marker compounds<br>coming out of the bottom of the column<br>there and there is that compound that we<br>actually want to measure comes out of<br>the column after all the interferences<br>there for the very first time we could<br>measure enzyme activities in these<br>peatland environments and clearly once<br>you've found a way of doing this this<br>gives you the opportunity to open up<br>this field to try and understand what it<br>is about wetlands that makes them so<br>special when it comes to the process of<br>decomposition<br>well the first thing we tried in these<br>wetlands to try to understand why<br>they're so different to normal<br>terrestrial systems was to go out to the<br>field and dig up cause of peat that we<br>could then bring into the laboratory and<br>basically simulate drier conditions in<br>those cores of peat and the basic idea<br>is make it more like a dry land and<br>you'll be able to see what it is about<br>the properties of that peat that changes<br>as the conditions become drier so what<br>do we see well here we can see enzyme<br>activity on the y axis a period of time<br>of this experiment taking place the wet<br>is the control they're showing<br>relatively low enzyme activities and as<br>we lower the water table and make it<br>gradually drier you can see that there<br>is more in the way of enzyme activity so<br>in theory it also needs to be tied<br>together quite nicely we've got this<br>system where enzyme activities become<br>more active when they would make the<br>wetland more like a dryland you'll<br>notice that for the first time in my<br>talk today I've mentioned specific types<br>of enzymes and what we're looking at in<br>this particular slide is hydrolyzed<br>enzyme activities the hydrolysis are the<br>important wants to study basically<br>because hydrolases are the main enzymes<br>involved in decomposition they are the<br>enzymes that solubilize all of that high<br>molecular 8 material and make it<br>available for the microbes in the system<br>so it all seems to be working well so<br>far I guess the next link in the chain<br>is showing that when you stimulate the<br>activity of the enzymes you also<br>increase the amount of the the ultimate<br>end products of decomposition from the<br>system which is the release of carbon<br>dioxide so here we're looking at co2<br>production<br>it's that same time period you see the<br>lowering of the water table here the<br>control again and this line here shows<br>what happens to carbon dioxide release<br>very clear evidence that when we make<br>the conditions drier you not only turn<br>on the hydrolase enzymes we also turn on<br>the production of carbon dioxide<br>something that we wouldn't normally<br>expect to see at this sort of level in<br>these people and systems all it's very<br>simple and very straightforward and I<br>remember submitting these results to my<br>first journal in this topic and quickly<br>getting the reviewers comments back<br>saying well this isn't very interesting<br>we already know this stuff you know we<br>know that you make a wetland drier and<br>it releases more co2 and the reason is<br>as the referee's pointed out microbes<br>are right sit with oxygen present and of<br>course enzymes they need oxygen as well<br>is previously nobody had actually<br>measured these enzyme activities in the<br>wetland so really nobody actually knew<br>that that was what was going on here it<br>was all just an assumption at the time<br>most of my funding came from the Royal<br>Society in the UK<br>Britain's Academy of Science and they<br>have a motto that's been around since<br>the very early days of the society back<br>in 1660 when Sir Isaac Newton was one of<br>their founding members<br>basically that motto is nullius in verba<br>take nobody's word for it and that was<br>actually a very apt saying here because<br>whilst everybody already knew that this<br>was going to be the case an actual fact<br>nobody had made those measurements so we<br>really need to check out those<br>assumptions<br>so the first starting point for checking<br>out those assumptions was to look for<br>other ecosystems which are depleted in<br>oxygen just like they are in peat lands<br>one of the things about people is that<br>we all know is that when the soil is<br>waterlogged the oxygen can move into<br>that soil 10,000 times more slowly than<br>it would do if oxygen was just using in<br>the air it's very difficult for oxygen<br>to get into these people and<br>environments because of that the<br>conditions are anaerobic and that is<br>clearly a type of environment where we<br>can look for comparisons with other<br>systems and the two most commonly<br>measured ecosystems where people have<br>looked at anaerobic conditions are<br>anaerobic sewage digesters and the rumen<br>and then aerobic stomach compartments in<br>sheep and cattle so in theory what this<br>should show is that the composition is<br>actually very slow in these systems but<br>when we look at for example hydrolase<br>activities to see whether a lot<br>hydrolase activity is low in the rumen<br>of a cow or in a<br>and aerobics looser gesture completely<br>wrong despite the fact there's no oxygen<br>present hydrolyzed enzyme activities are<br>very very high if we look at<br>decomposition if we look at microbial<br>metabolism again we find that in both of<br>these systems the activities are very<br>very high despite the fact that there's<br>no oxygen present so this idea that this<br>was a very simple observation that we've<br>made just didn't seem to tie together<br>because clearly there are places other<br>than peatlands where anaerobic<br>conditions does not shut down the<br>process of decomposition so the big<br>question is if it isn't oxygen that's<br>controlling it what is it of course the<br>next stage in this process was to go<br>back and do a few experiments to look at<br>the enzymes themselves and to see what<br>the enzymes did in the presence and<br>absence of oxygen so an aerobic systems<br>here the aerobic the opportunity<br>abundant systems and what you can see<br>here is that well for these particular<br>enzymes that maybe has a little bit of<br>an increase with sulphate a's perhaps a<br>bit of a decrease with beta glucose i<br>days maybe a bit of an increase with<br>phosphatase these are nothing like the<br>differences that we would expect if<br>oxygen was an on/off switch in this<br>system and regulating what was going on<br>first we thought well maybe we've just<br>picked the wrong three enzymes these are<br>any of you measure modulate enzymes you<br>know these are the three cheapest that<br>you can buy plus we just make the big<br>mistake it just came for the tea pons<br>tried a whole range of different title<br>eight enzymes all of them show the same<br>thing it doesn't really seem to matter<br>whether oxygens present or options acts<br>and<br>hydrolases seem to work quite<br>effectively but they one day we decided<br>to look at another enzyme enzyme called<br>phenol oxidase and that particular<br>enzyme responds responded massively to<br>the increased abundance of oxygen so<br>there's clearly something going on here<br>something that can give us clues as to<br>what's going on in many ways it seems<br>very simple and straightforward and<br>maybe you'd conclude that the feel of<br>stays is what's responsible for the<br>decomposition fact it can't be that<br>simple<br>there's another question in all of this<br>if the hydrolases don't mind whether<br>oxygen is present or absent why then is<br>it that when we made the wetland<br>conditions drier that we saw the<br>hydrolase enzyme activities go up<br>there's clearly a bit of a paradox in<br>this takes quite a while to try and<br>unravel what's going on but those are<br>not already in what we've told you so<br>far all the clues are already there so<br>let's have a look at the very first clue<br>that helps us to explain this the first<br>clue comes from looking at essentially<br>what phenol oxidase actually does phenol<br>stays is actually one of the few enzymes<br>able to attack that phenolic material<br>the brown color that's so abundant in<br>these people and environments and what<br>we're showing on this graphic here is<br>that as we lower beam a lot of stage<br>activity you can see that wherever<br>fiancee's activity is low we have high<br>sorry wherever fiancee's activity is<br>high we have low levels of phenolic<br>compounds in the<br>if for some reason the female officers<br>activity is low then phenolics<br>accumulate so being locked stays is an<br>enzyme which can clearly break down<br>phenolics in the environment the only<br>problem of course is that the the<br>phenomics are quite a small proportion<br>of the total amount of organic matter<br>that's present in a people most of it is<br>non phenolic compound so does seem a<br>little bit surprising in some ways so<br>what other clues if we gilts let's have<br>a look at what happens to phenolic<br>compound concentrations when we make the<br>conditions drier and stimulate the<br>phenol stays in the environment<br>basically what we can see here is over<br>that same 15 week period of drier<br>conditions as we lower the water table<br>and make conditions dry one of the most<br>dramatic effects we can actually see is<br>the loss of phenolic compounds from the<br>soil solution the water becomes much<br>clearer when we dry the wetland out so<br>another clue that gives us an idea of<br>what's going on but certainly doesn't<br>give us an instant explanation of what's<br>the final clue and the one that gives us<br>the biggest pointer as to what's going<br>on because from looking at what the<br>effect is of those Brown phenolic<br>compounds on hydrolyzed enzymes<br>remember the hydrolases are the main<br>enzymes involved in decomposition so and<br>he should be slice what we're looking at<br>is if you know that compound<br>concentration on the x axis and hyde<br>remains activity on the y axis and what<br>you can see there is a classic example<br>of inhibition basically the higher the<br>phenolic compound concentration in the<br>wetland the lower the hydrolase enzyme<br>activity because of the inhibitory<br>properties of these phenolic compounds<br>so boots are not you've got all the<br>clues that you need to understand what's<br>going on well I always think at this<br>point it's an idea to step back and to<br>try and understand it from its most<br>fundamental level so the most<br>fundamental level<br>what does decomposition involved within<br>those microbes producing hydrolyzed<br>enzymes extracellular enzymes that they<br>release out into the environment and<br>those hydrolyzed enzymes will attack the<br>organic matter out there in the<br>environment severed heads or whatever<br>else it is that you've got out there in<br>the environment and it will release from<br>that material available nutrients so<br>organic substrates low molecular weight<br>organic substrates and inorganic<br>materials as well socially creating<br>large amounts of resources for the<br>microbes and those microbes can then<br>produce even more hydrolases bring about<br>this runaway process of decomposition<br>that we're used to seeing in every other<br>ecosystem now we've said this doesn't<br>occur in these wetland environments so<br>what's going wrong we used to throw your<br>think that it was simply down to oxygen<br>but as we now know from what we've<br>looked at so far we can take the oxygen<br>away completely from this story and it<br>makes no difference if we look at the<br>rumen of a cow or an anaerobic sludge<br>digester this same process this runaway<br>process of decomposition seems to work<br>away quite happily without any<br>constraints whatsoever so the big<br>question is well what is so different<br>about these people and environments and<br>that difference is that abundant brown<br>liquid chemical that we've looked at the<br>phenolics<br>the phenolics as we've seen our<br>inhibitors they will inhibit the ability<br>of the microbes to synthesize new<br>hydrolyzed enzymes and if any hydrolyze<br>enzymes get out there into the<br>environment the activity of those<br>hydrolases is prevented from releasing<br>available resources to feed the microbes<br>so effectively those phenology shut down<br>the entire process of decomposition in<br>many ways this is the enzyme a class on<br>decomposition this is what stops that<br>runaway breakdown and decomposition of<br>any severed heads that you want to<br>dispose of in a English peatlands<br>another thing is we know that if we make<br>the conditions drier we can reverse this<br>so what do we need to do that well in a<br>peat bog the one thing that we are going<br>to need is some kind of chemical that<br>will remove the phenolic inhibitors and<br>that chemical is phenol activate the<br>enzyme we've just been looking at and<br>feedlots days is one of a few ways that<br>we can actually get rid of<br>phenolics in an intact system<br>unfortunately there is lots of this<br>phenol oxidase actually in peat bogs the<br>only problem is it it doesn't do<br>anything and the reason it doesn't do<br>anything is because there's no oxygen<br>because it's so difficult for oxygen to<br>diffuse into the waterlogged peat soils<br>so to really bring this together it's<br>only when oxygen comes into the system<br>through drainage or a drought event but<br>this triggers the feedlots days into<br>action and the feedlots days destroys<br>the phenolic inhibitors and then we<br>start to see this runaway decomposition<br>process that we would take for granted<br>well we were lucky enough back in 2001<br>to get this published in nature and it's<br>been the cornerstone of much of the<br>research that's gone on in my lab ever<br>since so why is this important<br>well one thing about the bugs is they<br>have planets growing in them and as we<br>all know plants take carbon dioxide out<br>of the atmosphere they convert it into<br>solid carbon rich biomass and normally<br>at the end of the life of that plant it<br>would die and decompose and release that<br>co2 back to the atmosphere but thanks to<br>the enzyme Atlantic that's not the case<br>decomposition is very slow much slower<br>than the rate at which the plants grow<br>so as a consequence there is now a huge<br>buildup of carbon stored in the world's<br>peatlands an area that covers no more<br>than 3% of the planet but it stores<br>almost as much as the co2 content of the<br>entire atmosphere that's a huge store of<br>peat pot the reason that we've got this<br>published in nature was the realization<br>that if for some reason this enzymic<br>latch was to fail then you could<br>potentially release all that co2 back<br>and already there is some evidence that<br>the<br>Hazama clutch mechanism is weakening its<br>weakening because of climate change<br>creating more drought events for example<br>but also because of some of man's more<br>direct impacts on these wetland<br>ecosystems this particular study another<br>paper that we got study published in<br>Nature which basically looked at the age<br>of carbon that was coming out of peoples<br>in Malaysia we were comparing oil palm<br>plantations in Malaysia that we're<br>replacing the pristine vegetation of the<br>piece once that were out there and the<br>interesting thing that we found was that<br>the carbon that was leaking out at that<br>wetland was well about 4,000 years old<br>guy called Tim Jones in my lab<br>discovered this in one of our samples at<br>the time that was the highest age for a<br>naturally preserved non-frozen source of<br>organic carbon that had been preserved<br>for such a long period of time in a<br>weapon and here we are carrying out<br>drainage activities in these swamps to<br>produce oil palm plantations essentially<br>for biofuels and actually releasing<br>large amounts of ancient stores of<br>all sounds a bit depressing and negative<br>so I like to switch my talk over a bit<br>at this point and saying that it's not<br>all bad news there must be some positive<br>ways that we can use this new knowledge<br>of the enzyme and latch in these systems<br>and one of the ideas I had quite early<br>on was maybe we could use the atomic<br>latch it's a way that we can preserve<br>food materials so well this could be a<br>good patent for the future make a bit of<br>cash so that'll happen<br>in actual fact sir as jumping the gun a<br>bit because it turns out that about<br>having some assurance from many people<br>that the Vikings were already doing this<br>a thousand years ago they were<br>collecting fish they were burying them<br>in the peatland and preserving them to<br>consumers resource later on so maybe as<br>a new food technology they're preserving<br>foods that doesn't actually need<br>refrigeration it's something that may be<br>a bit further off in the future<br>especially when you try to get people to<br>sample some of this material this is<br>another example of preservation that has<br>taken place over the years and that over<br>in Ireland they used to bury butter in<br>the bog it's a way of preserving it and<br>if some bog butter as it's known has<br>been preserved for several hundred years<br>below the ground interestingly before we<br>spend it very difficult to persuade<br>people they also give it a try but maybe<br>if things become difficult in the future<br>that might be something we'll we'll be<br>looking at the big thing about this is<br>it doesn't require refrigeration so no<br>energy involved in the preservation<br>food technology clearly out kind of<br>something that's more promising though<br>it's something we've been looking at is<br>the way that we could potentially use<br>the enzyme ik much in wetlands use for<br>water pollution treatment and over in<br>Wales there are a bit of a problem in<br>some of our drinking water reservoirs<br>and they're getting lots of nitrogen and<br>phosphorus into them and this is an idea<br>we heard of greatly floating in some a<br>clutch treatment wetlands when you<br>carrot these structures out into the<br>middle of your reservoir the plants take<br>up the nitrogen and the phosphorus the<br>enzyme it latches intact they will<br>essentially retain that nitrogen<br>phosphorus for long periods of time<br>especially acting like a biological<br>filter treating the water using natural<br>techniques but the real benefits of this<br>is that sir at the end of that period of<br>capturing the nitrogen phosphorus you<br>can actually tow the wetlands out you<br>can carry it to some farmers<br>agricultural land and as the water<br>drains away that allows oxygen in the<br>enzymic that is opened and you can<br>release that nitrogen and phosphorus<br>fertilizer is somewhere where it can<br>actually be used as a source of valuable<br>fertilizer so maybe that's one area<br>where there is something a bit more<br>positive than spending too much time<br>focusing our attention on the depressing<br>prospect of climate warming Armageddon<br>as a result of that destabilized enzyme<br>England<br>but there's another way that this may be<br>important as well and that's in this new<br>emerging field of geoengineering too<br>Engineering's suddenly beginning to take<br>attract a lot of interest certainly in<br>the UK where a lot of people are<br>starting to realize that we seem to be<br>struggling to persuade anybody really to<br>cut down on their carbon emissions and<br>crafts we're gonna need a plan B some<br>alternative way of reducing global<br>warming on the surface of the planet so<br>places like NASA have been considering<br>space-based mirrors to reflect away some<br>of the solar radiation we've got a<br>variety of a forestation schemes<br>suggested for the future and all of<br>these are attracting considerable<br>interest it's all about looking for a<br>quick fix essentially that will allow us<br>to continue our normal economic<br>activities without essentially having to<br>reduce our fossil fuel consumption<br>probably not something we really want to<br>be considering but he's there as a<br>plan-b in the background<br>as I said solar radiation attracted lots<br>of interest mentioned the space-based<br>mirrors they sought in Oxford and<br>Cambridge University there's a group<br>that have been looking at using tethered<br>balloons and their long pipe pump up and<br>spray aerosols of sulfuric acid into the<br>stratosphere or you could put it<br>starting clues behind jets as you're<br>flying along in the atmosphere sounds<br>good but it's obviously going to be<br>quite expensive and the other things it<br>doesn't really address the source of a<br>problem all that carbon dioxide that's<br>there in the first place it's also to<br>solve problems like ocean acidification<br>that we all will always be thinking a<br>lot more about now so my preferred<br>option is to look at the other side of<br>the story which is all about carbon<br>capture and storage and there are<br>physical ways of doing this essentially<br>creating artificial trees just soak up<br>the co2 out of the atmosphere and keep<br>it locked up for all the ones that I<br>suspect most of us here today are more<br>key to focus on that's the biological<br>techniques some are suggested ocean<br>fertilization with experiments where<br>iron has been added to the oceans to<br>stimulate the algal growth to get them<br>to K take carbon dioxide out of the<br>water others have looked at the<br>forestation so I've looked at biochar<br>but each of these has their concerns<br>that are raised with them<br>ecological concerns concerns with the<br>forestation about longevity trees only<br>have a certain amount of life time they<br>die what that's going to happen then<br>they will decompose release the carbon<br>dioxide back into the atmosphere<br>others have considered biochar that's<br>more my kids because stabilizes things<br>on millennial timescales but it also<br>requires a lot of energy to input to<br>bring about the storage properties so<br>basically what we've been suggesting is<br>that we could learn something from the<br>people is because here is a system which<br>has accumulated a huge store of carbon<br>in a very small proportion of the planet<br>we know that wetland plants will soak up<br>half a kilogram potentially of carbon<br>per meter square per year something we<br>know they don't do that very effectively<br>at the moment because results still a<br>lot of decomposition in the surface<br>aerobic the layers and the idea is that<br>if we can find a way of getting more of<br>that carbon directly into the long-term<br>storage we've got the potential to store<br>carbon on millennial timescales that<br>will be very valuable for the planet in<br>so basically what we're interested in<br>doing is showing that there are ways<br>that we can use the entire clutch to<br>achieve this we've always thought that<br>there was a way of doing this by making<br>wetlands water locked and wet no<br>problems about that but we now know<br>there are also other ways that we can do<br>that<br>as we look in more detail at the enzyme<br>McLaren ISM we've discovered that at<br>each of these different points within<br>the enzyme a clutch mechanism that we've<br>looked at so far they're in different<br>aspects that we can modify in some way<br>by changing the environmental conditions<br>that the microbes and these enzymes are<br>exposed to so just to take a couple of<br>examples available water is one way that<br>we've mentioned quite a lot<br>this slide shows moving along a gradient<br>from very wet soil it's a very dry soil<br>and you can see that for most wetlands<br>if you make conditions drier it actually<br>makes the enzymic latch weaker it allows<br>decomposition to take place and<br>fiancee's activity is high if we<br>continue to make it drier still we could<br>actually lower the feed oxidase activity<br>further oxygen itself or water<br>availability begins to constrain the<br>decomposition process and the<br>effectiveness of the examing life so if<br>we want to store carbon we we've<br>actually got two choices we could make<br>it wetter or we can make it much drier<br>both will have the same effect of making<br>conditions dryer here we can see in some<br>resource that we published last year in<br>native communications the effects of pH<br>on the<br>and it's Armagnac mechanism in the<br>phenyl off space within this system what<br>you can see is that as pH Rises you get<br>more active female stays if you want to<br>store more carbon you lower the pH so<br>across these different approaches that<br>we've been living now there are two<br>different approaches we can look at ways<br>that would strengthen the latch in the<br>wetland itself and the latest approach<br>we've been taking is to look at ways<br>that we can increase the range of lung<br>types that are influenced by the enzyme<br>a clash so transplanting the enzyme a<br>clash from the peel into other<br>ecosystems and we'll start off with that<br>idea of transplanting elsewhere this is<br>something that's been looked at by<br>University of Texas for example have<br>been looking at low tillage agricultural<br>located agriculture is all about and not<br>introducing oxygen into the soil by<br>plowing so exactly what we want to do if<br>we want to keep the enzymic latch closed<br>we've also been looking at adding<br>phenolic rich residues with this and the<br>two combine together seem to be very<br>effective at storing more carbon so it<br>does seem to be possible to transplant<br>this enzymic latch mechanism outside the<br>wetland itself to a degree at least<br>we're in the peatland we thought well<br>perhaps we could grow these forests that<br>we've all been talking about in the<br>forestation swings but then relocate<br>those that timber to the wetland and<br>bury it in the peas if you do that know<br>from the severed heads that we've<br>stumbled across but that will store that<br>carbon in a stable form for thousands of<br>years into the future<br>it seems like a good idea quite<br>expensive to do I'm not sure that's<br>going to catch on it might be a bit<br>disruptive for some of our remaining<br>undisturbed peoples as well we've also<br>been looking at ways that we can<br>increase plant productivity and shift<br>the communities within the wetlands<br>essentially looking for ways that we can<br>have plants that are growing that don't<br>introduce oxygen into the soil for<br>example or increase the rate at which<br>the plants will grow seems to work out<br>in one scale you can get the plants to<br>grow faster but then you've also got<br>this complication that quite often when<br>you have nitrogen and phosphorous it<br>stimulates decomposition as well got a<br>one of my favorite ones that we've been<br>looking at in banger I work in a<br>department dominated by zoologists and<br>one of the fiendish ways I've persuaded<br>students who take on biogeochemistry is<br>to tell them all about this animal near<br>the beaver and we've got this fiendish<br>plan in banger to rear up an army of<br>beavers 400 million beavers is our<br>target releasing them out there into the<br>world so they can build dams create more<br>peatlands across the landscape in a much<br>more cost-effective way that the way<br>we've been looking at just installing<br>dams in the environment and the Beavers<br>do all the work for free and clearly a<br>good thing for the environment you won't<br>be surprised to hear we've been<br>struggling to get permission to release<br>any beavers yet but the idea is there<br>and we're ready so what about the pH<br>remember I mentioned the fact that pH<br>being a useful way well we've been<br>looking at ways we can acidify the peach<br>with the people with watering cans of<br>sulfuric acid clearly it did actually<br>work it did slow down the composition we<br>realized we need is something larger<br>scales helicopters would clearly be<br>useful but even that could be quite<br>expensive colleagues in Oxford and<br>Cambridge we've got this big balloon<br>injecting sulphuric acid into the<br>stratosphere that could be quite useful<br>for us as well because what goes up must<br>come down we could have we could bring<br>if you're not worried enough about my<br>plans for people's in the northern<br>hemisphere it's not quite so worrying<br>when you don't hear that so this really<br>gets people worried up north I had this<br>idea that well price what we should<br>really be doing is using military<br>techniques to inject across the surface<br>of all our pristine peoples with sources<br>of phenolic waste which would not only<br>get rid of that phenolic waste but it<br>would be injecting phenolic inhibitors<br>across the landscape to slow down the<br>process of decomposition not that much<br>look with getting permission for this on<br>a large scale either although we are<br>trying it's in Canada in people and<br>restoration sites and seeing some quite<br>promising reserves that this is a very<br>effective way of adding these phenolic<br>residues and accelerating the process of<br>people and restoration after P mining<br>activities<br>and if that's not worrying enough what<br>always makes people in Europe at least<br>going very pale is when I say well one<br>it ultimate a miss to genetically<br>engineer sphagnum plants rusty and so I<br>guess within your equivalent here and<br>the basic idea is we modify the genes in<br>here which changes the way that they<br>produce formulates essentially the idea<br>is thanks to my colleague a Niall up<br>there we've actually been very<br>successful in finding a way to turn off<br>the controls on the production of female<br>AIDS so genetic genetically modifying<br>sphagnum plant so they continuously<br>produce an overabundance of phenolics<br>into the environment clearly has some<br>potential if we were to release this<br>genetically modified plants out there<br>I often try to persuade people but one<br>day we may actually consider this to be<br>quite an acceptable idea and things are<br>not for ever since I started making<br>presentations on this topic I agree<br>third so we're study from here in New<br>Zealand<br>where some social sciences studies took<br>place look at the acceptability of<br>genetic modification in the environment<br>and what they found in that study is<br>that there are some areas where there is<br>less resistance to genetic modification<br>than others that's great to be able to<br>talk about it the first time in New<br>Zealand itself basically genetic<br>modification for pollution control<br>nobody seems to be worried about that<br>listen to the other second good idea<br>like human gene therapy again anything<br>medically related can be good<br>the one thing that none of us seem to<br>like the idea of both here in New<br>Zealand and up in the north<br>is food anything that we've got to eat<br>but genetically modified is not<br>considered a good thing<br>so my ray of hope for one day being able<br>to release this genetically modified<br>sphagnum into the environment comes from<br>the idea that well swaggins a plant that<br>nobody wants to eat clearly there's the<br>potential here for us to gain acceptance<br>to release it out there into the<br>environment well like to end my<br>presentation by just pointing out that I<br>have said that there are risks and<br>rewards with everything that I've talked<br>about today and clearly biodiversity<br>there's a major risk of any of this to<br>biodiversity so clearly we do need to<br>carry out more research to look at the<br>impacts of these changes that we're<br>proposing on biodiversity<br>other people focus on the risks and many<br>people have pointed out to me that the<br>biggest risk always group up in bang it<br>becomes so successful that locking up<br>carbon we can actually trigger the next<br>Ice Age that could be quite serious I've<br>been trying to reassure people that this<br>will never be an issue because one thing<br>that we know is that we should be able<br>to remove any chance of that runaway<br>cooling by some of the techniques we've<br>been using and many places around<br>digging drainage ditches have circular<br>drainage around young people we're all<br>experts on this I'm sure that we'll have<br>no trouble at all in finding ways of<br>ensuring that that carbon sequestration<br>doesn't continue<br>it's a dangerous ways in other places<br>fires have been a very fast way that we<br>found that getting that carbon back into<br>the atmosphere and an idea from Island<br>but we may need to think about it what<br>we're creating with this acceleration of<br>the production of peas is a biofuel and<br>potentially that could actually be very<br>useful for the future as a source of<br>energy so I'd just like to end really my<br>presentation then by pointing out that<br>whilst the enzyme Akash might seem a bit<br>of a depressing subject there are<br>actually some ways where we can offer a<br>ray of hope the possibility one day if<br>we can get people to give it a try the<br>preserving peat with zero energy costs<br>no refrigeration by adding these<br>phenolic compounds<br>food novel water treatment techniques<br>where we can recycle nitrogen and<br>phosphorus get it back out there onto<br>the land where we want it and there's<br>also this alternative approach to<br>geoengineering locking up vast<br>quantities of carbon dioxide in the<br>peelings and other ecosystems using this<br>peopleand enzymic match as well and<br>finally that final suggestion that maybe<br>what we're doing here is we're creating<br>this vast resource of renewable energy<br>for the future which could be very<br>useful I'm aware that people might head<br>appointment so if you do need to duck<br>here please please go ahead but we'll<br>take we'll take some questions I was<br>fascinated to see you take it all the<br>way from the individual enzyme studies<br>through to the ecosystem and I think<br>this is the first time I've ever heard<br>of somebody say suggesting that we could<br>drain peat lanes and case these runaway<br>calling that took me by butts but that<br>surprise really so um do we have any<br>cross our questions for Chris place this<br>place there is some evidence that in<br>rich piece but when nitrogen is present<br>it's<br>some research going right back to the<br>1980s that suggests that so the caveat<br>is if it has to be leaning rich but it<br>is true that adding nitrogen as well as<br>the only compounds that are rich in<br>lignin would actually be an effective<br>No<br>is a very good point what we've been<br>doing so far in our studies in Canada is<br>looking at adding increasing levels of<br>phenolic compounds and obviously what<br>you want to do is you want to increase<br>the inhibitory effect in the soil but<br>the important thing is not to become so<br>inhibited that you just completely shut<br>off nutrient cycling which is important<br>to ensure all of the plants and access<br>to valuable nutrients like nitrogen and<br>phosphorus so there it is a very<br>important question so far none of the<br>levels that we've tested has actually<br>had a negative impact on plant growth so<br>in theory that suggests that there is<br>some way to go before we reach that<br>threshold and we haven't found a way to<br>exceed it yet but I wouldn't rule out<br>one that one day in the future we may<br>find like an optimum at which you should<br>so it's a very clever strategy I think<br>it makes you wonder whether plants might<br>themselves have the doctor at one stage<br>in the past actually manifested stealth<br>was something that we often have<br>declared to be something else perhaps I<br>think that's a very good point and<br>there's clearly some evidence for that<br>and the fact that at certain points in<br>the Earth's history we've had dramatic<br>increases in carbon stories think you've<br>li the accumulation of coal reserves for<br>example it's all accompanied with a<br>dramatic fall in oxygen availability<br>could it be linked in with the evolution<br>of phenolic compounds themselves and<br>lignin containing compounds I think<br>there's something it reminds me but of<br>India Rainey Dell grams work right on<br>the ecological staircase where nitrogens<br>tied up with phenomics right and so<br>they're slowing the whole nutrient<br>cycling down every my iconic<br>life<br>yes<br>I mean I'd like to think that there<br>would be more government thought has<br>concerns about global warming become<br>more intense and there is that does seem<br>to be happening in this last few years<br>it's very encouraging I think that<br>people have been much more keen to<br>switch from fossil fueled vehicles for<br>example to electric vehicles<br>if continue if we continue to see the<br>extremes of weather that we've been<br>having in recent years then I wouldn't<br>be at all surprised if in future we<br>don't see even more interest from as a<br>government scale in looking at these<br>alternative ways that which we could<br>encourage more carbon to be sequestered<br>in natural ecosystems because<br>agriculture in cases has must be even<br>better because if you can continue to<br>produce food on the same land that we're<br>sequestering carbon using enzyme in<br>match techniques then clearly it's a<br>win-win for everyone concerned so I<br>think we can get go back to this idea of<br>generating carbon credits<br>which is just seem to be coming back<br>onto the political agenda after an<br>initial failure about ten years ago I<br>think when there are financial<br>incentives in place to encourage people<br>to sequester more carbon than I suspect<br>you even get the farming community<br>themselves looking for ways that they<br>can sell carbon credits on their land<br>essentially through and zani klatch<br>techniques it's there it's in the future<br>that that future gets closer all the<br>time<br>McInnis things coming down from<br>university of auckland to talk about<br>climate impacts on new zealand forests<br>so that'll be another interesting one<br>that probably follows on nicely Chris's</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
