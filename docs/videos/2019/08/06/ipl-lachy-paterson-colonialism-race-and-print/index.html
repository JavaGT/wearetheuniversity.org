professional<br>staff and students from throughout the<br>University and members of the wider<br>Dunedin community and I would also like<br>to welcome our Chancellor professor<br>Royden Summerville who I've just had the<br>pleasure of traveling around the world<br>with but I haven't seen in a couple of<br>weeks so Royden it's fantastic to have<br>you here with us today<br>so to everyone who is gathered with us<br>know my head am i welcome now all of us<br>have taken time out of our busy<br>schedules not only to share tonight in<br>lucky success but I think more<br>importantly to learn from him as you<br>on the basis of his lecture professor<br>Patterson is an incredibly creative<br>prolific and very well respected scholar<br>he is a gifted and popular teacher both<br>at the graduate and undergraduate level<br>and last but certainly not least he has<br>provided exemplary service not only to<br>his department but to the wider<br>University and community as well this<br>Triple Crown of outstanding scholarship<br>training and teaching and service is<br>really the true hallmark of a university<br>of otago professor so lucky on behalf of<br>the university it gives me great<br>pleasure to congratulate you on your<br>very very well-deserved promotion to<br>Professor I will now call on professor<br>Poya reawy to tell us just a little bit<br>more about Lucky's academic journey to<br>Professor nor era tena koe tota no koto<br>KO CUDA Machida karate hit poke or<br>Tahiti Almario Michael tomorrow a memory<br>aliens welcome to your love is heavy<br>here so we're lucky a born in southern<br>Hawke's Bay if you're a rugby follower<br>he'll be a Meg boy raisin for katana in<br>the Bay of Plenty he would be a steamer<br>travelling between the neden and<br>Palmerston North would make him a<br>Hollander into a tuba but lucky lucky<br>doesn't ask for a rugby but has passed<br>the improvements I include been a<br>kitchen hand know what the key utensils<br>to make darning better worked at the<br>hospital as an orderly in the new side<br>again came for people making their<br>current or remaining lives better as a<br>da post peeler salesperson a<br>pepper-pecker he develops tools and<br>experience in understanding working with<br>everyday people in that ligament in<br>academic life he started here at the<br>University of Otago in history and Maori<br>studies<br>I waited Sagar Polytechnic and then he<br>was a language teacher at alternate<br>rangatahi here in Dunedin then he went<br>to Mercy University gave them hand<br>electrode in history and philosophy and<br>classics after their standard messier an<br>epiphany realized the folly of their<br>travel and came back to the invisible<br>Tiger his research expertise say one job<br>lucky was sometimes with Victor pond and<br>Timmy was working on the railways so<br>having two tracks<br>traveling in the same direction<br>sometimes I think is analogous with as<br>academic career in his pathway<br>as a non-maori a self-proclaimed Parker<br>a New Zealand in this constant model<br>language takes moral language print<br>culture the Treaty of Waitangi Maori<br>social cultural political and religious<br>history the last of which actually<br>earned him the distinction of been an<br>honorary scholar of Tawana Rani in<br>recognition of his research and Takapuna<br>ho which is the Presbyterian medicinal<br>terms was a leadership as Professor<br>Harlan Hanna's mentioned he said grows<br>into to me including acting dean which<br>you been fish it evolved and the<br>division of humanities and the water<br>university there was probably only three<br>more not just he needs Anders belt then<br>we can call him our super lucky pro<br>first Chancellor University of Otago and<br>of course the IPR which have all come to<br>this until this evening<br>so to to me was proud to have Loki the<br>grandson the grandfather the son the<br>father the brother a colleague a mentor<br>friend a researcher an academic whooping<br>- to MU a socialite and author an editor<br>a scholar an alumnus of the University<br>of Otago and their professor with us so<br>the normal user as I mentioned to<br>lecture research in author on race<br>Marian Parker colonialism in New Zealand<br>on Parker societal norms and views of<br>equality in race-mixing<br>requires a great deal of intestinal and<br>so so to take on such a challenge<br>exemplifies the attitude that Loki has<br>as one individual that might lead New<br>Zealand into society that's even better<br>than it is now<br>they found their friends and colleagues<br>please welcome Lachlan to present his<br>inaugural professor lecture<br>totai immediateiy<br>Katy Tomoaki OTA 41 angin a visa Harlan<br>hey NTN aqua in new yoga come a

all<br>my family for the support and<br>encouragement now in the various roles<br>and to to MU divisional humanities in a<br>spell and the clock terror as well<br>I've had the pleasure to work alongside<br>many Edmund people and I just like to<br>say that our academic activities would<br>grind to a halt without the professional<br>staff so in particular I'd like to call<br>out to Robin Russell Carol Forbes and<br>Susan Craig for the day-to-day help when<br>I was doing those roles but I'd also<br>like to call out to people like Gary<br>witty Chris Stoddard and Gregor McCall<br>because they were my go-to people for<br>advice on the Byzantine intricacies of<br>university administration so a big thank<br>you to all the professional staff I've<br>worked with I've also been really lucky<br>to have had great colleagues into to me<br>in particular my PhD supervisor and our<br>previous Dean professor Michael Riley<br>and our current Dean professor poyo<br>Dewey for their wisdom and their support<br>also my hue he irritated tema real Marty<br>so it's Megan Karen tangy way Gianna and<br>Craig as well as all my colleagues in<br>Pacific island studies in indigenous<br>development on the research side I would<br>especially like to acknowledge my<br>involvement in the Center for Research<br>on colonial culture headed by Tony<br>ballantine<br>and it stimulated a number of<br>collaborations of which have been apart<br>several of these have been with Angela<br>including our current Marsden project on<br>Marty home front during World War two<br>so a big thank you to all the people<br>professional academic staff students and<br>friends who I've worked with and helped<br>me in the years I've been here at Otago<br>now I've been to quite a few of these<br>and people normally start off talking a<br>grew up in fact itani in the Bay of<br>Plenty in the 1960s and 70s these are<br>fairly prosperous times when New Zealand<br>still had a a well-functioning<br>welfare state and most people had jobs<br>that they could survive on now I have to<br>concede I grew up in a somewhat innocent<br>in naive environment I was sheltered by<br>my parents but I think also by the time<br>period that I was I grew up and now<br> Donnie has a large Maori<br>population and I even lived in a people<br>potted street that's a street with my<br>Odeon park here that sort of aligned<br>with the government's residential policy<br>but despite their proximity Mardy empire<br>here back then mainly mixed through<br>schooling work and sport it's not to say<br>that other interactions didn't take<br>place but many Parker this is in a<br>district with 40% Maori population<br>didn't really have much to do with the<br>Ahmadi neighbours on a day to day basis<br>David also Belle who is a u.s.<br>sociologist who published the Tiki and<br>the fern in 1960 this was an outsider's<br>take on New Zealand society he spent a<br>quite a bit of his time in the town in<br>1860 was about the time that I shifted<br>the air as a child<br>and he noticed that the strand which is<br>back at Arnie's main shopping street<br>employed no more tea shop assistants at<br>that time now about a hundred years<br>prior to these photos<br>they've been war destruction land<br>confiscations and subsequent occupation<br>by the armed Constabulary less than<br>fifty years before these the government<br>mounted a terror raid on Iraq inanna at<br>mana party resulting in two deaths now I<br>wasn't that conscious as a child as to<br>how close colonialism was in terms of<br>time and place<br>I was five in the premise when this<br>photo was taken I'm one of the kids<br>directly behind the sign of you weren't<br>sure what we can see is that there were<br>almost as many Maori kids as parents now<br>I like school I did generally did quite<br>well and I was lucky that I grew up in a<br>home with books where I was encouraged<br>to learn the BEC theand there was only<br>one high school in town<br>I could hardly high and by the time I<br>got to the fourth form nine years nine<br>years later classes were streamed and it<br>was just one Maori girl in my class and<br>she called herself Pat Maudie<br>and this seems incredible when Marty<br>made up about 40% of the school's<br>catchment now poor pierre bourdieu's<br>concept of cultural capital of course<br>comes to mind that schools reflect<br>dominant cultural values they employ<br>teachers who favor children whose<br>backgrounds in values most closely<br>resemble their own it's there for your<br>aha<br>it's therefore not surprising that<br>middle class power here children did<br>well at school and those from different<br>cultural upbringing whether this were<br>this it class or ethnicity least so<br>however the fact that I mixed lists with<br>Maori kids at high school because we<br>also tended to play different sports was<br>not something I really do well Thanh at<br>the time it would be nice to say that my<br>childhood and Tony gave me a deep<br>understanding of tr Marty but that would<br>after a moderately misspent youth I<br>ended up in this province and drifted<br>into my previous career in the New<br>Zealand railways first as a track worker<br>and then as a signal maintainer I began<br>learning today on Marty in the early 90s<br>I've been good at languages at school<br>and my wife at the time had started a BA<br>in Maori studies so I started to learn<br>as well although least formally I taught<br>myself from books winter night classes<br>and finally did bursary Marty through<br>correspondence school then all of a<br>sudden 1996 my railway career came to a<br>sudden halt when I became a solar dead I<br>took the opportunity to become a<br>university student<br>my plans were pretty flexible at the<br>time get a degree that was that and I<br>ended up doing Maori studies in history<br>because I enjoyed them now I remember<br>back then talking to another mod mature<br>student he was a Maori guy and I started<br>moaning about how hard it was being a<br>and how I always felt a little bit on<br>the outside when all the other students<br>were we're Marty and he looked at me he<br>snapback lucky when I walk out of here<br>that's what I experience every day of my<br>life so nowadays we might talk in terms<br>of white privilege but 20 odd years ago<br>that kind of discourse wasn't really<br>available now sometimes the best lessons<br>are actually learned outside of the<br>classroom anyway I knew that I've been a<br>prep indeed Maori studies a total go and<br>this was in the days of Godfrey and Toro<br>our party has always been incredibly<br>open to all-comers so I wouldn't want to<br>do a PG dip in Marty Studies I didn't<br>have any real idea of what I should do<br>my 490 dissertation on but I was<br>fortunate that professor Moore field<br>employed me as a research assistant so I<br>was scouring new paper new paper old<br>Murray language newspapers and I was<br>looking for loanwords words that were<br>used in Maori but derived from English<br>and other languages and I thought I'm<br>getting paid to read these newspapers<br>for this linguistic research and what<br>it's all use them to click my own data<br>at the same time for my historical<br>purposes so I was getting too paid to do<br>my own research as it were so I looked<br>at marty run english and church<br>new paper 2 PP 400 which ran from the<br>tune of the last century when i had very<br>strong links to young maori party now<br>it's probably worth mentioning here that<br>new paper and light newspapers today<br>they're anything from the size of a<br>academic journal to maybe a tabloid some<br>of them are only a few pages long and<br>if they had news in them it was probably<br>weeks and weeks out of date but more<br>importantly none of this new paper made<br>any money the primary goal was to<br>promote particular discourses and to<br>influence Maori thinking and behavior so<br>this might be for government agenda<br>church and evangelical purposes or for<br>Maori political causes such as the<br>Kingitanga or Kotahitanga I carried on<br>with the same research work while doing<br>my PhD again gathering historical data<br>for my own thesis on the side and this<br>time concentrating on the 8 years<br>leading up to July 1863 when the British<br>army invaded the white cattle so what<br>we're Marty this is my question were<br>mighty reading in the various<br>periodicals available at the time and<br>what was going on in New Zealand in a<br>period when it seemed to be<br>transitioning from what was meant to be<br>a peaceful and prosperous existence<br>where at least lip service was being<br>paid to the Treaty of Waitangi to<br>all-out war reflecting on my research to<br>date on new paper my focus has tended to<br>be on discourse and race relations<br>hence my topic for today and what I want<br>to focus on this evening as some of the<br>contradictions around discourses on race<br>is seen in the country's newspapers I<br>use the word race race of course is a<br>social construct based on power but it's<br>also been one that's been a dominant<br>factor in New Zealand history and mighty<br>power relations so first on I'll look at<br>some early discussions on race in the<br>Marty new paper during the first two<br>decades of colonization and then a<br>little bit on mixed-raced marriage<br>finishing with some race issues that<br>arose in the park your newspapers now I<br>won't need to make too many direct links<br>to today as you're all very until<br>than people who I'm sure will be able to<br>see the ghosts of the past reflected in<br>today's will but I must warn you that<br>you may see or hear some terms that are<br>not really appropriate today he might<br>even be considered offensive that were<br>part of common parlance in the past so<br>Marty thanks to the treaty had the same<br>rights as Englishmen and it was<br>Englishmen who sought to shape and rule<br>the new colony the settlers brought in<br>imbibed various racial ideas prevalent<br>in the english-speaking world so if is<br>the colony was growing they were seeking<br>to exclude Chinese Indians blacks and<br>others from the new white homeland what<br>did this mean for Maori dear fellow<br>citizens and the only conclusion that<br>I've been able to make is that New<br>Zealand's colonization has been about<br>creating a country for white men if this<br>wasn't explicit in 1840 then it<br>certainly was by 1860 and the issue for<br>Marty was how they were expected to fit<br>in or stand aside<br>so as not to be a hindrance or<br>impediment to set the progress now this<br>isn't any different to colonial projects<br>in other lands but Marty did have the<br>moderately good fortune that the treaty<br>was signed at the height of<br>humanitarianism<br>so unlike the indigenous people of<br>Australia or the Eastern North America<br>Marty ownership of land was at least<br>recognized and Maori at least in theory<br>had equal political rights the<br>government therefore sought to<br>communicate with Maori including through<br>newspapers to persuade them of the<br>benefits of colonization that as<br>subjects of the Queen they could enjoy<br>modernity citizenship and the rule of<br>law both Maori and / here could advance<br>into the new dawn together so law for<br>example was something that<br>could assist and take up if they wanted<br>like they had with Christianity of<br>course this was a dissimulation the<br>government aspired to secure its own<br>authority and over time was prepared to<br>use force to do it and we can see this<br>contradiction at queimada MA in nineteen<br>eighteen sixty when Governor Brown who<br>was addressing Maori Chiefs trumpeted<br>that New Zealand was quote the only<br>colony with a Maori have been invited to<br>unite with the colonists and become one<br>people under one law and that quote New<br>Zealand is the first country colonized<br>on this new and humane system this of<br>course sounds a little bit like a former<br>prime minister who recently claimed that<br>New Zealand had been peacefully settled<br>of course<br>Kumar Amma Brown was concerned with the<br>Kingitanga and the war in Taranaki and<br>as talk of oneness also came with a<br>threat if Marty didn't fall into line he<br>said they could risk ruin or in the body<br>text destruction the official government<br>line was one of harmony and unity but as<br>we will see New Zealand's colonisation<br>was founded on notions of inequality<br>as we can see here from this little exit<br>it's Marty who must learn from polka fit<br>into the poker world in order for the<br>country to advance and we can also see<br>that the translations are not always<br>quite the same but this is an idea<br>that's so promulgated today by those who<br>suggest there were all just New<br>Zealanders and that our nationality<br>should trump all other aspects of<br>identity or rights<br>as in the 19th century mid 19th century<br>the underlying notion is that there it's<br>parkia cultural mainstream that should<br>predominate but the 19th century message<br>was also unequivocally racialized if as<br>phenom suggests colonization is<br>Manoukian<br>then race forms a natural dichotomy in<br>other words Mari and / hear the word<br>Marti also means normal but in this new<br>world it was also a general term for<br>native Marti could also mean without<br>restraint and I'm not sure whether this<br>was a missionary construction but it's<br>certainly developed in missionary<br>discourse and in the newspapers to<br>translate as excitable uncivilized<br>violent and dark and it could be<br>transposed quite widely for example when<br>discussing the Roman conquest of Britain<br>newpaper suggested that civilized Romans<br>with Pacquiao were in power hair clothes<br>and that Britons were wild with Mari<br>like customs and we can also see it in<br>the expression NACO Mari on native hat 1<br>which is a devoid of civilization and is<br>holding Maori back so the messages that<br>Marty were Marty as a race but they were<br>told that they should strive to give up<br>the racial dichotomy extended to color<br>with kitty ma white skin and cutting<br>mango black skin used to differentiate<br>between the two groups black and white<br>are complementary opposites used here as<br>theoretical constructs and by utilizing<br>this term in their newspaper ironically<br>to suggest a commonality the writer is<br>instead City in the groups are powders<br>as far as he can similarly on the same<br>article the author defines Marti as Dana<br>younger brothers Marti Society was was<br>as hierarchical and the language the<br>language defines sibling relationships<br>in terms of senior and junior terms so<br>in these discourses Maori were nearly<br>always I've only found one case where it<br>wasn't portrayed in the junior position<br>now the other bit that I've highlighted<br>is the word for Khurana theater which<br>literally means to make chiefly or to<br>make Noble my research has shown that<br>the term a Tonga Theatre Tonga has had a<br>checkered colonial past with different<br>meanings in different contexts<br>at this time missionaries and officials<br>alike often used it to define<br>civilization something that Marty were<br>to aspire to but had not yet reached so<br>the new people were aimed at Marty<br>Chiefs who were constantly reminded that<br>in Parker eyes they might be a rangatira<br>or chiefs politically but had not yet<br>reached the high levels of cultural<br>rangatiratanga expected of them so<br>despite the notion of oneness Marty as a<br>race with black and civilized and not<br>ready for equality they should therefore<br>trust the epochal de brother who did<br>possess a tiger theatre Tonga and leave<br>it's not surprising that the Kingitanga<br>anti-colonial movement that aspired to<br>establish an autonomous marti kingdom<br>recycled or critiqued some of this<br>discourse martinez and blackness became<br>attributes around which to build a maori<br>rather than a tribal identity for<br>example the Kingitanga newspaper tokyo<br>even looked outside of New Zealand<br>employing the example of Haiti as a<br>model of non-white anti colonial success<br>and it portrayed this in terms of<br>blackness killing mangu that could be<br>similarly when Marty King addressed all<br>Maori<br>so his supporters as well as those that<br>were aligned to Queen Victoria he did so<br>through the shared racial identity in<br>opposition to colonists whiteness are<br>you asking why does this even matter<br>wasn't it just a matter of time when<br>Marty would fade away either swept aside<br>in the face of a superior race or<br>absorbed into it<br>this was the accepted truth for many<br>parkia and even a few Marty certainly as<br>Damon Selita has argued intermarriage<br>racial crossings were a<br>nineteenth-century Colonials concern<br>interestingly in New Zealand the early<br>governors sought to foster mixed<br>marriage as a way of increasing power<br>here influence Angela one hala has also<br>shown there was extensive intermarriage<br>over time but with a small Maori base<br>and a continuing flood of perkier<br>immigrants and with most of the<br>mixed-race children living within Maori<br>communities this impacted Marty society<br>way more than Parker but people of mixed<br>ancestry will what they were called half<br>castes were an issue for par here<br>if colonisation was<br>promised on political cultural and<br>social divisions according to race where<br>did this leave people who had a dual<br>heritage and if you wanted a white New<br>Zealand without blacks Chinese and<br>Indians how much of an existential<br>threat was racial mixing to the colonial<br>vision and this was also at a time when<br>science was still grappling with<br>fundamental questions around hybridity<br>were these so-called half-caste children<br>more likely to grow up as weak and<br>unfertile creatures or with the best<br>qualities of both the appearance now at<br>a public meeting in 1873 James fuller<br>the old missionary suggested that he<br>could see no reason why a blending of<br>the races by intermarriage might not<br>come about which would supposedly<br>improve the Marty race of course<br>balla thought that Marty would need to<br>become more polished that is speaking<br>English in assimilating into pokeo ways<br>now these were not sentiment shared by<br>all noble digger<br>for example attacked this argument even<br>suggesting that he would prefer his<br>sisters or daughters did rather than<br>married to a Maori man these were not<br>French ideas but they were part of the<br>mainstream indeed in 1899 several<br>newspapers reproduced and critically a<br>piece from the London spectator on<br>intermarriage they stated that while<br>some interracial unions might be<br>fruitful quote a marriage between the<br>colours affirms to some extent the<br>Equality of the colours and the<br>affirmation is repugnant to the white<br>men supported by history he firmly<br>believes his color to be the mark of a<br>hereditary aristocracy of mankind and he<br>regards any degradation of their<br>aristocracy as a personal insult to be<br>prevented if possible or at least to be<br>bitterly resented I would imagine that<br>many white supremacists<br>today would probably echo<br>kinds of ideas Marty in the 19th century<br>did not have the same anxiety over<br>racial mix mixing by the 1870s their<br>concerns appear to be more about issues<br>of mana so land ownership which was a<br>land ownership was a source of mana was<br>increasingly under threat<br>so my Tahu for example argued for<br>separate reserves specifically for<br>half-castes but this was an attempt to<br>increase the PI rather than to fight<br>over the little that was remained<br>similarly Maori representation and<br>Parliament was limited so there was some<br>politicking around with a mixed race<br>individuals shall be putting themselves<br>forward for election now the only<br>outlier that I found in the Maori<br>language press has been the Anglican<br>churches to ppfor adora from 1907 and<br>this piece written I believe by Reverend<br>Harry Whittaker he D cor he was<br>critiquing Maori Palmeiras prediction<br>that the Marty race would eventually<br>disappear through absorption into poker<br>although he had one party our<br>grandparent himself call here he uses<br>the same racial dichotomy of black and<br>white nurse but as concerns at lease<br>about blood than ethnicity that is<br>culture and identity core he sought to<br>maintain Maori language and culture and<br>he believed that absorption through<br>intermarriage was a threat to this but<br>its main concern was around land and he<br>provided details of number of Marty<br>wealthy land holders who had married<br>Parker or who had adopted Park our<br>children in Ag you'd that the land would<br>be inevitably lost through inheritance<br>he said quote each person should have a<br>say over their own land but land is not<br>something created by people but handed<br>down by the ancestors to their<br>descendants and it's only right that our<br>land of the Marty<br>should be live tomorrow yeah I want to<br>move on to some research I've done on<br>Parker attitudes to race in New Zealand<br>scholars like Tony ballantine have<br>looked at how intellectuals debated and<br>shared racial theories such as Arianism<br>but what did ordinary people think and<br>how was race portrayed to them in the<br>settler newspapers let us not think that<br>New Zealand was somehow superior to ever<br>white settler colonies with regard to<br>racial attitudes like other places<br>blacked up minstrels singing plantation<br>songs such as these future<br>schoolteachers we're a popular<br>entertainment in New Zealand for most of<br>our history indeed I grew up with the<br>clear new newspapers also printed racist<br>jokes and anecdotes that circulated the<br>english-speaking world in books like<br>this were bestsellers in the 1960s now<br>this is a very anecdotal people want<br>science don't they I wanted to get a<br>more quantitative picture on racial<br>discourse so I mind our nation's<br>newspapers defined occurrence<br>occurrences of something that's very<br>offensive and there is the n-word now I<br>have to have to acknowledge some<br>methodological issues with the online<br>corpus of newspapers there are fewer<br>newspapers in the early years they had<br>fewer pages and not all papers have been<br>digitized but what we do see is the word<br>appearing increasingly in newspapers<br>over time however we look at the 1920s<br>it's quite a feat so I do need to<br>explain there although the word had been<br>used for advertisements such as for<br>minstrel sheet music and for tobacco<br>products from about 1914 it gained an<br>extra meaning of a dark brown color in<br>particular refer<br>two fabrics and it is this usage that it<br>resulted in the huge increase in<br>occurrences but what this tells us is<br>that the word was normalized in common<br>discourse even more so once I entered<br>the vocabulary as a simple color your<br>average reader wouldn't have better than<br>I they're looking at it and this was<br>despite an awareness even thene that the<br>where it was used in newspaper articles<br>and such like it was generally applied<br>to black people whether from Australia<br>Africa or America and though on the<br>streets it may have been used to to<br>refer to Maori this was definitely not<br>acceptable in print so when John Duffy<br>in opposition member for Wellington made<br>this comment in 1899 a political storm<br>broke out prominent Chiefs called on him<br>to withdraw his statement which they saw<br>as a deliberate insult to Maori as<br>subjects of the Queen and the premier<br>Richard Seaton played it for all it was<br>worth<br>great Tom despite Duffy apologizing for<br>what he's what he called a regrettable<br>use of a common and vulgar expression<br>now some newspapers were prepared to<br>critique the insult as being<br>inappropriate to Marty it was a matter<br>of pride to Parker self-identity that<br>the best colony in the world New Zealand<br>should naturally possess the best<br>natives as well despite the Smarty<br>exceptionalism<br>there was little criticism of Duffy's<br>central underlying argument that land<br>should belong to Park here and not to<br>Maori New Zealand was still a colony of<br>settlement<br>predicated on policies that lift most<br>Maori with little land impoverished in<br>substandard housing and socially and<br>politically marginalized I found a<br>number of statements in poker and<br>newspapers that extol Maori in<br>comparison to other Lysa native peoples<br>but they never critique the internal<br>logics of colonialism ok so my last<br>story I guess was one that was covered<br>in a number of newspapers in 1912 when<br>kuru Port Perry ha<br>a former New Zealand golf champion was<br>banned from buying a ticket in the dress<br>circle of a local picture theatre on the<br>pretext that son Marty in the past had<br>misbehaved he subsequently complained to<br>the napier council who sought legal<br>advice but to no avail<br>now most newspapers declared themselves<br>to be astonished at the ban but they<br>didn't actively condemn it nor did john<br>Payne a cinema owner and Member of<br>Parliament suffer politically for this<br>act of racial exclusion the only<br>newspaper to actively editorialize was<br>the truth admittedly the most scandal<br>mongering periodical of its time but it<br>endorsed the ban on Maori as a means of<br>showing them that they were not equal to<br>par here while it considered that some<br>Marty might be thorough gentlemen it<br>blamed the government for pampering them<br>in protecting their remaining lands from<br>alienation and this allowed Marty to<br>become arrogant and overbearing quite<br>apart from being false this discourse<br>resonates with current ones they argue<br>that Maori somehow have undeserved<br>privileges<br>so I hope that this little traipse<br>through the colonial newspapers has<br>shown their issues of race have been a<br>constant preoccupation through our<br>nation's history although primarily a<br>party I can see and not without its<br>contradictions in the 1840s and 50s the<br>government portrayed civilization in<br>terms of a cultural gap that Maori were<br>expected to bridge didn't labour have a<br>policy bridging the gaps mmm<br>Chiefs were rangatira<br>but did not possess the cultural<br>rangatiratanga of the park yeah so they<br>should surrender the running of the<br>country to the more knowledgeable Park<br>our brethren but race was also defined<br>in terms of a stacked dichotomy black<br>and white skins Maori were Maori but<br>they had to give up the narco Marty its<br>therefore not surprising that the<br>Kingitanga struggling to build a pan<br>Marty identity and maintain mana Marty<br>motuhake would utilize the same racial<br>discourse of difference<br>we've looked briefly at the issue of<br>race mixing another partier proprio cue<br>pation salmon favored some against and<br>then how settler papers react interacted<br>with issues of race New Zealand was<br>certainly part of a broader global<br>circulation of generic racist material<br>directed against people of color<br>specifically blacks as the natives of a<br>superior colony Maori were generally<br>exempted from the worst vilification<br>such as the n-word but their exception<br>was only relevant in opposition to other<br>peoples of color colonialism still<br>ground on in New Zealand assimilating<br>Maori culturally taking their lands<br>while pushing them to the social<br>political and economic margins now I<br>have to confess that for many years I've<br>subscribed to Whiggish beliefs that<br>while the world was not<br>perfect life was slowly and inevitably<br>improving yet when we look around we see<br>some for some groups life has become<br>much harder over recent years well maybe<br>at least a more liberal world was<br>emerging where racism hatred and<br>suffering we're on the retreat and where<br>we abhorred the racial prejudice of our<br>forebears this is maybe naive as we're<br>seeing in some countries society can<br>reach regress and liberal gains may be<br>lost it's therefore incumbent upon us at<br>a time when some people believe that<br>free speech means the right to say<br>whatever they want that we resist any<br>attempts to revert to the discourses of<br>tena koe - kotora my name is Tony<br>Valentine and on the PBC humanities here<br>that's how I go and it was very great<br>pleasure that I'll deliver a vote of<br>thanks to professor Patterson professor<br>Patterson locky has delivered initial<br>and lecture which has offered a<br>thoughtful exploration of the<br>intersections between print culture race<br>in colonialism their histories has<br>explored and the text that he has shared<br>with us this evening offer a very<br>important vantage point on the logics of<br>colonial domination in its cultural<br>legacies but they have also underscored<br>I think the richness of multicultural<br>intellectual history highlighting some<br>of the arguments and strategies that<br>Maori leaders adopted in the face of the<br>inequalities of a social order made by<br>Empire this evening Loki has given you a<br>taste of his research and I encourage<br>you will those of you who haven't read<br>much of his work to seek it out because<br>it offers powerful insights into the<br>interplay between power and culture and<br>the shaping of our society and just<br>wearing my historians hat you know there<br>is a long-standing argument most clearly<br>articulated by Keith Sinclair about the<br>superiority of New Zealand race<br>relations and that's been very clearly<br>put to rest this evening it was also<br>very interesting to hear professor<br>Patterson's reflections on his own<br>journey and his own pathway into<br>academia his thoughts on growing up in<br> attorney and the powerful but very<br>partial understandings of cultural<br>difference that we develop as children I<br>think would resonate with many New<br>Zealanders and those reflections also<br>demonstrated the ways in which the<br>opportunity structure in our society was<br>and is profoundly racialized right from<br>childhood what his lecture was both<br>self-deprecating and generous towards<br>others I don't think there's any<br>surprise there he is a great<br>institutional citizen somebody who works<br>very hard with his students and who has<br>served too<br>the division of humanities and the<br>university generously and very well and<br>I know firsthand that lucky is a great<br>research collaborator thinking hard<br>about the relationships between<br>communication and the construction of<br>cultural difference as an urgent<br>undertaken right now both within use on<br>cultural life and on the global stage we<br>have figures including a new cohort of<br>leaders who use words as weapons to<br>vilify to dehumanize and to legitimize<br>extremism hatred and violence your<br>lecture this evening locky has reminded<br>us all that language how we speak how we<br>write how we interpret X is central to<br>how we define and make communities so<br>professor Patterson I know that all of<br>us here students colleagues from - to MU<br>from across the division and the wider<br>University family and friends are just<br>delighted to be sharing this very<br>special occasion with you so could you<br>please join me in thanking lucky I do<br>have a gift to present to him and after<br>that I will encourage you to follow us<br>to the staff club we will have a<br>reception<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
