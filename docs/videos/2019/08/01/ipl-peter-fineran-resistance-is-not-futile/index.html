Royden Summerville who is<br>up at the top back there to all of you<br>know my how to my welcome<br>now these IPL's are an incredibly<br>special time for us as a university<br>community we have all come together<br>tonight to share not only in Peters<br>success but also to learn from him<br>professor Finneran is a creative<br>prolific and very well respected<br>scientist he is a gifted and popular<br>teacher at both undergraduate and<br>graduate level and I suspect that a<br>large number of his past and present<br>students are in the audience this<br>evening last but certainly not least he<br>is also a genuinely nice guy who has<br>provided exemplary service to his<br>department to the University and to his<br>discipline more generally<br>this Triple Crown outstanding research<br>teaching and service is the true<br>hallmark of a university of otago<br>professor so Peter on behalf of the<br>university of otago i would like to<br>congratulate you on your very<br>well-deserved promotion to professor i<br>will now call on professor vernon ward<br>who is the Dean of the Dunedin School of<br>biomedical sciences to tell us just a<br>little bit more about Peters academic<br>journey to Professor noreda tena koutou<br>Thank You Vice Chancellor tena koutou<br>katoa<br>I'm a new ithi na koto welcome everybody<br>this is Peter Finneran inaugural<br>professorial lecture and so an IPL is a<br>very important occasion so thank you<br>very much Karen to celebrate this it's<br>great seeing a full hall of people here<br>and to see so many microbiologists in<br>one place it doesn't happen very often<br>it's my role to give you some background<br>information on professor fern Aaron's<br>career and it's gonna be an incredibly<br>strong career and it's not possible in<br>the five minutes I've got to cover<br>everything that he's done so I'm going<br>to give you a snapshot and then indicate<br>the areas that are just as good that I<br>haven't covered he received his Bachelor<br>of Science honours degree and<br>biochemistry with first-class honors<br>from the University of Canterbury in<br>2001 and he followed that with 15 months<br>of work at the John Curtin School of<br>Medicine at the Australian National<br>University in Canberra he then followed<br>that he got a Bright Futures top<br>achiever doctoral scholarship which took<br>him to Cambridge for his PhD and then he<br>carried on and did a postdoctoral<br>fellowship at Cambridge after achieving<br>his PhD he then came to us here at Otago<br>in the department of microbiology and<br>immunology in 2008 as a lecturer he<br>became a senior lecturer in 2011 an<br>associate professor in 2015 and now<br>professor and in the essence when he<br>would have found out about this<br>effectively ten years from lecturer to<br>professor and that is a phenomenal path<br>with his research it's a few things we<br>do to measure and research one of the<br>key peer assessments of your research is<br>your ability to draw research funding<br>often look at it from that perspective<br>rather than the dollars perspective for<br>Marsden grants as a PhD as a PI sorry<br>Rutherford discovery fellowship a member<br>of the buyer protection center of<br>research excellence and he said also<br>listen to a bunch of other grants in<br>funding<br>he's had industry funding from the<br>kiwifruit industry so he's not just an<br>academic sitting in his ivory tower he<br>also gets out there and industry as well<br>I was looking at his supervisory record<br>whether it's from advisory panels PG<br>tipps eyes honors postgraduate sup the<br>PhD supervision in the last count I have<br>a 65 postgraduate students and he's<br>hosted international students are<br>internships and he's taken at least one<br>summer studentship every year the entire<br>time he's been here so it's very burst<br>his distinctions that go with this a<br>numerous I've already mentioned his<br>Bright Futures doctoral scholarship and<br>his Rutherford discovery fellowship he<br>placed third in all of the UK and the<br>young microbiologists at night 2006 so<br>greats that Peter you've done better<br>since then<br>finalists in the Prime Minister's<br>McDiarmid emerging researcher prize<br>school of Medical Sciences emerging<br>researcher award the University of Otago<br>is Rohith trust and Cal Smith medal<br>Thermo Fisher Scientific award for<br>excellence and molecular biology New<br>Zealand society for biochemistry and<br>molecular biology customs science award<br>the Ross Crozier medal from the Genetics<br>Society of Australia the biomedical<br>sciences distinguished researcher award<br>and he's just back from receiving the<br>Fleming prize in the UK which is<br>obviously a very prestigious<br>international award so that's just the<br>selection he publishes prolifically I<br>had a look this morning in PubMed<br>there's already seven articles this year<br>already in very good journals including<br>Nature microbiology tells me there's a<br>total of 76 publications there and to<br>give you an idea of the quality of them<br>these are in science proceedings the<br>National Academy of Sciences molecular<br>cell Nature communications Nature<br>microbiology Nature Reviews microbiology<br>nucleic acid research prestige enix in<br>bio Elife five of those web of science<br>tells you are highly cited special<br>papers it's a phenomenal record he gets<br>commentaries in the general science<br>multiple nature publications Faculty of<br>a thousand he's on the media he's in<br>print radio he's in television it's a<br>phenomenal record I had a look I quote<br>because of what he does I had a look at<br>well his web of science h-index is 31<br>but I notice it's quite a few papers<br>missing this that's obviously better<br>than that and his H index by Google<br>Scholar for the last five years alone is<br>33 so I don't have enough time to talk<br>about all that communication of science<br>that he's done and here's a very<br>wide-ranging speaking schedule and<br>international conference as invited<br>speeches and what have you and the say<br>in the media you might wonder whether<br>that research record goes with as<br>teaching and service record I don't have<br>time to tell you the list it's as long<br>in each case<br>and it's outstanding he is one of our<br>very best teachers he receives top<br>evaluations of his teaching from<br>students the comics he receives are ones<br>we would all be very proud to receive<br>his service contributions abroad both<br>internally to his department to his<br>university nationally and<br>internationally so it's an incredible<br>record so this brings me to the point of<br>introducing the talk for tonight<br>professor Fernan will explore the<br>resistance of bacteria to viruses I'm a<br>virologist this is great stuff right so<br>the and he'll explore the innate<br>defenses bacteria have at a population<br>level to shut down a viral invader as<br>well as the hugely topical CRISPR caste<br>system which many of you will have heard<br>of it's as a virus resistance mechanism<br>and you will look at the battle between<br>the bacteria the host and the virus the<br>invader and the balance that they have<br>so with that I'd like to invite<br>professor Foner in to present his<br>inaugural professorial lecture I wonder<br>that this is a nod to Tricky's but<br>anyway if not resistance is not futile<br>bacterial innate and adaptive immune<br>systems nor a latina to me he Kyoko to<br>Qatar tiene que tiene que tiene todo<br>Katara<br>kyouda koto thank you very much Harleen<br>and vernon for such a nice welcome and<br>introduction and thank you so much for<br>all of you for coming along now tonight<br>it's really a pleasure to see you know<br>so many friends colleagues neighbors<br>even and and of course that have my<br>family as well here is really fantastic<br>so what I want to do tonight is to give<br>you a flavor that of a an unseen arms<br>race a battle that's going on out there<br>in nature between bacteria and the viral<br>invaders and before my lab blames me for<br>forgetting to thank them I really wanted<br>to thank them for being the critical<br>part of this whole process and I think<br>you know I've been very fortunate to<br>have an incredible group of both past<br>and present<br>students and staff over the last 11<br>years here at Otago and Vernon said<br>there was 65 I counted about 50 or so so<br>I need to keep up but it's really the<br>people who do all the hard work who are<br>so passionate and really make it so much<br>fun for me to come into work every day<br>but also I've had really fantastic<br>collaborators and I'm not naming them<br>all on here but basically a lot of great<br>people here at Otago<br>as well as internationally as well so I<br>haven't always wanted to be a scientist<br>but I had some very inspirational people<br>while growing up and my parents were<br>both botanists and so I clearly had some<br>influence from them but I also had some<br>really good teachers and so I had a one<br>teacher stands out at Primary School Mr<br>Fallone and he was he was a teacher that<br>got us to do all these hands-on things<br>so he would ask us to do things like<br>take her marble and make it fall from<br>one meter to the ground and see who<br>could do that the slowest and all these<br>sorts of things and that really got you<br>thinking about science got you coming up<br>with ways to tackle problems and I<br>recently did a bit of a literature<br>search to find out the early influences<br>of my sign my science career and I<br>rather using PubMed I had to go through<br>the boxes in my parents attic and I<br>found this prestigious publication in<br>the journal<br>social studies back from 1987 where I<br>state to quote myself the job I'd most<br>like to do as a scientist because you'd<br>be famous for your inventions I'd invent<br>all kinds of things and also get money<br>for the things I invent I would also be<br>it would also be fun making things I<br>would also have my very own laboratory<br>so a couple of those things I think have<br>come true<br>basically I've become a scientist and I<br>get to you know make and and sort of<br>invent things I guess in a genetic sense<br>I'm not sure I'm rich and famous yet but<br>there's still time and I don't even have<br>my own laboratory because I have to<br>share it but um luckily it's with some<br>really really good people and so if my<br>students who I've hopefully taught to be<br>critical look at this hopefully they've<br>spotted that my handwriting has<br>deteriorated since 1987 but why but my<br>spelling hopefully has got a little bit<br>better so I didn't always want to be a<br>scientist after briefly thinking about<br>becoming a rock star or an artist I<br>decided to study biochemistry with some<br>sage advice from my dad and I had the<br>pleasure of working with Jack Hyneman at<br>the University of Canterbury and he's<br>really a very passionate motivated<br>researcher and so as a undergraduate has<br>an incredible mentor to get me excited<br>about science and a lot has changed<br>since I did my honours probably one<br>thing that hasn't changed is that<br>regulations and paperwork are still<br>making doing science a bit of a<br>challenge because actually during that<br>time that was when the hazardous<br>substances and new organisms act<br>actually kind of came into force and it<br>turned out that during that year<br>Canterbury and many other places<br>discovered that they were not<br>appropriately regulated and the lab got<br>shut down so I was partway through doing<br>my project and we had to stop for for a<br>couple of months actually and that<br>actually worked out really good so there<br>was a silver lining which was that when<br>we could start back up again Jack said<br>well we're not going to be able to do<br>the original project which was looking<br>at how bacteria passed genes between<br>themselves because there's not enough<br>time but let's work on these things<br>called bacteria phages which have become<br>real<br>my absence din so most of you are<br>probably going or at least the non<br>microbial just to going bacteria what<br>you know what's what's the bacteriophage<br>so like many of people in the audience<br>I've had a probably a viral infection<br>recently I've had a cold and so you know<br>we get colds we get infected by viruses<br>plants get also infected by viruses and<br>it turns out that basically all cellular<br>life can get infected by viruses and so<br>these bacteria over here which these<br>single-celled microorganisms they also<br>get and parasitize are infected by<br>viruses so we call these viruses<br>bacteria phages which literally means or<br>translates from from the group to eaters<br>of bacteria because they basically can<br>infect very specifically bacteria and<br>destroy them essentially eating or<br>eating their culture so after doing my<br>honours I thought I'd have a break and<br>look around for PhD opportunities and<br>learn some new skills so I moved to<br>Canberra and worked with Ian yang on<br>sort of a protein purification and<br>biochemistry project so it was a really<br>nice chance to pick up some new skills<br>before heading over to the UK and this<br>is where what drove me to to contact<br>George originally was but because he had<br>been one of the researchers very<br>influential early on and showing that<br>bacteria can actually talk to each other<br>so usually think of bacterial single<br>cells but in fact they can communicate<br>to each other and and I thought this<br>seems like a really cool thing that<br>bacteria are doing and so I wanted to<br>study that and it turns out really that<br>bacteria are more cultured or more<br>sophisticated than we might think I'm<br>sure they're not actually discussing<br>Verdi or Mozart and drinking glasses of<br>wine but certainly they are able to<br>engage in communication and I think this<br>is summarized or shown quite nicely in<br>this picture here so this is a an agar<br>plate of bacteria and what you have down<br>the bottom here is bacteria that are<br>talking to each other<br>and they're telling each other to start<br>producing an antimicrobial pigment this<br>red pig<br>and the bacteria that are at the top<br>here these ones they basically can't<br>speak so they've they've been you know<br>blocks in terms of speaking but they can<br>still hear and so these bacteria are<br>basically been told by the buns down the<br>bottom to start producing this<br>antimicrobial so you can see the<br>communication happening and on their<br>plate and this also tells us that<br>bacteria can work together as<br>communities and often as groups and<br>that's where sort of my interest in<br>bacteria phages and this communication<br>came together because what I was<br>fortunate to work on was a bacterial<br>immune system which protects these<br>bacteria from viruses and they do this<br>in a group behavior type of way so I<br>want to talk a little bit more about<br>bacteria phages because these things are<br>so incredible so these are just some<br>pictures of these different bacteria<br>phages shown here and they are so<br>abundant on the planet that they<br>outnumber all other organisms basically<br>put together so they are sort of the<br>dominant organism or biological entity<br>on the planet and what they do is<br>they're essentially a piece of genetic<br>material wrapped in a coat in this case<br>a protein coat and they can interact<br>with bacteria very specifically just<br>shown over here and what they do is they<br>bind to the bacteria and they inject<br>their genetic material and then they use<br>that bacterial cell as a factory to<br>produce many more viruses and these<br>viruses then burst out of the cell like<br>an explosion and then spread to other<br>cells and then infect them and so why is<br>this so important well it turns out that<br>if you actually estimate how many times<br>these viruses are carrying out those<br>infections and exploding cells it's<br>something like 10 trillion trillion<br>times every second and I cannot actually<br>get my head around that number may be<br>some good mathematicians and the<br>audience can but to put it simply if you<br>look in the oceans<br>apparently something like 40% of all<br>bacteria and the oceans are being turned<br>over by these viruses every day so these<br>viruses are having really important<br>roles<br>in terms of global ecosystems and<br>turning over of nutrients so because of<br>that pressure you've got all these<br>viruses and affecting bacteria bacteria<br>have actually evolved defenses they've<br>evolved these immune systems that<br>protect themselves from and being<br>infected and that's sort of where my<br>interest now has been focused on is<br>essentially looking at how bacteria can<br>fight back against these viruses how<br>they can kind of develop their own arms<br>or their own weapons to protect them<br>against and these viral invaders so I<br>think came to Otago to set up my group<br>and was very fortunate to have both<br>Frank Griffin and Vernon waters heads of<br>department when I was setting up my<br>group and both were very supportive<br>mentors Frank was a was a great<br>character to have as a head of<br>department I first arrived very<br>enthusiastic made me have no doubts at<br>all about moving to New Zealand and<br>being since then as I said I don't have<br>my own laboratory but and you know<br>fortunately I get to share it with two<br>fantastic other members of the<br>department Clive Watson and in great<br>cook and since having my group there<br>they've both been very supportive<br>mentors providing a lot of very good a<br>good advice sometimes not so good but<br>often very good<br>so since coming to a target what I've<br>done is I've brought all of these<br>different areas of my research interests<br>together and what we're really focusing<br>on is how bacteria interact with these<br>viruses these bacteria phages so how do<br>bacteria phages infect bacteria and how<br>do these bacteria protect themselves<br>through immunity against these viruses<br>and this also relates to this other area<br>which I haven't talked so much about but<br>as gene transfer so as well as getting<br>DNA coming in from these invading<br>viruses bacteria also passing around<br>genes between them and so we're very<br>interested in this process as well<br>because a lot of these immune systems<br>that work against these viruses also<br>work against the transfer of DNA between<br>bacteria so so why is it actually<br>important to work in this this area well<br>as I told you these interactions are<br>very vast so you're actually they're<br>contributing to microbial evolution and<br>global ecology these genes that are<br>being spread around major contributors<br>to the rise and antimicrobial resistance<br>that we see so gene transfer is<br>spreading antibiotic resistance around<br>and what a lot of people are also<br>interested in is using bacteria phages<br>because they are very specific to kill<br>target bacteria we can use them and take<br>inspiration from them to develop<br>microbial new microbial therapies<br>against drug-resistant bacteria and<br>finally one thing which I guess is very<br>unexpected but most researchers would<br>say is not unexpected is that when<br>you're carrying out research things come<br>that you don't expect and one thing<br>that's really come out of the<br>technologically for my group but from<br>the field as a whole is via<br>technological tools that have really<br>reshaped our ability to perform genetics<br>so just a little bit more on background<br>so why would we or how can we use these<br>bacteria phages and these viral defense<br>systems so what I've told you is that if<br>you've got a bacteriophage<br>infecting a cell this will then rapidly<br>take over the cell produce new viruses<br>and explode that cell so we can take<br>advantage of that to kill and target<br>specific bacteria so one area of<br>research that I won't talk about is<br>we're using this as a potential therapy<br>to treat PSA which is an important<br>pathogen and kiwifruit on the other hand<br>though sometimes these viruses can be<br>bad so if any of you had yogurt or<br>cheese sometime today you've basically<br>had a fermented dairy product and so to<br>get that fermentation you need to have<br>bacterial cultures that are growing and<br>fermenting it product what happens<br>though is when a bacteriophage gets in<br>there it completely spreads through and<br>obliterates all of those cells and in<br>the problem as that culture will be<br>spoiled and it's a big cost to the<br>industry so that industry has for many<br>years been exploiting these immune<br>systems within bacteria to protect these<br>dairy cultures from viral spoilage so<br>there's sometimes it's good to be<br>resistant to these bacteria phages and<br>other times you don't want to have be<br>resistant to them because you could<br>imagine if you're trying to use a<br>bacteriophage as a therapy if cells<br>become immune to that therapy that's<br>much like drug resistance emerging so we<br>need ways to understand these systems<br>and try to avoid or minimize these<br>problems so I think one of the most<br>sincere interpreters things that's come<br>out of looking at phage defense systems<br>or phage immune systems is the discovery<br>of enzymes or proteins that can carry<br>out really interesting functions so if<br>we go back in history you know 30 years<br>or so there was the discovery of<br>restriction enzymes and these are<br>enzymes that can cut DNA and we can use<br>that to move pieces of DNA from one<br>place to another and so many many drugs<br>for example insulin being a prime<br>example has only been able to be<br>produced at the high kind of quantity<br>and gun purity within bacterial cells<br>because we can cut that gene out and put<br>it into into bacterial cells so this has<br>been really important in many areas and<br>recently we've had this CRISPR case<br>explosion where essentially by studying<br>these immune systems within bacteria we<br>now have enzymes which we can use to<br>modify genetic material in a much more<br>precise manner and that has leading to<br>revolutions within medicine<br>being able to understand how organisms<br>work and also with potential biotech<br>applications and this is really<br>important a few I just did a search for<br>some recent work or some recent things<br>in the media and just a couple of weeks<br>ago there's a report saying the first<br>u.s. therapy trial happening with using<br>CRISPR cows so these are technologies<br>which are going to be changing our lives<br>in the in the coming years and probably<br>this in a different note I was also<br>looking New Zealand gene editing and<br>looking at the most recent link and it<br>was the opportunities party saying in<br>putting out a little video saying that<br>gene editing is a no-brainer so it was a<br>fairly simplistic and policy<br>announcement but but it was still very<br>interesting to see that politicians are<br>thinking about this area which is<br>clearly important for New Zealand and<br>for everyone else so one thing I've also<br>been fortunate to take advantage of is<br>doing a research and study leave and so<br>I got to work with John Van de Austin<br>and Stan Bruns<br>in the Netherlands and these two groups<br>were very instrumental in the initial<br>stages of CRISPR kes our research so I'd<br>sort of urge anyone any academics to do<br>take advantage of this it's a really<br>useful process so what I want to do for<br>the remainder of the time is talk about<br>the two areas that my lab is really<br>interested in and the first is the sort<br>of innate defenses that bacteria have<br>and then the second is focusing it on<br>what we've been doing on Chris Beck s<br>immune systems so what are these innate<br>defenses it's a bit like our first line<br>of defense against an viral infection in<br>terms of its it doesn't have a memory<br>and so how does this work if we think<br>back to a virus infecting a bacterium<br>it's going to produce more viruses they<br>will spread from one cell to another and<br>then this will rapidly kill those<br>bacteria in the population<br>if you imagine a population of bacteria<br>where you have a cell which has one of<br>these abortive and fiction immune<br>systems the cell that gets infected<br>actually dies and so the problem with<br>that is that the individual dies but the<br>benefit comes at the population level<br>because<br>Dyer's before that virus can replicate<br>and you then suppress that epidemic from<br>spreading through that population so bad<br>for the individual but good for the<br>population and so how do we actually<br>study these well this is a this is a<br>plate of bacteria and where all of this<br>kind of cloudiness is bacterial cells<br>and what we've done is we've taken 20 of<br>these phages<br>and we've sort of thrown them onto this<br>plate and each one of these little zones<br>that you see here is essentially where<br>that virus has landed on a cell has<br>replicated produced 200 viruses those<br>have infected more cells and so on and<br>so forth so you've basically got like a<br>little mini viral explosion happening in<br>the plate and you can then detect it and<br>that's useful because you can count how<br>many viruses are there and how many are<br>able to replicate this is what would<br>happen in a non immune host if we take a<br>bacterium that has one of these innate<br>immune systems and we put two million<br>phages onto exactly the same plate what<br>you can see is most of those viruses and<br>able to replicate because the immune<br>system is suppressing them what you can<br>see there is some there are some viruses<br>which are able to grow and I'll come<br>back to those so we discovered during my<br>postdoc in George Salmons lab a system<br>which provides this kind of abort of<br>infection immunity and the way this<br>works is there are two components to the<br>system there's one which is toxic and<br>there's one which is an antitoxin so<br>what happens is if you express this<br>toxin in the bacteria the bacteria die<br>so you can't see any bacteria growing<br>here these little colonies of bacteria<br>if you then also Express this antitoxin<br>what happens is that the bacteria can<br>now grow so they're basically being<br>protected by this antidote or this<br>antitoxin and that's what's shown down<br>here so in the end what we've got is<br>we've got cells which contain a complex<br>which is inactive and it's sitting in<br>the cell a bit like a mousetrap poised<br>ready to kill that cell when infected by<br>a virus and Tim Blair who's a postdoc a<br>PhD student and in George's lab he<br>solved the structure of this<br>it was a quite a quite an incredible<br>structure so how does this actually work<br>so here's a bacterial cell covered in<br>bacteria phages harboring this innate<br>immune system so when this virus and fix<br>what they typically do is they take over<br>the host and they repurpose host and<br>things for the earth for their purposes<br>and what this results in is in fact<br>destabilization of this mousetrap I<br>guess so that you now have this toxic<br>protein being released in a cell and<br>that toxic protein not only destroys the<br>virus but it also destroys the host cell<br>or leads to the host cell death so in<br>the end that cell is actually protected<br>so you kind of think that seems pretty<br>good a good way for the the cell to stop<br>the spread of the virus so can the virus<br>actually get around this there's this<br>arms race actually going on between the<br>viruses and their hosts and how do we<br>find these viruses which can basically<br>avoid the immune system within bacteria<br>if we come back to this picture of the<br>plate I showed you before remember we've<br>put two million viruses on this plate<br>and there are some of these little viral<br>explosions happening so if these viral<br>explosions are happening that means<br>those viruses are actually able to<br>replicate and they can ignore that<br>immune system so what happens if we look<br>at those and ask how is it avoiding the<br>immune system so if we take one of these<br>and we look at what's happened it turns<br>out these viruses have actually stolen<br>the antidote or the antitoxin<br>so they've basically taken from the<br>immune system their own protective<br>factor so what we think is the in<br>happening is that when the virus infects<br>it's is destroying parts of the cell but<br>because it's producing its own antidote<br>that's keeping this sort of toxic<br>mousetrap complex locked in that form<br>which is safe for the cell that means<br>the virus can keep on replicating<br>without destabilizing and shutting the<br>cell off so it's been able to escape<br>that system so that just shows you how<br>one of the ways that bacteria can<br>protect themselves from these viral<br>invaders and one of the main interests<br>on my lab is looking at how<br>they use these crisper casts or these<br>adaptive immune systems so what these<br>systems are this is this is just a<br>picture of a bacterial cell and what<br>these an adaptive immune systems are as<br>they provide bacteria with something a<br>little bit like our own adaptive<br>immunity so they are resistant to<br>viruses by acquiring a memory from that<br>virus and then having a specific<br>response to protect them from being<br>infected and the way they work is they<br>have two parts one is which what I'd<br>call the memory back<br>it's basically storing the memories of<br>the past invaders and then there are<br>these components which are important for<br>providing the immune mechanism and these<br>systems are found in almost or probably<br>half of all bacteria so how these<br>systems work we'll first just like our<br>immune system the bacteria need to be<br>immunized they need to acquire that<br>memory of that an infection and the way<br>they do this is when the viral genetic<br>material comes in there are these<br>components which will take a piece of<br>this and essentially add a new memory to<br>this memory bank<br>so it's storing memories of past<br>invaders well it's kind of neat is that<br>these memories are stored in one<br>location so they we can know that this<br>of new memories and old memories that<br>these bacteria have so memories can be<br>formed the cells are sort of vaccinated<br>but then they need to be they need to<br>actually be able to provide protection<br>against that virus so what they need to<br>do is they turn that memory into<br>something that can be read and then they<br>take that and they use that to guide<br>these this machinery to the invader and<br>then destroy that invader<br>so they're basically taking this memory<br>and recognizing something that looks the<br>same as that memory and then destroying<br>it so it's a very cool system and when I<br>say it's a cool system I mean it's a<br>really cool systems because there are<br>just so many of these out there if you<br>look within the within all bacterial<br>genomes or all bacteria there's<br>something like<br>at least 30 different varieties or<br>flavors of these systems so there's<br>incredible diversity and this is part of<br>this arms race that's going on between<br>the viruses and their hosts so what I<br>want to do now is talk a bit about some<br>of the work we've done to try to<br>understand how these systems work to<br>look firstly at how they generate memory<br>how they control these systems at the<br>right time and then how they can elicit<br>their defense and then I'll come back<br>and talk a bit about the sort of arms<br>race that's going on how can the viruses<br>come back and have it have a chance<br>against this immune system so how these<br>memories form this is the stage where<br>the virus comes in and new pieces need<br>to be stored in this memory bank and so<br>what my group has done we we showed that<br>the cast one and cast two proteins or<br>these we showed there's a couple of<br>proteins could interact to form a<br>complex that are important for this<br>process and we had a very nice<br>collaboration with Kirk Ross's lab and<br>biochemistry as well as Nick neva steena<br>and some some Dutch collaborators where<br>we could actually observe this complex<br>and see how it's holding these little<br>memories before it puts them into the<br>memory bank and what we thought is can<br>we now take what we know and can we make<br>take the minimal components to show that<br>memory formation can happen and what we<br>do is we take the the protein or the sum<br>this machine and then we add the memory<br>and we add the memory bank and we do<br>this all within a test tube and in the<br>lab and we can see that just by<br>combining these three things we can<br>actually get into memory formation<br>happening so this tells us that these<br>are these main components of that memory<br>formation so the other thing we want to<br>do is we want to see what's happening in<br>real cells because that's what's<br>happening more in nature and we do this<br>by taking bacteria and then adding or<br>basically give them a chance to acquire<br>immunity against an invader so we grow<br>the bacteria and we then ask are they<br>acquiring new memories from this invader<br>and we can do this by looking at the<br>memory bank and seeing has it stored any<br>new memories and there<br>and because each memory is being added<br>to this memory bank in one location we<br>can see that the memory storage is<br>getting bigger and bigger as more<br>memories are being added and what we can<br>do is we can look at these memories by<br>carrying out next-generation sequencing<br>or basically looking at these memories<br>and seeing where do they come from<br>within the invader and we've had a very<br>nice collaboration with Chris Brown's<br>lab for a number of years and his his<br>team's developed some tools enabling us<br>to detect these spaces as well as their<br>targets and these memories and their<br>targets so where are these memories<br>coming from what can we learn about what<br>makes them something memorable well it<br>turns out that all of these memories are<br>very restricted in their size so if we<br>look at what memories are acquired they<br>all have a very discrete size and they<br>are all found next to particular parts<br>of the viral genome so it seems that<br>only certain sequences within the virus<br>are actually memorable to this immune<br>system but one thing that I think was<br>the most surprising and probably the<br>coolest discovery from some of this work<br>was that when the bacteria are acquiring<br>these memories they actually make<br>mistakes so rather than always<br>recognizing the sort of the viral<br>invader they sometimes and actually<br>fairly frequently acquire memories from<br>their own genetic material so it's a<br>little bit like having an autoimmune<br>disease for bacteria because its own<br>immune system is thinking that self is<br>actually non-self and by doing a few<br>sort of tricks we could actually show<br>that this leads to the bacteria<br>essentially dying so they sometimes make<br>mistakes and it's self destruct game<br>over for those for those cells so that<br>got us thinking well if these systems<br>are actually sometimes detrimental<br>they're sometimes causing the sort of<br>autoimmune effects for cells when of<br>these systems these immune systems<br>actually turned on because it would make<br>sense for the immune system to be most<br>effective when it would be beneficial<br>for the bacteria and we started thinking<br>back to<br>how would how would bacteria respond to<br>a viral infection and if you imagine a<br>population of bacteria with the virus<br>infecting it that virus will very<br>rapidly lyse the cell spread to other<br>neighboring cells and then kill a<br>bacteria in that population so if you<br>imagine a very dense population of<br>bacteria that virus will very quickly<br>spread through that population so it's a<br>bit like you guys in the audience if one<br>of yous got a cold that either people<br>sitting around you it's probably gonna<br>spread quite quickly and it's the same<br>for bacteria so we thought if bacteria<br>are going to be vulnerable to viruses<br>when they're in this high density state<br>are there going to be ways or times that<br>they can control their immune system to<br>increase it and these in these states<br>and that's where it comes back to the<br>ability of bacteria to talk to each<br>other it turns out that bacteria when<br>they talk to each other they can<br>actually count essentially how many<br>bacteria are present whether there's<br>lots of them all or very few and so they<br>do this by sort of secreting these<br>signals and when the bacteria when<br>there's very few bacteria the signals<br>are too quieter it's like whispering<br>when the population gets very dense what<br>happens is you've got a lot of this talk<br>going on between the bacteria it gets<br>very loud they can then hear it and what<br>happens is they then change their<br>behavior they change their gene<br>expression so this means that as<br>population size changes bacteria can<br>alter their behavior in response so that<br>got us thinking would bacteria use this<br>type of approach to increase their<br>immunity when they would be most<br>vulnerable to a virus spreading through<br>a population and the answer is yes<br>that's exactly how it works so what we<br>can do is we can take bacteria that<br>can't talk to each other and then see<br>how much of their immune systems are<br>actually being produced and we we can<br>see that their immunity is decreased<br>when the when they're unable to talk to<br>each other and this is also true if we<br>look at how strong their immunity is and<br>how well they can actually acquire new<br>memories<br>so these systems need to be able to talk<br>to each other to have a very strong<br>immune response and so the way we think<br>about this now is we think if you have a<br>small number of bacteria the immune<br>system is less necessary and so it's<br>kept at a very low level and then when<br>the population gets very high the<br>bacteria talking to each other and<br>saying there's lots of us here let's<br>increase our immunity so that sort of<br>taken us to understand how these systems<br>are when these systems are switched on<br>but we also want to know a bit about how<br>they recognize the invader and the sir<br>comes back to a similar picture to what<br>I showed earlier if you have viruses<br>growing on a plate this is one which has<br>no memory of the virus this bacterium<br>has acquired one memory against that<br>virus and so you can see that those<br>cells now protected from from that virus<br>in a cool experiment that we did was we<br>basically added more and more memories<br>to this and asked the question what<br>happens and a little bit like us as you<br>get you know greater and greater<br>recognition or memory of someone or<br>something and you get a stronger and<br>stronger<br>memory and so this gives them more<br>protection with more memories against<br>the virus so basically told you that<br>these systems work and provide<br>protection against viral invaders and it<br>seems that the systems work pretty well<br>so we want to know well we still see so<br>many viruses out there so they must have<br>ways of getting around these defense<br>systems and that sort of just want to<br>talk a bit about now as the ways that<br>viruses can evade the CRISPR care system<br>and how the CRISPR care system can<br>respond back to that so firstly how do<br>these phages<br>evade that immunity and how do we<br>actually study this it comes back to<br>these same sorts of images where we see<br>these little viral explosions on a plate<br>and we know that those viral explosions<br>mean that those viruses have evaded or<br>avoided that immune system and then we<br>can look at them and find out what's<br>happening and by doing this we can<br>actually discover that<br>the viruses are avoiding the immune<br>system by changing their essentially<br>disguising themselves from that immune<br>system this is a little bit tedious<br>because you have to pick individual<br>things and look at what's happening so<br>what we've also done is we've been able<br>to scale this up and actually look at<br>twin 200,000 sort of elements that are<br>avoiding the system and ask the question<br>which ones avoid and how do these<br>systems get avoided and I won't talk<br>about the details but what this tells us<br>is essentially what are the features<br>that the samoon system needs to<br>recognize the invaders what are the<br>features for recognition but the<br>downside of that is you think well you<br>can actually find these viruses that can<br>escape or avoid the immune system so how<br>does this immune system then deal with<br>those ones that have escaped and as part<br>of this arms race that's going on<br>essentially the the viruses have escaped<br>but the bacteria have been able to come<br>up with their own strategy to deal with<br>them and it and it turns out that what<br>these immune systems can do is they can<br>recognize these viruses that have<br>escaped although it's sort of imprecise<br>recognition but this leads to a very<br>rapid new memory formation so I guess<br>it's a little bit like a vaccination as<br>well and so what happens in these cases<br>is when the virus visit first escaped<br>the immune system now generates a very<br>strong new immune response against that<br>that invader and this often results in<br>many new memories being acquired and so<br>what we would see is many memories being<br>acquired so it's a bit like now the<br>immune system not only remembers you<br>know the eye color the hair color the<br>height the weight of you know the<br>invader so there's a much stronger sort<br>of response or ability for it to<br>recognize what might be coming into the<br>cell and so we thought how can these<br>viruses now actually evade this very<br>strong immunity because I've seen that<br>having all these all these um<br>recognition elements would be tricky to<br>avoid<br>so we we did some work to try to see how<br>the viruses can evade this type of<br>multiple very strong memories and what<br>was really surprising was we found that<br>the only way these viruses could evade<br>this immune system was by removing large<br>parts of their genetic material so<br>basically removing all of the bits that<br>were being recognized and we did some<br>nice work with McNab pastina as well to<br>look at whether we could see these<br>changes in the viral structures and we<br>could see that when the virus was being<br>recognized within something that<br>measures the length of this tail<br>the only way it escaped was by<br>shortening this tail and removing the<br>region that was recognized and we can<br>actually measure that and see this in<br>the lab so I think this shows us that we<br>can really see these evolutionary events<br>and very rapid time scales which i think<br>is really exciting and then you can even<br>see it with your eyes when you get to<br>this high end and the Jing so one of the<br>problems with that type of strategy for<br>a virus a virus can only delete or<br>remove so much of its genetic material<br>there's a point where it can't just keep<br>removing things that are you know that<br>the immune system remembers it has to<br>have another strategy to evade the<br>immune system and one of the way one of<br>the things that was discovered a few<br>years ago now that viruses can produce<br>molecules which can suppress these<br>immune systems within bacteria and so<br>these are called anti CRISPR proteins<br>because they stop CRISPR care systems so<br>they're really pretty cool systems so<br>what happens the virus injects its<br>genetic material one of these genes will<br>produce this molecule which then can<br>shut down the immune system so the virus<br>is just coming in shutting off the<br>immune system and then it can replicate<br>unimpeded by a third immune system so<br>we've been doing a bit of work to try to<br>understand how these systems work and<br>also how they're regulated so hopefully<br>that's given you a little taste of this<br>incredible arms race that's going on<br>between the bacteria and the viruses<br>it's really kind of a game of<br>ceman ship where one will do something<br>the other one will come back and respond<br>the other one has no other trick up its<br>sleeve and it's just a continuous sort<br>of arms race that's happening and and I<br>think this is really tells us a lot<br>about evolutionary processes but then<br>this has a lot of real-world<br>implications and applications as<br>hopefully I've alluded to earlier and<br>that really just leads me to sort of<br>finished on this picture which was drawn<br>by a former lab member to show that<br>there's really this incredible arms race<br>going on between these these elements<br>and I think the question really as<br>waters next because there's always<br>something else out there and I think<br>that makes it interesting to come and to<br>work every day to try to find it and we<br>really just wanted to thank the<br>incredible team who've done all of the<br>work I've shown you today and also the<br>the funders who've made everything<br>possible so this is not possible to do<br>this work without funding and in<br>particular wanted to really acknowledge<br>the Royal Society of New Zealand<br>particularly through the Marcin fund and<br>the rather for discovery fellowships<br>because they provided a lot of very<br>fundamental research funds which enable<br>us to do a lot of this work and I think<br>that kind of links back nicely to the<br>fact that CRISPR care systems providing<br>such a useful application and a<br>potential buyer technological tool but<br>we could never have found them by trying<br>to look for them we had to do<br>fundamental research to be able to do<br>that and find them and now the potential<br>is as is massive so with that thank you<br>very much for your attention and it's<br>thank you very much indeed Peter<br>wonderful talk in fact I remember<br>meeting Peters postdoc and PhD mentor<br>George sambandh at a conference and 1985<br>I think it was in the UK and George was<br>telling me about this marvelous New<br>Zealand a PhD student that he had in the<br>lab the student that would make an<br>absolutely consummate academic the<br>student that was a complete package in<br>terms of this research communication and<br>interpersonal skills and I think we've<br>seen tonight just you know the truth and<br>in George's words on that I should say<br>there's only a couple years after George<br>said that to me that we managed to get<br>Peter into the lab anyway I went to the<br>department<br>so I guess Peter has emphasized in his<br>lecture just how much science and<br>medicine owed to those viruses and<br>infect bacteria I think is really<br>elegantly illustrated the role of<br>curiosity driven research how that<br>curiosity driven research into the arms<br>race between the bacteria and the<br>viruses has led first of all to some<br>fundamental understandings and new<br>knowledge and wonderful new knowledge<br>but it's also actually spawned a number<br>of but at least two by technological<br>revolutions the genetic manipulation is<br>part of the everyday parlance amongst<br>the public I guess these days and it's<br>probably not going to be too many more<br>years between before Chris Burke s is<br>also an everyday word and the Oxford the<br>Oxford Dictionary as well just showing<br>how as Peters emphasized his own talk<br>how important those fundamental<br>researchers and how these sort of<br>unexpected findings can leave to a<br>marvelous inventions that we could never<br>otherwise have imagined<br>ok so listening to Peter I guess I could<br>assure you as well could only really<br>marvel at the sophistication of these<br>bacteria ornate and adaptive immune<br>systems and I think you also have to<br>admire though at the resourcefulness of<br>those bacteriophage and fighting them<br>and overcoming them<br>and I guess the final thing you really<br>gotta Marvel letters what's around the<br>corner<br>what are we actually going to find out<br>next I mean it's such an exciting field<br>and there's such a lot of ongoing as you<br>say the arm race that is going to lead<br>to new innovations more and more<br>innovations all the time I think so<br>Peter I guess I just asked you people<br>gain to join me in thanking Peter for<br>this wonderful talk he's really<br>emphasized as groups world-leading<br>contributions to these rapidly advancing<br>fields and we really look forward to<br>hearing the future in a few more years<br>time as well so Peter I think we've got<br>a little gift time setting here<br>somewhere just topping up thank you so<br>much</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
