Royden<br>Summerville who is also here this<br>evening thank you very much Royden for<br>coming<br>now as all of you have heard me say so<br>many times the path to professor here at<br>the University of Otago is not an easy<br>one in order to receive this particular<br>promotion the applicant must demonstrate<br>excellence in teaching in research and<br>in service to the University and the<br>wider community as you will learn from<br>his lecture this evening professor<br>Schultz is an effective and motivating<br>teacher in fact the student evaluations<br>of his teaching border on the perfect he<br>is also an outstanding scientist and<br>tonight you will have the opportunity to<br>learn more about his groundbreaking<br>research into gut health and last but<br>certainly not least Michel has provided<br>exceptional service to his department to<br>the University and to the wider research<br>community all of this activity is all<br>the more impressive because it has<br>occurred against the backdrop of a very<br>busy medical practice<br>so Michael on behalf of the University<br>of Otago it gives me great pleasure to<br>congratulate you on your very well<br>earned promotion to professor and I will<br>now call on the Dean of the Dunedin<br>School of Medicine professor Barry<br>Taylor who will tell us just a little<br>bit more about Michael's academic<br>journey to Professor noreda tena koe tow<br>QR everybody great to see turnout on a<br>cold night it's my pleasure to introduce<br>Michael Schultz professor Michael<br>Schultz and and I guess summarized in<br>less than five minutes his career to<br>date so Michael was born and spent his<br>first 18 years in Stuttgart in Germany<br>he then joined the army<br>and spent 18 months in the army that was<br>pretty standard practice for all young<br>men and Germany at that stage and then<br>lift left after 18 months went to<br>university studying medicine graduating<br>in 1994 he then spent us house-surgeon<br>years so the next two years in the UK<br>Manchester and then in London before<br>spending a two-year stint at the<br>University of North Carolina Chapel Hill<br>in the USA after those two years really<br>focusing on research he then went back<br>to Germany and spent eight years as a<br>clinical research fellow and in<br>consultant gastroenterologist and<br>towards the end of that time was awarded<br>his PhD a slightly different name in<br>Germany but the equivalent of a PhD in<br>2005 he then came to Dunedin si-joint<br>clinical appointment between the<br>University and the DHB<br>and functioned sa gastroenterologist<br>within the clinical service and the<br>senior lecturer within the Department of<br>Medicine he spent eight years in that<br>role before being promoted to associate<br>professor and then six years after that<br>to the full professorship that we're<br>celebrating tonight during that time he<br>took on roles as deputy and then head of<br>department of medicine and he's been in<br>that head of department role now for the<br>last three years he's published greater<br>than 65 peer-reviewed papers nine<br>chapters and books supervised or<br>currently or in the past supervised more<br>than 15 mass<br>and PhD students and all the time<br>maintaining an active role as a<br>clinician in the hospital system<br>his words are very active researcher he<br>runs a large number of commercial trials<br>within the hospital system testing out<br>new ways of managing patients with<br>mainly inflammatory bowel disease but<br>he'll be talking a lot more about that<br>but his research has clearly been<br>directed and informed by his patients<br>and we'll hear a bit more about that he<br>in terms of his collaboration probably<br>the most noteworthy thing I want to<br>mention is forming and leading gut<br>health network of researchers from<br>across the spectrum of research<br>expertise looking at gut health and gut<br>health has become the big thing in many<br>areas of science which now seems to<br>control your emotions your bowel habits<br>whether you're going to get an<br>inflammatory disease such as even heart<br>disease so the influence of the gut well<br>known for a long time in terms of the<br>influence on the brain and vice versa<br>but now that influence has spread right<br>across the whole body so being in gut<br>health is a great sort of research<br>opportunity which he has picked up and<br>run with by forming this gut Health<br>Network so that's a quick summary of<br>Michael Schultz and in becoming a full<br>professor I'm able to actually and sort<br>of show that there was one other name<br>that comes to us so this is the miracle<br>in dinning chair in medicine<br>unfortunately no money comes with us at<br>all that just the prestige and the name<br>I think you'll Bob's it and Rob Walker<br>were previous holders of this particular<br>chair so this is for your office and to<br>not only I you've got a full<br>professorship but you have the miry<br>Glendening chair in medicine Jess<br>thank you very much thank you very much<br>professor Haines and professor Taylor<br>thank you very much for joining me<br>tonight and thank you very much for all<br>of you to give up your evening to to<br>listen to hopefully an interesting story<br>maybe and not quite straightforward<br>story but also a story that is the story<br>of my life and as a professor you get<br>this one opportunity to tell the story<br>of your life I think then nobody's<br>really interested in that again and you<br>have to really focus on your research<br>once more<br>I brought my lucky colon with me so this<br>is this is the colon that is on the<br>poster for the that advertised for the<br>IPL and I had some people asking me<br>Michael what do you have in your hands<br>well now you know it I've got my lucky<br>call on in my hands and I put my lucky<br>call on here so I guess just right<br>beside the Mary Glendenning chair it's a<br>peculiar chair I wonder what you do with<br>it but yes let's let's get on to this I<br>would like to tell you a little bit of a<br>journey a journey of how it came to be<br>that I studied medicine and a journey<br>that Indian led me to live here in<br>Dunedin so we've been here now for about<br>15 years or so and we still like it and<br>I introduced the place to a radiologist<br>just the other day and and I think at<br>some point he probably thought well can<br>this guy stop talking about a needn't we<br>know that he likes it here so so this is<br>this is the journey that started in<br>Germany took us to England as Barry<br>pointed out and from England over to<br>America from America back to Germany and<br>then finally down to to New Zealand it<br>was a bit of a rocky start I have to say<br>this is a little Michael maybe I should<br>have become a car mechanic I don't know<br>I had great interest in cars so that day<br>and yeah maybe maybe that should have<br>been my calling I then went to school in<br>Stuttgart as you as you said Barry and<br>this is how we looked like when we went<br>to school so you see the little<br>they were politically completely<br>incorrect I think nowadays these these<br>these horns full off of sweets<br>there were no apples in there or<br>anything this was purely chocolate and<br>sweets and lollies and stuff like that<br>grandma possibly was a little bit<br>differently thinking so she would have<br>given me a ruler and a pen and stuff<br>like what do I do with that I like the<br>sweets so this this was that this is<br>probably the first time I came across<br>something closely resembling Anatomy so<br>this is me working at age 16 in the<br>local abattoir a slaughterhouse my job<br>was to put stamps on the carcasses so<br>they were examined before and and found<br>ready to be consumed or put into the<br>food chain so I put the stamp on there<br>very interesting job looking back what I<br>struggled with most was the half liter<br>or liter of beer my colleagues consumed<br>for breakfast they looked at me and said<br>you drinking not beer and the tests they<br>performed them to convince me that I<br>should have a beer and you all know this<br>take a glass of coca-cola and I'm not<br>advertising you take a glass of coke put<br>a piece of meat in there it will<br>dissolve put it into beer it will not so<br>hey who can argue that a beer for<br>breakfast isn't something that you<br>should have I struggled with that and I<br>still do probably luckily a slight<br>detour I thought while shaping<br>surfboards might be something that I<br>should do tragic story - that this thing<br>is now at the bottom of lago de guardar<br>the italian lake it didn't swim so that<br>career was was nothing for me either<br>and Barry mentioned the army so every<br>German young man had to basically joined<br>the army and that time you could try<br>very hard not to join the army that was<br>possible but it would have had some<br>repercussions for your future career and<br>and the traditional Germans wouldn't<br>like that so I joined the army it was<br>the path of least resistance I don't<br>think I look very fearsome there and I<br>try to get out of the army as soon as I<br>could that's why I cut it short by by a<br>few months to then study medicine in<br>fact I briefly considered<br>during medicine in the army that would<br>have allowed me to stay in the army for<br>another 30 years or so they would have<br>paid for studies that was so good what<br>really I didn't like apart from other<br>things not liking the Army was they<br>would have told me what I have to do<br>they wouldn't have let you use your<br>specialty or choose your specialty that<br>you liked they would have said well we<br>do need an orthopedic surgeon I don't<br>think I would have made a good<br>orthopedic surgeon or a psychiatrist for<br>that matter so that was really something<br>luckily the public system called and I<br>was able to get away and study medicine<br>that's I did in ela in nürnberg we we<br>don't have the freshest v for the<br>freshest N or whatever you call this<br>here but we have student fraternities<br>the the reason to be in a fraternity is<br>the same you make friends and you drink<br>that's basically all you do for the<br>first year you do this wearing fancy<br>uniforms and and you have a lot of<br>traditions and that's why I joined them<br>I really felt at home there they gave<br>you kind of a home away from home<br>looking back it looks funny I'm still<br>member of that fraternity and we are<br>lucky enough to traveling Stars coming<br>to New Zealand to visit us because once<br>in a fraternity always in a fraternity<br>and you basically have to house these<br>youngsters at home and do the best for<br>them that you that you can do at the end<br>of medicine and and bury you ask me what<br>DCM means at the end of of medicine we<br>we have to write a thesis you don't get<br>in Germany your MD automatically you you<br>get it if you write an MD thesis so the<br>Americans have it a little bit easier<br>here I did cardiology I thought<br>cardiology is good this is this is an<br>elegant field they all drive big cars<br>and and and they just look at after one<br>organ very important organ I thought<br>let's do cardiology so it was good to<br>start with of course I did my thesis and<br>I now was able to present it in New<br>Delhi which was fantastic so the first<br>free conference trip to New Delhi that<br>was so good and I obviously got my MD<br>out of that but then things went a<br>little bit sour I had to apply for jobs<br>and the time in Germany applying for<br>jobs as a<br>doctor was very difficult needless to<br>say that maybe my grades were more<br>influenced by being in a fraternity than<br>concentrating on studies but I wrote 80<br>applications can you imagine<br>80 so that was before the internet so I<br>didn't just hit a button and send an<br>application of these were bound<br>application spiral-bound<br>application they were hugely expensive<br>Egypt an individual application was<br>hugely expensive I started at the top of<br>course going to universities and they<br>didn't like me<br>local hospitals didn't like me rehab<br>units didn't like me but there was<br>England England was had a shortage of<br>doctors so I went to England fantastic<br>Rob where's Rob Robert somewhere here I<br>did nephrology my first job was<br>nephrology and what I learned was it is<br>very important to know what soccer club<br>you belong to or what you're supporting<br>so the Saturday morning water and was<br>really divided between men United and<br>Manchester City I did my first<br>nephrology job in in Manchester and it's<br>also interesting how the belonging to a<br>soccer club and the support influences<br>your perception of symptoms when the<br>game was on it was dead quiet on the<br>water nobody called as a hostage and I<br>had two days to two hours off nobody had<br>any symptoms but believe me if the wrong<br>Club lost cause the pager went berserk<br>and everybody suddenly remembered why<br>they were in hospital there was there<br>was an interesting time we then went on<br>to Greenwich district hospital did a<br>little bit of cardiology and then I<br>dipped my toe into gastroenterology and<br>this is I thought that the finding<br>moment where I thought this is this is<br>my calling and there was hope they was<br>hope for leaving England and possibly<br>going back to Germany and actually doing<br>a stranger ology so as a as a trainee<br>intern I did a stint at Yale University<br>and funny how people perceive<br>applications so in my application was<br>obviously a lecturer letter from a<br>recommendation from Yale University<br>needless to say without the American<br>exam I was absolutely unable to do<br>anything at Yale University I was like<br>the fifth behind the professor and tried<br>to see the patient I was not allowed to<br>touch any patients I was not allowed to<br>even<br>really talk to a patient but I had my<br>letter of recommendation from Yale<br>University who can be that and now to<br>the title of my talk excuse me where is<br>the bathroom now you can imagine we were<br>sitting like this here and I was sitting<br>beside my German colleague who came with<br>me to New Haven and and he whispered in<br>my no idea where the bathroom is but<br>then the guy behind us<br>professor boy is already he kept us on<br>the shoulder and said hey bathroom is<br>over there and we come whoops<br>another one who speaks German so he was<br>a professor from Munich University and<br>he was on sabbatical at Yale University<br>and he knew where the bathroom is so he<br>became our friend and as in my in my<br>final year when I when I had to kind of<br>figure out my career and I went through<br>these 80 applications I said to you all<br>reach hey your professor in Munich can<br>you help me with a job and he said sure<br>I mean you seem to be a nice guy sent<br>you CV to my boss and I'm sure he can<br>invite you to an interview for an<br>interview took about 24 hours I got my<br>invitation back sorry we have no job for<br>you so I I went to already again and<br>said hey you need to try better than<br>that this didn't work and he said yep<br>and there's a guy in Regensburg show<br>Murray he does things a little bit<br>differently he doesn't just look after<br>for grades he he wants to talk and he's<br>nice so I sent my application off to<br>professor Sherman looking guy and so he<br>was so I still call him professor<br>Shiller I haven't moved on to the human<br>stage but professor Murray in response<br>to my application sent me a book he sent<br>me a book about that big and said dr.<br>Scholl's please read chapter 10 if you<br>find chapter 10 interesting call my<br>secretary and arrange an interview<br>needless to say chapter 10 was the best<br>chapter I ever read I mean there was<br>nothing better than chapter 10 it had to<br>do with interleukin 10 whatever that was<br>interleukin 2 no idea mice well I<br>thought I become a doctor but I never -<br>look after my soul I wrote him back and<br>said gosh yeah chapter 10 that's the one<br>I was waiting for<br>so he so he invited me to an interview<br>and there we were talking about chapter<br>10 i by then had actually read chapter<br>10 and i did my homework so i could<br>answer questions to chapter 10 and he<br>said i don't have a job for you right<br>now which i thought ok here we go again<br>but he said if you want to spend a<br>couple of years in a theoretical<br>institution that's what he called it so<br>I wasn't quite sure what I meant<br>I can help you in a few years you come<br>back and you have a job here so cut a<br>long story short he introduced me to<br>Professor balfus archer who has been my<br>mentor ever since Balfour is a clinician<br>scientist at the University of North<br>Carolina in Chapel Hill and above who is<br>just the most fantastic mentor you can<br>imagine I had the pleasure of being<br>there just a couple of weeks ago when he<br>was given the American<br>Gastroenterological Association lifetime<br>mentoring award and that just shows you<br>what what kind of guy he is he when he<br>mentors somebody he knows how that's<br>being done so Balfour had written and I<br>shouldn't tell you all these secrets but<br>it stays in this room I guess Balfour<br>had written an application to the<br>American funding authorities he sent me<br>that application said Michael you need<br>to translate that into German you send<br>it to the German funding agencies they<br>wouldn't know I've submitted the same<br>stuff to the Americans and then we both<br>get money so that's what we did I got to<br>go to North Carolina and do research on<br>inflammatory bowel disease so just a<br>small excuse on what is inflammatory<br>bowel disease now inflammatory bowel<br>disease is one of those chronic<br>disorders and that affect people mainly<br>in their young years it is still not<br>quite known where inflammatory bowel<br>disease comes from you probably know<br>Crohn's disease and also if colitis so<br>it is a multi-faceted disease it has<br>several things that need to come into<br>play luminol antigens of the microbiome<br>that Burien Harleen mentioned the immune<br>response needs to be in the right<br>mindset to cause inflammatory bowel<br>disease the patient needs to have a<br>certain genetic background to develop<br>this disease and of course the<br>environment plays a huge role in in all<br>of this so in order to study this<br>we left for America my then girlfriend<br>now wife and mother of my children we<br>set off to America and we thought oh<br>this sounds like a great idea so<br>inflammatory bowel disease as I said<br>it's Crohn's disease and also if colitis<br>the main difference is also if colitis<br>as the name suggests can only affect the<br>large intestine<br>whereas Crohn's disease can affect the<br>patient from top to bottom if you look<br>at these juicy pictures up there and<br>this is prior to dinner so I think I can<br>still show them Crohn's disease has a<br>distinctive different look to it than<br>odds of colitis Crohn's disease gives<br>you deep observations and healthy inner<br>lining beside these big ulcers whereas<br>also if colitis on the other hand gives<br>you a more uniform appearance confluent<br>inflammation and under the microscope<br>they also look quite different these two<br>diseases however talking about science<br>talking about research these diseases do<br>actually affect the patient fairly<br>similarly they are not that different on<br>on treatment levels and in patient<br>levels full steam ahead<br>we started research so this was my foot<br>in the door with funding from two big<br>funding organizations we were able to do<br>very nice studies so powerful claim to<br>fame is that he was the first who<br>described that a mouse model susceptible<br>to inflammatory bowel disease how to<br>intestinal inflammation will not get<br>such an inflammation if there is no<br>microbiota if the bottom of the mouse is<br>sterile so this first paper and he<br>basically what he did was he collected<br>animal models susceptible to<br>inflammation and stuck them into a<br>germ-free environment and most of them<br>did not get any inflammation so this<br>first paper here can you actually see<br>the mouse yes you can<br>so this first paper here I was a<br>co-author on that because I was in the<br>lab for like six eight weeks or so<br>showed that if you have the mouse in a<br>germ-free environment nothing really<br>happens in terms of inflammation but if<br>the mouse gets moved out into a we call<br>that specific free environment by a<br>specific pathogen free environment sorry<br>this basically means a<br>an environment outside the cage so the<br>mouse is susceptible to all sorts of<br>bacteria this mouse gets within 12 weeks<br>massive information and you see this<br>here this is this is the inner lining of<br>the large intestine of a mouse very thin<br>very normal looking where's all this<br>done here this is massive information<br>this is really a sickly swollen large<br>intestine this is how these poor mice<br>had to lift they lift like the bubble<br>boy in a bubble it's hugely labor<br>intense and and a complication prone to<br>raise a germ-free environment this is<br>something that is is very difficult to<br>do so only very few places in the world<br>have this environment where we can<br>really claim that the mouse is<br>absolutely sterile and term free now my<br>first paper that I published myself then<br>or where did most of the work was a<br>little bit of an interesting one because<br>I just told you that if the mouse is<br>germ free without any bacteria the mouse<br>will not get any inflammation well<br>Michael showed that if you keep the<br>mouse long enough in in a germ-free<br>environment the mouse will still get<br>some inflammation that needed a little<br>bit of convincing that needle a little<br>bit of extra work to make sure that the<br>mouse wasn't contaminated or anything<br>like that but in the end we were able to<br>convince even the most serious skeptic<br>that yes there is an autoimmune<br>component in the whole system so<br>eventually if you just wait long enough<br>the mouse will get inflammation now<br>these mice are very important on very<br>special mice il-10 knockout mice oil and<br>deficient mice they lack interleukin 10<br>well that's not the secret but<br>interleukin 10 is an immunosuppressive<br>cytokine Ross Kemp is here somewhere she<br>will tell me off later on for being so<br>simplistic but after all I'm just a<br>clinician so it's it's an<br>immunosuppressive cytokine if you take<br>that away the immune system will just go<br>berserk and and will create this<br>inflammation the same thing holds true<br>for interleukin interleukin 2 again if<br>you take that away there will be lots of<br>information so you see that the picture<br>is not quite as nice as in this first<br>paper they do get inflammation but not<br>just not as much as other animals but<br>nevertheless it was still proof of<br>principle that<br>our components that we thought that lead<br>to inflammatory bowel disease are just<br>important to kind of make this happen<br>then in 1996 still in the States we<br>expected a child Kimmy I don't know if<br>Kimmy's here hi - Sydney Kimmy and my<br>traditional parents as they were and my<br>wife's traditional parents said you<br>can't have a child if you're not married<br>so well get married we got married in<br>New York it has the romantic atmosphere<br>of a 1970s twins office I guess so we we<br>had tiled walls halfway through the<br>corridor the guy we got married on the<br>31st so of December the guy said we need<br>to be fast here I need to be RT about 12<br>o'clock do you have anyone who wants to<br>join and said yeah this person so you<br>know how it within 30 seconds or so it<br>was all over and done with and you see<br>it didn't impede on the work down here<br>is Kimmy and me working ahead on an old<br>Olivetti computer and this this study<br>that came to fruition then within their<br>time frame was probably the one that<br>again formed my research interest the<br>most so if the influence the microbiota<br>is so important in in creating<br>inflammatory bowel disease we should be<br>able to manipulate the microflora and<br>somehow manipulate the creation of<br>inflammatory bowel disease so at that<br>point in time probiotics we were just<br>first mentioned we took a strain<br>lactobacillus plantarum 299 video and<br>asked me why it was named like that and<br>we did a whole bunch of experiments with<br>these with these animals so of course<br>the gold standard was you keep the<br>animal in germ-free conditions nothing<br>will happen the animal will not get<br>inflammation we're back to the Isleton<br>knockout mice then if you take the<br>animal out of the germ-free environment<br>it will get severe colitis so that were<br>our control experiments we then moved on<br>to move the germ-free into an SPF<br>environment against severe colitis but<br>if we associate that moving out<br>to the SPF environment with<br>lactobacillus plantarum so as soon as<br>these animals got out of their cage we<br>started feeding them lactobacillus the<br>colitis was much less severe than it was<br>before so obviously there was some sort<br>of preventative effect of feeding a<br>probiotic to these very inflammatory<br>bowel disease prone animals even more so<br>if we took germ-free animals and mono<br>associated them with lactobacillus the<br>effect was even much better so they saw<br>lactobacillus still in their sterile<br>environment we moved them out and<br>continued with lactobacillus and that<br>gave them just a very mild colitis so<br>that was an interesting finding because<br>for the first time we were able in mice<br>to manipulate the intestinal flora and<br>showed that this has flow-on effects on<br>on inflammatory bowel disease that said<br>we had to move back to New Jersey to to<br>Regensburg to Germany because the<br>funding ran out and I thought well what<br>works in mice must work in humans we're<br>not that different so let's do the same<br>trial in humans well everybody who can<br>reach a kaplan-meier curve tells me that<br>mmm didn't really work so what we took<br>where patients with Crohn's disease<br>active Crohn's disease a flare-up of<br>their Crohn's disease we put these<br>patients on steroids as per standard<br>protocol but we also added a<br>lactobacillus - to their diet or to<br>their treatment hoping that we can<br>shorten the active disease or the<br>interval of active disease and hoping<br>that we can keep them in remission<br>longer these patients needless to say it<br>just did not work so all my enthusiasm<br>was for nothing<br>we stopped the trial after about 10<br>patients because there was absolutely no<br>no difference in these patients they<br>went my initial enthusiasm but another<br>milestone was reached and as you could<br>see early on with Kimmy on my arm and<br>I'm hacking away on the computer the<br>family was roped in and this is now<br>Fiona who is up there in the audience<br>and Fiona didn't know it at that time<br>and basically I'm not quite sure if she<br>would have been capable of signing an<br>informed consent form but I'm sure<br>with some reassurance what what we did<br>was we thought okay we can manipulate<br>the intestinal flora of mice by giving<br>them a probiotic can we do that in<br>humans so we picked I think six women we<br>started giving them treating them with<br>electro bacillus and stopped at the time<br>of birth and then we collected fecal<br>samples from these newborn babies up to<br>a certain length of time and we're<br>trying to find that particular<br>lactobacillus that we fed the mums<br>whether that was in in the baby and<br>needless to say it was the year so the<br>thought was at that time that the the<br>first contact with a microbiome for a<br>newborn is through mum so when you<br>compare and and everybody who went to<br>general Tanakh symposium last week there<br>was plenty of evidence there when when<br>you look at the micro flora of a newborn<br>baby that resembles very much a mixture<br>between a vaginal flora and a a rectal<br>flora of of mum if you do the same in a<br>baby with c-section yeah well the micro<br>flora assembles more the sterile hands<br>of the physician of the obstetrician and<br>of the table the surrounding environment<br>in the hospital so clearly it is<br>important that mum passes something onto<br>the baby so in these in these six months<br>we were able to up to two years find<br>this particular lactobacillus that mum<br>has seen and obviously has passed on<br>through baby we were very careful to<br>make sure that baby wasn't exposed in<br>any other means to that lactobacillus<br>the three baby said were born by<br>c-section did not show any evidence of<br>this lactobacillus so that was a<br>fantastic study thank you very much for<br>your honor for helping with that study<br>it was a tremendous milestone but like<br>all these things there's a carry to it<br>and this was the first contact little<br>did I know that I will end up in this<br>place this was the first contact with<br>the University of Otago so the paper was<br>published and an editorial was published<br>by professor Tanakh now yes you can read<br>the<br>toriel at least part of it he wasn't too<br>impressed I guess Gerald he said<br>although the results are tantalizing<br>perhaps attempts at influencing the<br>composition of the gut microflora might<br>be better directed at bifidobacteria<br>obviously Gerald works on bifidobacteria<br>so he had to put his claim into the sand<br>but at least we got an editorial out of<br>it and Gerald noticed that and I I had<br>some very great conversations with<br>Gerald later on when when I joined the<br>university of otago so that was that was<br>absolutely fantastic so that was a<br>starting point now Barry mention that we<br>do something that's called habilitation<br>which then ends in a big word like<br>cleave at st. very German word yes it is<br>somewhat similar to your PhD essentially<br>you're your boss has to decide when<br>you're ready to go for it it's not a big<br>consortium that that makes that decision<br>the unwritten rule is you publish a<br>number of papers you have some funding<br>available and then you write up this<br>thesis which you can write up either as<br>a cumulative thesis just like here as<br>well so you put your papers in there do<br>an introduction to a conclusion and<br>that's it and this is this is what i did<br>i had my six papers that were well<br>published and and well cited so that was<br>the habilitation and that was very<br>useful for my few years that I spent in<br>Regensburg we had to get married again<br>now why was that I I thought you know<br>the as I said before the atmosphere of a<br>vince office of the 70s should be enough<br>but no it wasn't the dream of a real<br>marriage or real wedding in white and<br>all the bells and whistles we had to<br>just give in to that lots of dollars<br>that went in but it was worth it it was<br>absolutely worth it it was very very<br>good so that happened two years back in<br>in in Germany it wasn't a white wedding<br>because of course white weren't white<br>anymore we had two children so we<br>couldn't do the white wedding so we did<br>the yellow white wedding I think<br>kind of off-white wedding which was<br>fantastic fast forward now Dunedin how<br>did this happen with Dunedin now it<br>happened because an email reached me dr.<br>Lepke who is the guy down here in the<br>middle dr. Lepke also a German doctor he<br>knew professor Sherman right back in<br>back in Germany and the gastro<br>department I think that's possibly the<br>fate of the gastro department was once<br>again looking for a colleague so dr.<br>Lepke send an email to the colleague and<br>said well if you got some money who<br>wants to come to New Zealand why don't<br>you ask him to send a cv to New Zealand<br>hmm<br>I was the third person who received that<br>email the first two said New Zealand too<br>far away or too many family ties here in<br>in in Germany I don't want to go but<br>well I looked at my wife and I said well<br>you know we've we've tried it before<br>we've been away we've been to the States<br>we've been to England why shouldn't we<br>try New Zealand and when then the<br>University here said come for a week two<br>visits well Barry I have to admit I said<br>well at least we get a week New Zealand<br>out of this whether we like the job or<br>not again little did we know that we<br>came to a land of opportunity<br>gastroenterologist in New Zealand that's<br>really a land of opportunity a land<br>where milk and honey flows from a gas<br>from the logical point of view Rob<br>Walker John heightened Jim man Geraldton<br>OGG grant but Gil Baba said over-the-air<br>raff loop Kmart in slope I couldn't find<br>a picture of Stephanie Ferrand<br>endocrinologist in the hospital so<br>that's that's a proxy for Steph all<br>these people gave me such a warm welcome<br>and and believed in what I wanted to do<br>and it didn't seem as such a big step<br>twice 12 hours flying being absolutely<br>naked I think it was raining like crazy<br>here and yet Dunedin showed itself from<br>from the best side still we liked it<br>here<br>why why did I say land of opportunity so<br>after all these interviews on the flight<br>back we looked at each other and said<br>I'm same thing happened to me here as<br>well today we made an offer or I got an<br>offer of the job and I said to my wife<br>he let<br>take this job why not so why is it a<br>land of opportunity now back to some<br>serious stuff New Zealand has one of the<br>highest incidents of inflammatory bowel<br>disease the highest rate of inflammatory<br>bowel disease worldwide and it's still<br>growing so somebody who has an interest<br>in inflammatory bowel disease wells to<br>go this is fantastic<br>we have approximately 25,000 patients in<br>New Zealand does this work that I've<br>done together with Kirsten Capel who is<br>here in the audience I believe I saw her<br>yesterday she is it was trawling through<br>many many many patient notes and now<br>these all locked up and asbestos gear<br>but we apparently been told we can<br>retrieve some of the notes back from<br>from the the basement of the hospital<br>but needless to say this curve is<br>pointing up so we will see more of these<br>patients in the future so that's a good<br>starting point for the land of<br>opportunity we have a lot of unhappy<br>patients so shortly after I arrived<br>there was a a questionnaire done in in<br>New Zealand about treatment and<br>everything else while 2/3 of all<br>patients needed emergency care prior to<br>their diagnosis that should not happen<br>25% of patients waited more than five<br>years for a diagnosis that should not<br>happen 50% of Asians needed surgery now<br>Mark Thompson Fawcett is up there and we<br>weekly almost have a discussion whether<br>this is good or bad if you need surgery<br>I still maintain it's bad mark maintains<br>it's good but I think the the verdict is<br>still out there<br>61% waited more than six months to see a<br>specialist all these things make very<br>unhappy patients now we are not alone in<br>this world they lower panel here and you<br>can read the numbers yourself those are<br>the results from a year from the same<br>European service so they are not much<br>better than what we do here in New<br>Zealand they have similar problems we<br>also have unhappy doctors going on with<br>the theme of land of opportunity in 1932<br>Beryl Crone diverted described first the<br>disease of crohn's disease<br>and since then not much really has<br>happened lots of publications in<br>everything but for the patient's<br>something that I can take back<br>to my clinic that's still difficult you<br>you know these trucks you in the<br>audience they are steroids out there now<br>steroids are still our main stem of<br>treatment can you believe it they were<br>first around in 1955 we're still using<br>steroids with all the side effects<br>steroids have their vicious drugs of<br>course they're good for the patient<br>because it brings them into remission<br>the symptoms go away but what's the cost<br>we dabbled a little bit in nutrition<br>1985 there was a high poverty burn to<br>this disease no there isn't<br>at least there wasn't and maybe now<br>learning that nutrition is the biggest<br>influence of the microbiome maybe we go<br>back and revisit nutrition but certainly<br>at that point in time no is the siren<br>again a drug that has plenty of benefits<br>it's a fantastic drug because it keeps<br>patients in remission without steroids<br>it's an immuno modulator so it doesn't<br>isn't called immunosuppressive agents at<br>sounds very bad it's an immuno modulator<br>but again when I have to go through the<br>list of potential side-effects with my<br>patients needless to say that some<br>patients just walk out the door and say<br>well things but know things we're<br>talking about lymphoma which is a cancer<br>of the blood system we talk about skin<br>cancer well thank you we have enough<br>skin cancer in New Zealand we don't need<br>you to put me on a drug that gives me<br>even more skin cancer and that's a study<br>we also published and showed that we<br>were able to triple the rate of skin<br>cancer in patients treated with this<br>drug so you have to have a good reason<br>why you put patients on these drugs miss<br>attract say not much nicer a bit of hope<br>then in 1996 and we're the first very<br>directed medications coming on the<br>market from Belgium the so-called NT TNF<br>antibodies or biologicals those drugs<br>are different to steroids steroids put a<br>blanket on your immune system but these<br>biological drugs are very targeted to<br>one thing in the immune system and take<br>that one thing out similar to aisle ten<br>in aisle two TNF alpha is one of those<br>mediators of inflammation if you block<br>it the inflammation goes away at least<br>that's the theory so there were two of<br>them<br>a little bit political here it took New<br>Zealand quite a while and Hildy's drugs<br>were funded in 2009 finally our patients<br>got access to these drugs and then<br>nothing since 2009 we had no further<br>development in New Zealand for any<br>further drugs so again unhappy doctors I<br>just put up there in 2015 Australia had<br>some more drugs in 2017 Australia had<br>some more drugs we have nothing<br>well if our patient cannot tolerate the<br>drugs that we have available<br>if a patient loses the effect of those<br>drugs in my next slide we'll show you<br>that this is actually quite a few we<br>have to turn to surgery now you saw on<br>my very first slide that I'm on Twitter<br>and I'm following quite a few people on<br>Twitter and I'm also following a group<br>that's called gutless and glamorous<br>gutless and glamorous is a group of<br>young women with a stoma bag now they<br>make the best of their situation but I<br>don't think that should be what we're<br>aiming for of course this is not the end<br>of the world but if you talk to a 15 20<br>25 year old young woman who wants to<br>plan a family that potentially surgery<br>will ruin these plans of having a family<br>and it will play with your body image<br>this is not an easy thing to do<br>especially when this person then brings<br>the newspaper and says but these drugs<br>are available in some other countries<br>can we not just leave to Australia and I<br>have to say yeah yes you might have to a<br>lot of drugs that we use are not a<br>hundred percent effective this is a<br>slider I borrowed from Professor Barkley<br>in in Christchurch and what it basically<br>shows is that you start your patients on<br>these trucks and the efficacy is here on<br>this side so the immuno modulators aces<br>are in for instance reach something like<br>30% of efficacy 30% of patients on these<br>drugs will stay in remission for a long<br>time that's fantastic if we use the<br>biological so this is the entity and if<br>antibody biological said I talked about<br>we go over 60% so that's again fantastic<br>60% of our patients will reach remission<br>over time this will get less and less so<br>we put those two drugs together it will<br>still get less and less<br>and after about a year only about half<br>of our patients are still in remission<br>so that drug that worked very well in<br>the beginning stops working we call that<br>a therapeutic gap and this is I think<br>where research needs to be directed it<br>how do you do research in New Zealand<br>well you need people I already said I<br>had patients but you also need money<br>going the traditional funding routes<br>seems to be difficult seems to be not<br>very effective because the acceptance<br>rate of the big applications is bit<br>small so I thought well how can I<br>capture the needs of my needs and the<br>patient with one thing so Barry<br>mentioned we do a lot of commercial<br>trials and this gives our patients<br>access to the latest medications so all<br>these tracks that either not even<br>available in Australia but or already<br>available in Australia or the American<br>the United States or Europe all these<br>tracks need to be tested first so we<br>have now built up a big Center for<br>clinical trials and thanks to my<br>research nurses are aha and Marilee and<br>Murray Michele and Christine Howe IBD<br>nurse and Dawn and who was I missing<br>Amelia<br>so there's a standby picture proxy for<br>Amelia because I couldn't find an Amelia<br>picture so all these nurses help me<br>running this trial Steve Johnson has<br>joined the unit lately in three years<br>ago and he's also very busy in in these<br>turning toilets and what they do is they<br>allow my patients to have the latest in<br>medications and we have a lot of success<br>stories but they also pay quite<br>handsomely these trials so they pay for<br>all our investigator-initiated trials<br>and you see here the yellow bars down<br>here the light yellow bars these are the<br>trials that we run where we use the<br>money from these commercial trials to<br>run these things and one of those<br>projects was a project that looked into<br>the original inflammatory bowel disease<br>organoids<br>now what our organoids I teamed up with<br>grant but who had a long-standing<br>history of working together with the<br>gastro department as well as Ross Kemp<br>again<br>Safina was was our PhD student at their<br>time and we we asked the initial<br>question the chicken and the egg<br>question is it a leaky gut that leaks<br>leads to inflammatory bowel disease and<br>if so is the leak he got there before<br>inflammatory bowel disease happens or<br>will it be a consequence of inflammatory<br>bowel disease so the course consequence<br>question for that we used patients with<br>inflammatory bowel disease we still do<br>we take a biopsy from their large<br>intestine we isolate the little crypts<br>that's the little subunits that the<br>large intestine is made of and we grow<br>them in the lab we grow out these crypts<br>into little mini guts and they actually<br>really mini guts in terms of they<br>representing all the cells that you<br>would find in a normal large intestine<br>positive point they don't fart but they<br>grow and they get bigger they have no<br>immune system<br>they have no bacteria so we can really<br>go back to the origins of inflammatory<br>bowel disease what was their first what<br>was the first event that led to<br>inflammatory bowel disease needless to<br>say they're all patient specific so we<br>have now a freezer full of these little<br>organoids<br>from individual patients and can study<br>the difference between patients but also<br>the difference with healthy beings and<br>we characterize them so the top panel<br>here is a normal biopsy of a large<br>intestine and needless to say what you<br>see here all these crypts and things but<br>it looks fairly similar to what grows in<br>my freezer or in my in my incubator<br>rather they get frozen and then they get<br>thrown again so they look very similar<br>so we are able to replicate a large<br>intestine in the lab an electron<br>microscope picture up here for compared<br>with an organ or down here so there is<br>really a strong similarity between what<br>we are growing in the lab and what is<br>actually present in the patient and<br>that's obviously the first step to learn<br>about these diseases when you take all<br>the other influencing factors away but<br>then the question was really how does<br>infirmity bowel disease Crohn's disease<br>develop so the trigger is there trigger<br>necessary our hypothesis which proved<br>wrong<br>in the end but our processes was without<br>any trigger without an immune system<br>these things are just the same we need<br>something to trigger inflammatory bowel<br>disease boy were we wrong<br>we saw straightaway that even an<br>uninflated colon Crohn's disease colon<br>the Crips look much different these<br>individual subunits here and if you<br>believe this this graph here the crypts<br>in in inflammatory bowel disease and<br>Crohn's disease are much longer their<br>damages they are inflamed naked-eye you<br>don't need to be a molecular biologist<br>or a clinician to see there's a big<br>difference between the these two this is<br>a control organoid this is a Crohn's<br>disease organoid that looks really<br>unhealthy if we looked further into<br>detail electron microscopy this picture<br>you've seen before are very nicely<br>organized very nicely organized in a<br>lining of the large intestine Crohn's<br>disease doesn't look like that it looks<br>really ill it looks distorted it looks<br>just not healthy and Safina could show<br>that about 20% of those organoids grow<br>inside out so they've lost the<br>orientation they didn't know which way<br>to grow so suddenly the outside is<br>inside and the inside is outside doesn't<br>make any sense but the fact is we don't<br>need bacteria to trigger inflammatory<br>bowel disease we don't even need an<br>immune system sorry to say we just need<br>a patient and the genetic background to<br>make crohn's disease going back to the<br>question of leaky gut well yes these<br>things are leaky again without the<br>influence of of bacteria so up here you<br>see an organized and we put color into<br>the medium that was outside the<br>organizer bernard was swimming in that<br>medium nothing goes to the inside so<br>there was no leakiness but if we take a<br>Crohn's disease organoid lots of<br>leakiness all the color leaked into the<br>organoid so again a sign for the leaky<br>gut is there it's already there before<br>Crohn's disease physically develops so<br>that was quite interesting in this study<br>in in organoids showed us that changes<br>are independent of the effects of<br>bacteria and immune system suggesting<br>that an increased in the-- in epithelial<br>permeability is course and not<br>consequence of inflammation<br>now we need to obviously confirm that<br>but that was a fantastic first finding<br>and then we moved on there were only be<br>patients so the orgonite story is for<br>making hopefully doctors a bit more<br>happy in finding new drugs but then<br>there are in heavy patients so over a<br>beer Holger Reagan breast who is sitting<br>in the audience and to be as landlords<br>both from the Department of Information<br>Sciences Christine oh my inflammatory<br>bowel disease nurse and my postdoc<br>Andrew we set out to do something about<br>unhappy patients Brennan Spiegel a<br>colleague of mine from Los Angeles<br>basically said in this little bit longer<br>sentence here we need to go where the<br>patient is we can't expect the patient<br>to always come to us we need to be more<br>open to patients we need to incorporate<br>their lifestyle because we're working in<br>the hospital we're living in a hospital<br>patients don't<br>so the problem really is depicted in<br>this in a flowchart here if a patient<br>has a flare-up now this is my patient up<br>here this patient will call the IBD<br>nurse the IBD nurse will then put a<br>little sticky note on my desk because<br>she knows that I'm never at my desk and<br>I will read the sticky notes and I will<br>put another sticky note on her sticky<br>note to say what she's gonna do with the<br>patient so she will then find her sticky<br>note attached to my sticky note and call<br>the patient back the patient then<br>possibly three four five days later will<br>ring the IBD nurse again and say well<br>actually it did not really work so by<br>that time the nurse comes back to me<br>possibly again with a sticky note and<br>and the circle will go round and round<br>and round and this is just not good well<br>what did we do about it we thought let's<br>take IVD smart let's develop our body<br>smart that's an F smartphone application<br>that Holger and his colleagues were<br>helping us to develop and that<br>smartphone application should enable a<br>patient to have a useful communication<br>with us so the patient can fill out the<br>smartphone app telling us all about the<br>symptoms telling us all about how they<br>feel there's a free text box in there<br>and this will come straight to my<br>computer so I have all the information I<br>need about this patient's problem and I<br>can answer straightaway some people<br>more sophisticated they have a nurse in<br>between and then there will be a red<br>light coming up saying this patient is<br>in deep trouble a yellow well you can<br>wake after the weekend the patient will<br>still be with us after the weekend or<br>the green light which says patient is<br>fine absolutely nothing to worry about<br>so this app for the first time allowed<br>this very seamless communication between<br>the patient and the healthcare<br>professional we tried this application<br>in a nationwide study so we talked to<br>four or three other centers we enrolled<br>a hundred patients they were allocated<br>to either the face to face trial which<br>means you carry on and talk to your<br>doctor as per usual every three months<br>you sit down with dr. Mann do not owe<br>and have a chat with dr. Mann janata who<br>is another colleague of mine here in the<br>audience or you just fill out Michaels<br>app and Mytyl will get an email with the<br>results and Mytyl will respond back all<br>of these health care interventions are<br>only as good as well first of all the<br>acceptance and second the outcome will<br>after a year of not seeing me a patient<br>be as healthy as before have I missed<br>anything by having the patient just<br>filling out the app is the patient then<br>needing to go to a hospital because our<br>mr. flare-up or anything like that so we<br>try to all this over a 12 month trial as<br>I said face to face versus IBD smart and<br>we had our readouts these are disease<br>severity indices and we looked at what<br>happened after a year now we had 100<br>patients that that's a reasonable number<br>and you see there was no difference this<br>was a non-inferiority trial so we don't<br>have any p-values here but you see the<br>patients with also if colitis feared the<br>same after a year throughout the year<br>Crohn's disease and try to separate a<br>little bit but in the end it came back<br>together and this is the most important<br>one I believe you is quality of life how<br>did the patient perceive their quality<br>of life and this was absolutely similar<br>so by doing that we were able to prove<br>that using the smartphone app we can<br>deliver the same level and the same<br>quality of care then face to face but<br>possibly much easier for all parties<br>concerned the patient can be anywhere<br>and we can do this so we now have this<br>application out in the public and cannot<br>be downloaded from the App Store because<br>of various reasons the App Store doesn't<br>play ball with us but we we make this<br>this app available to all patients that<br>want it and hope that we can improve the<br>care for these patients<br>now when coming to the end of my talk<br>and I'm almost running out of time here<br>2019 2018 we did another survey and<br>somehow we have not achieved very much<br>in the world of inflammatory bowel<br>disease thirty-four percent of patients<br>still worry about cleanliness and<br>sanitation when they travel around the<br>country and sixty-five percent coming<br>back to where's the next bathroom worry<br>about toilet facilities so patients when<br>they start traveling with this disease<br>they still worried about where we'll end<br>up will I be able to use the facilities<br>that are available they obviously have<br>lots of other concerns Crohn's and<br>Colitis New Zealand came up with this<br>little cart so if these patients have an<br>urgent business to do they can show this<br>card but you know how difficult it is to<br>talk about this who will go up to<br>strangers and said I'm about you can I<br>please jump the queue this is still<br>something we need to work on so in<br>summary there's still so much to do so<br>much to do in terms of the answer of<br>inflammatory bowel disease might be in<br>the intestinal microbiome<br>but then probiotics didn't work did I<br>use the wrong ones<br>did I used two wrong patients who knows<br>we need personalized medicine combining<br>all we know this is not a one<br>one-size-fits-all disease this is very<br>individualized so we need to work on our<br>organoids<br>to make sure that each patient gets the<br>best medication that is available for<br>this particular patient until then I<br>guess it's on their terms on my patients<br>terms in not on our terms to help them<br>getting through this difficult time and<br>we try to reach out with IBD smart I had<br>lots of fun doing this you you see I'm<br>really passionate my wife will say you<br>forgot to breathe when you talked yes I<br>say that's my enthusiasm but it's<br>probably true a little bit about both so<br>I was president of the<br>Society of gastroenterology until last<br>year and we we do a themed night so I<br>think I'm doing a very pretty princess<br>layer down here the last conference here<br>in Dunedin we had the sextet involved<br>and gosh they rocked the place it was in<br>the stadium it was absolutely fantastic<br>so yeah it is fun doing gastroenterology<br>we do wacky things I you probably all<br>read about the study we did going to the<br>Mongol Maupin tested them for hepatitis<br>C that got me slightly out of my comfort<br>zone they are intimidating but nice<br>after all and I still know them and we<br>still talk so that's fantastic in the<br>way this came about was one of our<br>students comes from a mob family from a<br>mongrel mob family and we talked about<br>this and he opened the door and said<br>this is uncle it you can talk to him<br>okay<br>hi uncle was fascinating we went through<br>three centers in in New Zealand and we<br>tested about 50 mobsters so that was<br>really an exciting thing I went to Samoa<br>to teach gastroenterology and then<br>obviously I connected with my patients<br>that's the Crohn's and Colitis<br>children's camp yeah the the exercise we<br>had to do on the circle training was<br>really difficult there's a nice YouTube<br>video of me sinking down in mud and it<br>was a fantastic time but seeing these<br>kids now to address me not as a doctors<br>but as Michael and we talk about these<br>things on a different level it makes it<br>just worthwhile it's it's absolutely<br>amazing so I told you I've got a funny<br>picture of you coming through the thank<br>you part my wife had to live through all<br>this she had to not only be treated with<br>lactobacillus but she had to travel the<br>world with me to just fulfill my dreams<br>and I often say my children don't study<br>medicine why do they not I was never<br>home to tell them how great this job is<br>so probably that's what I missed but my<br>wife stood behind me and pushed me<br>forward probably she was really<br>instrumental to all of this so like you<br>thank you very much and you don't need<br>to come down and I don't throw them up<br>here but they are for you Kimmy I still<br>don't know whether she<br>no that's the wrong direction I don't<br>know whether Kimmy is online but Kimmy<br>Sydney enjoy Sydney this is such a<br>fantastic place and dad keeps paying for<br>you and then we have Fiona in the room<br>and as Harleen said yes the whole family<br>is somehow connected to the University<br>of Otago feed yes you did fantastic with<br>a dad who was never home with a dad who<br>did lots of research with a debt who had<br>these yucky topics at dinner table

have to thank the gastro unit<br>in the hospital because they are at the<br>receiving end and they need to take<br>biopsies and they need to have patients<br>distracted because they need to fill

another blood<br>sample and answering another phone call<br>kyoro tenets are choked out or my name's<br>Paul grunts and I have the privilege of<br>being the pro vice-chancellor for Health<br>Sciences these are always enjoyable<br>occasions but they are so enjoyable when<br>you hear from somebody who's so<br>passionate about their research so we<br>heard about a journey in research<br>peppered with two beautiful children and<br>two weddings we also heard about<br>research of real impact and benefit to<br>patients all against the backdrop of<br>clinical practice which I know how<br>challenging that can be to bring it all<br>together so an impressive achievement<br>and a wonderful lecture so<br>congratulations Michael and we do have a<br>small gift hidden away that I'm going to<br>present to you on our behalf - thank you<br>I would also like to thank you our<br>audience for coming along the university<br>puts a lot on these occasions they're<br>very special celebrations here at
