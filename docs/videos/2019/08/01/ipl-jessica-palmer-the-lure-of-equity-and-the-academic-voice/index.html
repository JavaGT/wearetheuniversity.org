to<br>welcome all of you to this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor<br>Jessica Palmer on behalf of the<br>university I would like to begin by<br>extending a particularly warm welcome to<br>members of Jessica's far now who are in<br>the audience tonight her husband Nick<br>and her parents Charles and Anne wicked<br>and her sister Tamara Walker are all<br>here to support Jessica<br>now professor wicked is the Dean of law<br>at aut so I suspect that this is a<br>particularly proud moment for him now<br>these IPL's are incredibly important<br>occasions for us as a university<br>community so having members of family<br>here makes them even more special thank<br>you all for coming<br>now in addition to Jessica's family we<br>also have some other special guests here<br>this evening<br>in honor of the university's one hundred<br>and fiftieth anniversary celebrations<br>the Court of Appeal is sitting in<br>Dunedin this week and I am delighted to<br>welcome justice Christine French justice<br>for eemiller<br>and justice Graham Lange who have taken<br>time out of their very busy schedule to<br>attend this IPL this evening your<br>presence here is incredibly important to<br>us now as I look out on the audience<br>tonight<br>I see the typical cast of characters of<br>academic and professional staff and<br>students from around the university and<br>members of the wider to meet Dunedin<br>community<br>I also know that given the nature of<br>tonight's talk<br>there are also members of the legal<br>fraternity who are in the audience<br>including many judges from the district<br>court president of the Law Society<br>Association Otago Branch John Farrow and<br>the convener of the Otago women lawyers<br>Association Karen billing Hirst now<br>sadly the one person who is not here<br>this evening is our Chancellor dr.<br>Royden Somerville QC unfortunately<br>Royden is actually being a lawyer today<br>and and he couldn't be here with us but<br>he sends his very very best wishes to<br>professor Palmer for her IPL and wishes<br>her the very best on this very special<br>occasion<br>so in short whether you've come here<br>from across the campus from across town<br>or from across the country no my Hut am<br>I welcome now as you are all well aware<br>the path to professor is not an easy one<br>at the University of Otago it requires<br>excellence in teaching in research and<br>in service to the University and the<br>wider community and professor Palmer as<br>you will learn very shortly has excelled<br>in all three of these areas she is a<br>well respected legal scholar she is a<br>gifted and popular teacher and last but<br>certainly not least she has provided<br>exemplary service to the law faculty the<br>University and to the legal profession<br>more generally now in addition to all of<br>these achievements professor Palmer is<br>also the first female Dean of the Otago<br>Law School as part of our 150th<br>celebrations we would also like to add<br>this achievement to our lists of reasons<br>to celebrate this year<br>Jessica's name will forever be linked to<br>those of other first women at Otago<br>including Caroline Freeman ethel<br>benjamin emily Seidenberg<br>Winifred boys Smith via Papa Annandale<br>Atherton and many many more all of these<br>women fought battles so that others no<br>longer have to so Jessica on behalf of<br>no it gives me great pleasure to welcome<br>you to give your inaugural professorial<br>lecture I am personally very proud to<br>have you as the Dean of our law school I<br>will now call on professor Nicola parrot<br>to tell us a bit more about Jessica's<br>academic journey to Professor Nora<br>tena koutou tena koutou tena koutou<br>katoa<br>it's an honor and a pleasure to tell you<br>a bit about Jessica's journey to<br>Professor just joined the law faculty as<br>a lecturer in 2005 those of us who<br>attended the seminar she gave as part of<br>the application process we'll remember<br>two things her passion for equity and in<br>particular the law of trusts and her<br>enthusiasm for teaching she was only in<br>her mid-20s at the time and had never<br>met any of us but she engaged us in an<br>extremely lively discussion about the<br>essence of a trust<br>she had no written paper no PowerPoint<br>slides just the whiteboard a whiteboard<br>marker which she climbed all over the<br>board<br>her excitement and the command of the<br>subject area for us the decision was<br>easy she would be an inspirational<br>teacher especially in front of our large<br>compulsory 2nd year class and an<br>excellent researcher we also realized<br>that we would be gaining a great citizen<br>and a wonderful colleague with a joyous<br>loud laugh and now she's our leader or<br>boss as I sometimes call her she doesn't<br>like that much just came to New Zealand<br>as a baby with her when her parents<br>Charles and Anne<br>moved here from the UK she attended<br>Barry Dean school in Auckland and then<br>did law and accounting at Auckland<br>University we will forgive her for that<br>only just after graduating she joined<br>Chapman trip one of New Zealand's big<br>three law firms but legal practice was<br>not really where her passion lay so she<br>accepted a job as a judge's clerk at the<br>High Court doing research for the judges<br>including justice Miller who had just<br>been appointed to the bench just then<br>pursued postgraduate study obtaining an<br>LLM with first-class honours from the<br>University of Cambridge it was there<br>that she cemented her interest in the<br>law<br>equity that strange system of law that<br>developed alongside the common law<br>system administered by the administer<br>the English Courts of Justice to<br>moderate the harshness of the common law<br>yes we'll explain more about that in her<br>lecture academia and her love of equity<br>are in her genes her father Charles<br>shares those interests in 2008 Charles<br>spent a sabbatical with us and Co taught<br>a new paper that Jess had developed on<br>commercial equity during that time<br>Charles and Jess shared an office<br>directly opposite my office I witnessed<br>firsthand the fiery legal debates<br>between father and daughter they may<br>share a love for equity but they<br>disagree on much of it sometimes<br>vehemently so much to the amusement of<br>the students but importantly those<br>lectures opened the students eyes too<br>strongly divergent viewpoints<br>passionately held and supported by<br>persuasive arguments I can think of no<br>better way to learn<br>I too have benefited enormously from<br>Jess's research and thinking having her<br>so approximately located was the best<br>thing that happened to my research and<br>has led to several joint publications<br>and presentations jess has won several<br>awards for her teaching she instills in<br>students an interest in learning about<br>the law and an ability to question her<br>summaries are legendary a large number<br>of students here tonight<br>it's testimony to the fact that she is<br>an outstanding teacher her research has<br>flourished and is cited by international<br>experts around the world important for<br>law academics is their influence on the<br>developments of the law and there too<br>jess has had real impact the judges are<br>using her work in their decisions<br>including the judges of Appeal who are<br>here today she was also one of only two<br>academics invited to assist<br>the Law Commission in its reform of the<br>law of trusts that reform is about to be<br>enacted in 2015 the university<br>recognized her outstanding performance<br>by awarding her the prestigious<br>carlsmith medal and promoting her to<br>associate professor and then last year<br>to full professor work is not the only<br>thing that fills Jessi's days during her<br>14 years at Otago she and Nick have<br>produced four wonderful children Maya<br>Neve Toby and Francis now aged twelve<br>ten eight and six they're enjoying pizza<br>but they make life very busy and<br>interesting that jess has been able to<br>develop her academic career and then<br>last year take on the enormous job of<br>dean of law is in large measure due to<br>the support she receives from her<br>husband Nick Thank You Nick we are<br>indebted to you and I invite professor<br>Jessica Parma to deliver inaugural<br>professorial lecture on the lure of<br>equity and academic voice<br>I didn't anticipate delivering this with<br>the bench in front of me we'll see how<br>we go ta mauriora tena koutou katoa Tina<br>Mott a highly highly highly a Tudor de<br>manaphy no alternator hey tin na koto<br>karma he ki tamanna he coming here ki<br>talking far no Tina koto tena koutou<br>tena koutou katoa a huge welcome from me<br>I mean everyone's been covered already<br>but I just want to say that I'm<br>personally just so touched to have all<br>of you here and as I look around there<br>are faces from all different aspects of<br>my life and I take that as a just a huge<br>huge encouragement encouragement to have<br>you here so thank you very much it's a<br>privilege to be an academic the<br>academics role is to study an area and<br>significant detail with the aim of<br>contributing knowledge to that<br>particular field and to pass that<br>knowledge on to the next group of<br>enthusiastic learners shout-out to you<br>guys for coming tonight thank you<br>sometimes the contributions their<br>academics make to a particular field may<br>be substantial they might bring massive<br>change to the way that we understand<br>things in this world or the way that we<br>do things but for most academics for<br>most of the time the contributions that<br>we make are on their own small their<br>refinements or rediscoveries alignments<br>these contributions require much time in<br>perseverance and sometimes the effects<br>might not seem to be that overwhelming<br>but when you stand back to appreciate<br>the wider picture you can see a<br>patchwork of scholarship that has<br>advanced our knowledge of the world in<br>some way and hopefully has made us<br>better off for it<br>this evening my task is to share with<br>you a sense of some of the particular<br>work that I do and although you've heard<br>a wee bit from Professor peers we do<br>have a slight problem<br>most of these IPOs are extremely<br>fascinating<br>but unfortunately if you and I were to<br>meet at a drinks function I'm the one<br>with whom you strike up a conversation<br>and very quickly look for an exit route<br>the conversation goes something like<br>this so what are you do for a living I'm<br>an academic the blood is starting to<br>drain from the face of the person<br>they're looking around but they're<br>hoping that this might be resurrected Oh<br>what area do you work in law at this<br>stage either the blood has gone<br>completely or they're now on to a new<br>line of thought perhaps she does<br>something exciting like criminal justice<br>or human rights either way I know where<br>the conversation is going what area of<br>law they ask trusts and contracts<br>oh so this evening is somewhat of a<br>treat but for me rather than you because<br>you are now officially stuck for 45<br>minutes and I forgot to stamp my watch<br>so we're going to I give another two<br>minutes and I will regale you on the<br>wonder of my research interest and<br>hopefully persuade some of you to enroll<br>in an LLB at o-tar go the best LLB you<br>can get in New Zealand<br>so the title of my lecture tonight is<br>the lure of equity in the academic voice<br>first what do I mean by equity<br>our lure is a messy and complicated mix<br>of rules and principles from various<br>different sources much of it in our<br>highly regulated state comes from<br>statutes and regulations enacted by<br>Parliament another substantial source is<br>case law a judge-made law which we've<br>largely inherited from the UK and over<br>time have gone on to develop as our own<br>into the mix we add international<br>covenants and treaties which are<br>incorporated into our law in various<br>ways and happily and importantly in more<br>recent times we are seeing a concerted<br>effort to also acknowledge and include<br>principles of takuna and see our maori<br>and our statutes in case law we lawyers<br>refer to case law as common law that is<br>the law which is common to the various<br>different courts in our system in an<br>earlier time that common law was applied<br>with huge rigidity and it led to some<br>real and justices a few examples a<br>promise is made by the promise or - a<br>promise see legal fancy words but you<br>get what I'm saying<br>the promise isn't made under seal a big<br>fancy stamp that shows that it's<br>legitimate it was as was required years<br>and years ago so the common law courts<br>would say to that you might have had a<br>promise you might have had an agreement<br>but it's unenforceable a second example<br>this time the contract is made using the<br>right formalities but the party one of<br>the parties is now claiming that in fact<br>the contract was made under some kind of<br>pressure<br>they were unduly pressured by the other<br>in what out again the common law is<br>incredibly rigid in respondent by saying<br>you've got an enforceable contract you<br>must abide by it know out a third<br>possibility for example a man and<br>unfortunately for us woman generally was<br>a man back then a man takes legal<br>ownership of property but he makes a<br>commitment to hold it for the use of<br>someone else but he then renege on the<br>commitment and insists on taking the<br>full benefits of ownership for himself<br>as far as the common law courts are<br>concerned the answer was he is the legal<br>owner and therefore he is allowed to do<br>as he likes these kinds of decisions<br>were obviously felt to be really really<br>unjust so individual parties suffering<br>from these and justices would approach<br>the king they would ask for mercy or for<br>some kind of dispensation of justice<br>from the king over time the King Delic<br>delegated that power to his chief<br>minister the Chancellor the request<br>would be put the Chancellor to exercise<br>his discretion to provide some sort of<br>excuse from the harshness of the common<br>law and eventually over time the<br>Chancellor's exercise of discretion<br>developed into its own jurisdiction<br>complete with rules of process and<br>substance and its own judges and it<br>became to be known as equity the king's<br>judges administered the rules of the<br>common law and the chant three judges<br>administered the rules and principles of<br>equity and over time the answers to<br>these problems developed so in relation<br>to the first one I made a contract with<br>you but we never sealed it therefore<br>it's not enforceable an equity said in<br>response if you are a promise a a<br>promising party who has made a promise<br>you cannot renege on that promise if we<br>can be sure that you made it and that<br>the other party accepted and relied upon<br>it<br>equity developed a fancy doctrine called<br>estoppel to explain that situation an<br>estoppel just simply means that the<br>party now trying to renege on his<br>promise is he stopped or in our modern<br>day language simply stopped from<br>insisting on his strict legal right to<br>say that there is no contract the second<br>one an enforceable contract but this one<br>made under pressure and the common law<br>courts had told us too bad your bound<br>equity said that's not okay and we just<br>we developed doctrines and equity to<br>give us excuses to set aside contracts<br>and the one probably most calm<br>we used as the doctrine of undue<br>influence and in the third one which<br>most of you are going to be free pretty<br>similar pretty familiar when you know<br>what the answer is<br>equity said in response to a legal owner<br>who had entered into an arrangement to<br>hold property for another that he held<br>that property on trust and that the<br>other who we call the beneficiary has<br>rights in equity to enforce that<br>arrangement even if the common-law<br>provided no response so equity arose as<br>a separate system of justice responding<br>to an unjust insistence on strict legal<br>rights in that sense equity has been<br>described as another country where they<br>do things differently for some it was<br>indeed seen as roguish but equities<br>existence is not independent independent<br>it is not another country it is<br>supplementary it responds to a gap or a<br>shortcoming in the common law and that<br>is its only reason for existence so if<br>the common law then proceeds to develop<br>and dig its way out of a hole the need<br>for equity falls away eventually in the<br>mid 19th century the two systems were<br>combined into one jurisdiction and our<br>common law became a heavy mix of the<br>Kings common law and equity happy well<br>that's half the problem it gave me a<br>whole career it's plenty brilliant<br>whether the two were intended to be<br>truly assimilated or whether it's better<br>to understand the situation as a dualist<br>system is an ongoing debate while the<br>differing rules of practice and<br>procedure have to a large extent being<br>assimilated or integrated many of the<br>substantive doctrines between equity and<br>the common law have not so in many areas<br>of the private law in particular we<br>often still talk about what we do at law<br>in contrast to what we do in equity this<br>disjuncture contributes to a belief by<br>some that equity is even now primarily a<br>system of discretion and fairness for<br>the individual and as less concerned<br>with values like certainty consistency<br>reliability and coherence which we tend<br>to expect of the rest of the law but<br>here's where we get excited in my<br>opinion this view overlooks the<br>development of equity over many years<br>into a substantial jurisdiction that has<br>its own collection of doctrines<br>principles and rights and all of those<br>things together do justice across a wide<br>range of scenarios in much the same way<br>as common law has evolved and continues<br>to do so the very fact that I can point<br>you to three doctrines and equity tells<br>you that equity has developed into a<br>system that enables us to do that I<br>suggest that some courts and lawyers<br>haven't been lured into a<br>misunderstanding of what equity is now<br>by what it first was some modern cases<br>show a preference for an abstract notion<br>of equity that can undermine the very<br>principles and rights that equity has<br>developed since its beginnings my claim<br>is simple as I think Stewart Ennis<br>noises the best ones are<br>equity or not to be used as a license to<br>do what at first glance might appear to<br>be the just thing in a given case if in<br>fact it undermines the rights of parties<br>is it query has already identified them<br>such principles have been developed and<br>have been worked out to do justice if we<br>do not give enough attention to the<br>existing rights that equity has<br>established we end up with a body of law<br>that is contradictory and incoherent<br>I'll provide an example of this shortly<br>it's an equity that much of my work has<br>been concentrated and there are two<br>reasons for this first I find the<br>breadth and depth of equity fascinating<br>I know you're surprised equity applies<br>across a range of very different<br>contexts from large-scale swap contracts<br>between banks property developments<br>between commercial partners real estate<br>agents acting for both buyer and seller<br>family members at odds over who owns a<br>lotto one and spouses and de facto part<br>seeking to ring-fence their property<br>from relationship property claims these<br>are to name but a few<br>equity can have something to say in<br>large scale and small-scale commercial<br>scenarios family situations and indeed<br>between the crown and Maori in its<br>treaty relationship equity pops up<br>everywhere<br>for instance my husband and I have<br>finally decided to get on with<br>renovating our house it's been a very<br>long term coming<br>unfortunately spare time is not<br>something that we have much of at the<br>moment so we've contracted an interior<br>designer to manage all the detail she<br>seems to be doing a wonderful job have<br>yet to see the finished product but so<br>far so good but what if at the end of<br>the project we learn that she has in<br>fact been receiving significant<br>Commission's from the kitchen jointer or<br>the bench top supplier and that sees us<br>pay much more than we should have and it<br>sees her pocket a nice secret profit am<br>I entitled to expect that she should<br>have acted in our interests all along<br>while she managed the project and not<br>made any additional profit at least not<br>without my authorization or should I<br>have thought to cover this in the<br>contract and if I didn't more for me<br>what if our contract is completely<br>silent on this we just didn't consider<br>it what if there's nothing and writing<br>at all which there isn't<br>don't ask me if I've got a current will<br>I raise this example really is a way to<br>mention my long-suffering husband Nick<br>who likely knew much more than I that<br>marrying me meant leaving the quiet life<br>and uprooting a few times as I pursued<br>the academic road I know that living<br>with someone who has never quite<br>satisfied with the present is not easy<br>thank you and thank you too for<br>partnering with me to raise our four<br>beautiful tamariki in a chancellor who's<br>not here tonight did say to me on the<br>weekend as long as I include a photo of<br>the kids in the lecture it will go well<br>and as Nicholas said yes they did choose<br>a pizza party with babysitter over being<br>here but back to the point at hand I'm<br>taken by equity because of the way in<br>which it can have something to say in so<br>many different interactions in the way<br>in which it is consumed to do right<br>the second reason I have found myself<br>focusing much of my research in equity<br>is because I was blessed to be taught by<br>some superb teachers in my undergraduate<br>in postgraduate studies who showed me<br>that although equity is complicated it<br>is also very interesting and throws a<br>useful light on how the rest of the law<br>operates ten points who know we're going<br>who knows what we were going one of my<br>teachers has graciously traveled to be<br>here for this lecture I don't know about<br>gracious but he's more obliged having<br>been taught by my father throughout the<br>compulsory sorry haven't avoided being<br>taught by my father<br>throughout the compulsory papers in the<br>law degree I had the great privilege of<br>doing two optional papers under his<br>tutelage dead you remain one of the most<br>gifted teachers I've ever had and it's<br>no mere coincidence that we work in the<br>same areas of law you have set an<br>example for me of what a good teacher<br>can be and I hope that I come close to<br>reaching it myself in time I've enjoyed<br>the looks of horror on the faces of both<br>students and conference growers goers<br>and Friday seminar attendant as you have<br>objected objected loudly to something<br>have seen in a lecture or presentation<br>they being unaware of the familiar<br>relationship I do beseech you however to<br>remain quiet this evening as an academic<br>lawyer it is my hope that the work I do<br>helps to develop or clarify the law in a<br>way that best serves society's needs the<br>law operates to enable us to live<br>peacefully in the same space together<br>but the law is with the humans that it<br>seeks to assist is not always perfect<br>nor is it readily understandable and<br>especially so with equity as many of my<br>do you know it is so good to be able to<br>use this again is another another mark<br>of Nicodemo career is the jokes you<br>first started using when you came on<br>board after well don't work anymore<br>Rachel Hunter it won't happen overnight<br>but it will happen I've had about 10<br>years worth of students who don't get<br>that joke it is wonderful that Lion King<br>is having another round this year I can<br>keep this one going so what does the<br>academic lawyer do an analogy with sport<br>might be helpful at this point the judge<br>is on the field with the parties to the<br>dispute and their lawyers the judge<br>determines and applies the rules of the<br>game as it is played the academic<br>watches from the sidelines considering<br>the present game and the context of the<br>objectives of the game the history of<br>the game how it is played elsewhere and<br>how it should best be planned<br>in between games she pronounces with jus<br>respect where the judge got it right and<br>where the judge got it wrong in the hope<br>than the next game who input might be of<br>some assistance sometimes this is done<br>with the community of other academics<br>and sometimes she goes it alone at times<br>the community moves their view from the<br>field and spends time arguing out a<br>difference of opinion or works through a<br>theory of the game amongst themselves<br>and sometimes it's not obvious to<br>everyone else how important that<br>discussion is sometimes the lawyers and<br>parties out on the field invite the<br>academic to work with them to prepare<br>for the game or to play in the game with<br>them or to help them avoid the game or<br>together and every soften the rules of<br>the game are reviewed by the officials<br>and the academic is invited to the table<br>to join in that discussion the academic<br>lawyer part commentator Pat strategist<br>part advisor reformer of course those of<br>us who work in the law know that what is<br>at stake is far more than a game the<br>questions that we work on have very real<br>effects on people's lives and for this<br>reason what we do is both a privilege<br>and a responsibility in some instances<br>my particular academic voice has been<br>accepted and has concluded to a<br>clarification or a correction in others<br>it has not for let me give you a couple<br>of illustrations in the specific context<br>of trusts and in order to do that we<br>need to go on a brief summary of what<br>trusts are hold on to your seats<br>ordinarily we understand ownership of<br>property to give us a power or a right<br>or a liberty jurisprudence just hold<br>hold yourself on the corner there to do<br>certain things we are free to use our<br>property we're free to exclude others<br>from our property we're free to transfer<br>our property to others in a trust the<br>original owner who we will call the set<br>law may want his property to benefit<br>another who we will call the beneficiary<br>so he appoints a trustee to hold the<br>property for the beneficiary equity<br>calls this the trust in the property<br>owner the trustee the trustee remains<br>the owner legally and has the ownership<br>powers and so to the outside world this<br>is what we see set law has transferred<br>property to someone the legal owner who<br>now has all the powers of ownership but<br>in equity what we see is something quite<br>different to the outside world<br>little appears to have changed but in<br>equity the liberty of the trustee is<br>replaced by a set of duties she now has<br>duties to hold the property for the<br>beneficiary to ensure that everything<br>she does is in the interests of the<br>beneficiary and to follow the terms of<br>the trust deed her Liberty in relation<br>to the property is severely fitted by<br>the trust trusts are created for a range<br>of purposes some of the reasons are<br>about getting property to a beneficiary<br>with the least cost or trouble so for<br>example our set law might want to<br>benefit the beneficiary directly but<br>doesn't trust the beneficiary our<br>beneficiary is a spendthrift and we're<br>not sure what the benefit is going to do<br>with the property so instead the<br>property is given to a trustee to care<br>for and make the decisions maybe a state<br>law wants to benefit several different<br>beneficiaries and isn't sure which<br>beneficiary should get to which bit of<br>the property and so the set law sets<br>that what we call a discretionary trust<br>where the trustee holds the power or the<br>discretion to choose which beneficiaries<br>will take maybe the set law owns land<br>that has been in the family for a long<br>time maybe it's a farm<br>maybe it's business interests maybe it's<br>just a very special house and the set<br>law doesn't want the land or the<br>property to be broken up and so in order<br>to keep the property within the<br>generations and across the generations a<br>trust is established<br>maybe the set law wants to avoid taxes<br>that would apply if he had given the<br>property to<br>Leaton beneficiary those of you who are<br>old enough might remember gift taxes and<br>estate taxes all gone now but valid<br>reasons and some jurisdictions why you<br>might set up a trust there are other<br>reasons too for why you might create a<br>trust that aren't about getting the<br>property of the beneficiary but might be<br>more about getting the property away<br>from the set law may be the central<br>wants to gain access to government<br>subsidies in benefits rest home care<br>legal aid the old working for families<br>benefits all of those benefits being<br>assessed on the basis of the set laws<br>own personal wealth so if the set law<br>can remove the wealth from himself<br>personally she'd his assets he can<br>access such subsidies dodgy huh no maybe<br>the signal wants to ring-fence property<br>from claims of others maybe the set law<br>wants to ring-fence his property from<br>claims of a lender or a creditor or<br>maybe even from claims of a potential<br>spouse or partner maybe he's trying to<br>ring-fence the property from claims of<br>that the beneficiaries partners or<br>creditors might make out so there are a<br>range of reasons why we might create<br>trusts and what i don't want to do<br>tonight is to preach on which of those<br>is right or wrong what I'm interested in<br>iniquity is how we recognize the trust<br>and its mechanisms as I said most of<br>these tax and subsea benefits have been<br>removed in various ways but trusts have<br>been incredibly popular nevertheless New<br>Zealanders have had a somewhat of a love<br>affair with trusts settling their homes<br>and their assets on trust in so doing<br>they have sought ways to nevertheless<br>keep control of the assets for<br>themselves<br>maybe they appoint themselves as the<br>trustees maybe they keep back a power to<br>change the beneficiaries as they so<br>choose it's not surprising that all of<br>this has caused some eyebrows to raise<br>and close attention from creditors and<br>ex-partners lawyers judges and reformers<br>all questioning the appropriate<br>boundaries of trusts so in case law or<br>we've seen a series of important cases<br>in the past decade that have attacked<br>the modern trusts on several different<br>ground<br>there are sham they're an illusion or<br>let's look to particular statutes that<br>give us an ability to attack them in<br>certain contexts and they have I think<br>happily become an issue of law reform<br>the law commissioners having a good look<br>at them and has reviewed them and has<br>put forward a reports and draft<br>legislation taken up by the Ministry of<br>Justice and now sitting before<br>Parliament in the form of our new<br>Trust's bill all of this has kept a<br>trust lawyer like me rather busy I want<br>to give two examples of the academic<br>voice in this context the first one<br>beneficiaries access to information the<br>debate here is between confidentiality<br>in disclosure settlers trustees and<br>their lawyers claim that confidentiality<br>is key to running the trust and they<br>refuse disclosure to a beneficiary and<br>this is all the more so in the modern<br>trust scenario where the originals owner<br>stays involved and sees himself as still<br>somewhat in control they may not want<br>the beneficiary to know the details of<br>the property subject the trust they may<br>not want the beneficiary knowing who the<br>other beneficiaries are or what has been<br>done with the property or in fact even<br>that there is a trust at all of which<br>the beneficiary is a beneficiary they<br>want to keep everything secret the<br>approach and the case law has evolved<br>over time the courts used to approach<br>this by saying beneficiaries are able to<br>access information if they have an<br>equitable ownership right now remember<br>going back to the reason we have Trust's<br>sometimes we have trusts because we're<br>not sure which beneficiaries we want to<br>benefit so we create a discretionary<br>trust in that situation our discretion<br>beneficiaries would not be allowed to<br>access the information because the<br>courts would have said they do not have<br>themselves a fixed ownership right so<br>the old approach of the courts was<br>pretty limited<br>it kept on developing I think the most<br>common arts are given by the courts in<br>recent years is that whether or not a<br>beneficiary has access to information is<br>messe for the court supervisory<br>jurisdiction equity is a creation some<br>would say of the court or at least finds<br>its way out in the courts and the court<br>therefore has the power the role the<br>right to supervise such trusts so if the<br>court thinks it's appropriate to give<br>access to information to a beneficiary<br>then so be it<br>a recent Court of Appeal case a couple<br>of years ago suggested that perhaps the<br>beneficiary access to information was an<br>exercise of the trustees discretionary<br>power to disclose I'm really glad to say<br>that one didn't last very long because I<br>find that hugely worrying we're that<br>we're that took the court was to say but<br>if they were to review the trustees<br>decision you would have to show<br>something pretty worrying something<br>pretty problematic about what the<br>trustee had done before the court would<br>interfere in other words we would have<br>to show something like that the trustee<br>had acted in bad faith when they refused<br>to disclose which set the bar very high<br>what do I think the answer is what's the<br>academic voice on this one well they've<br>been several academics including me who<br>have argued strongly about this issue<br>we've argued that if accountability is<br>at the heart of the trust relationship<br>if it's about trustees or injuries to<br>beneficiaries the only way to give that<br>real meaning the only way to make sure<br>that that trust can be enforced is to<br>enable the beneficiaries to hold the<br>trustees to account they can't do that<br>if they don't have access to information<br>so it's a really simple claim and it's<br>just this that the corresponding result<br>of duties is the beneficiary's personal<br>right to access information and that<br>personal right ought to be a presumption<br>not an absolute right because there<br>might be some very good reasons why we<br>will disallow information to certain<br>beneficiaries maybe they're just really<br>annoying beneficiaries and there are<br>some of those around maybe we don't need<br>all beneficiaries of a trust to know<br>everything it's enough<br>we've got a few beneficiaries who know<br>information so there might be some<br>really good reasons why we don't<br>disclose but the important point being<br>argued here is that the starting point<br>matters and the starting point ought to<br>be that the beneficiary has a<br>one of the most satisfying role was I've<br>had as an academic trust lawyer was to<br>be appointed to the law commissions<br>experience group to advise someone how<br>Trussell should be reformed it's fair to<br>say that in a panel of mainly practicing<br>lawyers there was a range of views on<br>this issue of access to information but<br>ultimately both the Law Commission and<br>the Ministry of Justice recommended a<br>presumption that beneficiaries must be<br>told of basic trust information by<br>trustees and the presumption there any<br>other information they requested should<br>be disclosed that position is now in the<br>new draft legislation and we wait<br>patiently for it to become the law<br>working with the Law Commission was a<br>wonderful opportunity to debate the<br>issues and have a hand in helping the<br>Commission craft a new statute it was<br>particularly special to do that<br>alongside the great and she was very<br>humble because she didn't say that she<br>was also involved<br>professor Nicol appeared another person<br>who has played an important role in my<br>career Nicola I am indebted to you for<br>flying closely alongside me since I<br>arrived here as a young lecturer in 2005<br>you have been incredibly gracious with<br>your expertise and equity and with your<br>general nouse on all things related to<br>both the university in the legal<br>profession and I'm guessing every person<br>in this room could testify to one of<br>those three things if not two or three<br>of those three things I have treated our<br>discussions in debates usually carried<br>out shouting across the hallway and out<br>in three offices poor Jeff Hall had to<br>retire to escape it I'm under no<br>illusion as to how lucky I have been to<br>have you as a colleague and a friend and<br>this deanship gig has meant that we<br>don't have the same amount of<br>interaction which we used to and I do<br>miss that<br>I'm looking forward very much to<br>teaching together with you and semester<br>two<br>so an example of a very minor point that<br>matters hugely here's the second example<br>and then I stopped in order to get<br>through this example when you've still<br>bit of background work so back to our<br>understanding of what a trust is so we<br>now know that the trustee has to do some<br>beneficiary and the beneficiary has<br>personal rights as against the trustee<br>we've mentioned one of them there are<br>several other rights if the trustee<br>loses the property if the trustee makes<br>a profit with the property and keeps it<br>for himself those kinds of instances<br>give rise to have beneficiaries right to<br>say give me the profit or give me the<br>loss I've suffered they are personal<br>rights but another feature of the trust<br>and this is the one that's really cool<br>this is the one that demonstrates the<br>real wonder of what a trust is now I<br>said it's a theory it's the right that<br>equity confers on the beneficiary in<br>relation to the Trust property itself<br>the trustees as a group are recognized<br>to have a property right in the Trust<br>property itself what does that mean that<br>means if our trustee miss applies the<br>property sends it off somewhere else<br>our beneficiary can trace or follow<br>through to that property and claim it<br>back on the basis that our beneficiaries<br>have an equitable property right that's<br>massive that's huge and it's huge<br>because it seems to fly in the face of<br>the common law right so does it yeah a<br>beneficiary's trust interest will trump<br>a party who's been given the property by<br>the trustee or a party who is using the<br>property occupying the property but the<br>one limit because of this problem<br>between common law and equity the one<br>limitless right is what we call in law<br>the bonafide a purchase of a value<br>without know just BFP if the w / o in<br>what does that mean the rest of you who<br>are normal the good-faith purchaser the<br>person whom gives something over and<br>returned for the property and did not<br>know that the property was already<br>subject to trust now just be careful<br>about that<br>it's not just that I gave something up<br>and returned that doesn't get me home<br>free it's that I gave something up in<br>return and I didn't know that the<br>property was in trust that is the only<br>combination that will keep me free from<br>the beneficiaries equal property right<br>are we seeing now how powerful the<br>beneficiary's property right is this is<br>fairly basic trust principle I need to<br>give you another type of trust before we<br>can attack this particular problem<br>here's the second type of trust the<br>students are going enough a constructive<br>trust the trust we be looking at up to<br>now has been what we call an express<br>trust or a declared trust I declare a<br>trust the constructive trust is a trust<br>that we say is construed by the<br>circumstances something in the<br>circumstances gives rise to the trust<br>and there are lots of different<br>categories of this kind of trust but the<br>one that we can soon with tonight is one<br>that's been consumed with tonight it's<br>been has been really popular in New<br>Zealand and it goes like this<br>our claimant is claiming against the<br>owner that she has made contributions to<br>the property and that she has reasonable<br>expectations to take a share of the<br>property as a result and equity says if<br>those things exist it is unconscionable<br>for the owner to refuse to give her an<br>interest so equity recognizes a property<br>interest for our claimant all well and<br>good here's where it gets tricky in that<br>situation the owner was the legal owner<br>and had full legal title what's been<br>happening in the last few years is this<br>we have an existing trust we're all<br>happy with it we've become trust experts<br>on that in the last half an hour and we<br>have an outside claimant coming in and<br>saying I've made contributions to the<br>Trust property<br>and I have the reasonable expectation to<br>receive an interest in a giving an<br>example I struggle with picking names<br>we're just going to go with these don't<br>don't try and see into them what this is<br>about me Antonio and Petra de facto<br>partners they live in a house which<br>Antonio acquired before the relationship<br>he holds the house on trust for the<br>benefit of himself and has two children<br>for his pre from his previous marriage<br>he and his lawyer are the trustees Petra<br>knows there is a trust but this doesn't<br>concern her because it does not seem to<br>affect their use of the house<br>Antonio makes all the decisions in<br>relation to the house and he sees the<br>lawyer maybe once a year and Tania has<br>been renovating the house over the last<br>couple of years and Petra has helped in<br>several ways she has put in long hours<br>on the weekend sanding and painting the<br>house she has landscaped the garden<br>Antonio's money has been tied up and<br>paying for the renovations so Petra's<br>income has been used to pay for their<br>general living expenses the parties<br>separate and Petra seeks a share of the<br>house using the constructive trust<br>argument and the courts currently agree<br>with her they recognize the separate<br>constructive trust first of all let's<br>talk about why they recognize this trust<br>they say things like this with all due<br>respect the reality of a trustees<br>ability to give a third party that's our<br>Petra expectations in return for Petra's<br>contributions over trust property must<br>be recognized practical realities when<br>one trustee is an absolute control of<br>all trust activities and the other<br>trustees have effectively abdicated<br>their trustee responsibilities must be<br>recognized are we seeing a theme coming<br>out here courts I think have moved from<br>talking about the demands of justice or<br>fairness to<br>talking about practical realities but<br>the intent behind them is the same and<br>in my opinion with the utmost respect<br>this situation is a really good example<br>of an apparently just result on first<br>glance it seems unfair for Petra to walk<br>away with nothing but that is unfair in<br>fact incorrect once the broader trust<br>principles are considered there are<br>several problems and I'm just going to<br>run through three of them and I'm hoping<br>you've already figured them out the<br>first one relates to the beneficiaries<br>equitable property right the beneficiary<br>of the original trust has an equal<br>property right which he or she is<br>allowed to trace through to any transfer<br>of property to someone other than the<br>good-faith purchaser Petra is not<br>unfortunately a good faith purchaser she<br>is taking an interest based on<br>contributions she had made but she has<br>not purchased any property and nor in<br>our situation can she say that she knew<br>nothing of the trust in my opinion it is<br>conceptually impossible and that's a big<br>claim I realized that to say that a<br>constructive trust should never arise in<br>this case as a matter of principle<br>that's secondly even if as some judges<br>with respect are you were brave enough<br>to say that equity should still be<br>discretionary and flexible and should go<br>after the just result even if that were<br>the case it would be difficult to find a<br>constructive trust here because I would<br>suggest Petra doesn't have a reasonable<br>expectation of taking inish in the<br>property why not because she knew of the<br>trust<br>she should have dealt with the trustees<br>appropriately if she wanted some kind of<br>interest and thirdly even if a judge<br>decided to ignore all of those arguments<br>which they do the constructive trust<br>sorry<br>the constructor trust would give Petra<br>an equitable interest in the property<br>yes but that equitable interest sorry go<br>back would be in competition with equal<br>interest of the beneficiaries we in<br>equity land call this a case of<br>competing equities exciting stuff and<br>equity tells us when you have a case of<br>competing equities the first in time<br>wins who had the first beneficial<br>interest here it wasn't unfortunately<br>Petra<br>it was the beneficiaries of the<br>expressed trust it is with utmost<br>respect for the judges that I think they<br>have this wrong and I think it matters<br>it matters because it gives Petra a<br>property interest she ought not to have<br>and it takes from the beneficiaries a<br>property interest they ought to retain<br>is there still an injustice absolutely<br>yes is an injustice<br>what's the injustice that Petra has<br>contributed to the value of the property<br>that the beneficiaries own so what ought<br>we to do in response to that injustice<br>well it turns out the answer to that<br>injustice doesn't an effect lion equity<br>it lies back in the common law it's an<br>area of law called restitution the law<br>says if you have benefited me under some<br>kind of mistaken understanding or with<br>no return back so that it would be<br>unjust for me to keep it I must give you<br>a monetary remedy to the value of your<br>contributions tada<br>Petra is remedied she seeks she finds<br>relief and our trust remains<br>conceptually certain and equity lives to<br>fight another day my task has been to<br>understand and to remind others of the<br>principles underlying equity especially<br>where an equal remedy alters property<br>rights and can have significant<br>consequences some like to think that<br>equity is a source of authority to do<br>individual justice on the case but in my<br>view justice is best achieved by the<br>careful inconsistent application of<br>principles that are themselves just I<br>have tried to be an academic voice in<br>this arena and now as dean I find myself<br>in a role where I am concerned about the<br>academic lawyers voice more generally<br>I'm convinced that despite all our<br>strange habits such as turning up to<br>public lectures and old-fashioned gab<br>what we do matters to students we teach<br>methods of reasoning and critique the<br>necessity of attention to detail the<br>importance of identifying all the<br>competing interests and making sure that<br>they are all weighed up we hope that<br>they will see as we do just how<br>important the law is and how valuable<br>their skills will become to judges<br>lawyers and law reformers we elucidate<br>underlying principles trends and<br>concerns to help them in their roles of<br>upholding and working and responsive<br>system of justice albeit that I know we<br>can be very annoying at times to the<br>general public who are often interested<br>in and concerned about the law as they<br>rightly should be we play a valuable<br>role in keeping them informed some of us<br>more so than others that our land we we<br>inform them so that our local and<br>national conversations are rich and<br>productive the law school is essential<br>to a functioning robust legal system as<br>is the university to a free and informed<br>society we must never take ourselves too<br>seriously but we must take this<br>institution seriously I am both<br>privileged and burdened by this task and<br>I'm grateful for the wonderful academic<br>colleagues I work with here in the north<br>equity and across the university who are<br>pursuing in their fields<br>this noble role that is the academics<br>voice and I'm equally grateful for our<br>professional staff for whom without my<br>mind shudders to think of the mess that<br>we might make of this place thank you to<br>all of my colleagues both academic and<br>professional I am touched that so many<br>of you have come out<br>this evening the academic endeavor can<br>be a solitary one but there has not been<br>the case for me at all in the law<br>faculty and in this great university the<br>final word of things must go to my<br>mother mum thank you for your support<br>and your belief in me especially in<br>these last couple of very demanding<br>years for me they have I am sure be much<br>harder for you as you fight to be with<br>us for as long as possible and yet you<br>have continued to worry about me and<br>does send an encouraging message every<br>now and then and to listen patiently and<br>with comforting words thank you<br>to conclude I have endeavoured in this<br>lecture to convince you of two things<br>that the alluring nature of equity must<br>be treated with caution and that the<br>academic voice that sounds that caution<br>matters for several years now I have<br>tried to inhabit that academic voice as<br>many of my colleagues do daily in their<br>fields - I have not always succeeded but<br>it has nevertheless been a wonderful<br>journey thus far if I haven't managed to<br>persuade you on either of those two<br>points then I think the only other<br>plausible conclusion we can reach this<br>evening is that the university has made<br>god bless Otago thank you for coming out<br>this evening and for being a most<br>supportive audience tena koutou tena<br>koutou tena Tartu Ottawa<br>Pataki come here come here I can't quit<br>tena koutou katoa my name is Tony<br>ballantine and I'm the pro<br>vice-chancellor humanities and it is<br>with great pleasure that I will deliver<br>a vote of thanks to Professor Parma but<br>before I do so can I just acknowledge<br>the wonderful way utter from killed<br>apartheid Pataki and their title of the<br>Dean professor Palmer<br>I think he's delivered a truly excellent<br>lecture she has shared her reflections<br>on why equity is important highlighting<br>its<br>expansiveness its breadth and depth in<br>Jessica's words she has shared some<br>ideas about how equity is best<br>understood and as a historian I was very<br>interested to hear how professor<br>Palmer's explanation of equities<br>evolution and the on-going debates over<br>its proper place was in the law<br>illuminates institutions in a legal<br>landscape and exploring these issues she<br>has demonstrated her ability as a<br>communicator and as a teacher she has<br>taken the area of legal inquiry and made<br>it come alive and discussing equally and<br>trust trusts Jessica's lecture has<br>underlined the particular<br>responsibilities of the legal academic<br>she has suggested this evening that that<br>is a hybrid role part commentator part<br>Critic part coach part change agents C<br>all C's alliteration<br>I grew up in a household with a try<br>truth newspaper was the key reading<br>material and she has reminded us that<br>there's a role that carries with it very<br>significant responsibilities as these<br>legal matters have the capacity to<br>substantially affect people's lives<br>she has also shared important<br>reflections on her own epidemic journey<br>she has emphasized the particular<br>importance of teachers something that we<br>can all take for granted in the<br>day-to-day routines of their roles and<br>she's also reminded us of the importance<br>of family and the people around us this<br>is a key dimension of academic life<br>there is easy to underplay academic life<br>may often be imagined as solitary but it<br>is fundamentally social and this regard<br>as is very clear that professor Palmer<br>has been well taught both at home and in<br>her formal education and she is now<br>sharing those very considerable<br>abilities with our students her lecture<br>closed with a vision of the role of the<br>academic that is very interactive she<br>emphasized the responsibilities that we<br>have to the students we teach as subject<br>specialists both in the individual<br>papers and also in their broader<br>training professor Palmer also stressed<br>the very particular relationships that<br>legal academics need to cultivate to<br>help propagate a healthy and just legal<br>system and to shape and inform public<br>debate around the law and she reminded<br>us all of the multiple sets of<br>relationships that are essential to the<br>effective functioning of a complex<br>institution such as ours at the outset<br>of the lecture professor Palmer<br>suggested that we would all have to<br>tolerate her reflections on the law of<br>trusts and contracts about 45 minutes or<br>47 minutes have flowing past professor<br>Palmer you have challenged informed and<br>engaged us and in so doing you have<br>displayed the warmth the words the<br>clarity of thought<br>and the intellectual acumen that you<br>bring to your role every single day I<br>know that all of us here students<br>colleagues from across the university<br>legal professionals and your family are<br>delighted to be sharing this very<br>special occasion with you so in a moment<br>I'm going to ask you to join me in<br>thanking Jessica I do have something<br>fortunately it's not something that I<br>baked after I give this to you so could<br>I invite you all to please join us in<br>the staff club where we have the chance<br>to mix and mingle and just celebrate<br>this very special occasion but could you<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
