the path to<br>professor here at the University of<br>Otago is not an easy one it requires<br>excellence in teaching in research and<br>in service and as you will learn later<br>this evening professor saw them has<br>excelled in all three of these areas he<br>is a prolific and well respected and<br>prize-winning researcher he is a gifted<br>and popular teacher both at the<br>undergraduate and postgraduate level and<br>last but certainly not least he has<br>provided exemplary service to the<br>department to the University and to<br>discipline more generally this Triple<br>Crown of outstanding teaching research<br>and service is the true hallmark of a<br>university of otago professor so martin<br>on behalf of the university it gives me<br>great pride to congratulate you on your<br>very well earned promotion and i will<br>now call on professor richard barker the<br>pro vice-chancellor of sciences to tell<br>us just a little bit more about martin's<br>academic journey -

and colleagues tena<br>koutou tena koutou tena koutou katoa it<br>is my great pleasure to introduce our<br>speaker tonight Professor Martin Selvam<br>to give his inaugural professorial<br>lecture at the University of Otago as<br>indicated by the vice-chancellor<br>professor cell bomb is one of our newer<br>professors at the University receiving a<br>well-deserved promotion to the position<br>professor in February of this year<br>professor cell bomb was born somewhere<br>in Scandinavia I will let Martin fill in<br>the details but let's just say that as a<br>place renowned for building great cars<br>and great tennis players after thinking<br>that he would follow in his father's<br>footsteps and working in industry as a<br>blue-collar worker he then took up<br>somewhat regimental activities at the<br>behest of the government before fleeing<br>to the US and pursuit of more athletic<br>activities which I think he's going to<br>enlighten us on while in the u.s.<br>professor Sal Baum undertook tertiary<br>study being the first in his family to<br>do so he noted in the material they gave<br>me that he thought he was going to be a<br>blue-collar worker and I'd have to say<br>based on their what we see before us<br>that is perhaps what eventuated he<br>received his BA in psychology and<br>criminal justice from Tri State<br>University at Angola Indiana in 2000 his<br>MA in clinical psychology from Ball<br>State University Muncie Indiana<br>and his PhD in clinical psychology in<br>2007 from Kent State University in Ohio<br>he started his academic career at the<br>University of Alabama subsequently moved<br>to the Australian National University<br>prior to his arrival at University of<br>Otago in 2016<br>professor cell bombs research focuses on<br>psychopathy and other personality<br>disorders the broader integration of<br>personality and psychopathology and<br>applied personality assessment along<br>with his academic career he finds the<br>time to be a registered clinic<br>psychology and may a psychologist and<br>maintain a small private practice in<br>which he conducts court-ordered forensic<br>evaluations from across New Zealand just<br>12 years post PhD his work has already<br>featured in over 200 peer-reviewed<br>publications he has won several awards<br>including the American Psychological<br>associations Theodore Mellon mid-career<br>award for advancing personality science<br>the American psychology law societies<br>Saleem char award and the Society for<br>personality assessments Samuel and Ann<br>Beck award the latter two awards were<br>early career achievement in addition to<br>his award-winning research professor<br>Selvam takes service to his profession<br>seriously while at the australian<br>national university he was the director<br>of clinical psych clinic of psychology<br>program as well and as well as serving<br>on the school's executive board at Otago<br>he serves on the research committee and<br>also the human ethics committee and an<br>amongst this he finds the time to<br>fulfill the duties of editor and chief<br>for journal of personality assessment<br>and while he's at it he's an<br>award-winning teacher who we are very<br>lucky to have joined our psychology<br>department a strong department made only<br>stronger in the process tonight<br>professor cell bomb is going to describe<br>his personal and academic journey that<br>spans five countries the aforementioned<br>Scandinavian country the USA Canada<br>Australia and lucky for us New Zealand<br>and across three continents please join<br>me in welcoming professor Martin<br>Sullivan<br>good evening can everyone hear me in the<br>back all right I guess I was already<br>introduced I don't need to introduce<br>myself and Richard can already said my<br>entire talk so I don't think I need to<br>say a whole lot more but we will start<br>nonetheless this one is not working<br>properly sell juice uses so the Afra<br>mentioned skin and even country that<br>Richard was alluding to with Sweden I<br>was born in Malmo Sweden where I grew up<br>and I spent the first 19 years of my<br>life I was engaged in some military<br>service and decided that this country is<br>no longer for me and I had become quite<br>interested in athletics<br>I was playing american-style football<br>and which is quite popular of course in<br>the United States but I was also quite<br>popular in Sweden in fact there were<br>there were over 80 teams in Sweden those<br>playing American football so I got into<br>this when I was 14 I was playing and I<br>thought you know what if I am going to<br>play football at a high level I better<br>go to his country of origin so I thought<br>you know what I'm done with Sweden I'm<br>going to go to the United States so I<br>packed my bags I left my family and<br>friends and I flew to Angola Indiana<br>which is right here in Midwestern United<br>States in northeastern Indiana to be<br>exact<br>not too far away from Chicago Detroit in<br>Cleveland as you can see on the map here<br>and more specifically I tend to try<br>State University and Tri State is a<br>small engineering college in the US I<br>did not go there for engineering<br>obviously in fact I went there only for<br>its football team<br>I was told that this was a relatively<br>new team so if I coming from Sweden was<br>going to be able to play it had to be a<br>new team where people weren't very good<br>so I went there so my major was football<br>and then for for those of you who are<br>not familiar this is just a little<br>picture from Tri State University that's<br>not me<br>and also this might reflect some<br>psychological immaturity but I had a<br>minor if getting drunk at fraternity<br>parties I thought having watched plenty<br>of Hollywood movies this would be<br>something I would enjoy I did for short<br>Wow so so coach said you know what if<br>you're gonna be at the University you<br>know we really we think it's important<br>to have student-athletes here so you<br>need to pick a major and and this was a<br>bit perplexing to me and and I had some<br>choice words at this but but then after<br>some contemplation I decided you know<br>what psychology that was a class I took<br>in high school and it was relatively<br>easy and I thought it was somewhat fun<br>and and and for good measure not to not<br>to seem so your typical of American<br>football players but I added criminal<br>justice because I felt you know what I<br>could maybe become a police officer that<br>would be something that would be fun<br>later on perhaps but I really didn't<br>know what I wanted to do was the main<br>point here but after a couple of years<br>this began to change because I found a<br>mentor and dr. Dwayne Daubert who was<br>the director of the criminal justice<br>program and he was also forensic<br>psychologist and he told me that<br>forensic psychologists evaluate<br>offenders that you can penetrate the<br>minds of these individuals who are<br>really difficult to understand because<br>they're so different from you and I and<br>I thought that sounded really<br>fascinating because I grew up in a<br>really poor neighborhood in Sweden so I<br>saw gangs all over the place and even<br>though I wasn't being affiliated I<br>thought that you know what these these<br>friends of mine there were really crazy<br>people and I need to understand but then<br>people told me well if you're going to<br>practice clinical psychology which is<br>really what you have to do to do<br>forensic evaluations you need a PhD not<br>goal so I applied to PhD for<br>but I didn't get into a single one and<br>after some moments of sadness but I<br>decided that I was going to go to a<br>master's program to prepare myself<br>better for PhD study and I did that went<br>to terminal master's program in clinical<br>psychology at Ball State University in<br>Muncie Indiana as Richard mentioned Ball<br>State is famous because David Letterman<br>got his degree from there some of you<br>may know who that is I went there not<br>because of that but I was very lucky to<br>be mentored by Professor Gary Mooney who<br>was also forensic psychologists who had<br>become quite disillusioned with academia<br>he said oh I done all this stuff getting<br>grants and publishing in an APA journals<br>and all of that and and he didn't like<br>that system and he said the only<br>research accounts this applied research<br>the only only research that actually<br>makes an impact in society so he really<br>emphasized the idea to me that applied<br>personality assessment that is using<br>psychological test instruments in how<br>they can be better applied to offenders<br>might be the way to go so I thought that<br>sounds great and there was a particular<br>test in Minnesota multiphasic<br>personality inventory that he was a<br>proponent of and he said you know what<br>you need to go to Kent State University<br>because that is where the experts are on<br>this particular test so I applied to a<br>bunch of PhD programs again this time I<br>got into five and I decided to choose<br>Kent State University and that's where I<br>did my PhD in Kent Ohio so during my PhD<br>years as I mentioned was a PhD in<br>clinical psychology my mentors were<br>yoseob and porous and Jacque Ram Yossi<br>was my primary supervisor on MMPI based<br>PhD thesis but more generally these two<br>individuals are experts on personality<br>assessment and that is really what they<br>were promoting with respect to my<br>education and by this time because I<br>gotten involved with a lot of research<br>in order to prepare myself to do a PhD I<br>started to discover that actually like<br>the scientific process a little bit<br>better than I liked the clean<br>Nicoll work although I very much value<br>both I continue to be a registered<br>psychologist and do some clinical work<br>from time to time when I can fit it into<br>this service that was mentioned earlier<br>so one of the things that was taught to<br>me and it was mentioned I have a few<br>publications and the reason for that is<br>because of not working<br>I think networking is extremely<br>important and that is what was taught to<br>me at very early on in PhD that if you<br>want to be productive you have to know<br>people so I'm very good at following<br>directions<br>you know you stuff coaches screaming at<br>me I used to have military captains<br>telling me what I have to do so I was<br>very good okay if I'm gonna do something<br>I'm gonna do it<br>so I started not working very early on I<br>met professor Chris Patrick who's now<br>Florida State University I met Scott<br>Lilienfeld who is at Emory University in<br>Atlanta I met professor Alka telegin who<br>is now retired psychologist from the<br>University of Minnesota and all of these<br>individuals had important influences in<br>developing my academic career and and it<br>also taught me that I can get involved<br>in a lot more projects and contribute in<br>a much greater scale to science if I<br>know a lot of people and I do so I was<br>very interested in clinical personality<br>assessment I mentioned the MMPI<br>and it was in its second edition when I<br>started at Kent State it later became<br>the restructured form which some of my<br>students are in this room today have<br>been tortured with for quite some time<br>but for those of you who are not<br>familiar it is a broadband psychological<br>test instrument by broadband I mean it<br>measures a lot of different things so it<br>measures a lot of different types of<br>mental health symptoms like anxiety<br>depression but also personality traits<br>like low self-esteem impulsivity a<br>variety of things that are important to<br>clinical psychology practice but I was<br>particularly interested in using this<br>test for forensic psychology purposes<br>and specifically to understand the minds<br>of offenders and especially the<br>psychopathic personality so some of you<br>may wonder what is psychopathy while<br>psychopathy can be defined not very<br>easily<br>I really like this quote by Bob hair<br>who's one of the eminent scholars with<br>respect to psychopathy and he said that<br>Psychopaths can be described as<br>intraspecies predators who use charm<br>manipulation intimidation of violence to<br>control others and satisfy their own<br>selfish needs lacking in conscience and<br>feelings for others they cold-bloodedly<br>take what they want and do as they<br>please violating social norms and<br>expectations without the slightest sense<br>of guilt or regret I think I've read<br>this quote so many times I probably<br>didn't really to read from the screen<br>but that is that is a cop a--they and<br>this is a picture of my PhD thesis I'm<br>not quite sure why I felt the need to<br>show that but it's culminated in a<br>research article while really a number<br>of research articles but this was the<br>key one that are published with some of<br>the individuals that I mentioned as well<br>and and the goal here what we did was to<br>develop specific mmpi two based scales<br>to assess psychopathic personality<br>traits and we used in particular the<br>psychopathic personality inventory which<br>is a common research manager for this<br>purpose yes eight scales that reflect a<br>variety of personality traits I was<br>supposed to not you silly supporter<br>that's right but you can read here on<br>the screen so things like Machiavellian<br>egocentricity which reflects a<br>narcissistic and ruthless interpersonal<br>style but also other things like<br>violating social norms and standards<br>failure to accept responsibility for<br>one's actions not planning one's<br>behavior very well dominating and<br>influencing other people not being<br>particularly fearful in light of<br>potentially dangerous events being<br>resilient to overwhelming stressors in<br>the environment and of course being<br>cold-hearted and callous in relation to<br>other people so that's what this test<br>measures you can use factor analysis<br>which seems to be a favorite technique<br>of many psychologists it's about to say<br>something means I want<br>about my view of factor analysis but<br>anyhow and you can group you can group<br>these different scales into two broad<br>domains of psychopathy fearless<br>dominance and in impulsive anti<br>sociology and I don't really have time<br>to go over exactly what those reflect<br>and here I'm showing some slides because<br>I always have this compulsive need to<br>prove what I'm saying but none of you<br>can really read this slide and you don't<br>really have any idea what these numbers<br>are so just take my word for it here's<br>the evidence but I calculate a bunch of<br>correlations which are essentially<br>estimates of relationships between the<br>psychopathy scales for the MMPI two that<br>I developed in three different samples<br>both prison inmates as well as<br>university samples and these scales from<br>the psychopathic personality inventory<br>and found out that the correlations came<br>out exactly as I would have expected<br>which was good and I also looked at the<br>associations with the psychopathy<br>checklist which was developed by Bob<br>hair and is probably viewed as a gold<br>standard psychopathy assessment this is<br>a sample of the forensic defendants for<br>whom the pcl was completed I'm actually<br>going to talk about the pcl a little bit<br>later but the bottom line there is that<br>the scales are correlated with the<br>psychopathy checklist to a degree we<br>would expect but why this is important<br>it's probably something you would care a<br>little bit more about and that is<br>because we know in forensic<br>psychological context that psychopathy<br>or psychopathic personality traits are<br>an important risk factor because people<br>who are high on these traits tend to be<br>at higher risk for reoffending violence<br>sexual crimes and things like that so<br>being able to assess these types of<br>personality traits in people with using<br>a test like the MMPI - that is widely<br>used in clinical and forensic<br>psychological practice seem like a good<br>idea because the best tool to use is the<br>PC LR but that's a very labor intensive<br>instrument so so you can kind of look at<br>this as as a screening measure just like<br>we assess for say tuberculosis you know<br>you don't give everyone chest x-rays<br>because that would be a waste of time<br>and money you start out with a little<br>skin test and if there's a reaction then<br>you send them to a chest x-ray and it<br>would be similar here<br>as everyone gets the MMPI anyways but<br>anyhow after my PhD or really I should<br>say Germany HD in order to get a PhD in<br>clinical psychology in the United States<br>you have to complete the one-year<br>internship in this internship is a<br>full-time anywhere in North America so<br>you apply to a bunch of internships try<br>to persuade these people while you<br>should complete your clinical training<br>there you go on lots of interviews and<br>then you rank these inner-ear<br>internships from first to last in terms<br>of preference you put them into a<br>computer and guess what the internships<br>rings their applicants and put them into<br>a computer and then the computer tells<br>you where you're going I had to go to<br>Canada the the computer decided that he<br>can't stay in the US although Canada was<br>my number one choice so there you go and<br>and I went to the Centre for Addiction<br>and Mental Health in Toronto Ontario and<br>while this was great for my clinical<br>training it was even better for my<br>research training because I met<br>professor Mike Bagby who has been a very<br>close collaborator of mine ever since on<br>a wide range of different projects<br>including on the MMPI<br>so he's probably the person are<br>published with the most sense I left<br>there in 2007 so this was a really<br>important connection to make and and it<br>was actually here at the Tago last year<br>was supposed to present a seminar and<br>then I had to driving to the emergency<br>room unfortunately so he couldn't<br>present any help on that sad note I went<br>back to a Kent State for my postdoc<br>because I couldn't get enough of the<br>place and also because we were finishing<br>up the restructured form for the MMPI 2<br>which is the most current version of<br>this important psychological test and I<br>wanted to be a major part of that so I<br>decided to dedicate a couple of years of<br>my life to that but also in the US in<br>order to practice clinical psychology<br>you also need to have a certain number<br>postdoctoral clinical hours and I<br>therefore spent part time about half of<br>my time in<br>Court clinic in Akron Ohio which was<br>about half an hour away where I did<br>about a hundred forensic psychological<br>evaluations cell lots of very<br>interesting people then it was time for<br>a move I had to get a job I couldn't<br>stay at Kent State anymore so I applied<br>all over the country and to Canada again<br>Canadians didn't want me this time<br>but the ones that did was the University<br>of Alabama in Tuscaloosa Alabama about<br>1200 kilometers from Kent<br>so pack my bags I went down there and<br>you know it's this is completely<br>coincidental but I was very happy to go<br>to University of Alabama not only<br>because I have a strong psychology<br>department they also have the best<br>football team in the United States at<br>least at the university level in fact<br>for the four years I was there they won<br>three out of four national championships<br>much due to this man Nick Saban who are<br>liked so much I named a horse after him<br>but NASA will tell you that is true and<br>is probably embarrassed right now and<br>this is bryant-denny Stadium where I<br>spent many saturdays 102,000 crazy<br>Alabamians would be there<br>it's a sixth largest stadium in the<br>world so I was there for four years as I<br>mentioned I worked in the clinical<br>psychology and law concentration at the<br>University so it was a clinical<br>psychology program but with the<br>concentration in forensic psychology and<br>there had a great fortune to mentor five<br>excellent PhD students al Johnson brain<br>day Goodwin Jamie Anderson Rachel ROC<br>and Becca Costner and and they have gone<br>on to their own successful careers Jamie<br>for instance at Sam Houston State<br>University in Texas so when I was at<br>Alabama much because of what my students<br>wanted to do my research was beginning<br>to move a little bit away from<br>personality assessment a lot more into<br>the psychopathy realm and I became<br>particularly interested in the idea of<br>successful psychopathy that is a lot of<br>psychopaths end up in prison because<br>they commit crying the hurts people and<br>so on but there are some people who are<br>psychopathic we're able to navigate<br>Gate society quite well maybe they end<br>up in big corporations maybe they become<br>politicians lawyers you guys can laugh<br>away not naming any names and one of the<br>studies that we did at the University of<br>Alabama was to try to recruit these<br>types of people of course you can't<br>advertise are you a psychopath please<br>come to myself although we probably get<br>some interesting people but rather we<br>try to advertise for people who would at<br>least admit to certain qualities that<br>that would be correlate with psychopathy<br>like being adventurous fearless charming<br>carefree people who lead exciting lives<br>are you the kind of person who do almost<br>anything for there are you good at<br>looking out for number one and and<br>handling other people if so come to an<br>experiment this study is over by the way<br>and I had a great fortune of working<br>with dr. Randy silicon who's a good<br>friend of mine and he was a COPI ion<br>this particular study so then after four<br>years in Alabama I decided it's time for<br>something new I've always I suppose<br>myself been a little bit adventurous<br>although I don't look out for number one<br>or handle numbers and I just I won't try<br>something new I've been to Australia a<br>few times I really liked Australia<br>mostly because I'll go to the Gold Coast<br>and have fun with my friend thinking<br>that was Australia and and so I moved<br>not to the Gold Coast but to Canberra<br>and to the Australian National<br>University Canberra was good too<br>I liked it there at least in Canberra<br>so satay Andy I worked as a senior<br>lecturer than an associate professor and<br>as Richard mentioned I was the director<br>of the clinical psychology program for a<br>while I had two PhD students that are<br>completed at they a new jockey Liggett<br>who's now in clinical practice who after<br>she turned in or thesis at thank<br>goodness now never have to do research<br>again she still published five papers so<br>in Elliott Christian I asked him Valley<br>at I need a picture it's like you're not<br>showing my picture well go there and I<br>was lucky enough to meet Vanessa at Anu<br>and we've been together since but then I<br>was bored of the a in you well board is<br>a nice word and I decided I need<br>something new my life and and and I<br>decided to look for some jobs both<br>Vanessa and I were were not so pleased<br>with the developments in the department<br>there and and I saw an opening at the<br>University of Otago and I heard that<br>Otago had a good psychology department<br>so I decided I'm gonna apply I did and<br>for some reason I managed to con them<br>into hiring me yeah ha beat you guys do<br>you really verify those pups in there<br>never mind I'm just kidding<br>so at the University of Otago I have<br>established a personality<br>psychopathology a measurement lab and I<br>have lots of students who I'll<br>acknowledge Tiffany brown is one of my<br>PhD students fatima Sahadi<br>who are Co supervised with Harleen so I<br>have to spend more time with Harleen<br>which is a good thing<br>no no y-you guys are laughing so master<br>students me rangoli in a hawks and<br>olivia monroe i three honor students<br>Cara Lee Claire Liggins and Emma Veltman<br>Emma tells me that she's going to also<br>pursue a PhD I can't see him out right<br>now but she's hiding from and I have an<br>undergraduate student Amira Hall Jones<br>as well in some very important research<br>assistants who have been employed on my<br>grant and helped me collect important<br>data so I want to spend a little bit of<br>time talking about my research program I<br>spent a lot of time talking about me in<br>and now I'm gonna try to talk about my<br>research so they're essentially for<br>broad and somewhat interrelated domains<br>of research that I want to talk about<br>and I'm just gonna give you guys some<br>highlights in terms of the various<br>things I'm interested in doing and that<br>I'm currently doing and what we found<br>the first broader part is restructuring<br>mental health disorders some of you will<br>know that there's a Diagnostic and<br>Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders<br>currently in its fifth edition there's<br>also an ICD 11 right now that was just<br>published and all of these have a bunch<br>of diagnostic categories in them is you<br>know describing what type of symptoms<br>you have to have in order to meet<br>criteria or threshold for particular<br>diagnosis but what's decades of science<br>has also shown is that this categorical<br>approach to diagnosis is highly flawed<br>because it tends to miss most people and<br>does not adequately account for severity<br>and functioning and virtually every<br>study that has been published show that<br>there's extreme problems with diagnostic<br>co-occurrence that is if you have one<br>disorder in the DSM you're about 50%<br>chance of having a second disorder as<br>well which is problematic in many<br>respects but I I got involved with a<br>consortium and international consortium<br>but I think we're right now about a<br>hundred psychiatrists and psychologists<br>and we're trying to change the field<br>with respect to mental health diagnosis<br>and we published a theoretical review<br>paper in which we kind of laid out the<br>framework for how we should go about<br>doing this organized mental disorders<br>with respect to dimensional symptom<br>domains rather than<br>gorkel arbitrary diagnosis and in fact<br>this cost some wind so even the ODT<br>decided that that it was worth talking<br>about this I'm not sure that reporter<br>fully understood that's okay I got my<br>picture in the newspaper so and<br>essentially what we call this whole new<br>system is the hierarchical taxonomy of<br>psychopathology that we published in the<br>Journal of abnormal psychology and and<br>this looks a little bit complex and I<br>suppose it is but essentially the the<br>key issue here is that we need to look<br>at things from a dimensional perspective<br>but also a hierarchical perspective in<br>the sense that sometimes it's useful to<br>look at symptoms that come together in a<br>higher-order fashion for instance many<br>people have depression symptoms also<br>have anxiety symptoms so instead of<br>thinking about things as two different<br>diagnoses we can think of something as<br>higher-order internalizing instead and<br>the benefits with this type of system<br>which I don't really have a ton of time<br>to explain but the benefits of this type<br>of system is simply that we can capture<br>everyone the DSM cannot capture everyone<br>in fact some of the most common<br>diagnoses usually have something like<br>not elsewhere classified or not<br>otherwise specified after them because<br>they can't fit patients neatly into a<br>particular diagnostic category but the<br>hierarchical dimensional system will<br>capture everyone because essentially<br>it's a spectrum you can look at a<br>combination of different dimensions and<br>find someone somewhere it's kind of like<br>the color spectrum you know you have an<br>infinite number of colors but you really<br>only have three dimensions so you look<br>at all infinite combinations of all of<br>those three dimensions you have your<br>color spectrum well the same thing goes<br>for having multiple dimensions for<br>psychopathology there's a place for<br>everyone to be characterized and then<br>it's also important that we think about<br>things in terms of severity some people<br>with mental health problems are better<br>functioning than others some individuals<br>have to be hospitalized some others have<br>mental health problems can still go to<br>work they can still maintain friendships<br>and so on and so forth so severe they<br>needs to be accounted for in the<br>diagnostic manual so essentially when<br>we're talking about severity and and and<br>and the symptom dimension<br>we're essentially talking about two<br>broader mains of severity and style and<br>they're relatively independent from one<br>another so we can think about severely<br>as a dimensional thing you know some<br>people might be extremely impaired to<br>the degree that they might to be<br>hospitalized or some might not be so<br>impaired but they still have some<br>problems in functioning it's still a<br>dimensional account but the way that<br>this impairment is actually manifesting<br>is gonna differ from person to person so<br>you imagine these houses here they're<br>all kind of fancy houses I think many of<br>us would probably like to live in one of<br>these three houses they would be except<br>I'm just joking but joking aside a lot<br>of us might want to live in some of<br>these houses and and because they're<br>fancy they're expensive they all have<br>water and so on so there would be so<br>there would be quite people like these<br>things right so so there would be all<br>high on there like like expense down a<br>severity dimension but if I took a poll<br>in terms of which house you would<br>actually prefer they would probably be a<br>lot of different results some people we<br>like this cozy cabin some people would<br>like the mansion and some people would<br>like this really modern looking house<br>and that is because of preference so in<br>this example style and severe they're<br>different severe it is independent<br>because here we're talking extreme all<br>but the different style and we just<br>think about but mental health disorders<br>anyway here's another example long<br>saying well here we have some successful<br>musicians there are musicians I try to<br>make sure that a microphone and<br>instrument in case you didn't recognize<br>them though three of them are Kiwis yes<br>snoop dogg you cannot have musicians<br>without Snoop Dogg anyhow but here's the<br>same here's the same concept right so<br>here we have really successful musicians<br>although they might vary in their degree<br>of success there's still successful<br>musicians so in terms of a severity<br>impairment dimension they would vary but<br>they would be at a higher end because<br>they're all successful but again if I<br>took a poll who's your favorite musician<br>here we've got a lot of different<br>answers because they would differ in the<br>idea of style so again similar for<br>mental disorders we need to separate<br>that idea of how impaired someone is in<br>functioning compared to what the<br>symptoms that they exhibit actually look<br>like so we've done a little research<br>this is actually not my study but I<br>really like to study better than my own<br>so I'm showing it instead but<br>essentially what we found in part of<br>this group in general what what we found<br>was that if we if you take a a do by<br>factor model which is complex<br>statistical analysis we can essentially<br>extract the general dimension so we look<br>at all of these different diagnoses we<br>can extract the general dimension that's<br>correlated with all that's essentially<br>our impairment dimension and then<br>independent from the impairment<br>dimension we can oxy also extract some<br>style dimensions and what we find in in<br>longitudinal research is that their<br>style which are these lines here tend to<br>remain relatively stable that is we<br>don't really change who we are but we<br>can't change in terms of our general<br>functioning how impaired we are with<br>respect to functioning that is this line<br>that doesn't remain as stable so anyhow<br>so we've been working a lot on that in a<br>particular area of research that we have<br>focused on is personality disorders and<br>it's probably where I spend most of my<br>time and and if you read the definition<br>the SMI personality disorders an<br>enduring pattern of inner experience and<br>behavior deviates markedly from<br>expectations of individual culture<br>patterns manifested in the way we think<br>the way we feel how we relate to other<br>people and how we can control our<br>behavior personality disorders are meant<br>to be inflexible across context that is<br>to have the same types of problems don't<br>matter where they go and they don't seem<br>to change although there's some debate<br>as to whether or not that's the case<br>there are 10 personality disorders in<br>the DSM I'm not really going to talk<br>about them at all<br>I'm just telling you there are ten of<br>them right now but there's a lot of<br>problems with them that's why I don't<br>want to talk about them they're<br>successive diagnostic call currents in<br>the sense that if you have one<br>personality sore chances area<br>chances are you have several more in<br>fact if you look at symptoms of<br>personality disorders to list a bunch of<br>symptoms here and then a bunch of<br>personality in the columns we see that<br>there's a ton of overlap across these<br>different symptoms which is not<br>particularly useful because part of the<br>reason we have diagnoses for<br>communication and planning interventions<br>well if all of these kind of Co occur at<br>the same time that's not going to be<br>particularly useful for that there's<br>also very arbitrary boundaries in terms<br>of what is normal versus abnormal for<br>all of these diagnoses they use poly<br>feta criterion sets and what that means<br>is that you need X otherwise symptoms in<br>order to meet criteria for for diagnosis<br>so five out of nine for instance for<br>borderline personality disorder<br>well mathematicians will tell you that<br>means there are 256 different<br>combinations a meeting diagnostic<br>criteria for borderline PD how useful is<br>that or you have four out of eight for<br>obsessive-compulsive personality<br>disorder four out of eight so you have<br>two patients with the same diagnosis who<br>do not share single symptom and how do<br>they come to this idea that they should<br>have four out of eight or five out of<br>nine there were some brilliant science<br>of course I went into that right no this<br>is true this is the absolute truth<br>because I know the people under work<br>groups of personality disorder in the<br>DSM about half sounds about right<br>this is science for you and not only is<br>it intellectually embarrassing but it's<br>also fiscally irresponsible I mean tons<br>of millions of dollars go into<br>epidemiological studies to determine the<br>prevalence rates or what sounds about<br>right<br>there's also excessive within diagnosis<br>heterogeneity as I just mentioned<br>because of our thirty criterion sets but<br>even so despite these ten disorders most<br>people who have a personality disorder<br>do not map on to any of these ten<br>disorders they have personality disorder<br>not otherwise specified<br>fight so how useful is it when about 40%<br>of people cannot actually be classified<br>according to any of the categories and<br>then they're not as stable as they claim<br>to be and for seven of these ten<br>disorders we don't know a whole lot at<br>all with respect to etiology which is<br>causation and treatment so how should we<br>solve this well again going back to<br>dimensional models of the other mental<br>health disorders we all know that<br>everyone has a personality you might<br>think of some friends know that person<br>has no person that trust me they have a<br>personality<br>they might just express it a little bit<br>differently and we all have a standing<br>on a personality trait dimension most of<br>us are in the middle but some people are<br>in the extremes extremely high on say<br>neuroticism are extremely low and say<br>agreeableness these are standard<br>personality trait domains identified in<br>science these people might have problems<br>right and that is that is really where<br>we're going with all of this is that<br>person a source can be defined in terms<br>of people who are the extremes of our<br>personality traits and we actually<br>already have a diagnosis in the DSM<br>that's like this it's called<br>intellectual disability here we have a<br>individual differences dimension<br>everyone has intelligence right everyone<br>has intelligence it's a normally<br>distributed dimension but we've decided<br>I suppose as a society that individuals<br>who are extremely low and the second<br>percentile on our intelligence measures<br>are lower are individuals who might have<br>problems they are not sufficiently<br>intelligent to take care of themselves<br>so if they're that low and they actually<br>do have problems in functioning that is<br>impairment which is scored on a severity<br>dimension even for this disorder then<br>they have an intellectual disability so<br>it's not just that they're extremely low<br>on intelligence that also have to result<br>in some form of impairment again style<br>and severity are independent from one<br>another in that regard so we published<br>some some papers one of the things that<br>if you're gonna<br>wrote a proposal like this that we<br>should essentially change the whole<br>system of how we think about personality<br>disorders in psychopathology in general<br>for that matter you have to show some<br>evidence that there's still some overlap<br>that you're not missing something<br>important by by moving to this<br>dimensional perspective so here's a<br>meta-analysis which is essentially a<br>quantitative summary we essentially just<br>look at all of the studies have been<br>published in the area then we average<br>the results so we look at the bunch of<br>personality trait dimensions it have<br>been proposed to measure personality as<br>a matter if you don't understand what<br>they are the take-home message is the<br>same here we have six of the most common<br>personality disorders from the<br>traditional system and essentially what<br>we found in all of these numbers that<br>you can't read is that we find a<br>tremendous amount of overlap we can<br>capture all of the traditional disorders<br>using a dimensional system but the good<br>thing with the demential system is that<br>we're gonna capture everyone and not<br>just sixty percent one of the<br>personalities orders that I've<br>particularly interesting that I alluded<br>to before when I talked about my PhD<br>thesis but I also defined for you guys<br>is psychopathy and we've been doing some<br>of this exercise with the psychopathic<br>personality disorders well this is a<br>study I collaborated with my good friend<br>and colleague Dustin Wygant<br>I decided to depict here he told me use<br>I obliged so pitbull and I published<br>this study where we're looking at the<br>anti-social personality disorder and and<br>as its defined in the DSM are according<br>to these five I'm sorry seven symptoms<br>how they're only listening listening six<br>because I combined them but you know<br>people are disregarding social norms and<br>standards they're reckless impulsive<br>they are responsible they're quick to<br>anger they are going to be deceitful<br>they're gonna manipulate you and I don't<br>feel bad about it at all<br>these are people with antisocial<br>personality great we don't want to meet<br>them the the problem with this disorder<br>is that you only need three out of seven<br>in order to meet diagnostic threshold<br>three out of seven that means that most<br>people who are in prison<br>we'll meet diagnostic criteria because<br>they break the law they're impulsive and<br>irresponsible and they often have hot<br>tempers so that is not very useful so<br>people talk about psychopathy as a more<br>specific diagnostic construct that<br>includes more personality features like<br>callousness lacking in empathy and<br>remorse not feeling much for other<br>people including not having much fear or<br>anxiety so they're gonna engage in all<br>these dangerous activities because they<br>don't fear the consequences they don't<br>they don't form deep relationships with<br>others most of their relationships are<br>sexual nature interpersonally they can<br>be charming but they're also grandiose<br>in terms of their interactions with<br>other they feel superior to others and<br>they dominate and manipulate and the<br>person who's probably done the most work<br>on this is dr. Bob hare who developed a<br>psychopathy checklist which is an<br>interview based Mouser you essentially<br>sit down with someone for two hours you<br>interview them and then you also collect<br>a bunch of institutional records and<br>then you rate them on a series of twenty<br>traits there are pretty much a list of<br>everything that I just talked about in<br>terms of the antisocial personality<br>symptoms and the extra psychopathy<br>symptoms and they say that if there's a<br>score of 30 out of 40 which is the max<br>your psychopathy there's absolutely no<br>evidence for that actually we don't<br>think about psychopathy as a excuse me<br>categorical<br>Naumann because there's no evidence for<br>it just because Bob hare an experimental<br>psychologist who needed to classify<br>people because of his experimental<br>studies he needed groups said 30 all the<br>clinicians decided to run with this and<br>say AHA anyone who scores third is a<br>psychopath<br>what magic happens when he moved from 29<br>to 30 on a dimensional score I can tell<br>you nothing but the state of Texas uses<br>this for sexual violent predator<br>evaluations and everyone less authority<br>on this test is a psychopath and is<br>therefore at very high risk for sexual<br>violence and could be confined for the<br>rest of their lives I'm not gonna go<br>into this anymore but anyhow Dustin and<br>I collected a bunch of data I was<br>heavily involved in this project I was<br>still at Alabama when we started it and<br>we interviewed a bunch of offenders and<br>I decided to show you just very quick<br>videos or what psychopathy looks like so<br>all of these individuals scored over 35<br>on hare scale so they're very high on<br>psychopathy traits but they look quite<br>different nevertheless and all of these<br>individuals have given their consent to<br>be shown for educational purposes and<br>trust me they loved the idea that they<br>were going to be shown for educational<br>purpose although they probably don't<br>know that they're being shown in New<br>Zealand right now so what I'm going to<br>do so I'm gonna play this video excuse<br>me and this person just give you some<br>context Murder two individuals<br>execution-style in their trailer because<br>he thought there were sex offenders and<br>he did believe he did not believe such<br>individuals should exist so he was asked<br>how do you feel about your crimes and<br>here's his answer I hate to sound like a<br>sociopath but it's really no different<br>from taking out the trash<br>I'm just I felt<br>nothing I'm I didn't and I want to maybe<br>it's important I I wasn't angry when I<br>went there I wasn't I didn't have any<br>kind of desire to torture order to make<br>them suffer I just simply thought there<br>is no way that you can exist real person<br>and individuals are psychopathic tend to<br>be quite selfish and not care about<br>other people and this gentleman is going<br>to talk about that aspect if I didn't<br>know you who are you if you ain't making<br>no type of reference of me trying to get<br>some money or you know better myself and<br>who are you you ain't you know I look at<br>you with a speak okay cool not gone back<br>my way and wouldn't think twice about<br>you also a nice gentleman he just robbed<br>someone in this individual it's gonna<br>show us the grandiose sense of self<br>these individuals have very little<br>insight into their behavior and and they<br>think very highly of themselves this<br>person I kidnapped a woman and raped her<br>for a couple of days in a hut in the<br>middle of the woods but he doesn't seem<br>to be too bothered by that he's not<br>gonna talk about that in this clip but<br>rather he was asked on a scale of 0 to<br>10 how do you feel about yourself and<br>here's his answer 12 probably nine and a<br>half 15 because the very first person<br>that you have to take care of is<br>yourself period point-blank no matter<br>who what when where how or why because<br>I'm stuck with me no matter where I go<br>okay they face get those are never alone<br>are we no better but but no seriously<br>I'm the one person that I can't escape<br>I'm the one person I can't lie to you<br>I can try I've tried before and I knew<br>the truth it was crazy it kind of<br>freaked me out a little bit yeah there's<br>some interesting people that's we meet<br>in this type of work anyhow<br>so one of the things that we were<br>interested in to see if these<br>dimensional personality traits that<br>we're offering to supplant the current<br>system can capture psychopathy based on<br>Bob hare specl<br>better than the traditionally antisocial<br>personality disorder and we show some<br>evidence for that but I'm actually going<br>to just cut to the chase here we have<br>psychopathy and if we look at overlap as<br>in a correlation it's called a Venn<br>diagram we find that the traditional<br>dsm-5 diagnosis do capture psychopathy<br>to a great extent I mean there are after<br>all sharing a lot of symptoms just not<br>all of the symptoms but then we use the<br>dimensional personality traits and we<br>find that they capture psychopathy<br>almost completely suggesting that this<br>more important construct of psychopathy<br>can actually be fully covered with the<br>new dimensional system whereas the<br>traditional system doesn't do a very<br>good job<br>I'm finally gonna mention just a couple<br>of very quick studies about personality<br>assessment I continue to do work with<br>the MMPI - restructured form and of<br>course I study personality disorders I<br>thought what a good idea I should<br>develop personality disorder scales for<br>the MMPI to Aref so I did and and I<br>published this with mark wall and Chris<br>hopwood Chris interestingly is actually<br>a lead researcher on the most competing<br>tests - the MMPI TRF but I brought him<br>over to the dark side he also likes<br>personality disorders so that's why he<br>joined the effort also highlining<br>studied by my student Tiffany brown<br>who's here somewhere and she was a<br>third-year student when she did this<br>project which is why she was meant to<br>become a PhD student I think so she was<br>interested in in applied personality<br>assessment and especially you know<br>catching people who lie on our test<br>because you know if you use these types<br>of tests in clinical practice one of the<br>drawbacks with self-report<br>questionnaires is that people can lie<br>right<br>I I go through a forensic evaluation in<br>jail oh I don't want to go to prison I<br>want to go to a hospital because it's<br>much better there you know I'm not gonna<br>be found guilty so I'm gonna just fake<br>mental health problems evil spirits<br>possessed me at times yep my soul<br>sometimes leaves my body yep well we've<br>done a lot of research to show that that<br>we have good skills that can capture<br>these individuals well Tiffany was<br>interested in underreporting so people<br>are minimizing and denying their<br>problems especially in the priam<br>employment context MMP is used all over<br>the world to screen for public safety<br>personnel like police officers<br>firefighters and so on and so she<br>essentially asked a bunch of undergrads<br>and said to them I gonna pay you a bunch<br>of money if you can fake on this test<br>and deny all these problems and get away<br>with it they couldn't because we have<br>very good scale or two sets of scales<br>that caught them and they were of course<br>compared to a group of people who took<br>the test honestly after we had excluded<br>all people took it randomly in our<br>psychology subject pool where people act<br>I want to get out of here we have scales<br>for that too so those were some some of<br>the person Allen projects recently I'm<br>not gonna belabor this too much because<br>I'm probably about to get kicked off the<br>stage but the the I just want to very<br>quickly talk about the road ahead some<br>of the things we're doing I'm very<br>interested in externalizing spectrum<br>psychopathology that includes antisocial<br>'ti psychopathy but also things like<br>substance abuse and ADHD anger problems<br>so Neal McNaughton who's here he and I<br>have started talking about using EEG<br>biomarkers to see if we can diagnose<br>these people differently and better and<br>we've been trying to get some money to<br>do this and we've been successful in in<br>some ways and and we advertise for<br>individuals so happy this is not as<br>funny as the other advertisements but<br>still you know if you get angry a lot if<br>you've been addicted to drugs diagnosed<br>with ADHD come to come to us and we will<br>hook you off to an EEG and interview you<br>for hours matt is sitting here has<br>interviewed lots of these individuals<br>and I think she likes it I'm just<br>kidding<br>yeah Madi can speak for self another<br>thing that we're doing is continuing<br>this theme of assessing dimensional<br>Personalis the icd-11 was just recently<br>published and for the first time in a<br>history of diagnostic manuals they<br>proposed a dimensional system of<br>personality disorders this is great<br>because now someone is finally dare to<br>take that step and we're going to do a<br>study on that if we get money I'm hoping<br>we get money and and Tiffany is gonna do<br>part of her PhD on that also interested<br>in successful psychopathy as I mentioned<br>before lots of collaborations going on<br>recently connected with Ritchie Poulton<br>we're going to do a project with the<br>Dunedin study and and Emma Veltman my<br>current honor student and PhD to be is<br>going to be heavily involved in that as<br>well<br>and I work with David Cook in Scotland<br>we developed a new psychopathy measure<br>that also is very much based in<br>personality trait theory rather than in<br>a bunch of arbitrary symptoms so I<br>developed the test it's been translated<br>into a few languages interestingly the<br>language are Persian Lithuanian Chinese<br>very interesting eclectic set of<br>language it's no region but not Swedish<br>my Swedish vocabulary are so bad that<br>that's not going to happen and the MMPI<br>3 is about to be released late next year<br>and a large proportion of my research<br>program is gonna go towards publishing<br>on the validity and the utility of the<br>MMPI 3 an applied Personalis s-mint of<br>course not forgetting my forensic roots<br>it's gonna be a lot focus on how we can<br>use this in forensic applications<br>so in closing it's a great University<br>I'm very happy to be here I have a great<br>colleagues I know you know that<br>yourselves it's a great place of lay to<br>live Dunedin for all its faults you know<br>we can live in a place like this it<br>doesn't get much better maybe I should<br>have included that house in the list<br>although the weather could be a little<br>bit better here you know in these talks<br>you're supposed to acknowledge people<br>which i think is the right thing to do<br>but there are so many people that I<br>would need to acknowledge I couldn't<br>list my one slide but you've seen lots<br>of pictures and those are not random<br>these are people who very much been<br>influential in my career and and I<br>really wanted to highlight them<br>I should highlight some personal<br>pictures as well here's Vanessa very<br>supportive of my professional adventures<br>I should acknowledge her she might not<br>acknowledge me after showing this<br>picture almost life-size after she ran a<br>half marathon but oh well we don't have<br>kids<br>but we have pseudo kids so here are two<br>horses Mary and Mary's the black one and<br>no Maranoa have a special relationship<br>that I'm not gonna get into then we have<br>Bart Bart's my horse here celebrating<br>its ninth birthday<br>Bart likes to party and and sometimes to<br>embarked parties they can get a little<br>bit crazy I also have two sheep Anna and<br>Elsa very important and last but not<br>least peanut and Nova have traveled<br>across continents they're living in<br>their third country now four states yeah<br>they're great<br>Kirra guitar my name is David Birky I'm<br>acting a chori of the Department of<br>Psychology unfortunately Mike Columbo<br>who is the head of department is away<br>overseas and I couldn't make it but I<br>know he really wishes he was here well<br>what a great talk<br>fantastic Martin and and I for me there<br>are perhaps two things that I took away<br>from him one was just a lovely example<br>of how you could take theoretical<br>research you could look at structures<br>that had been around for a long time<br>start pulling them apart and then<br>developing ideas from that which would<br>then feed out into the community in this<br>in this case in clinical practice the<br>second aspect of the talk that I thought<br>was wonderful too was you're mentioning<br>of mentors and how important mentors<br>were for you and it's clear that in your<br>and your trajectory that there have been<br>particular people that have been very<br>important and bringing you to where you<br>are now<br>and I think for those of us who work<br>with students I think that's really<br>important a really important message to<br>take away as well so I've really been<br>looking forward to this talk and part of<br>the anticipation has been built up by<br>the number of posters that have appeared<br>around the department is quite<br>remarkable I was you know in the staff<br>room this morning and there were about<br>300 posters of Martin across the wall<br>there everywhere even in the lifts<br>actually the ones and the lifts are<br>really interesting because it's quite<br>clear that once people get into the lift<br>you know there might be they're on their<br>own and they've got a bit of time on<br>their hands and some people obviously<br>have some sort of artistic bent and so<br>it's been interesting to watch those<br>posters on the lift and how they've<br>changed over the last week and you know<br>for example on one<br>Martin developed glasses on another day<br>and his mustache grew enormously and<br>lovely tweaks on it and I was looking at<br>this and and as acting head of<br>department it's actually very important<br>that one of the things I do is sort of<br>maintain order and the department and<br>it's a very difficult job but I thought<br>you know we have to get to the bottom of<br>this you know who's who's making these<br>changes to the posters and I was<br>thinking well it's clearly not people<br>who work on the second floor because<br>they're only in the lift for a short<br>period of time and then the same at a<br>third floor you know you've only got a<br>few seconds really to do anything so who<br>are the people that stay in the lift for<br>the longest well it's clearly the people<br>up on the fifth floor where our clinical<br>program is run so I think Martin I think<br>you need to talk to you over at clinical<br>students about this yeah but there was<br>one addition to these photos that I<br>thought was as quite lovely really and<br>that was one day Martin<br>developed a wizard's hat and it was a<br>beautiful head nice tall peaked hat with<br>stars on it and I was thinking about<br>that and I thought actually that's very<br>appropriate and what we've seen tonight<br>is actually magic as I say the way that<br>you've been able to take this data and<br>pull it apart and produce something<br>that's incredibly meaningful so I want<br>to thank you for that and I'd like to<br>give you just a small gift and<br>appreciation of that you don't need to<br>open it now and so just in finishing<br>what I'd like is actually to invite you<br>across to the staff club where you can<br>join with Martin and for a few<br>refreshments but before we do that I'd<br>just like you to join with me and put<br>your hands together and thank Martin<br>first talk and also an appreciation of a<br>service achievement<br>you</p></main><footer
