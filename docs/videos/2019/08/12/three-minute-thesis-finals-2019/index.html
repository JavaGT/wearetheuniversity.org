manager<br>of policy and compliance for the<br>University of Otago they asked me to be<br>the MC because we take compliance with<br>the rules very seriously in the three<br>minute thesis it is my great pleasure to<br>welcome you all to the 2019 University<br>of Otago three minute thesis finals I'd<br>like to welcome everyone in the audience<br>today I'd like to welcome the<br>contestants I'd like to welcome our<br>judges I'd like to welcome people on the<br>livestream and people of the future the<br>three minute thesis celebrates the<br>exciting research that we do at the<br>University of Otago it celebrates in<br>fact the exciting research that PhD and<br>masters candidates from around the world<br>do we're just lucky enough to be hearing<br>our own universities researchers it was<br>developed by the University of<br>Queensland in 2008 and the competition<br>is designed to cultivate the<br>communication skills of our PhD and<br>masters candidates and to foster an<br>interest in the research the very<br>exciting research that we do<br>amongst lay audiences presenting in the<br>three minute thesis competition<br>increases our capacity to effectively<br>explain the research that we're involved<br>in to people who aren't embedded in it<br>on a daily basis in three minutes we are<br>asked to do something that's really<br>tough to explain highly technical highly<br>specialized in highly important research<br>in a simplified brief manner we're only<br>allowed one PowerPoint slide and we're<br>allowed no props no props the idea for<br>this competition came about in 2008<br>after a drought in Queensland<br>everybody was reducing their water usage<br>and they all had been given all the<br>students had been given an egg timer for<br>a three-minute shower the den Dean of<br>the University's Graduate research<br>school put two and two together and came<br>up with a three minute thesis<br>competition if from a drought you put<br>two and two two<br>and come up with a three minute thesis<br>competition whatever a professor he was<br>in it was clearly not in numeracy so in<br>my own simpler in smellier times that<br>competition was only for Australia but<br>it has extended out as its popularity<br>has grown and it is now over 600<br>universities and 65 countries worldwide<br>the 3mt is a fantastic event it is<br>always a highlight of the Graduate<br>research calendar is this is the first<br>event or the second event of the<br>calendar this month first event<br>oh my god okay 7-7 okay it's a fun event<br>as I mentioned earlier but it's much<br>much more than that in the years that<br>I've been associated with the 3mt I've<br>noticed three things the first is that<br>the contestants keep getting younger the<br>second is that the font on my run sheet<br>keeps needing to get larger and the<br>third is that the research just keeps<br>improving it's exciting it's interesting<br>and it is engaging and I have no doubt<br>that the group of contestants that we<br>have here today will just continue to to<br>go in that positive trajectory research<br>at Otago is clearly in safe hands<br>being able to conduct research on<br>something that you love is an incredible<br>privilege it is a real thrill to be able<br>to spend a lot of time although<br>sometimes it doesn't feel that thrilling<br>but to be able to spend a lot of time on<br>doing something that you are passionate<br>about it is a privilege in our working<br>lives it is a project privilege an hour<br>an hour studying lives our graduate<br>research candidates future academics<br>their future captains of industry<br>they're our future researchers and our<br>future leaders I'm confident that the<br>thesis candidates are of a world class<br>standard I'm also confident that they<br>are receiving world-class supervision in<br>a world-class university it's always<br>inspiring to hear the creative way that<br>our graduate graduate research<br>candidates communicate something as<br>complicated as their research in a<br>small amount of time the 3mt provides an<br>incredible development opportunity for<br>us all it fosters important skills of<br>clarity and brevity this is a skill that<br>will last you a lifetime whether it's an<br>elevator pitch for a job you're<br>interested in or whether you're trying<br>to win an argument with your teenager<br>it's always important to keep it brief<br>preparing a three-minute three-minute<br>presentation always serves to reignite<br>your passion and enthusiasm in my<br>experience for your research simplifying<br>our research and communicating it as<br>clearly as possible makes us remember<br>why we started this in the first place<br>why we are going about doing this<br>endeavor what we loved about our<br>disciplines and what we loved about the<br>work that we're doing as a staff member<br>getting involved in this competition it<br>provides a lovely opportunity to witness<br>the enthusiasm the passion and the<br>cleverness of our mini thesis candidates<br>firsthand tonight we have four masters<br>and seven PhD students competing they've<br>all fought off stiff competition and<br>their departments in divisions to be<br>here tonight the winner of our masters<br>section will get to compete in the new<br>zealand into university national mest<br>masters competition and Dunedin later<br>this month and the winner of the<br>doctoral section will go on to travel to<br>Brisbane to compete in the asia-pacific<br>3mt final at the University of<br>Queensland and October there's also a<br>People's Choice Award which will cover<br>both the masters and PhD students so<br>you'll get to have your say as well as<br>listening to what the judges think in<br>your program you'll find a tear-off<br>strip please hand us at the end of all<br>the presentations to one of the Graduate<br>research ambassadors wave to us graduate<br>research ambassadors yay they will be<br>coming and collecting them while the<br>judges are doing their deliberations ok<br>so that's a little bit by way of<br>introduction of the competition I'll do<br>some housekeeping now as I understand it<br>and I've only been in the job a short<br>time the<br>listy of o-tar goes manager of policy<br>and compliance means that I in this role<br>have almost dictatorial powers to make<br>you do what I want you to do so listen<br>up okay emergency exits here if there<br>was a fire in a case of a fire we would<br>go down with stairs at Mount the main<br>stairs that you came in do not use a<br>lift we're lucky to find the lift in<br>this building actually but do not use a<br>list and we will meet between the clock<br>tower and this building here case of an<br>earthquake maybe move more towards the<br>carpark actually but that's probably my<br>own riffing on that half health and<br>safety announcement there are bathrooms<br>downstairs on the first floor as we came<br>up just by the stairs try to find any<br>other get ones around here again I think<br>you're going to get lost so don't do<br>that cell phones please check your cell<br>phones are switched to silent or<br>preferably off you are allowed to take a<br>video or photo discreetly Sharon<br>discreetly okay alright please do not<br>get in the way of the recording that has<br>been made at the back of the room<br>our lovely competitors bear in mind that<br>there are going to be photos at the end<br>of this and so I like you to stay behind<br>the inn to have a group photo two<br>competitors should be aware that the<br>videos and photos can be that are taken<br>could be used for publicity purposes<br>it's too late now to complain about that<br>isn't it well you certainly await you<br>nervously but in any event if you do<br>have any questions or concerns please<br>come and see me<br>at one of the breaks in terms of our<br>sponsorship we're very fortunate that<br>tonight's event has been sponsored by<br>hello world Dunedin hello world have<br>generously donated a number of travel<br>prizes for tonight's contestants<br>including travel to the next stage of<br>the competition for the doctor'll winner<br>I guess they could get you a taxi to the<br>Masters competition you know they've<br>also got a prize actually for that too<br>okay I think that you're hearing enough<br>from me I'll introduce the judges panel<br>and then we'll get started very soon we<br>know I'm required to introduce people<br>who have had a distinguished career<br>and if accomplished so much I throw up a<br>little in my mouth I'll be honest with<br>you today is no exception<br>it makes me sick I however have devised<br>a little technique for coping with the<br>queasiness that I feel by their<br>achievements of successes and the clear<br>evidence and results of their careers<br>that technique is to lie yes I tell<br>stories it's my tip for you to if you're<br>ever in a situation where you have to<br>introduce people and you can feel your<br>bile raising its channel your petty<br>jealousy through just making nonsense up<br>no one's ever going to suspect no one's<br>ever going to tell but that's my tip for<br>you so without further ado the first to<br>judge I'd like to introduce you to is<br>Rachel Professor Rachel sprung can<br>smooth wave Rachel rate wave excellent<br>rachel is a professor in higher<br>education in geography and also the Dean<br>of the Graduate research school at the<br>University of Otago she efforts to be<br>believed initially trained as a<br>geographer doing a PhD in geography at<br>the University of British Columbia she<br>specialized in Emmett urban climatology<br>with her research involving cycling<br>driving or flying around urban areas<br>measuring the climatic effects of urban<br>green space she's also interested in<br>micro climates and where it might be<br>best to grow wine she's a tippler after<br>becoming a climate denier and Rachel<br>we've talked about this<br>Rachel was drummed out of geography and<br>in the last 15 years she switched into<br>higher education<br>she's a past head of the higher<br>education development center where she<br>worked as an academic staff developer<br>Rachel came to the Graduate research<br>school in 2012 as Dean of the School she<br>still finds time to continue to<br>supervise PhD students rachel is<br>passionate about giving students the<br>best popular possible curricular<br>experience as well at university she's<br>won plenty of awards for her teaching<br>and his supervision and I'm too bitter<br>to mention those here tonight rachel has<br>a particular interest in research as a<br>high-impact experience I hope they don't<br>less fitting than I imagined and tonight<br>is looking very much forward to enjoying<br>some of that research<br>please give Rachel a big warm thank you<br>next I'd like to introduce associate<br>professor Lisa McNeil Lisa is an<br>academic in the department of marketing<br>in the division of commerce lisa is the<br>associate dean postgraduate research for<br>the Otago Business School and was the<br>director of the international business<br>program for four years Lisa began her<br>academic career and the arts was an<br>interest in postmodern literature and in<br>the human condition before according to<br>her BA professors turning to the dark<br>side of communists I'm sure the<br>Communist professors will say before<br>realizing she needed a job<br>Lisa completed her PhD research at a<br>number of Asian countries and has<br>researched a variety of interesting<br>consumer phenomena these days Lisa's<br>police' research is what we buy and why<br>we buy it<br>examining such varied topics is why we<br>buy sugary fatty but oh so yummy foods<br>it's because they're all so yummy and<br>why we go into debt for fashion if I'm<br>to believe her biography she has an<br>interest in men who moisturize and wear<br>skinny jeans I got that right didn't I<br>oh well horses for courses<br>lisa says she's looking forward to the<br>research tonight and in the spirit of<br>promoting her local economy is willing<br>to be bribed a word of warning though<br>she'll be looking out carefully for any<br>subliminal messages and advertising in<br>the presentations tonight so watch out<br>thank you very much please give Lisa a<br>finally David hey David is a Dunedin<br>screenwriter according to the biography<br>I received David Haye is a Scotsman with<br>vision<br>it's excellent he's whipped he's worked<br>as an editor a podcaster a producer a<br>director and a writer of natural history<br>stories more recently he's turned to<br>cinema dramas of the human kind because<br>humans will do what they're told while<br>animals will not not in my house David<br>not in my house<br>I thought this bio was a likely story so<br>I googled him I wish I hadn't just like<br>Rachel and Lisa David his<br>accomplishments in achievements and<br>makes other things David worked Natural<br>History New Zealand for over four years<br>and prior to that mistaking it for a<br>Scottish Talent Quest he worked on<br>Campbell Live for two years you can see<br>one of David's award-winning short films<br>called fish at this year's Film Festival<br>I take it you can I can't i've been<br>trespassed but enjoy it it has<br>spectacular reviews David's looking<br>forward to hearing the great research<br>and then leaving a little early to avoid<br>hearing the movie pictures pictures I<br>might have for him policy and compliance<br>a love story don't worry David I can<br>email you the details it's our great<br>pleasure to have you here tonight please<br>welcome<br>okay the rules we're nearly there<br>everyone we're nearly at the point at<br>which you start hearing the things that<br>you've actually come to here but policy<br>and compliance have got to go through<br>the rules okay<br>so one single static power point that's<br>all that slide is the only thing that's<br>permitted no slide transitions<br>no animations no movement of the sort of<br>or any description of kind are allowed<br>the slide is to be presented from the<br>beginning of the oration no additional<br>electronic media eg sound and video<br>files are permitted no additional props<br>eg costumes or musical instruments<br>laboratory equipment they are not<br>allowed either presentations are limited<br>to three minutes no this is a key one<br>Susan our lovely timekeeper Thank You<br>Susan Susan<br>we'll have that we'll have the official<br>countdown she will show you a sign 30<br>seconds<br>at that point you have 30 seconds to go<br>then she will show you another sight ten<br>seconds doot oh there's a theme 10<br>seconds to go then she will go at that<br>sound no more middle of a sentence zip<br>it don't say anything<br>ok the moment you're over there sadly we<br>have to disqualify you and nobody wants<br>that presentations are to be spoken word<br>no poems and no rap songs or limericks<br>or any other things like that and<br>present 8 presentations that commence<br>from the stage I think that means this<br>but ok presentations are considered to<br>have commenced when a presenter starts<br>the presentation through either movement<br>or speech ok the decision of the judging<br>panel is final alright what are the<br>criteria the first criteria for judging<br>a comprehension in content did the<br>presentation provide an understanding of<br>the background and the significance of<br>the research question being addressed<br>while explaining terminology and<br>avoiding jargon did the presentation<br>clearly describe the impact and/or<br>results of the research including<br>conclusions and outcome<br>did the presentation follow a clear and<br>logical sequence was the thesis topic<br>research significance results and impact<br>outcomes communicated in a language<br>appropriate for this communication for a<br>non specialist audience did the<br>presenters been adequate time on each<br>element of their presentation or did the<br>it seemed elaborate too long or was one<br>aspect of it rushed engagement and<br>communication did the oration make the<br>audience want to know more I know you're<br>all wanting to know more about policy<br>and compliance so it's that kind of<br>thing well as the presenter careful not<br>to trivialize or generalize their<br>research did the presenter convey<br>enthusiasm for their research did they<br>capture and maintain the audience's<br>attention did they have sufficient stage<br>presence iContact and vocal range<br>maintain a steady pace and have a<br>confident stance was the PowerPoint<br>slide enhancing of the presentation was<br>a clear and concise judges will give<br>individual feedback after each<br>presentation so once you've delivered<br>your speech please just stay here and<br>I'll pass the mic to the judges and they<br>will go through and give you some<br>feedback before the presentations began<br>I want to point and I invite you to<br>ponder two things the first is what a<br>huge accomplishment it is to get to the<br>finals of the 3mt<br>taking an average speaking time of a<br>hundred and fifty words per minute your<br>standard PhD candidate would require<br>over 11 hours to read aloud their thesis<br>and that's not thinking about the<br>footnotes the appendices or toilet<br>breaks the average masters candidates<br>would take 4.5 hours by the same measure<br>reading all the errors and Donald<br>Trump's tweets would take the rest of my<br>life clearly considering all the steep<br>thinking and I mean the thesis<br>candidates not Donald Trump's this is a<br>mess of challenge to try and condense<br>your work into three minutes and the<br>finalists have done brilliantly to get<br>this far the second thing I'd like you<br>to ponder is the notion of time and how<br>quickly or slowly we perceive that time<br>to pass three minutes what does three<br>minutes seem like<br>if I read out all the names of the<br>university's policies procedures and<br>guidelines it would take me just under<br>three minutes however I sense it would<br>seem like an eternity to you for me<br>though it would fly by shall we try it a<br>is for academic dress statute and<br>academic integrity policy and academic<br>progress policy no I won't do any more<br>yesterday i sat in a cafe with a friend<br>and we were trying to guess how long<br>three minutes talk to pass we did this a<br>number of times we were wrong every time<br>but we had a really good lunch hour<br>together three minutes is a really long<br>time if you're walking through campus<br>with your skirt tucked into your undies<br>trust me<br>however it's an incredibly short period<br>of time when you're trying to explain<br>your years of research so without<br>further ado I would like to introduce<br>the first contestant from the masters<br>section okay fantastic<br>Jonah if you'd like to come down here<br>okay<br>here we have from the department of<br>zoology Jonah Belk it's talking about<br>his thesis topic modeling the passive<br>dynamics of spider locomotion through<br>robot robotic design tell me when you're<br>ready<br>Jonah and I will press the button you're<br>ready yeah I can say stuff okay cool you<br>can tell me you're ready all right go<br>for it yeah today we're all accustomed<br>to seeing those buzzing YouTube video<br>headlines the future is now robot Oz and<br>as promised we kick on the YouTube video<br>and outs trolls a little robot kicks a<br>ball<br>serves a cup of tea Wow the movements<br>are impressive but there's still that<br>underlying problem clunkiness the<br>movements are completely power driven<br>not fluid or natural like a human beings<br>after all it's not exactly complement to<br>say to your friend and bro you dance<br>like a robot<br>so how do we tackle this problem with<br>clunkiness this is where my research<br>comes in I started with the biomechanics<br>and locomotion of spiders<br>we understand that efficient movement is<br>key to an animal's survival in the wild<br>efficient movement allows an animal to<br>move it that adaptively and with<br>endurance II with endurance through its<br>environment efficient movement takes<br>advantage of the pendulum light<br>qualities of its skeletal muscle design<br>and couples it with the elasticity of<br>its tendons and muscles consider for a<br>moment that the human leg is like a<br>pendulum as a moves from high to low<br>making contact the ground and carrying<br>on it recaptures most of the energy now<br>compare this to a generic robots gait<br>which is mostly power driven in his<br>joints and from the on-board computer<br>and most of that energy has dissipated<br>into the environment in efficient these<br>passive qualities of outline can be<br>found in most legged creatures from<br>larger animals such as ourselves humans<br>down to the eight little critters like<br>spiders currently I'm building and<br>modeling an eight-legged runner that has<br>the same passive bouncy qualities as to<br>be seen here my CAD design using only<br>stretchy plastic joints and Springs we<br>3d print these little eight-legged<br>runners that use very little battery<br>power this is in stark contrast to<br>current robots which have massive<br>batteries to feed power-hungry computers<br>but you may be wondering why why build a<br>model that is has eight lavetta's eight<br>legs mean you could be building it based<br>off of something it's more generic more<br>recognizable like a human being for a<br>couple of reasons one spiders are<br>innately very stable so if we're trying<br>to mimic or build in their biomechanics<br>we know they won't topple over say like<br>a bipedal robot second spiders are<br>nimble and fast ideal characteristics<br>for a robot this robot that I'm<br>designing will be cost-effective<br>efficient and to be mass-produced very<br>quickly say to be used for disaster<br>relief after an earthquake for example<br>concluding I argue that we can build<br>better bio-inspired robots that more<br>move more naturally and more bouncy be<br>quite honest these robots will use far<br>less processing power with less<br>computing power lending to an overall<br>lighter more naturally moving robot let<br>us take up setback to fully understand<br>animal<br>motion and Bioman keep biomechanics so<br>that we can take a step forward in<br>robotic design thank you<br>you're uh thank you that was a great<br>start you've set the bar right up here<br>so well done on that once I got over my<br>repulsion of actually seeing that spider<br>and focused on the robotic side it was<br>great<br>excellent body language very engaging<br>start nice link to the impacts of the<br>research so well done thank you<br>fantastic especially in the really<br>difficult position of first up I agree<br>with Rachel I loved your body language<br>and particularly the hand gestures I<br>like that you linked what you're talking<br>about to the little spider movements as<br>we went along do you invest<br>okay I work in the arts so I definitely<br>wanted to be investing in anything so<br>okay I thought that you you started<br>really beautifully by giving us an<br>example from everyday life that we could<br>all immediately relate to with something<br>obvious like robotics which is not part<br>of our everyday lives particularly and I<br>also thought that one of the great<br>things that you see in a nice story<br>we're told is that when the audience has<br>a question that it's answered almost<br>immediately which is what you and what<br>you did very nicely they're like when<br>you told us of uses of this I was going<br>what could you use it for and then you<br>go you answered it so thank you very<br>much Thanks what's great did I<br>understand correctly though that robot<br>dancing isn't cool all right so I'm<br>going to change change my style up thing<br>I think next up we have many McIntyre<br>Wilson Mary is doing an MSc and the<br>Department of Biochemistry in Health<br>Sciences Division her thesis is on<br>investigating combination gene and drug<br>therapies is potential treatments for CL<br>insects patents disease and children met<br>Mary's supervisors our associate<br>professor stephanie hughes Mary give me<br>most of you here today will know about<br>neurodegeneration Alzheimer's<br>Parkinson's Huntington's all of these<br>awful diseases are examples of<br>accelerated brain cell death<br>aka neuro degeneration in adults some of<br>you may even have witnessed firsthand<br>that slow and terrible cognitive decline<br>in a loved one their loss of memories of<br>speech and motor skills of everything<br>that makes them then can you even<br>imagine being a parent and seeing those<br>same symptoms in your very young child<br>that's what's faced by parents of<br>children affected by a rare<br>neurodegenerative disorder called batten<br>disease<br>now batten disease isn't just one<br>disease it's many we know of 14 types<br>caused by mutations in different genes<br>and every one of them is a genetic death<br>sentence the molecular mechanisms behind<br>bedand disease are complicated but the<br>overarching concepts don't have to be in<br>a healthy person every cell in the human<br>body represents a balanced ecosystem a<br>tidy and functional student flat if you<br>will the flat mates in this metaphor are<br>proteins tiny molecules within the cell<br>that ensure day to day cellular<br>processes run smoothly in bed and<br>disease however the proteins encoded by<br>mutated CLN genes are the flatmates<br>assigned to taking out the trash and<br>recycling and frankly they're not<br>pulling their weight over time waste<br>builds up in the flat and it becomes an<br>unpleasant place to live eventually the<br>situation gets so bad that the flat is<br>condemned and the cell dies now if this<br>occurs in a normal body cell it's not<br>too problematic we've got plenty of<br>other cells to replace it but the<br>central nervous system is made up of<br>specialized cells called neurons which<br>are far harder to replace and this is<br>what causes that neuro degeneration my<br>lab is studying a particular type of bed<br>and disease called CL insects like all<br>forms of bed ins CL n6 bed disease has<br>no cure parents are told to take their<br>children home love them and let them die<br>but we need to be able to tell them<br>something better so I'm researching<br>two potential therapies for CL and sex<br>batten disease the first is gene therapy<br>where we essentially replace the mutated<br>gene within the neuron with a healthy<br>copy trading out that flat flat mate for<br>one who does their chores the second<br>involves repurposing drugs already used<br>on the market today to upregulate which<br>means to kickstart and motivate those<br>waste management and brick and recycling<br>pathways we hope to combine these<br>therapies to really boost brain<br>recycling and waste management power and<br>to provide hope for a long lasting and<br>comprehensive treatment for CL and six<br>band disease thank you<br>the I thought you did a lovely job of<br>showing us the importance and the<br>necessity of the research that was a<br>really big part of your presentation I<br>think which worked really well and also<br>the it was it's complicated obviously so<br>you used an analogy which I thought were<br>actually well and I loved how you came<br>back to it later on um when you you said<br>replaced the rubbish flatmate for a new<br>and I think that was a good tactic you<br>think he loved the analogy<br>go to eye contact with the audience I<br>also really enjoyed the slide so in the<br>way that they complemented what you were<br>talking about in terms of the two<br>treatments so you know well done<br>great presentation Thanks I really<br>enjoyed the way that you used motive<br>elements to embed the topic particularly<br>with a lay audience I I felt that you<br>actually tied what you're talking about<br>to the world outside of the lab which I<br>think for those of us who haven't worked<br>in laboratories we really appreciate<br>well done thank you<br>our next contestant it's also doing an<br>MSc from the department of zoology in<br>sciences division<br>megacity is looking at the effects of<br>seasonal water abstraction for<br>irrigation on ethnic benthic insects I<br>can't even read invertebrates of the<br>night I'm not gonna be able to say this<br>man your hairy Ghia you river system New<br>Zealand I need you around in my life<br>fantastic<br>please all give her a warm welcome in<br>this pan aroma of my field site in<br>Central Otago taken in March 2019 you<br>can see that more than 50% of the<br>naturalized flow is directed into an<br>irrigation canal which supports farms of<br>sheep cattle and fruit orchards of<br>export quality with the current permits<br>that the farmers have they're not even<br>restricted to take hundred percent of<br>that water downstream of that take the<br>width of the river the depth of the<br>river and the flow velocity are<br>considerably reduced leaving residents<br>of the river like the fish and<br>invertebrates to grab a width<br>fight for survival for the five month<br>irrigation period luckily for Manu her<br>Eagle River in 1991 the New Zealand<br>government passed the Resource<br>Management Act to comply with which<br>Otago Regional Council is monitoring<br>putting minimum flow limits on the<br>amount of water that can be abstracted<br>and renewing these age-old mining<br>permits that allow such exploitative<br>abstraction by 2021 so I in 2019 took my<br>net and my sampling equipment 2/3 of<br>such diversions of the 213 on manual<br>hairy gear River collected invertebrate<br>samples invertebrates are animals that<br>lack the<br>column for example snails insects earth<br>worms crustaceans I collected them from<br>downstream of the river and absolute<br>downstream of the take and upstream of<br>the take three times when the river was<br>at its lowest in March when the water<br>abstraction was stopped in me and in<br>June again I took this to my lab<br>identified and counted each one of them<br>calculated their abundances and<br>diversity richness and related them to<br>flow parameters preliminary results show<br>that throughout the three samplings the<br>abundance was lower in was lower in the<br>downstream of the take invertebrates<br>reflect the health of the ecosystem<br>aquatic ecosystem and are the food<br>source for the fish game fish for<br>example trout and youth and is also and<br>also native galaxies what my results<br>cannot do is solve the problem of water<br>extra a water abstraction or minimum<br>flow setting but it's like it's giving a<br>scientific foundation to the<br>policymakers to do the same<br>just like with any world problem any<br>world issue like poverty or terrorism<br>it's the joint effort of the scientific<br>community the stakeholders like the<br>Otago Regional Council and govern the<br>stakeholders like farmers governing body<br>like the Otago each new council to come<br>together to sustainably judiciously<br>preserve our freshwater resources thank<br>you<br>got a wonderful level of enthusiasm for<br>your topic I really could tell that<br>you're really passionate about this and<br>passionate about making a difference I<br>also really enjoyed that you outlined<br>how important your topic is very very<br>early in the presentation so we were<br>really clear what it was you're going to<br>talk about and why we needed to hear<br>about it yeah I would certainly concur<br>with the passion and animation that you<br>showed for that with the topic was<br>definitely infectious and I got<br>particularly engaged when you spoke<br>about the importance of the<br>invertebrates to the ecosystem and if I<br>was going to give you some advice I<br>would consider bringing that earlier in<br>the presentation and that might have<br>like got me going a bit sooner as well<br>thank you yeah great passion I thought<br>it was good background to the problem<br>and your methods were really well<br>described and to hear those results too<br>and the impacts that sort of just drew<br>it all together and great interaction<br>with the slide to you thank you thank<br>you very much I have a kitten at home<br>and he keeps bringing inadvertent<br>breaths it'll be quite good to get some<br>testing and actually some elimination I<br>think from his coach there's quite a lot<br>of slugs ladybirds and various other<br>disgusting creatures stuck to him at the<br>moment the next person that we have up<br>is Rebecca Rebecca Kennedy Perkins her<br>supervisor is Sofie bond and today she's<br>talking about greenhouse gas emissions<br>and agriculture should we give a cow<br>I'll head off and you can give me the<br>nod for when you already not the nod all<br>Tara has a very unique emissions profile<br>methane accounts for over 42% of ghost<br>missions and the majority of these come<br>from agriculture yet there is a lack of<br>any real practice able and workable<br>strategies towards the reduction of this<br>gas this book<br>comes important when considering that of<br>the three main greenhouse gases methane<br>is the second most potent behind that of<br>nitrous oxide therefore through my<br>research I intend to work<br>collaboratively with farmers in order to<br>produce these sorts of strategies to<br>reduce greenhouse gas emissions in<br>agriculture now when I talk about the<br>global warming now when I talk about<br>potency I'm talking about the global<br>warming potential held by each gas so<br>this is the amount took this is the term<br>given to the amount of warming a gas has<br>over a certain period of time in<br>comparison to that of carbon dioxide so<br>the global warming potential of carbon<br>dioxide is one and the global warming<br>potential of methane is 28 to 36 times<br>that of carbon dioxide and this global<br>warming potential is why we should give<br>a cow about greenhouse gas emissions in<br>agriculture the smoke out this is an<br>intractable problem in part caused by<br>the dominant discourses surrounding a<br>very mental management and agriculture<br>and the importance of safeguarding our<br>economy last year agriculture<br>contributed over 42 billion dollars in<br>export revenue and supplied over 350,000<br>jobs to a litera<br>so change them the sector presents a<br>very real possibility of harming our<br>economy but this is not just an economic<br>dilemma this is a dilemma centered upon<br>livelihoods<br>there's our farmers who will be<br>negatively affected by changes within<br>the sector and not long ago farmers were<br>seen as our national heroes an<br>intensification was encouraged yet we're<br>seeing the increasing vilification of<br>farmers and then being heralded as the<br>Destroyers of our natural environment<br>but farmers need to be mobilized in this<br>mobilization is going to occur at the<br>grassroots level farmers influencing<br>farmers and farmers supporting farmers<br>and I am NOT saying that government<br>intervention is not necessary nor that<br>it will not be accepted but it must be<br>understood that this is their land and<br>farmers know their land this is why I<br>have begun my Master's research and I<br>soon begin working collaboratively with<br>farmers in order to produce these<br>strategies of reduction of greenhouse<br>gas emissions in agriculture however<br>using the qualitative method methodology<br>of the co production of knowledge which<br>instead of extracting information from<br>participants you co produce knowledge<br>and work with participants no matter how<br>small we may be as a nation this is no<br>excuse for inaction and no one group can<br>be persecuted because the burden is<br>deemed to fall within their sector thank<br>you thank you very much Rebecca I love<br>part of the graphic there very<br>interesting it was quite a busy slide<br>but you know I love the graphic honor<br>I enjoyed how you clearly outlined the<br>importance of the problem it really took<br>us to the crack server in the methane<br>and the impact on you know greenhouse<br>gases and the role of agriculture so I<br>think I was left wanting to know more<br>and these presentations they thank you<br>thanks thanks Rebecca I felt really<br>really clear empathy from you for people<br>who have livelihoods that are tied up<br>with such a complex issue and I came<br>away with a real sense of positivity<br>from your presentation so really I do<br>applaud there and it's someone who who<br>really likes the treatment of of<br>participants and researchers Co<br>researchers or Co participants I loved<br>you methodology - thank you yeah I'd<br>absolutely agree with that point I<br>I enjoyed that you opened up with giving<br>us a picture of a complex real world<br>that you were going to try and tackle<br>again I would like to know more about<br>what the research was actually going to<br>evolve thank you<br>wow what an impressive group of students<br>doing fantastic research and getting up<br>and communicating it so clearly please<br>okay so that concludes the masters<br>presentations going to send the judges<br>off to do some deliberating watching you<br>don't take any bribes Lisa you can<br>invest afterwards but no bribes right<br>now we'll send them off and then we can<br>have a break and talk amongst yourselves<br>start thinking about that People's<br>whoa okay everyone you all sorted judges<br>judges are sorted contestants are you<br>all sorted<br>hey you got some of them wandering<br>around all righty<br>okay I think we're all sorted then<br>you're in so you sorted excellent okay<br>well let's continue on to the doctoral<br>candidates in we have seven doctoral<br>candidates in the section I think from<br>memory 11 minus 4 is 7 if my maths<br>serves me correct the first up we have<br>Casey Casey Casey well whatever you want<br>really still yeah Naru I think I've got<br>that wrong too Casey is from the<br>Department of Pathology<br>and biomedical science and Health<br>Sciences Division her supervisors are<br>dr. Logan Walker associate professor<br>John Pearson in venice' letter more and<br>she'll be talking about unraveling the<br>genetic variance underlying inherent<br>'red endometrial cancer risk Oh<br>which over this way and you give me I<br>can't wait destiny a word that brings to<br>mind fortune tellers crystal balls and<br>one that's often dismissed for a lack of<br>scientific validation but I believe that<br>destiny is rooted in science some people<br>are destined to be tall others to be<br>short<br>these things aren't mystical it's<br>encoded in our DNA we each carry two<br>copies of every gene one from our mum<br>the other from our dad however sometimes<br>we inherit too many or not enough copies<br>of these genes and we call these copy<br>number variations and some of these can<br>play a big part in designing your<br>genetic destiny so my question is how<br>can I Han<br>the power of a genetic destiny to help<br>combat cancer or more specifically how<br>can I help the 380,000 women worldwide<br>who are expected to develop endometrial<br>cancer each and every year endometrial<br>cancer occurs in the lining of a woman's<br>uterus and some women are born with a<br>genetic predisposition to developing the<br>disease for women carrying this risk<br>it's like walking around the top of a<br>cliff blindfolded the longer they remain<br>unaware of this risk and keep on walking<br>the far more likely they are to stumble<br>off but if we know the genetic change is<br>responsible we can start to map their<br>path and work towards disappearing them<br>away from that cliff edge with<br>prevention strategies we have access to<br>genetic data from over 20,000 women from<br>all around the world making this the<br>largest study of its kind ever conducted<br>and these women formed two groups those<br>that have developed endometrial cancer<br>and those that haven't and using this<br>data we compare the two groups by asking<br>the same single question billions of<br>times which bits of DNA are unique to<br>the women who have developed endometrial<br>cancer now the final output ends up<br>looking a lot like a Manhattan skyline<br>there's a lot of buildings a lot of<br>information but we're after those Empire<br>State buildings these are our genetic<br>crystal balls these pointers to<br>locations where those copy number<br>variants I spoke about earlier occur<br>more commonly among the women who have<br>developed cancer<br>we now have genetic landmarks that allow<br>us to zoom in and start asking why why<br>do copy number variants in these genes<br>predispose a woman to developing cancer<br>what is it about them that steers her<br>towards that cliff my hope is that we<br>stop waiting for women to stumble off<br>the cliff before stepping in to help I<br>think that we can and we should do<br>better if we understand the genetics<br>underlying endometrial cancer risk we<br>can take off those blindfolds and start<br>putting safety barriers up for those<br>women that need it thank you<br>lovely storytelling thank you very much<br>I loved how you started with that kind<br>of a magical Wonderland to get us hooked<br>in and you also obviously we're talking<br>about genetics which is not a very<br>visual subject but you used imagery<br>really strongly throughout that whole<br>presentation thanks very much thanks<br>Casey great storytelling there you<br>hooked us in nicely and I really love<br>the slide and how that linked to your<br>talk I thought it was really well placed<br>in great body language Thanks thanks<br>Casey I thought you were a really good<br>example of someone focusing on promise<br>in potential instead of negativity in a<br>really serious subject so I felt that<br>your enthusiasm was really catching and<br>that yes we can do what you see if we<br>can thank you thank you very much next<br>up we have sherry McConville now sherry<br>it's sherry the first professional<br>doctorates to come to a final the three<br>minute thesis yeah so that's that's<br>awesome so for those of you who don't<br>know the vast majority of doctoral<br>students at the University of PhD<br>students but we also have professional<br>doctoral students as well and so it's<br>fantastic to have one of those here with<br>us today sherry is talking about no one<br>left behind adventure for everyone she<br>is doing a doctor of Business<br>Administration I'm going to lurch this<br>way past you you took me the wink I'll<br>give the other wink okay give me the<br>wink<br>okay ladies and gentlemen in the words<br>of Martin Luther King I have a dream a<br>dream to create an adventure hub right<br>here in the heart of Dunedin an<br>adventure hub for people of all<br>abilities spread over acres of natural<br>bush containing things like a mudslide<br>zipline obstacle course and many of the<br>other things that you can see up here in<br>the<br>picture that the concept be based on<br>three key principles environmental<br>conservation or even regeneration health<br>and well-being because it's about<br>getting people like you out and active<br>in the great outdoors but most<br>importantly this is about social equity<br>this is about creating a space for<br>everybody no matter their physical<br>ability no matter their age and stage in<br>life no matter their level of income but<br>this is just my big hairy audacious goal<br>based on the inequality and the<br>inaccessibility that I see some people<br>experiencing plus I didn't know if this<br>is the type of adventure that our<br>community would want the purpose of my<br>research was to therefore find out and<br>to answer the question how can we<br>develop a sustainable adventure hub in<br>Dunedin for people of all abilities<br>there were three phases to the research<br>in the first I interviewed Dunedin<br>residents to find out what adventure<br>means for them and I showed them a<br>prototype they feedback and that led to<br>the development of the second prototype<br>here next I looked at successful<br>adventure businesses up and down the<br>country and also internationally I<br>interviewed observed and participated to<br>understand their key success factors and<br>then thirdly I interviewed key<br>stakeholders to see how we could<br>collaborate to make this thing happen<br>using themes as the basis of analysis<br>what I found was that those key<br>stakeholders are interested in helping<br>that that the best business model for us<br>in Dunedin is a community owned asset<br>rather than a for-profit enterprise and<br>that not only our Dunedin residents<br>excited about this idea they have a<br>thirst for adventure and no matter what<br>their ability but there are barriers<br>such as time-cost in physical access so<br>I have a dream a dream to create an<br>adventure hub right here in the heart of<br>Dunedin for people of all abilities<br>whether they're in a wheelchair or an<br>Olympic level athlete so that no one is<br>left behind to get into trouble with<br>clear by saying isn't she wonderful<br>she's from commerce would you like to<br>invest one thing I will say is watching<br>your presentation that you're a great<br>salesperson you sold the room on your<br>vision and you sold the room on your<br>catchphrase around that dream so I'm<br>looking forward to seeing that dream<br>come to fruition Thank You Sheree yep<br>great engaging start you drew us in<br>quite a lot of background but then you<br>got to actually what you were doing and<br>and I love that it's crafting of the<br>story - we again to return to the dream<br>at the end so thanks yeah I agree the<br>nice little symmetry in your<br>presentation therefore you started with<br>the dream and ended with the dream and<br>then you listed your three factors<br>somewhere in the kind of middle<br>beginning and the third factor seemed<br>really key to me and I wondered if you<br>wanted to bring that up higher and bring<br>it up earlier that might help a little<br>Thank You Sheree great presentation I'm<br>not sold on the zip lining though I<br>think me and as applying some serious<br>issues are going to occur but could be<br>funny to watch I guess next up we have<br>Jason wah he is from the department of<br>surgical Sciences and his supervisors<br>are professor hex B Abbott professor<br>Paul Hanson and Andrew bricks and his<br>presentation tonight is on aligning<br>recommended knee osteoarthritis<br>inventions with what people want<br>fantastic welcome move over here and<br>first-line interventions for managing<br>osteoarthritis such as self-management<br>in education programs and exercise<br>programs are consistently recommended<br>across clinical practice guidelines for<br>managing osteoarthritis yet these<br>interventions are not routinely<br>practiced or systematically delivered<br>across the health system rather has seen<br>center-left of slide second line<br>interventions namely drug therapies and<br>third line interventions joint<br>replacement received far more attention<br>and practice this imbalance could be<br>caused by what these stakeholders are<br>thinking when they're choosing or<br>recommending or stars rightist<br>interventions aligning what people want<br>with what is recommended for managing<br>osteoarthritis could help close this<br>evidence practice gap my research has<br>focused on what drives the choice of<br>osteoarthritis interventions and which<br>interventions people want based on these<br>drivers how about done this in the first<br>phase of my thesis I used qualitative<br>methods and identified eight attributes<br>of interventions that stakeholders<br>consider when choosing or recommending<br>or steroids interventions this<br>information informed the second phase of<br>my research where I measured the<br>importance of those eight attributes by<br>asking the same stakeholders across the<br>health system to make trade-offs between<br>the attributes<br>the results as seen on the top of right<br>of the slide show that the further away<br>the solid black line is from the center<br>of the spiderweb the more stakeholders<br>valued those attributes importantly what<br>I found was that stakeholder preferences<br>did not differ by group and so this<br>means will suggest that stakeholder<br>preferences are not a barrier to<br>choosing or recommending interventions<br>across the health system finally in the<br>third phase of my research I prioritized<br>osteoarthritis interventions first I<br>rated the performance of interventions<br>on the attributes and then second I<br>measured the amount of alignment or<br>overlap between intervention performance<br>and stakeholder preferences the more<br>overlap the higher they were prioritized<br>the results on the bottom right of the<br>slide tell us that stakeholders want<br>exercise programs first-line therapy<br>drug therapies second-line intervention<br>sorry and self-management and education<br>programs first-line intervention and<br>total joint replacement third line<br>intervention so what does this mean well<br>this tells us that not all recommended<br>interventions for managing<br>osteoarthritis align with what people<br>want ultimately this information helps<br>us to understand what drives the choice<br>of osteoarthritis interventions and can<br>help inform health policymakers about<br>which interventions to offer across the<br>news or in public health system thank<br>you<br>thanks very much I enjoyed your body<br>language your presentation style was was<br>really nice and the way you explained<br>the research I was I was very interested<br>with your methodology the only thing I<br>would say is that the use of jargon was<br>a little bit distanced me somewhat from<br>other content of what you were saying<br>thanks Jason I thought you we got a<br>really nice full story of your research<br>in terms of the background and what you<br>did and through to the results I loved<br>some of the graphics on your slide quite<br>busy though but some excellent graphics<br>here to make those points thinking Jason<br>I thought you had a really clever title<br>you combined the practitioner<br>perspective and the patient perspective<br>really well there so we knew exactly<br>what it was you were going to talk about<br>and what you were trying to do also I<br>thought you're a very calm presence<br>there's no evidence whatsoever that you<br>thank you very much Nick stuff despite<br>what the slide says we have Jeff Doherty<br>which was also easier to say so I was<br>happy about that<br>Jeff is a PhD candidate in the<br>Department of Zoology and he is talking<br>about the suicidal cricket and the hare<br>worm over to you when you already judges<br>and audience members I'd like all of you<br>to pretend that you're a cricket<br>now as a cricket he read many things<br>including dead insects they must be good<br>for you right well unfortunately if you<br>are a cricket maybe not because that<br>dead insect you just ate contained a<br>tiny dormant hare worm which is part of<br>a very specialized group of parasites<br>now that harem is inside you and it has<br>woken up during the next couple of<br>months it consumes your body fluids and<br>grows inside you until it matures and is<br>ready to mate however the hare worm can<br>only mate in water which is a problem<br>because it's stuck inside you a<br>land-loving insect the harem does have a<br>solution to this though and it kind of<br>sounds like a theme picked out of a<br>science fiction novel it uses mind<br>control somehow the hair worm hijacks<br>your tiny cricket brain and as a result<br>you start walking around aimlessly like<br>a zombie which brings you sooner or<br>later into a puddle of water where you<br>drown low and behold the harem that had<br>spent several weeks inside you then<br>coils out your back end and swims away<br>leaving behind your floating corpse<br>without even a second thought now I know<br>that this sad story sounds unbelievable<br>but the changes in your behavior caused<br>by the hair worm that brought you into<br>water are one of the most well known<br>examples of what researchers call<br>parasite manipulation but despite its<br>notoriety little research has been done<br>on this fascinating phenomenon and we<br>don't really know how hair worms do it<br>and that's why I'm focusing my research<br>I want to understand how harems interact<br>with their insect hosts and drive them<br>into water<br>in order to accomplish this I'm<br>currently replicating the hair worms<br>complex life cycle in the laboratory in<br>order to infect different insect species<br>and study their behaviors under<br>controlled experiments as the hair worm<br>grows and matures inside them and by<br>using powerful analytical tools we will<br>attempt to identify the biochemical<br>pathways manipulated by the hair worm<br>that are ultimately responsible for your<br>demise as a cricket this could open new<br>doors for studies on parasites that<br>manipulate animal behavior which<br>includes human behavior by the way but<br>if we discover how hair worms really<br>cause the suicidal behaviors in their<br>hosts perhaps that they secrete a deadly<br>cocktail of zombified molecules my<br>project may provide new insight on some<br>of the fundamental aspects of behavior<br>itself which to this day remain largely<br>a mystery thank you<br>thanks chief that was scarily disturbing<br>and quite gruesome and I'm going to be<br>thinking about it for a long time I<br>definitely wanted to know more and I<br>absolutely loved your slide thank you<br>there was a fantastic explanation for<br>the layperson it was really nice and<br>sharp and concise and as Rachel said I<br>never thought I would say this but I<br>actually want to know more about here<br>wounds now yes for a lay audience is<br>definitely very engaging and very kind<br>of lured and frightening story so yeah<br>thanks for that<br>and I absolutely want to know more and I<br>thought that it was good that you<br>touched on a bigger picture um you know<br>how do what how does it influence how as<br>our behavior influenced was a really<br>interesting thing to bring in towards<br>I think I simultaneously want to know<br>more and don't want to know more you<br>know one thing I do know is I'm never<br>going to eat anything made out of<br>cricket flour though that I'm sure of it<br>was brilliant thank you very much next<br>up we have Curran Rawat and Karuna is<br>doing a PhD in tourism and is looking at<br>emotions experienced by high altitude<br>altitude mountain guides who guide above<br>the deaths zone<br>excellent take it away when you are<br>ready for a moment visualize yourself<br>inside this picture standing in that<br>queue and now think if your occupation<br>was to work in an altitude above 8,000<br>meters where less than 40 percent of<br>oxygen is present than sea level<br>temperature declines below 40 degree and<br>Colvin's exceeds up to 60 kilometre per<br>hour<br>due to these conditions science called<br>this phrase of altitude as Death Zone<br>because it is not suitable for human<br>survival but ladies and gentlemen there<br>is one group of occupations<br>uniquely known as high-altitude mountain<br>guides who works at this range of<br>altitude not only at this they live in a<br>small tent over a period of months with<br>less food and sleep in the meantime they<br>have to maintain the safety margin of<br>the clients from rapidly changing<br>high-altitude weather conditions staying<br>focused under those circumstances and<br>still being responsible to lead the<br>expedition successfully and safely it<br>must be very stressful situation for<br>them which is the reason why I wanted to<br>understand the emotion experienced by<br>these guys and how do they manage them<br>seven females and 13 males were<br>interviewed from 10 different<br>nationalities so what I found was<br>despite these odd working conditions<br>interestingly overall the experience<br>positive emotions such as joy while they<br>also experienced negative emotions such<br>as fear sadness and anger but they<br>managed that what strike me then was<br>under those kind of dangerous situation<br>and stressful circumstances<br>how do they manage the negative I mean<br>emotion and still have positive<br>experiences because there's more to<br>learn from their strategy that can be<br>applied into our daily lives because as<br>now and then we all go through some sort<br>of stressful situations so here's how do<br>they do that before every expedition the<br>plan of the road<br>let's say they wrote is Therese from<br>point A to point B first they anticipate<br>what could go wrong in this road this<br>thoughtful process helps them to<br>identify worst-case scenarios that<br>involve significant risk then they work<br>backwards from B to a in order to avoid<br>the decisions mistake another other<br>controllable factors that help to create<br>those scenarios and they come out with<br>the condition C plan to deal with it so<br>while they're in the mountain if<br>something goes wrong they're mentally<br>prepared with the contingency plan to<br>deal with the eventualities this way<br>they manage the negative emotion without<br>getting influenced by it and change<br>their des own experience into Happy's<br>own experiences to be honest I applied<br>this strategy to manage my fear by<br>anticipating that I'm presenting in<br>front of this crowd very earlier if this<br>strategy works for me what so the guys<br>the possibilities that it will work for<br>you try considering it so what my<br>research brings into this understanding<br>is their how an individual can manage to<br>stay calm under stream Li stressful<br>situation and still perform up to the<br>standards or perhaps even better thank<br>you<br>I've been fortunate enough to be first<br>for the second commerce presenter thank<br>you nicely clear it's a really unique<br>topic and I thought you gave a really<br>interesting description of I guess what<br>would call reverse cognitive processing<br>and you said you use this process<br>yourself well it paid off because you<br>were really confident in your<br>presentation yes thanks Karen<br>I thought it was great sitting of the<br>scene and it was really helped by the<br>slide you went through your methods and<br>your results I really enjoyed the<br>feedback about emotions that they were<br>experiencing and importantly the<br>application to clear beginning middle<br>and end and you just as we were getting<br>to ask the question what could we do<br>with this research you answered it very<br>well so thanks for that thank you thank<br>you very much<br>right next up we have Laura scalper out<br>she is from the Department of Sociology<br>gender studies in criminology in the<br>humanities division and she is doing her<br>PhD there her topic for tonight is<br>practicing gender equality church-going<br>couples experiences of egalitarianism<br>and tools for counter-culture<br>living please welcome Laura imagine that<br>walking down this path is a couple named<br>Tom and Susan they're committed to<br>gender equality in their partnership and<br>I'm interested in the role Tom plays in<br>this Tom and Susan represent the couples<br>I interviewed for my study they're<br>churchgoers which can sometimes make<br>their commitment to equality seem<br>countercultural this is because<br>Christian culture has a patriarchal<br>history often marked by gender defined<br>responsibilities for this sociological<br>study I recruited couples who identify<br>as egalitarian which is the position<br>that men and women are of equal<br>intrinsic value before God there are no<br>gender defined responsibilities as to<br>what each can fulfill but I come back to<br>Tom because I'm interested in the role<br>men play in establishing equal<br>partnerships with women within<br>literature there's a pattern that shows<br>that in heterosexual relationships it is<br>the man who plays an essential role in<br>initiating and implementing equality and<br>what I've discovered is that for<br>participants like Tom their religious<br>beliefs actually helped them be<br>countercultural and enhance their<br>commitment to equality so what does<br>egalitarian masculinity look like well<br>based off my male participants number<br>one they're not attached to the idea of<br>being masculine or<br>and Men and instead opted for kind of<br>gender-blind<br>attitude number two they consider it<br>important to give away power and be<br>sacrificial this is often informed by<br>their Christian spirituality which<br>focuses on escalating the needs of<br>others above their own number three they<br>consider the mental load of the<br>household like Tom who knows what chores<br>need to be done what groceries need to<br>be bought he doesn't need Susan to tell<br>him what to do in fact the idea of being<br>labeled a helping husband makes him<br>cringe and lastly number four the male<br>participants are either Pro feminists or<br>identify as feminists having taken the<br>time to deconstruct loaded terms like<br>feminism as I continue to study my<br>couples words from poet Edwina Gately<br>come to mind<br>there was no path so I trod one my<br>couples tread they take deliberate steps<br>to enact their beliefs about gender<br>egalitarianism both men and women and<br>for anyone desiring equal partnerships<br>religious or non-religious I think<br>taking the time to learn conceptual and<br>practical tools of how to do that is<br>valuable and I can't help but notice a<br>sense of freedom these couples enjoy<br>empowered to be themselves outside of<br>gendered expectations and so like then<br>do we have what it takes to tread thank<br>you<br>thanks very much that was a really<br>engaging presentation I thought it was<br>interesting how you you married the two<br>ideas of the the Christianity and the<br>gender equality wasn't really something<br>that I thought about before and also<br>enjoyed how you you finished with that<br>question you threw it back at us thank<br>you<br>thank you Laura a really excellent<br>presentation I like the way you describe<br>the problem and quite later and so for<br>some of us seeing that title it would<br>have been like what is this going to be<br>about but you broke it down really<br>nicely and I thought the slide was an<br>excellent complement to it as well so I<br>was actually wrapped all the way through<br>thank you you're really lovely presenter<br>and that you don't rush you're very<br>clear easy to follow and you've got a<br>really nice technique that you've used<br>there of taking a memorable piece from a<br>poem and using it to help us cement some<br>meaning around what it is that you're<br>thank you very much Laura I felt sure<br>that egalitarian masculinity was going<br>to have something to do with those<br>skinny jeans that we all know Lisa likes<br>I was wrong but nevertheless interested<br>thank you very much for a great<br>presentation lucky last<br>our final doctoral presenter is Victoria<br>Purdy Victoria is from the department of<br>food science and doing her doctorate<br>there she is going to be talking to us<br>about fingerprinting New Zealand hops<br>all this is going to be up our Rachel's<br>le she likes a tipple can we expand the<br>New Zealand hops industry give a warm<br>welcome to Victoria New Zealand often<br>gets left off the world map some New<br>Zealand knowledge you can add to your<br>basket today is that New Zealand has<br>more breweries per capita than the US UK<br>and Australia there has been a 64%<br>increase in breweries over the last five<br>years with an increase in breweries and<br>beer festivals there is no hiding that<br>craft beer is a massive trend at moment<br>these craft beers a pecked full of<br>flavor but what is causing this flavor<br>it is a combination between the malt<br>yeast and most importantly hops hops are<br>flour produced by the humorless lupulus<br>plant they have been known for decades<br>to produce the bitterness and the beer<br>in the science behind this has been well<br>studied what has had less study is the<br>aroma compounds now this is what gives<br>the beer those interesting flavors<br>bringing this back to New Zealand our<br>current hot breeding program can take up<br>to 10 years to produce a new hot variety<br>although the lately time we have been<br>able to produce some very uniquely<br>flavored hops that are highly sought<br>after<br>however we produce Lee<br>than 1% of the world's hops that's where<br>I come in I was fortunate enough to<br>collect my own samples from the Tasman<br>region where majority of New Zealand<br>hops are grown using these samples I<br>apply a fingerprinting approach to<br>detect as many aroma compounds as<br>possible just like the human fingerprint<br>I am a date I am able to identify the<br>hops and how they are unique from one<br>another so what does all of this mean<br>once I have pieced together all of the<br>fingerprinting information I can mean<br>share this with the hot growers so they<br>can better understand what their hops<br>are made of this information can also be<br>used by the hot breeders to help them<br>produce even more uniquely flavored hops<br>and hopefully decrease the amount of<br>time it takes to produce those new hop<br>varieties if we can scientifically prove<br>that New Zealand is a fantastic place to<br>breed and grow hops we will be able to<br>expand the industry hugely and create a<br>thanks Victoria now as a geographer I am<br>but concerned about initially New<br>Zealand being leaf documenting the blob<br>that is New Zealand on your mat surely<br>there's a climatic effect in their night<br>seriously great presentation excellent<br>body language you took quite a long time<br>to get around the background I wanted to<br>know but more about the actual<br>fingerprinting but this is always good<br>to leave us wanting to know more Thanks<br>thanks Victoria I really enjoyed the New<br>Zealand context and here who knew that<br>we had more breweries than all of those<br>other places I really thought it was<br>important that you gave us the practical<br>implications of your work so you didn't<br>just show us the scientific side you<br>showed us how perhaps we can make the<br>hop industry more economically viable<br>and New Zealand well done thank you yeah<br>I enjoyed your presentation style and<br>the real-world implications came across<br>really well thank you thank you<br>well I think you'll all agree that when<br>I said that the state of graduate<br>research was in good hands the<br>University of Otago right at the<br>beginning I was right as I like to say<br>in my house I'm always right<br>thus I was particularly right about so<br>what we'll have next at the judges<br>deliberation but before we do that I<br>just want everyone to join together one<br>more time to give everyone a<br>truly impressive and yep oh I tell white<br>Robin can't you wait good lord<br>I don't know these PVCs it's outrageous<br>all right we'll get to that so the<br>judges are going to go off and do their<br>deliberation<br>Robin is champing at the bit there so<br>we'll get on with the voting for the<br>People's Choice the research graduate<br>research ambassadors who are at the back<br>are going to come and collect your<br>voting documents and then they will tell<br>you them up you can't bribe them only<br>her but she's going to go off to do the<br>deliberation and we will be back shortly<br>to find out the winners of tonight's<br>events<br>yura I know you're all waiting with<br>bated breath with us firstly because I<br>know she won't think herself but if you<br>could just join up we have clear back<br>every year for a reason she makes a<br>terrific emcee so if you're just joining<br>us me in thanking Claire for her well I<br>think the standard just keeps getting<br>better each year and as judges we found<br>a you know really tough to separate out<br>some of the contestants I think you're<br>all fantastic nobody got lost in the<br>presentation I think that's probably the<br>first year we've had nobody sort of trip<br>up or have a mess of paws so I think you<br>all did a terrific job on those<br>presentations loved hearing about the<br>research it was fantastic okay without<br>further ado we are going to get unto the<br>awards so the winner and actually if<br>Drew is here some are you Soviets Drew's<br>gonna give the one of the certificate in<br>the envelope so the winner of the<br>Masters section of the 2019 University<br>of Otago three-minute thesis<br>grand final they get a research award of<br>$500 from the Graduate research school<br>and courtesy of hollow world Dunedin a<br>travel voucher to the value of $250 so<br>the Masters winner this year is Jonah<br>Belk<br>the winner of the doctor'll section of<br>the 2019 university of otago three<br>minute thesis grand final receives a<br>research award of 750 dollars from the<br>Graduate research school and courtesy of<br>how I will Dunedin air travel to the<br>Brisbane competition for the<br>asia-pacific 3mt<br>final at the University of Queensland<br>the doctoral winner is Cassie styling<br>the People's Choice winner receives a<br>$250 research award funded jointly by<br>the Graduate research school and<br>courtesy of hello world Dunedin they get<br>a travel suitcase the People's Choice is<br>gfd<br>Thank You Rachel<br>well done to the winners and well done<br>to everyone it has really been a very<br>successful evening and the research is<br>impressive and you've all done very well<br>it takes a lot to coordinate a 3mt and<br>there are a number of people to think<br>firstly I'd like to thank teams of in<br>events in marketing and also in GRS for<br>their hard work in organizing the three<br>MT contest particular thanks ode to<br>Andrew Loney<br>well done for going and seeing all the<br>the heats and judging those in yeah and<br>doing a lot of organization awesome in<br>things particularly to to just
