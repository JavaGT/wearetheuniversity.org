welcome back to my second<br>vlog in my vlog series these two little<br>vlogs that are coming atcha are from my<br>travels to the UK recently gonna do two<br>different vlogs because I the photos was<br>just too long to make it into one the<br>first one you're gonna see me in<br>Winchester and Edinburgh they're pretty<br>cool I'm fun fact for all of you<br>students out there they're wanting to<br>travel you can go to Easter travel and<br>you can buy this little this little<br>thing this is my one and aiesec card see<br>so what they can do is you can actually<br>lay by flights so all you have to do is<br>put down $100 deposit on some flights<br>and then you pay them off just eight<br>weeks before you leave which is a great<br>great thing if you are a poor shooter so<br>that's just how I manage to travel so<br>yeah but I hope you enjoy these little<br>vlogs there's a lot of me talking in it<br>so hopefully don't get sick of that yeah<br>sup guys welcome to there you okay we<br>arrived very late last night we got in<br>at like 11 p.m.<br>yeah UK time yeah rough time getting<br>over here but that's fine were here<br>we're here we're here we're here we're<br>about to get out today into Winchester<br>which is we were actually staying at the<br>moment with comments lovely family our<br>boa this is comer hello welcome welcome<br>I use the skin I'll put her Instagram<br>details below to--if you want to follow<br>her she's gorgeous so good doing so yeah<br>I might show you a little bit of<br>winchester today hey tame so today<br>our adventure was going down to the<br>Winchester city center and we when I saw<br>some cool old buildings the Cathedral<br>actually was really interesting it's one<br>of the oldest cathedrals in the country<br>and we went and saw it I didn't take any<br>footage of it but I might take some<br>another time that's what we did everyone<br>got some mean-ass food and now yeah<br>shooting this fan tip when you're<br>traveling always put your shooting<br>discount<br>we have shouldn't idea because you'll be<br>surprised at Malachi says you can get<br>some discount there so yeah do that at<br>the moment we're just walking the<br>Dougie's and we're walking in out in the<br>fields we're staying over there yeah<br>they're out there you can't really can't<br>really see them yeah you might be able<br>to see them on the grass a little bit<br>but not really but yeah that's all we've<br>done today<br>jet lag is real today not so much this<br>morning about this afternoon we did have<br>a gin and tonic and I don't think that<br>helped<br>so if you do like that trying to avoid<br>alcohol because it fails spiking yeah if<br>you do they try and avoid alcohol<br>because make sure you just want to go to<br>sleep<br>yeah I might better see the dogs now any<br>hey hey yeah so we had lunch at a place<br>called zzs today it's a really beautiful<br>Italian restaurant and when she said in<br>the city center on High Street it was<br>really good actually they had lots of<br>vegan options too which is great for me<br>but some delicious normal people food<br>coma so they're good as well so yeah<br>that was delicious<br>at lunchtime we have found it kind of<br>hard to eat food today just because I<br>think our body clocks are just<br>completely out yeah it's so far so good<br>really good day really interesting<br>seeing old buildings but we actually<br>even went into the corruption of there<br>what's it called the Cathedral today<br>that was quite eerie like you're in<br>King's Landing<br>and that metaphor<br>that's how it feels it's very charming<br>little town city yeah it's very<br>picturesque but yeah it's only the very<br>beginning about Vinci look at little<br>doggies behind me yeah yeah so far so<br>good<br>hopefully delaying is also tomorrow<br>I mean currently at the king's house and<br>Winchester no they're okay King does not<br>get any more so then when she seems to<br>be the capital of the United Kingdom and<br>all of England I should say and then<br>King Henry came along a and made enter<br>London because he didn't want to live<br>here but look at this it was crazy<br>so this is actually just Queen to me to<br>Tim Alfred yeah so there was a statue<br>there's a statue in the actual town just<br>down the road and it's off King Alfred<br>and very funny because it was first put<br>up the first one yeah the first I was<br>put up and he didn't like it because the<br>face was too ugly and so what he told<br>that maker to do but artists whoever did<br>it was to take it down and put a<br>different person's face on it that he<br>liked and they named it after himself<br>which we thought was quite but yeah we<br>went and saw her he's soaking up what is<br>known as King Arthur and this and when<br>Chester is what they think was Camelot<br>if it was real so King was a King Henry<br>that found the table the knights of the<br>round table actual table was found here<br>and it's up in the gray porch we just<br>went and saw over there which especially<br>really cold but yeah stunning so far<br>guys also quick side note we've only<br>spent two and a half pounds today<br>because the<br>thing about going and looking at all of<br>these beautiful things yeah<br>is that most of them are free like<br>walking around this place completely<br>free<br>no idiot oh yeah and we've been to<br>I completely<br>it was very overwhelming so that's why<br>because<br>yeah a lot of people and a lot of things<br>to look at you know you kind of just<br>and then we caught the trainees we have<br>to<br>which is weird<br>Michaela<br>from not from she stayed with zags<br>lifted from<br>and then now we're just on the train to<br>get a bra<br>so hopefully we get start to meet them<br>which we should be able to yeah<br>hey guys we just made it to our in Umbra<br>hostel actually really nice<br>this is for you<br>those are people's back gardens and that<br>down there is like a little um place<br>where you can sit and have a cup of tea<br>but this is called the whist in hostel<br>it's on the West End of Edinburgh<br>surprise surprise and it's costing us 40<br>pounds for three nights so it's actually<br>really really good good value and its<br>really nice yeah I mean Mickey's here<br>tom is here and we were just about to go<br>out and explore a bit of the shopping<br>and Edinburgh I'll try a vlog a little<br>bit if there's anything really<br>interesting but otherwise I'll probably<br>just be trying to soak it in<br>and then I'll show you guys like the<br>castle and stuff which you're gonna go<br>do tomorrow but yeah go ahead safely the<br>train ride was awesome I did flog a<br>little bit of that so you would have<br>seen a bit but yeah see
