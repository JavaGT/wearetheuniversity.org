We go out,  <br>explore the site,  see how people <br>are interacting with the spaces.<br>Auckland has a lot of challenges at the moment <br>in terms of urban development, <br>housing, transport, so <br>definitely, this is a really interesting <br>context to apply urban design <br>and start to think about how <br>we might be able to solve them.<br>Our programmes here at the <br>University of Auckland are  <br>accredited by the New Zealand Planning Institute,<br>and most of our students get jobs even <br>before they complete their degrees.  <br>I chose this course because I love <br>the idea of having the big picture.<br>It excites me to work on the <br>scale that can affect a lot of people.<br>The University of Auckland programme is designed<br>for people from any background,<br>and the whole idea of our programmes<br>is to teach the skills and competencies<br>you need to be a qualified and <br>professional urban planner.</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
