What’s the catch?*<br>Are we just eating fish or are we consuming much more than that? What is invisible to the naked eye but may caused much harm and damage to our body? My research looks into the pollutants that accumulate in the fish that we eat, namely Methylmercury.<br><br>Find out more about the 3 Minute Thesis here: https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/research-degrees/workshops-events/3mt-doctoral</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>toxicologists have a saying that goes<br>the dose makes the poison in other words<br>there isn't any distinctive line drawn<br>between toxic and non-toxic rather it<br>lies on the spectrum of how much of a<br>substance you consume so what does this<br>substance that we are consuming yet are<br>unaware of today I'm going to tell you<br>about a different form of mercury not<br>that mercury the silvery liquid that you<br>find in your thermometer it is a form of<br>mercury that's hidden within the fish<br>that we eat and it is 10 times more<br>lethal than its counterpart this mercury<br>is known as methyl mercury so methyl<br>mercury exists in an organic form which<br>means that it has a carbon and three<br>hydrogen atoms attached to it this<br>allows metal mercury to sneak pass on<br>many natural defense mechanisms such as<br>the liver and even the placenta and only<br>to get concentrated in our bodies in<br>high and higher doses so imagine this<br>small fish with methyl mercury gets<br>eaten by big fish with methyl mercury<br>and in turn gets eaten by us so the<br>question lies how does me Tamaki get<br>into the fish and where does my research<br>fit into all of this the answer lies in<br>all lakes in New Zealand we have our own<br>natural mercury source coming from<br>geothermal emissions from the volcanoes<br>and thermal vents under the lakes this<br>leads to production of methyl mercury<br>now my research targets the top predator<br>in this particular food chain Charlotte<br>and he aims to tell us how much methyl<br>mercury that is accumulated in them so<br>just to paint a picture on the magnitude<br>of the impact of my research do you know<br>that annually the trout hovers in<br>Rotorua averages 260 tons that's the<br>weight of 10 African elephants<br>so to carry out my research my<br>supervisor and I will go on fishing<br>trips in the Rotorua Lakes to bring back<br>trout from our analysis we have found<br>that different lakes have varying degree<br>of methylmercury<br>and this will affect the amount<br>accumulated and fish this is due to a<br>number of reasons such as low oxygen<br>temperature conditions and also water<br>temperature as a result we hope to have<br>a better understanding of how much<br>methyl mercury accumulates in our native<br>fish and also for us to provide a public<br>health recommendation in which legs to<br>fish in because there is a saying that<br>goes we are what we eat<br>and we definitely do not want to end up<br>like the fish on our dish now do we</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
