The goal is to see these methods used in the production of approved pharmaceutical ingredients for medicinal cannabis products at an affordable price for patients.<br><br>Find out more about 3 Minute Thesis here: https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/research-degrees/workshops-events/3mt-doctoral</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>medicinal cannabis I can honestly say<br>when I started at university I was not<br>expecting debt to be a PhD PhD topic but<br>Here I am today to discuss my current<br>journey<br>well I'll attempt to produce highly pure<br>safe and effective medicinal cannabis<br>products the skeptics out there may<br>believe that medicinal cannabis is<br>simply a way for people to legally<br>consume marijuana but this could not be<br>further from the truth<br>cannabis actually contains a number of<br>compounds with a range of therapeutic<br>properties free from any psychoactive<br>effects commonly associated with typical<br>cannabis consumption<br>cannabidiol or CBD is perhaps the most<br>well-known of these and may be familiar<br>to many in this room CBD has been<br>scientifically proven to treat rare and<br>severe forms of epilepsy an S such has<br>seen approval from the US Food and Drug<br>Administration to treat such conditions<br>when I slice it from cannabis CBD has no<br>psychoactive effects and hence has been<br>approved for patients above the age of 2<br>that suffer from epileptic disorders<br>such as Lennox Gaston and dravet<br>syndrome isolating CBD from cannabis as<br>a major focus of my thesis and with help<br>from medicinal cannabis company Kenna<br>sells plant research I hope to develop<br>novel environmentally friendly methods<br>of producing highly pure CBD medicines<br>that may be used to help alleviate a<br>range of medical ailments the process<br>starts in Kenna South's own cultivation<br>facility where specific nutrient<br>profiles and growing conditions are used<br>to produce high CBD cannabis using<br>specific medicinal cannabis strains and<br>optimizing the plants growing<br>environments helps our goal of producing<br>top-quality medicinal cannabis flower<br>which also aids in future purification<br>of the CBD from here the plant material<br>is dried and milled to produce a<br>consistent raw material for further<br>chemical processing in Kenna South's<br>research laboratory I then attempt to<br>extract and purify the CBD to remove any<br>compounds that may produce side effects<br>such as a common psychoactive properties<br>associate<br>with cannabis this involves some highly<br>specific and scientific techniques such<br>as supercritical extraction and<br>chromatography to help in the<br>purification of CBD from here the some<br>final chemical processes can be<br>implemented first before samples can be<br>sent for analysis to ensure the<br>purification has been successful the<br>ultimate goal of this research will be<br>to develop novel<br>environmentally-friendly methods of<br>producing approved pharmaceutical<br>ingredients for medicinal cannabis<br>products at an affordable price for the<br>patients thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
