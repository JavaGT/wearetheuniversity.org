Current prosthetic hand control schemes exhibit poor accuracy and responseâ€”factors that have prevented such devices moving into commercial markets. This research overcomes these limitations and provides trans-radial amputees the opportunity to have hand function restored.<br><br>Find out more about the 3 Minute Thesis here: waikato.ac.nz/students/research-degrees/workshops-events/3mt-doctoral</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>he are hot to me a newie or TL as a<br>question my ancestors would use to teach<br>their children a vital principle and it<br>would be taught in places like this mall<br>Toto Mona that's a mountain which my<br>family is connected to translated their<br>question is what is the most important<br>thing in this world to which the reply<br>is Hareton Lata Hareton gotta hurt<br>another that is people it is people it<br>is people ten million people on the<br>earth suffer from the loss of a limb<br>three million of them are upper<br>extremity amputees that type of<br>amputation is particularly limiting<br>because our world is engineered for our<br>hands the reality is that once it's gone<br>it's gone for good and it must be<br>understood that it's not just the<br>physical injury that's social it's<br>mental it's spiritual my research<br>attempts to restore some of that hand<br>function by making brain controlled<br>prosthetics I can see you starting to<br>listen now yes it's like Terminator star<br>wars type stuff okay and I'm feel very<br>lucky to be a part of it but there were<br>two things I found almost instantly that<br>keep it to the movies and not in the<br>real world<br>the first is accuracy and the second is<br>response accuracy is how precisely we<br>can determine what you are thinking and<br>response is how quickly we can determine<br>them<br>now those compete so you're not going to<br>have one without the other and that<br>limits it so we can't get it into the<br>market my research looks at adding<br>autonomous machine vision to it that<br>looks like this a hand a prosthetic hand<br>that is able to sense the environment<br>and as it approaches objects adapts to<br>that object starts changing and then the<br>responsibility as<br>to the amputee whether to close or open<br>on that object now that's going to help<br>us push the technology into the market<br>okay that there's a wonderful thing but<br>the impact is directly to people we can<br>restore independence we can restore<br>quality of life and we can restore their<br>Modi or their spirit which is a<br>beautiful thing here her Timmy annuity<br>out</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
