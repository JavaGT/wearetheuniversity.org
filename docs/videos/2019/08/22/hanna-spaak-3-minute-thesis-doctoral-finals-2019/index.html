The results will help us better understand the complex physiology of nectar production, optimise honey production and bird conservation.<br><br>Find out more about the 3 Minute Thesis here: https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/research-degrees/workshops-events/3mt-doctoral</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>good evening ladies and gentlemen<br>yes I'm Hana but tonight you can call me<br>honey so let's talk about sex I guess no<br>even the guy in the last hole is wide<br>awake<br>great because actually in nature many<br>things come down to sex it secures our<br>survival increases variety in moreover<br>makes or offspring heavier plants are<br>the experts in sexuality they even<br>recruited their own fertility associates<br>pollinators like mr. bee insects birds<br>birds and geckos are lured with an<br>incredible set of floor attractants to<br>FedEx their pond fried form plant a to<br>plant feed so how does now the flower<br>reimburse those busy workers for their<br>service well in many cases with nectar<br>and nectar is what I'm working with I<br>want to find who Zealand's sweetest<br>nectar tastes sweet because it contains<br>a lot of sugar but also proteins amino<br>acids and a decent amount of water so<br>after many years now in rooms without<br>any windows normal life of a scientist I<br>can finally head outside travel across<br>the whole country and sample nectar from<br>the most common trees but before I could<br>do so I had to figure out what common<br>actually meant because there was a<br>problem more than 250 beautiful and<br>Democrats in only three years for my<br>thesis so I used three observations of<br>many thousand people to reduce down my<br>list to a top 20 I can tell you working<br>with nectar is tricky it's known to be a<br>very versatile plant SEP because it<br>depends on so many factors light rain<br>soil you name it but hardly anything is<br>known about New Zealand nectar on a big<br>scale that's what I want to know how<br>nectar varies among different locations<br>species and climate zones and how fast<br>as a flower actually will fill its<br>nectar and can we provoke enters nectar<br>flow or does it come to<br>and by knowing these facts we can create<br>a New Zealand white nectar map honey<br>producers can use those Maps to optimize<br>heist placement and even create a new<br>honey flavor who knows<br>moreover we can estimate better if there<br>will be enough food for our beloved to<br>his bed birds and his so that they can<br>please us with their ancient melodies<br>for many more decades thank you and good<br>night</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
