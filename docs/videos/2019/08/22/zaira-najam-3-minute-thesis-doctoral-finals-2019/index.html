Although these two indices are considered different, they are actually part of the same pattern, thus stressing the need for extensive trend analysis to better measure and manage poverty.<br><br>Find out more about the 3 Minute Thesis here: https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/research-degrees/workshops-events/3mt-doctoral</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>cura I have a question to ask do we all<br>want zero poverty yes right but I would<br>say if you can't measure you can't<br>manage we are still struggling to<br>eradicate poverty and it is a big<br>concern for the policymakers therefore<br>it is the first goal set under<br>sustainable development goals by United<br>Nations and the goal says there should<br>be no poverty in any dimension and in<br>any form by 2030 here comes my research<br>over the decades since we started<br>calculating poverty you were allied on<br>manometric poverty innocence in which in<br>order to gauge the welfare of people we<br>look into how much money they have and<br>if they are living below the threshold<br>measured in terms of dollars or in local<br>currency Witham the mass poor during the<br>journey then this is improved and<br>advanced in order to satisfy more<br>properties which a good poverty index<br>should possess but then almost two<br>decades ago a debate in literature<br>started off where in few economists<br>question the use of manometric poverty<br>indices and argue to see poverty as a<br>multi-dimensional phenomenon in which an<br>individual is termed as poor if he or<br>she is deprived of services and<br>facilities in health education and<br>living standards not money wealth in<br>poverty as a multi-dimensional<br>phenomenon the improvement and<br>advancement in multi-dimensional poverty<br>indices started taking place but exactly<br>on the same pattern as money metric<br>poverty indices so that means if we<br>calculate poverty using these indices<br>for let's take the example of Pakistan<br>which is the focus of my study we get<br>different poverty estimates for same<br>very year and it is very perplexing so<br>now what I am doing in my research is do<br>inform policymakers about the poverty<br>trends that how different or same they<br>are if we consider multi-dimensional and<br>manometric poverty intersects using<br>their base<br>and advanced forms and also to see what<br>stories these illnesses have to tell<br>about different districts of Pakistan<br>along with how effective certain poverty<br>eradicating initiatives were if we<br>consider these two streams of poverty<br>innocence this all will help<br>policymakers in making more informed<br>decisions about measuring and managing<br>poverty and to have a world free of<br>poverty thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
