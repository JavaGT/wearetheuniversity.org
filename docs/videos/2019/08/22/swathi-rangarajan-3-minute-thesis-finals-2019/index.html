My research explores how primary teachers in the technology classroom in New Zealand use higher order questions to gauge student learning and scaffold the next learning steps for the students.<br><br>Find out more about the 3 Minute Thesis here: https://www.waikato.ac.nz/students/research-degrees/workshops-events/3mt-doctoral</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>every good story has an underdog who has<br>very little chance of winning against<br>the big bad giant in my story the<br>underdog is a subject called technology<br>education and it is fighting the<br>traditional ways of the classroom this<br>fight began in the early 1960s and it<br>was 30 long years before it won its<br>first major victory in 1995 technology<br>education was introduced as a mandatory<br>subject in New Zealand schools if this<br>was a fictional story this would have<br>been a happily ever after unfortunately<br>in real life this was very different<br>20 years later today we are still<br>struggling with some aspects of teaching<br>technology in a technology classroom<br>students are solving problems for a<br>specific group of people by me designing<br>and making products by solving these<br>problems they are enhancing and<br>practicing creativity collaboration<br>innovation critical thinking all<br>essential for their life in the 21st<br>century the characteristic feature of<br>technology education is that every<br>student is expected to come up with a<br>unique solution to the given problem so<br>at the same time different students<br>could be working on with different<br>materials could be learning different<br>skills and abilities and could be<br>gaining different kinds of knowledge so<br>how is the teacher to know what each<br>individual student is learning the<br>teachers role after all is to scaffold<br>the next learning step for the student<br>my research deals with this challenge<br>generally teachers ask questions to<br>gauge what the student is learning but<br>research shows us that they ask factual<br>recall questions that the students then<br>answer in less than four words this is<br>not enough for a technology classroom<br>the questions need to encourage the<br>students to critique analyze and<br>organize their learning in other words<br>demonstrate higher-order thinking skills<br>in my qualitative research I provide two<br>primary teachers with a frame<br>of higher order questions that can<br>challenge and deepen student thinking<br>questions like if you were to make<br>improvements to this design what changes<br>would you make why or question like if<br>or this a this framework will provide a<br>scaffold for the teacher or and<br>it I track how they use it in the<br>classroom how they learn from it and how<br>it affects the teacher-student dialogue<br>in the classroom<br>I hope my research will provide a few<br>answers on how we can support student<br>learning in the classroom and thus bring<br>us one step closer to providing a<br>victory for the underdog thank you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
