Damon made the choice to step down from paid employment to return to study, completing a Bachelor of Planning with Honours in 2008, a life-changing decision which led directly to his leadership role at Ecomatters. Now, Damon works to empower people and businesses to act as kaitiaki of our natural environment, and to reconnect to the land.<br><br>Damon shares his experience and talks about the transition underway in the business world to environmentally sustainable models, and the opportunity this presents for the creative-minded.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Damon Burchfield and I'm a<br>creative entrepreneur I was working as a<br>journalist and looking at business<br>models different businesses and what<br>they were doing and the sustainability<br>space and I realized that we had this<br>huge challenge ahead of us I stumbled<br>across the urban planning degree at<br>University of Auckland and really liked<br>the way that it was attending to<br>environmental social and economic issues<br>in a really holistic way so I gave up<br>the comforts of a full-time role paid<br>paid employment and when studied for<br>four years and it was the best thing I<br>ever did my job as CEO Eddie committers<br>is to tackle sustainability and<br>environment challenges particularly in<br>Auckland we work together with community<br>business and government to engage those<br>organizations and people in what we need<br>to be doing as a society to tackle the<br>significant sustainability issues we<br>face<br>it's about upscaling community with<br>tools and knowledge that they need to be<br>a part of the solution we run bike hubs<br>and help people fix and restore bikes we<br>do a lot of work and housing quality<br>showing them what change they can make<br>in the home to achieve better outcomes<br>we do a lot of nature work working on<br>streams undertaking restoration projects<br>we have a nursery here a tea committers<br>so we grow thousands of native trees<br>every year we also undertake a lot of<br>zero-waste projects a lot of what my<br>role really is is listening to what<br>people are trying to achieve in the<br>context of environment and<br>sustainability processing there and<br>understanding what might that look like<br>in terms of practical action on the<br>ground and then really working with my<br>team to deliver practical outcomes it's<br>being able to look at a global picture<br>and understanding what that will mean in<br>a local application three words that<br>would sum up my career would be<br>collaborate facilitate and be<br>compassionate if I was going to be<br>starting a business now I'd be looking<br>at how can i embed sustained<br>into everything my business is doing the<br>20th century model of just taking<br>resources turning them into a product or<br>service that people don't really need<br>that ultimately ends up in a landfill<br>it's just not going to work anymore in<br>the 21st century I really believe the<br>the key to success is understanding what<br>are your strengths and what can you<br>bring to a role and then surround<br>yourself with good people who can</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
