Marshall is also the Co-founder and Chairperson of the Screen Composers Guild of New Zealand. <br><br>Marshall’s career has taken many turns including roles not directly in the music industry.<br><br>“Music is hard”, Marshall mentions in this video, and there are several essential qualities a creative entrepreneur needs to foster in order to succeed: perseverance and persistence being just two on his list. In music, many people settle for practicing as a hobby. Marshall shares a little more about his journey turning his passion into his day job, where every day is different.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>my name is Marshall Smith and I'm a<br>creative entrepreneur I write music for<br>film and television programs primarily<br>documentary and television series<br>creative entrepreneurship to me is<br>really the marriage of being creative<br>and its truest sense but also<br>recognizing that there's a business<br>aspect to what you do I can't honestly<br>say I had a very strong clear plan I'm a<br>symbol ships toilets I've been a PA<br>I've been evinced sort of organizer I<br>went in marketing I design websites have<br>been a graphic designer<br>and I've also presented a big Wednesday<br>for use in lotteries commission for<br>three years I actually did a degree in<br>political history minoring in film<br>studies but the degree was actually<br>incredibly useful for me in terms of<br>focusing the way I thought and the way I<br>I just looked at the world was very<br>creatively inspiring in my career I've<br>been very lucky to have a number of<br>mentors in London I had a music manager<br>for my band who was incredibly<br>influential in my career mainly<br>convincing me to not be in bands but a<br>latterly I discovered the world of<br>commercial composers and discovered I<br>really enjoyed that being behind the<br>scenes<br>a typical day for me is not very<br>difficult actually you know one day we<br>might be working on a country music<br>track the next day we might be working<br>on a Duff shampoo commercial<br>the next day we might be writing music<br>for his game in Japan there's been lots<br>of pivotal moments in my career I've<br>almost given up many times if I'm honest<br>and music is really hard and it's very<br>tough to keep going I've pretty much<br>given up on the idea of making a living<br>out of music and I was just going to do<br>it as a hobby which most people do and<br>then I I was actually a finalist for the<br>era silver scroll awards for song of the<br>year and I thought hmm maybe I am good<br>at this maybe I should give it a little<br>bit more time three words that would sum<br>up my career<br>perseverance flexibility and integrity<br>I've been told to give up many many<br>times I've almost given up many many<br>times<br>I think persistence is one of them the<br>key to survival in this industry what I<br>get to do in my job is is to be<br>but also now rather than struggling<br>along and a band you know I actually can<br>make a good living and still do<br>something that I really really love<br>every day so it is it's it's a pretty</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
