Dr J.J. Eldridge talks about their research into the lives and deaths of stars, especially binary stars that have very different lives to single stars like our Sun.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>stars are the engines of change in the<br>universe they take the simple elements<br>hide<br>and fuse them together to make heavier<br>elements like oxygen 9 and those are the<br>heavy complex elements that we need for<br>complex life to exist in the universe<br>sunlight and Starlight are just a<br>byproduct of these fusion reactions<br>they're the waste energy that's created<br>in the fusion a key part of the story of<br>understanding stars for me is that most<br>stars are not like our Sun they're not<br>on their own they're actually in binary<br>star systems where you have two stars<br>that are locked together and they're<br>orbiting around each other this means<br>they can lead really hectic lifestyles<br>because as stars are aged they get<br>bigger and they can actually get in each<br>other's way<br>and well as they get in each other's way<br>they can exchange mass which means one<br>can get more massive one can get less<br>massive or in extreme cases they can<br>merge together and form a kind of super<br>star that was going to have a really<br>interesting explosion when it dies a lot<br>of the elements in our universe are made<br>in supernovae which are explosions when<br>the stars die oxygen come from massive<br>stars when they die in a supernova<br>whereas most of the iron in the universe<br>come from stars like our Sun but only if<br>they're in a binary star system if our<br>Sun was in a binary star system it would<br>eventually become a type of star called<br>a white dwarf and if it then interacts<br>with the other star and reaches<br>something we call that Chandrasekhar<br>mass it would then explode and the<br>entire star would become iron and iron<br>is really important because it takes the<br>oxygen we breathe around our body but<br>allowing us to be alive and so we can<br>actually trace how the two most abundant<br>elements in the universe come from<br>either these core collapse supernovae or<br>from these binary star systems in these<br>type 1a supernovae binary star systems<br>are also responsible for some of the<br>rarer elements in the universe why do<br>they make different elements in<br>different amounts<br>why are oxygen and iron so abundant but<br>maybe things like gold silver platinum<br>also rare somehow that was linked back<br>to how those stars actually go through<br>their lives since 2015 we've had a new<br>window on the universe to study these<br>type of mergers neutron stars are so<br>massive and so tiny that when they get<br>very close together they really<br>space-time and they warp the universe<br>and they send out waves just like there<br>are waves on a pond when you throw a<br>stone into it and we can now detect<br>via two observatories in America and one<br>in Europe we can detect those ripples in<br>space-time so this is really interesting<br>because while we can detect the neutron<br>stars merging we can also detect things<br>like black holes which are another type<br>of stellar remnant which we can't see<br>with light so one of the key reasons I<br>like studying stars is that question and<br>change that question of creation because<br>we want to know where we came from is a<br>very human question to say why are we<br>here and studying astrophysics is one of<br>the ways of doing that and because stars<br>make the materials that make us on<br>thering and understanding stars is a way<br>to understand ourselves I don't go and<br>observe stars in a telescope I make<br>computer models of those stars and try<br>and take them as close to observations<br>as I can do you want to have a synthetic<br>universe that you can observe and then<br>compare to the real one because if you<br>put all your physics into your computer<br>program then you know that you're a<br>you're computer programming is correct<br>but also your physics is correct this is<br>useful because it means we're making a<br>bigger computer toolbox of how to solve<br>some of the most difficult problems in<br>the universe in developing L computed<br>toolbox to solve problems we have a much<br>bigger computer toolbox to solve all the<br>more pressing problems we have on our</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
