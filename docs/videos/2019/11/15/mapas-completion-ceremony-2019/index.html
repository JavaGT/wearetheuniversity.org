health in our koto<br>Couture and welcome to night as the<br>celebration and Thanksgiving of the hard<br>work and dedication of so many students<br>families and staff here at the funny one<br>honor we congratulate you or asthma pair<br>schedules reaching this really important<br>milestone for some of you your journey<br>has been complex and occasionally<br>painful painful some have experienced<br>bereavements<br>on your journey loss heartache health<br>challenges and hardship on the other<br>hand some have found spare time to work<br>jobs have babies get married get engaged<br>or whatever<br>not necessarily in any particular order<br>typically your family has invested a lot<br>in you leading up to your study here and<br>during your study here this investment<br>is very powerful as a graduate you will<br>on average have a bit have better life<br>chances for employment higher income<br>homeownership not necessarily in<br>Auckland and life expectancy these are<br>really important for you personally and<br>for your family however you must balance<br>these life chances and privileges as you<br>seek the most important life goal and<br>that's happiness and you must balance<br>the privileges of your family investment<br>against a yet another our word I'm<br>famous for this one as responsibilities<br>I think that other are words I've used<br>over the years racism and reflection<br>will still be will still follow you into<br>your careers and you'll still have to<br>work through those those<br>responsibilities you have our<br>professionalism humility<br>generosity and most of all Aloha for our<br>people our health system will demand<br>much from you but it will also try to<br>condition you aka brainwash you so that<br>you judge patients rather than try to<br>understand them so that you talk at<br>rather than listen to your patients so<br>that you treat rather than care and so<br>that you Revere money more than manake<br>Tonga as health professionals we need to<br>be very wary of these pressures and<br>demands from the systems we work in our<br>people need us to be great health<br>workers and to continue to learn I know<br>I can hear the groaning from here about<br>more study but we need to continue to<br>learn to be great scientists and we need<br>to continue to learn to be human have<br>humanity and to love our people to love<br>our people doesn't mean to say that we<br>have to accept bad behavior but it does<br>mean that we have to have a wise<br>understanding of how our histories have<br>shaped and scarred our bodies our minds<br>and have loaded health risks into our<br>environments and patterns some of our<br>behaviors don't forget this and although<br>it will frustrate you at times you must<br>know it you must feel it you must live<br>it and you must breathe it I<br>congratulate you as part of the changing<br>face of the New Zealand health workforce<br>over the last few years as I've said<br>pretty much a similar speech I've<br>usually told a story of a friend or my<br>brother or colleague who has encountered<br>the health system fronting and there's<br>always been someone who I've been able<br>to ring up nag eyeball or communicate<br>with and I've always said how<br>interesting to see you out<br>in the workplace and I've renamed you as<br>graduates is the Memphis mafia one of us<br>one of our far know one of your<br>relations is coming to see us soon<br>tomorrow the Faculty of medical and<br>health science graduates

a lot of time<br>thinking about family and opportunity so<br>my grandfather<br>it comes from mouth on a typical tongue<br>fairly big family<br>small house but what was a typical about<br>him was such a strong sense of the<br>importance of education so at the time<br>it was only one scholarship to get into<br>the medical school in Fiji and that<br>usually goes to a Methodist students and<br>my grandfather being a Catholic had to<br>try extra extra-hard and study to get<br>the scholarship in that year he mesh<br>they gave out two scholarships and see<br>if the usual one he comes back from Fiji<br>to tatanga and my grandma comes with my<br>family her family to Auckland by herself<br>while he works as a doctor there trying<br>to raise a family while working in a<br>toothbrush Factory so

and stability to study and<br>that hasn't always been the case so I<br>wanted to I wanted to recognize that the<br>success that I have is predicated on all<br>these choices and values of generations<br>before me so on to give thanks<br>my grandparents thank you to my dad for<br>working hard and supporting me through<br>this and even though this is a meta<br>um I'm sure all the time he

exceptional<br>people which I'm sure you've heard<br>tonight<br>but if selfishly selflessly helped us<br>over the years they have been in the<br>background organizing tutorials<br>providing learning they've been in the<br>background of planning student events to<br>promote off along with them<br>they've been shoulders to cry on they<br>have been ear sturluson aunties and<br>uncles for so many of us when<br>feel far away from home they've also<br>taken on the role of queers you've would<br>have heard not an age but in provision<br>of resource and this resource is a very<br>important one to us all and I'm sure we<br>can agree on this kite it's something<br>that is quintessential to our existence<br>and dear to us all neighbor all jokes<br>aside they've cared for us and watch<br>over us as if we were their own and I<br>just wanted to pass on the deepest<br>gratitude to the map best thing for<br>these years of love kindness and wisdom<br>dare not go to so again it's important<br>that I
