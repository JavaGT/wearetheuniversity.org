Additionally, she was a crew representative to support space shuttle integrated testing and payload testing. During the early phase of building the International Space Station, Anna was the chief of the Space Station branch.  <br><br>She discusses her career, and why we need more women and girls studying STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. With support from the US Embassy in New Zealand, her talk is also timed to highlight the 50th anniversary of the Apollo Moon landing.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>bunnies jetpacks on the PVC for the<br>stomach area that's why I'm introducing<br>the speaker before I do that I just like<br>to give you some tasks in here we are<br>the closest way to look after you so<br>before we get in the way just cover up a<br>few house keeping wait have toilets you<br>may have seen if there's a fire<br>please remain calm please listen to the<br>Academy stuff they all asked me to make<br>eight the written as quickly and that's<br>and you'll be directed outside to<br>another contradiction percent at the<br>point please do not many circumstances<br>and then myself anyway I'm too Emma<br>Fisher she is one of the first field<br>female astronauts she's now retired to<br>be selected by NASA she's also a chemist<br>and a medical doctor who specializes in<br>emergency medicine dr. Fisher worked on<br>the space shuttle program in the<br>International Space Station and the<br>Orion capsule that is being developed in<br>that NASA's future Space Launch System<br>additionally she was a crew<br>representative to support Space Shuttle<br>integrated testing and pele testing<br>during the earlier phase of building the<br>International Space Station she was the<br>chief of the space station<br>so no pleasure to be here actually to be<br>in New Zealand because I flew over New<br>Zealand in Austria when I was up in<br>space but I've never actually I know<br>this is also your exam period for some<br>of the younger folks here I not sure I<br>would have taken time out I could skip<br>dirty ticket most of the summer so I<br>thank you very much for coming<br>it's a real pleasure and an honor for me<br>to get to and share with you my<br>experiences so what I'm going to do I'm<br>very passionate about space and and<br>careers with the stem of the backgrounds<br>or steam I should say now and so I can<br>more decently talk there now and a half<br>I'd like to talk for 45 minutes so I'm<br>going to get started I want to try to<br>finish my talk in about 45 minutes or so<br>and then I want to definitely leave time<br>for questions and answers at the end so<br>with that I'm going to go ahead and get<br>started<br>and I would like to start with a picture<br>of when I was a child as when I was in<br>second grade partially because when I'm<br>talking to audiences if there's so many<br>people in the audience I'd like them to<br>know that yes I was a child at one point<br>too<br>but it also reminds me to talk about a<br>few things one I was a very shy nerd as<br>a child I actually loved doing my math<br>homework which my daughter's can't<br>believe that I actually had meant to but<br>it also reminds me to talk about the<br>first time that I decided I wanted to be<br>an astronaut my father was in the<br>military and we looked a great deal we<br>were stationed at Fort Campbell Kentucky<br>sort of in the middle of the United<br>States and early in the morning we were<br>outside with my first class I was 12<br>years old<br>and we were tired with a PE teacher and<br>we were crowded around listening to out<br>Shepard the first American to launch<br>into space for his cell orbital flight<br>in May 5th 1961 like I said I was 12<br>years old<br>7th grade and at that moment listening<br>to him talk to Mission Control I said to<br>myself I want to do that so it was to me<br>the perfect combination of something<br>that had science it was challenging and<br>exploring just everything but of course<br>back in those days 1961 that wasn't a<br>very realistic goal for a young girl the<br>first astronauts had just been<br>the murmur seven they were all male only<br>with test pilots but the seed was<br>planted and I really like to emphasize<br>that for younger folks from the audience<br>in case you got there anyway as you see<br>as all talk to mark you know that didn't<br>seem like a very likely thing that was<br>going to happen as I said my father was<br>in the military we moved up a great deal<br>in fact when we hired his last post it<br>was stationed that I was in eighth grade<br>I was 13 and that was eighth grade was<br>my 13th school so you know I'd learned<br>to be very adaptable as we move to now I<br>was really happy to be in middle school<br>and high school in one place and even<br>today I really value those friendships<br>because I think perhaps I appreciate a<br>more having moved around as I said I was<br>very much nerd than them science I love<br>net first person in my family to go to<br>college I applied to one school<br>University of California Los Angeles<br>UCLA and was very fortunate to be<br>accepted I started out an act that I<br>started thinking about what was I going<br>to do with math I wasn't<br>smart enough to be a theoretical<br>mathematician I'm a professor like I<br>also really love science so I round up<br>I'm taking some courses in chemistry and<br>decided that I wanted to get my<br>bachelor's in chemistry and as I've been<br>alive I really loved that as well but I<br>thought I really wanted to combine my<br>love of science with working more with<br>people so I decided to go to medical<br>school and again was there fortunate to<br>get in and decided to go into emergency<br>medicine by this time it looked like I<br>wasn't going to have a chance to become<br>an astronaut but I haven't totally given<br>up yet because I thought well maybe one<br>of these days there will be a space<br>station then I could be a doctor honest<br>but I didn't tell that to the admission<br>committee but anyway my my then fiancee<br>and later husband was a year ahead of me<br>in medical school and one of my medical<br>school friends was the intern on the<br>service and they were having lunch one<br>day and and Mark told my husband you<br>know massives<br>looking for astronauts and not just<br>pilot astronauts this time physician<br>specialist for this new spaceship so<br>this was before the speciality good one<br>I can still remember at the hospital<br>that I was training at<br>Angeles paging me and say Anna we have<br>one month before the deadline<br>the application process had been open<br>for about a year and it was just it<br>still to this day kind of makes me kind<br>of shudder think that you know what if<br>you haven't been hungry that day and<br>they haven't gone to lunch I'm not sure<br>just kind of sort of strange house<br>tomorrow life takes these turns anyway<br>back in those days there was no internet<br>so you had to call me I have the mail<br>and application you have to fill that<br>out get your letters of recommendation<br>and your transcripts and everything that<br>whole process oh well your internship I<br>got my application in like the day and<br>six weeks later found myself released<br>and interviewing for the first 50 women<br>never interviewed for the program and<br>then in January of 1978 or about five or<br>six months later found out that I was<br>very lucky to be in the first class of<br>astronauts ever selected for that<br>specifically for the space shuttle<br>program you can see it's a pretty large<br>class there were thirty five of us fifty<br>new pilots twenty mission specialists<br>it was the most diverse class that NASA<br>had ever selected and it was the first<br>classroom ever to have accepting women<br>the six of us on the left is that she<br>analyst biochemist<br>I resent that doctor she was training to<br>be a certain dr. Kathy Selden a<br>geologist dr. Judy Resnik<br>electrical engineer and unfortunately<br>she killed her Challenger accident on<br>myself and dr. Sally Ride the first<br>American women to fly in space and also<br>unfortunately she passed away in 2012<br>from pancreatic cancer about a year ago<br>an artist with designs catches on you<br>can see all the patches I'm wearing them<br>every proved as a patch every class up<br>at that so whatever is - likes to<br>doesn't work with crews and design<br>matches design this attachment sticks us<br>and I'm wearing somewhere here I was<br>predicting where a headed but I like to<br>think that Judy and Sally are not here<br>that they were appreciated in what this<br>patch as we thought it's pretty special<br>this is the picture of the Johnson Space<br>Center in Houston Texas<br>that's where I live and if you want to<br>be an astronaut in the United States<br>that's where we're always kind of leave<br>that space you know it's a little bit<br>like<br>the University here it's where all of<br>our simulators are located and we're<br>training took place when you're first<br>selected as an astronaut you're called<br>an astronaut candidate and for us that<br>period was about a year for some of the<br>more recent classes because they have a<br>little bit more to learn mainly they<br>have to learn Russian because because we<br>have to launch on the Russian Soyuz but<br>that's several years so they're cameras<br>see period lasts a little bit but as<br>massive Pro them to me they always come<br>up with acronyms and abbreviations so<br>affectionately known as the oskins<br>when we first get started but whenever<br>you finish that sort of a trial period<br>after that we have various jobs that we<br>have in the office my first job was to<br>work in the area of spaces for and<br>spacewalks and they didn't even have a<br>shuttle suit back then we were selected<br>this actually is an Apollo suit because<br>they haven't like I said made the first<br>shell see and you can see it you'll see<br>a little later slide what the shuttle<br>suit looks like it's what they used to<br>walk on the moon and in that Pete Conrad<br>was the shortlist of the Apollo<br>astronauts so I've actually got to wear<br>history and they were able to make it<br>short enough that as you can see it<br>still<br>however nonetheless we still get a lot<br>of the really preparation preparatory<br>tests in the water in these tender looks<br>that we used to hook our equipment and<br>to put ourselves to the tellers and<br>there's a mini workstation that we carry<br>our tools out those are still onboard<br>the International Space Station now all<br>these years later so it's kind of a neat<br>way to start our career a lot of times<br>people wonder well what do you do when<br>you're not flying in space and we have<br>lots of different jobs so at different<br>times I've worked in the facility where<br>we verify our software I worked as a<br>Capcom in Mission Control did some<br>development work on the robotic arm of<br>astronauts that worked at the Kennedy<br>Space Center to get the shuttle ready<br>get the cockpit configure the switch is<br>in the right position and so we have all<br>these different jobs which also<br>contributed to our training but then<br>finally in July of 1983 about two weeks<br>before my daughter was born I was<br>assigned to my flight and you know it<br>was like kind of exciting to the<br>assignment first flight I said I was<br>eight and a half months pregnant at the<br>time and then I delivered Kristen on<br>Friday<br>following methods that are meant a<br>morning meeting just to be able to make<br>sure that everyone knew that although it<br>just powered avi was definitely not<br>going to be going anywhere and in fact I<br>was the first mom to find space and my<br>god are always going to be that way<br>I owe it all to her but anyway one of<br>the first things you do when you're<br>assigned to improve everyone wants to<br>define their captain our commander allow<br>Dave Walker myself over the two rookies<br>on board to at least come up with the<br>concept for our Pat and so we have our<br>names around the outside there are two<br>satellites because we were going to<br>deploy two satellites and then for the<br>first time in history we were going to<br>bring two satellites back that were in<br>orbit they were launched on an earlier<br>shuttle mission and then their rocket<br>that was supposed to take them to a<br>higher orbit fail about four seconds<br>into what should have been a<br>minute firm and so these perfectly good<br>multi-million dollar satellites were on<br>orbit but they were totally useless<br>because they were in the wrong place<br>so the first time ever we were sent up<br>really because the Internet's underwrite<br>rewards of one minute and several others<br>really pressured NASA to go get this out<br>and it was I don't have time to go into<br>all the details of it<br>it was the most<br>a machine you could never imagine<br>because this happened in February and we<br>launched in November so we were part of<br>all the developments and everything and<br>it was just a lot of fun so we have a<br>two-cent likes to represent the two we<br>could deploy and the two we could bring<br>back five stars from the yet through<br>numbers and since I was the first one to<br>fly in space and I was designing the<br>catch I have to start for my daughter<br>Kristen so training for a shuttle<br>mission it takes anywhere from a year to<br>about a year and a half<br>unlike for the International Space<br>Station training for the space station<br>nowadays takes about two and a half to<br>three years and half that time you're<br>gone because of the facilities with our<br>international partners are just really<br>spread all over the world<br>and you're gone for half of that two and<br>a half year period and then you go into<br>space for six months so it's a very<br>different program from the shuttle for<br>the shuttle most of the training was at<br>the Johnson Space Center and for the<br>most part the training was about a year<br>to a year and a half and like I said<br>most of that was in Houston but about<br>two or three weeks before want we went<br>to the Kennedy Space Center for a<br>practice launch and the TCD team of the<br>practice countdown and that's where this<br>picture was taken<br>stale Gardner would be one of my<br>crewmates going out to be the space walk<br>our commander recount adapter Joe<br>element but also be doing<br> myself toast the robotic arm<br>operator in the flight engineer and Dave<br>Walker a pilot<br>yeah also at that same trip was one of<br>the last times that people would be<br>doors for the shuttle were open so that<br>you could see whatever payload was so<br>these are the two satellites that we're<br>going to deploy from the child payload<br>Bay and then in this big empty space up<br>here does not look so good from here but<br>trust me about half the payload bed is<br>where the two satellites would go that<br>we were going to learn about and this<br>guy like he's 376 communications that<br>way<br>he's identical to the two that are on<br>orbit that we were going to go retrieve<br>so this is the week you wanted to space<br>you go into quarantine and you spend<br>about three days at the Johnson Space<br>Center doing your last final bits of<br>training and then about three days<br>before launch of whether the Kennedy<br>Space Center and in the morning I launch<br>this is a very traditional picture of<br>Italy takes a picture of breakfast and<br>you can see there's not a lot of food<br>there and the reason is or a lot to<br>drink and if any of you are going to be<br>lucky enough to perhaps fly down there<br>to the left dick or SpaceX or any of the<br>the new vehicles that are coming alive<br>my arm listen to this<br>mypods because you really don't want to<br>drink a lot and you really don't want to<br>eat a lot the mornings you're going to<br>watch and the reason is if you're going<br>to be out on the pad and you're going to<br>be out here no matter what the launch<br>vehicle is somewhere on the order of<br>three hours and if you can imagine your<br>seat<br>did you lay your seat back on the floor<br>and you're laying in that position for<br>about three hours if you don't have a<br>drop to drink that morning you're gonna<br>have to go to the bathroom really that<br>and you don't want to make it any worse<br>they drink a lot and then the other<br>thing is you don't want to eat a lot<br>because about 60 to 70 percent of<br>astronauts cosmonauts type tonight's<br>which is what the Chinese call their<br>astronauts a habit it's called space<br>palpitations and which is a fancy term<br>for symptoms that are very much like<br>being seasick so not a malaise and if<br>you think's going up here on the ground<br>was in prison yes you're one up on the<br>space is way way worse so I absolutely<br>did<br>take any chances so I really didn't need<br>a lot so here we are getting ready to<br>walk out to that and to the van that's<br>going to take us up to the pad and then<br>we launched on the space shuttle<br>Discovery and I was the fourth person to<br>in the rest the vehicle and get strapped<br>so time when I got to stand out on that<br>access arm and look out for almost a<br>full moon and think about that I was<br>about to go do it - remember that time<br>long ago when I was 12 years old when I<br>first decided I wanted to be an<br>astronaut and spirit was about to come<br>true so it was a very surreal feeling<br>you almost don't believe that it's<br>really you know happening this is what<br>it looks like inside the cockpit we flew<br>the Challenger so we were like - it's<br>pretty much like what I'm wearing right<br>now I'm after challenger they started<br>earning those orange of pressure<br>garments so here's where the commander<br>since the pilot a mission specialist -<br>which one which is Joe and then I'm an<br>MS - mission specialist 2 and you can<br>see that I can get a really good view of<br>all the displays and switches<br>and as I said I was the flight engineer<br>so when a seventh entry my job is to<br>make sure that we were on the time line<br>and we didn't forgive anything and - if<br>we were to have a malfunction which<br>thankfully didn't I make sure we're in<br>the right procedure so this is what it<br>looked like we had a scrub one day for<br>lunch November 7th but the winds at<br>altitude were too great and so we wound<br>up launching on November 8 which was<br>Dale's birthday and when the launch<br>director called wish us good luck in the<br>sack up the mission and they will<br>promise to not blow up the canvas and so<br>this is the way this over those reviews<br>so we have two solid rocket boosters on<br>either side and then there's the three<br>main engines that disease that's people<br>that are oxygen and hydrogen from the<br>large order of boring external tank<br>there are seven million pounds of so now<br>if if you can imagine I'm going to show<br>you a very short video it's about a<br>minute or less so if you could imagine<br>your seat is like it says before with<br>your back on the floor and you're laying<br>there you can lay out on the path<br>three hours and now you're getting ready<br>to till the stop and I'm going to try to<br>explain<br>they each have a parachute and there are<br>a good steak dinner and Easter which is<br>approximately 10 times once the solvents<br>are find the right<br>this glass and it's just a constant<br>acceleration up till about six or six<br>and a half minutes into the asset<br>profile when you achieve three cheese<br>and then the computer has the engines<br>throttle back to maintain three cheese<br>and what that means is that you a<br>hundred kilograms here on the ground for<br>a very brief period of length three<br>hundred kilograms but the jeans up<br>through your chest so although it's a<br>little uncomfortable to breathe it<br>and so then you go from 0 km/h to<br>twenty-six thousand five hundred<br>kilometers per hour which is orbital<br>velocity in eight-and-a-half minutes<br>just to give you an idea of just how<br>fast things are happening and in an<br>instant you go from 3ds to weightless<br>when those three main engines cut off in<br>half minutes again you just go you're<br>immediately weightless and you can<br>almost feel the blood that's left in<br>your legs<br>after sitting on the pad for three hours<br>that normally would be cool<br>your legs sort of shifting into your<br>central venous system and and you're<br>going to get rid of that cooler over the<br>next couple of days because your body<br>senses it as a fluid overload and if you<br>look at astronauts faces the first<br>couple days when they're on orbit the<br>faces are really full usually and gets<br>rid of all your wrinkles I'm going to<br>show you a little bit about what it was<br>like to live and work in space and<br>although the shuttle is not flying<br>anything like a lot of what I'm going to<br>talk about is very similar it's on the<br>space station or some of the new<br>vehicles that were working on that I'll<br>I'll talk about very briefly at the end<br>of my top so the space shuttle o is like<br>a little tiny two-story apartment and<br>the upper flight deck that's very much<br>like the cockpit of a commercial jet and<br>you can see our commander Burke out<br>sitting in his commander C and there<br>were over 2,000 switches and circuit<br>breakers in the shuttle and most of them<br>are on the flight deck as opposed to the<br>Newark when I go vehicle that I'm going<br>to mention at the end of my talk where<br>it's controlled primarily through<br>displays I think there's about<br>by 30 switches in that vehicle and most<br>of those are just emergency backups and<br>pieces of computer failure and again so<br>about 2,000 and the shuttle so it's<br>really changing the way we design on the<br>spacecraft but here's the and then we<br>also have a bunch of checklist be<br>carried over 300 pounds of checklist<br>this was our crew activity plan that was<br>like a Bible telling us what we were<br>going to do every minute of every day we<br>were on orbit and once you get on work<br>with the seats that Joe and I were<br>sitting in are no longer necessary and<br>not only that they get in your way so<br>they were designed to be bolted and<br>stove and then you can see like this is<br>the panel from which the commander the<br>pilot can fly the shuttle to dock with<br>the International Space Station or as we<br>robotic arm and then below there is a<br>business was our list the mid-deck and<br>the mid-depth is where everything else<br>was it's where members so we have<br>experiments that we have any you can see<br>I'm moving on to the handle of our<br>treadmill which is where we exercise<br>although I'll have to be honest our<br>flight was so busy I think we maybe use<br>the treadmill once or twice that entire<br>thing because we were just too busy and<br>we each had a locker and everything was<br>color coded red was for the commander<br>and yellow for the pie<br>mission specialist 1 and breathe for me<br>that way if you saw a packet of food or<br>a checklist you could immediately tell<br>whose it was by the little color tag on<br>it we they allow us to buy stickers from<br>our colleges or military affiliation<br>pictures of our family<br>you can see our demonstrating space care<br>here there's no such thing as a flat<br>here today and I'm wearing a necklace<br>actually submit was somewhere near that<br>at the top you can see it a little bit<br>about the fluid in space well first I<br>should say I definitely was one of those<br>60 or 70% and that space adaptation<br>syndrome luckily I didn't need anything<br>so and I didn't eat anything heartily at<br>all for two days cuz I definitely didn't<br>want to throw up yeah so I woke up on<br>the morning of the third day and I was<br>absolutely starving I had a hot dog and<br>that's probably the most expensive too<br>but most of the food is free to<br>freeze-dry<br>kind of like backpacking food or like<br>the little cups of noodles students love<br>to live on but when you're in college<br>and we just added some water my favorite<br>was Beach stroganoff and then some<br>really nice engineer design Lestrade I<br>hold up our little containers cuz you<br>can imagine<br>try to eat containers moving around is<br>everything in fact if one of the things<br>Scott Kelly who was the astronaut that<br>was up on the station the us extra not<br>that was on the station for a year he<br>talks about one of the things he really<br>missed was being considered a table and<br>have dinner you know with your family<br>with your friends but at least this gave<br>us a sort of the feeling of having that<br>meant a trade with yourself they can<br>they receive that breakfast there's<br>orange juice and coffee and this is a<br>video I'm not going to have time to show<br>it just shows how I prepare meals them<br>if you're in just like a joke to it and<br>a little bit about squeaking in space I<br>remember the first night when I got up<br>there I felt so strange I kept feeling<br>like I wanted her pillow to put my hat<br>on and of course you're the floating's<br>that you really don't need to do that<br>nobody enough like really wanted to use<br>their sleeping bags like an actual<br>sleeping bag to get inside them so we<br>have two sleeping bags here attached to<br>the law and do up here and so I created<br>this kind of little hammock arrangement<br>which let me flow but at the same time<br>feel a little bit secure on the space<br>station each crew member actually has a<br>little telephone sized bedroom if you<br>will and again it doesn't<br>or even teaching here and you can sweep<br>them any orientation so they have a<br>little more luxurious quarters then then<br>we had this worked really well and but<br>eventually even I got to where I felt<br>comfortable districting free-floating<br>this is a picture money<br>my crew might could make a joke to it I<br>didn't need to know he took it till<br>about after my just going through their<br>photographs which you can see on the<br>last day everybody wants to know how to<br>go to the bathroom space but nobody<br>wants to ask so here's our pilot Dave<br>Walker he's just simulating here and the<br>waste management system er WS M&amp;S as<br>NASA call it is kind of concert marathon<br>or something like that<br>we have checklists for everything as I<br>said here's the checklist er<br>definitely do not want to screw this one<br>will be very eminent but I think I'll<br>leave the rest to your imagination<br>I'm the one thing that NASA added when<br>we start applying a mixed gender male<br>female Cruz which is privacy curtain but<br>and so I always tell young aspiring to<br>be an astronaut and you better not have<br>a lot of need for privacy you get to<br>know your crew mates really well perhaps<br>better than you really want to know them<br>so I'm just gonna very very briefly show<br>you a bit about what we did on our<br>flight because as I said it was really<br>an amazing why the very historic flight<br>them and just an effort an example<br>NASA's amazing capability and teamwork<br>so we want the two satellites that I<br>should have do on day two one on day two<br>when I'm a three-date war was a<br>preparation day Joe and a little check<br>on their spacesuits Rick and I were<br>living ready he and I really need to<br>learn that rendezvous while the other<br>three members down on the mid-depth at<br>the air getting them the rest in each of<br>their space suits to go itself and so<br>you have to realize that over very long<br>days just the wrong angle itself takes<br>approximately six hours and then the<br>spacewalk itself was somewhere between<br>six and seven hours so if you're talking<br>really long days so I'm Dave five in our<br>base seven we rendezvous with the blocka<br>and the rest are satellites and a lot of<br>time to explain all the details so I was<br>interested<br>but basically here's the step like that<br>was not designed to be retrieved for me<br>to grab something what the robotic arm<br>it needs to have a special Ratliff<br>fixture on it and so we have to figure<br>out a way to do that and so here you see<br>Dale and in a space suit with his Buck<br>Rogers man whenever unit backpack with a<br>device that we have this I'm I need to<br>go and dock with the after nozzle and<br>and separately satellite has solar<br>arrays all around it and if we damage<br>those there's really no point for<br>himself like that you know would cost<br>more to refurbish it so we had to be<br>very careful handling it and so then<br>here's the air he has stopped the<br>satellite I have a maneuvering the arm<br>and Jove is in the set of foot<br>restraints on the end of the arm kinda<br>like a cherry picker and then what's the<br>Oh brings about slows that stops the<br>rotation of the satellite and then<br>brings out to Joe and he are not and<br>they go into the payload Bay and then<br>attach and whether it's our hardware<br>that's gonna live down into the people a<br>bit very careful choreography and then<br>finally at the end of the set<br>speaks walk on day seven they brought<br>out their room for sale sign they made<br>which was kind of a joke but but not<br>really because the insurance<br>underwriters were so excited this was<br>the second-largest about that operation<br>that waiter London ever had the number<br>one was a Spanish galleon so they were<br>really happy and to them one more day<br>and then on the morning of the nice big<br>party orbit burn and at that point once<br>you slow down the orbital velocity<br>basically you've become a meteorite and<br>you're entering the Earth's atmosphere<br>you're hoping that the guidance officer<br>really did their homework<br>well because we only get one chance Phil<br>and the show because it's a library this<br>is a picture that one of my friends tip<br>is we went over in Houston and then we<br>were the second shuttle to land at the<br>Kennedy Space Center and for those of<br>you that perhaps familiar with you<br>it's normally a commercial flight from<br>Houston to Orlando which is where the<br>Kennedy Space Center is located takes<br>about two hours we did that trip in<br>about four minutes faster each other and<br>we were as I said before the first<br>flight effort to bring a partner from<br>space and we were met by custom<br>officials asking if we have anything to<br>declare<br>I remember when we landed I felt like<br>that 800-pound gorilla excuse me of like<br>four bathrooms worth between Imperial I<br>learned I feel it's so heavy<br>it was amazing to me how perfectly the<br>human body adapts to weightlessness and<br>gets used to it and then when you come<br>back I would feel so heavy I had some<br>switches to throw on the overhead panel<br>antenna stimulator Tiffany maybe 30<br>seconds it probably took me several<br>minutes to get my arm up and reach them<br>and make sure I was on light switch and<br>you can see here that we're all there<br>holding on to the handles the steps to<br>exit the show and in fact after the<br>couple slides of people might probably<br>active<br>they stopped doing this they have a<br>vehicle that would pull up to the hatch<br>and then they bring the crew out and we<br>would have flight surgeons on board to<br>give you an honor because of all mostly<br>you're coming back dehydrated because of<br>the fluid shifts I told you about so<br>they actually stopped doing it this way<br>and so we went back to the crew quarters<br>took the shower felt great to take a<br>shower after nine days of no shower and<br>and then we landed about 7:30 in the<br>morning and a lot to look in the<br>afternoon we were back in the Houston<br>and I cannot tell you about captain<br>Weston to see my that was I think we<br>were about 15 days so I'd like to shift<br>gears now and to share with you some<br>pictures of the amazing view from space<br>and and also every photographer tries to<br>capture the perfect sunrise or sunset<br>and when you're reporting the earth it<br>takes about 90 minutes to orbit the<br>Earth and every 45 minutes you're going<br>to see there a sunrise or sunset it<br>never gets old<br>looking into the Mediterranean looking<br>into the Middle East by night Peninsula<br>and one of the things that all<br>astronauts cosmonauts<br>I cannot would say taiko not says what<br>the Chinese call their astronauts is<br>once you get on orbit and you see this<br>amazing you you don't see any borders<br>like you do on maps and you just see<br>this planet is one cool beautiful planet<br>one beautiful little spaceship in a way<br>if you want to think of it that way and<br>and you really wish that more and more<br>people get the chance to see this view<br>about the Commercial Crew programs that<br>you're hearing about but beyond musk and<br>Richard Branson and so forth because I<br>think more people they get to see this<br>and appreciate how amazing this planet<br>is and then turn around and look to the<br>vast blackness of space and it really<br>makes you appreciate and think about how<br>we really should take care not only of<br>our planet with of each other and this<br>is the Himalayas which I love yeah but<br>using the date-time are just spectacular<br>and yeah the Johnson Space Center and<br>this is the Kennedy Space Center where<br>we launch this is pad 39a they're trying<br>to be the vertical Assembly Building and<br>the 15,000 foot runway where we would<br>land and to go on the west coast of the<br>United States to the East Coast again it<br>takes about eight eight and a half<br>minutes if you were to do that and a<br>commercial flight they'd probably um buy<br>that again just to give you an idea of<br>how fast you're traveling then I just<br>thought this way you know Europe with<br>this is a Christchurch and I really look<br>hard find Hamilton this is the only<br>picture anywhere of the North Island<br>that isn't covered by cloud so long<br>about this but just to give you a<br>glimpse of what our training is like for<br>the show we have two simulators we have<br>a motion base for asset entry and a big<br>space for orbit this is our motion base<br>and you can see similar the simulator<br>loads to the shuttle I'm in fact we<br>spent hundreds of hours in the simulator<br>so that by the time you're up on orbit<br>and space it really feels like like home<br>and even now when I went into the<br>mock-up that we have still at the Space<br>Center it feels like like you're going<br>home in addition though there are many<br>other wonderful jobs in the space<br>program astronaut was just one of them<br>kind of<br>the expert the addiction control we have<br>all these different positions that need<br>to be filled those are all people with a<br>degree in some area a stem and have to<br>go through extensive training to<br>understand their system and then the<br>loss at which in control of course as a<br>flight director interestingly we have<br>the first female astronauts picked in<br>1978 we didn't have the first female<br>flight director until 1984 so now we<br>have several and we also have a<br>full-scale mock-up with the<br>International Space Station this is<br>where the space station crew to do their<br>emergency training and lots of other<br>training but it's the only place where<br>they have the entire space station so<br>they can practice what they would do in<br>the case of a fire or depress and then<br>we have another facility swimming pool<br>called the new to avoid Sealab and has<br>other tests to come up with a special<br>fancy name for everything and you can<br>see there's all our mouths ups in and<br>this is where we'll be training for<br>spacewalks and you can see as I<br>mentioned earlier that<br>is different than the sea that showed<br>you earlier this is the shelf suit it's<br>a two-piece suit the Lord<br>trouser Lord torso that you put on and<br>then the upper part of the torso is this<br>device that's gonna lower you into the<br>water getting into that so then you have<br>weights lift weights that are gonna be<br>around your leg and then they put some<br>in your on your arms when you get the<br>water and then they lower you into the<br>water so they make you this neutrally<br>buoyant again physically this is the<br>hardest or anything we do and we<br>actually had a lot of rotator cuff<br>shoulder injuries just because all the<br>time you'd spend in there and then you<br>go through your procedures three or<br>spacewalk whatever your particular task<br>is and we also use that facility to<br>practice our procedures of you we're<br>going to bail out of the show and you<br>practice getting into it you're trying<br>to get into Iraq when you're gonna split<br>- it is not easy and also the procedures<br>and kicks we have to bail out of our 238<br>we have a small fleet of t-38 which is<br>how they it's the aircraft that the Air<br>Force uses to train pilots for the US<br>Air Force and NASA but a small number of<br>them and that's how the pilots in the<br>office maintain their proficiency as<br>pilots and as a mission specialist we<br>fly on the back seat and we<br>navigation and the other thing that's<br>really important about the t30 Gates is<br>when you're in a simulator all of our<br>other trainings and simulators and in<br>the back of your mind if you make a bad<br>mistake you may die of embarrassment but<br>you not gonna actually dock in that t-38<br>you know you can have a quick knit<br>malfunction you can have weather issues<br>and all sorts of things so it's a very<br>realistic environment for us to train in<br>our course throughout most of my time at<br>NASA we didn't have iPhones so you know<br>we weren't taking pictures all the time<br>and sell it beats and all that and one<br>of the towards the end of my time of<br>flying I had my cell phone in my pocket<br>men take a selfie so this was myself<br>real briefly I just like to talk about<br>what was currently going on one of the<br>things that I really enjoyed working on<br>was I was the chief of the space station<br>branch and the astronaut office at the<br>very beginning of the space station<br>before we even launched the very first<br>element and it was just amazing I think<br>the space station is one of the greatest<br>accomplishments that humans have ever<br>done I don't think people realize just<br>how complicated it was to build this<br>gigantic structure it's about the size<br>the habitable volume is about the size<br>of a five bedroom house and and the<br>trust of about the sides and it's just<br>so good and even look at that picture<br>you just cannot realize the really neat<br>things was that it's this partnership<br>with all of our international partners<br>and it was truly amazing you now almost<br>20 years later to just see how well we<br>all work together from that sort of a<br>rough start at the beginning<br>learning how to deal with our Russian<br>colleagues who thought they knew how to<br>do space and us and and how we all now<br>work together so that even men in the<br>political situation and the level of<br>leaders is not going to well at the<br>working level we're all friends and<br>colleagues and and that's one of the<br>things I love most about space I think<br>it's one of the things that brings us<br>all together as one common goal here's<br>the picture this is the current group<br>that's on the station when the followers<br>have a crew of six and this is just a<br>commuter and a Christian Pope<br>they just very recently with a two<br>amendment ended a female with the space<br>walk and probably might just think of<br>how far we came from when I was in that<br>policy to go where they did the first<br>all-female space walk and then Stephanie<br>Wilson another astronaut was the Capcom<br>in Mission Control so that was a pretty<br>that just happened so the show stopped<br>crime in July of 2011 135 flights one of<br>my favorite shots of the and after the<br>shuttle stop flying we really have no<br>way to send astronauts up to the<br>International Space Station without<br>relying on our Russian colleagues who<br>watched the Russian Soyuz<br>I would like to harm and so what NASA<br>has been working on the last several<br>years is sort of two things one we have<br>Commercial Crew program<br>you feel designed to take US astronauts<br>from Florida to the International Space<br>Station that's all they're being<br>designed to do and the NASA selected to<br>the Boeing Starliner and the SpaceX<br>Dragon the SpaceX has been taking cargo<br>to the International Space Station for<br>several years they just tested so a<br>while ago the the human rated Dragon<br>capsule and they hopefully will be glad<br>the first manned flight sometime next<br>year Boeing is going to have its first<br>unmanned yes hopefully before the end of<br>the year at schedule for the Sierra<br>Nevada was not selected to take humans<br>up to the pasture house up to the space<br>station but it is going to be developed<br>to take cargo to the international space<br>station and so that's what we're doing<br>on the Commercial Crew side and again<br>that's to take astronauts to the space<br>station what NASA is working on is the<br>Orion vehicle which is really just a<br>large like an Apollo capsule but the<br>Araya is being developed specifically to<br>go beyond low-earth to take us back to<br>the moon or wherever we want to go and<br>the neat thing about Orion and the other<br>two vehicles as they all have an abort<br>system so basically if you have a<br>problem with the rocket you get the<br>abort button it cools you away and the<br>only thing is you might<br>a different part of the earth that you<br>plan with you land safely and be alive<br>so these are the three mock-ups of the<br>three capsules this is the spacex dragon<br>the boeing Starliner and the Orion<br>capsule and these are the crews that<br>have been named to fly the first two<br>flights of each of those vehicles so<br>these are the two crews for the Boeing<br>Starliner and these are the crews for<br>the for the first two flights of speed X<br>and hopefully what kind of skier knows<br>those next year so stay tuned their<br>attack president Trump's announced that<br>he wants us to be back on the moon by<br>2024 that's pretty ambitious with enough<br>men a second miracle and we're all very<br>very excited and the other thing was the<br>Apollo 11 anniversary in July vice<br>president independence came to the<br>Kennedy Space Center and actually was<br>there but my daughter who's broadcast<br>journalism journalist and he announced<br>that the next person has stepped on the<br>moon you know at least the first one<br>that's something exciting authority but<br>I'm hopeful that we're going to build a<br>base on the moon much like the base in<br>an article which I have to go is it that<br>and I think center and it's just amazing<br>the similarities and so that's what I'm<br>hopeful that we're going to doing<br>international effort as well but of<br>course that's just a stepping stone to<br>where we really want to go which is we<br>really went over the Mars and but I<br>really strongly that we need to go to<br>the moon we're only three or four days<br>away from home and learn all those<br>techniques of self-sufficiency and so<br>forth and just to remind everybody just<br>puffs are our weight Mars is this is a<br>picture of Earth taken from the Mars<br>rover and since the Mars rovers only<br>been up for a while there's a very good<br>chance that all of you are in that<br>picture but I just think visually when<br>you talk about how many million miles<br>away Mars is for me it just doesn't<br>compute but looking at that picture<br>makes me realize just how far away Mars<br>is and crews are going to have to be<br>well-trained and it's self-sufficient I<br>just think it's so exciting and somebody<br>a young ellipse or an audience could be<br>those first people that are gonna step<br>on armor so what is what at how exciting<br>when I am with this life I love this<br>life since NASA drawing it's been around<br>almost<br>as an astronaut and when my grandmother<br>passed away in 2003 at the age of 105<br>she was born in 1898 yeah when I think<br>about what she saw her lifetime you know<br>or basic or some length of days<br>development development like to see in<br>the first man step on the moon to see<br>him her granddaughter a lot on stage<br>though and you know that the way<br>technology is changing and the way<br>things are developing so fast right now<br>I can't imagine that those of you the<br>not considered lucky enough to live to<br>be a hundred hundred and five you know<br>what that's going to be like what you're<br>going to see in your lifetime I just<br>think it's a really exciting time really<br>why I encourage young folks behind me<br>moment particularly I get females<br>interested because I think this is such<br>an exciting time and I'm jealous I wish<br>I could start over and continue to do<br>that thank you so much for your<br>attention<br>to be an astronaut at the moment you<br>know things can change the rules can<br>always be changed but at the moment we<br>also have to be a US citizen to be a<br>u.s. astronaut but they typically don't<br>have to be a citizen to work for NASA in<br>fact just before the primary coking and<br>developmental work for those displays<br>were from Belgium and so to work for<br>NASA and I don't know if you're actually<br>to be hired as a NASA solar service<br>department but we have contractors and<br>they actually have their own company<br>contractors so there's many ways to<br>become involved with NASA besides<br>actually and now with SpaceX Virgin<br>Galactic and Blue Origin<br>there's so many ways to get involved in<br>space and New Zealand is starting its<br>own a space agency so you know I'm<br>encouraging them to perhaps involve the<br>space station program space station is<br>splendid right now for 2024 and there's<br>a lot of talk about turning it over to<br>the commercial sector so that people<br>will be able to and companies may be<br>able to send your own people up to work<br>on their experiments so I think things<br>are changing very rapidly that's what I<br>mean and I think there's gonna be lots<br>of opportunities for people not to go<br>into space and as I said there's many<br>exciting jobs if you love space but you<br>where<br>that's a very good question and it's one<br>that when we worry about all the time<br>and that the greatest risk to the<br>International Space Station is either<br>micrometeorite hit or space debris right<br>at the moment NORAD it's part of the US<br>Air Force tracks all that space debris<br>at least the pieces that are big enough<br>and many times we have to move the<br>shuttle or move the space station either<br>lower or raise the orbit a little bit to<br>make sure that you don't contact any<br>space debris so it's definitely<br>appreciated the association of space<br>explorers we actually have it's one of<br>our top concerns we've talked and we<br>really think that what we need is an<br>International Space Agency and we also<br>need something like the FAA for space<br>because right now any country that wants<br>to launch anything into space there's no<br>regular<br>taury mechanism there's nobody that's<br>this whoops there's too many satellites<br>at that orbit you're gonna have to pick<br>a different and there's no mechanism to<br>get rid of some of this space debris I<br>heard talk of commercial companies<br>trying to come up with vehicles or<br>satellites that could go and sort of try<br>to collect some of the bigger pieces but<br>it's definitely a concern is a concern<br>of NASA it's a concern if anybody is<br>going into space and I don't have any<br>real answers right now but we're<br>there's Space Camp I would have given<br>anything to Space Camp when I was here<br>but when I was your age so there's that<br>study hard in school get good grades I'm<br>gonna take a lot of math and science<br>classes if you truly want you want to be<br>an astronaut I mean there's many jobs as<br>I'd like to talk about in a space<br>program that are often there<br>specifically you want to be an astronaut<br>then there's two pathways which is to<br>become a pilot and that's kind of<br>obvious you you enjoying the military<br>you really to get the experience you<br>need to need to join the military get<br>the hours you need and and then at the<br>moment<br>go to test pilot schools if that just<br>gives a very different level of<br>experience so that's wonderful<br>and then the other pathway is to be a<br>mission specialist and at the moment<br>again you can really pick any area<br>science you want my office mates<br>veterinarian you know I said what does<br>that have to do in space well you know<br>took a lot of science and smart and the<br>y intercept is 4 times and doing and<br>then you know so you want to get<br>and have a degree of dance degree in<br>some area of science and then you know<br>to be competitive the last astronaut<br>class that NASA selected pick 12 people<br>there were 18,000 applicants to position<br>so you want your application to stick<br>out so you kind of want to show you know<br>like I was a scuba diver before I went<br>to NASA will get your pilot's license<br>you want to just demonstrate you know<br>mountain climbing<br>you know any of those things that<br>demonstrate that you are going to be<br>comfortable environment situation so who<br>knows you know I think you mentioned<br>that you - perhaps you won't need to<br>have different maybe people with degrees<br>or humanities and in other areas we'll<br>also I know my god that would be with<br>your support cast your nose in this race<br>I want to be a space church myself I'm<br>gonna be able to just go up there look<br>out the window for as long as I can stay<br>I wish I think it's gonna be a lot yes<br>that's funny<br>we're all very supportive when he first<br>came along many years I thought it was<br>he assumed that he was not and he's a<br>submission and goes after it and he<br>tackles things that and and I have<br>fought for wanting to go to mars and if<br>he can figure out a way to do it faster<br>and better than me Jim we're all for it<br>I think as we found out going into space<br>it's more difficult than you think<br>that's going to be and he's had his<br>failures and and it's going to Mars is<br>going to be an order of magnitude more<br>difficult than anything needs have<br>tested so far but I won't be successful<br>if he can if he can do that and go<br>straight to Mars<br>I still think you know what we're all<br>supportive when still think going to the<br>moon and learning the techniques that<br>you're going to need and establishing an<br>Internet<br>no mates and doing research and figuring<br>out how to protect yourself from<br>radiation and all those different things<br>I still think that's the right way for<br>now so their plan but if he can do that<br>I think I think everyone that I wanted<br>was very supportive and and I'm really<br>exciting I was skiing with a bunch of my<br>friends when he had that watch where he<br>had what is it the testicle of our orbit<br>don't know we didn't you'd stop that but<br>I mean we were just anything as long as<br>he's doing it safely and I mean I guess<br>that people want to sign up for like<br>one-way trips to Mars I've heard of that<br>- I mean you know back in the days of<br>people colonizing and going to other<br>continents Magellan often times so that<br>certainly NASA would never sign up for<br>that they always want to have a plan to<br>return someone but it's certainly I<br>think it's a within people's rights if<br>they want to sign up for that and<br>understand because eventually if you<br>want to colonize another planet you know<br>you're gonna have to go do that<br>meant to you know perhaps be your near<br>the end of your life<br>I know sir all my friends that would<br>sign up tomorrow you know I still I<br>think persistence is perhaps and I think<br>my mini astronaut Anna for example to me<br>if I have the first time to to apply<br>again and some of my friends of like<br>tips in seven times before they got<br>selected as an astronaut so you know it<br>may sound like when you hear someone's<br>bio that everything went really smoothly<br>you know I really think that that's<br>important and then just always like<br>trying to do your best but I think<br>persistence is underrated can't promise<br>this lady in there what what altitude<br>eleum for the channel it's about 200<br>nautical miles something like that is it<br>that's about where the space station is<br>and it said about a 56-degree<br>inclinations some of the earlier shows<br>likes like Mike life was at 28 degrees<br>inclination so you don't see as much of<br>year<br>but at 56 degrees you pretty much see<br>everything the only show of lights that<br>were higher than that where the Space<br>Telescope's lights they were at about<br>300 nautical miles and if you go look at<br>a picture of Earth from a what I call it<br>the normal shuttle attitude which is 200<br>nautical miles and then you look at the<br>pictures taken from one of the Space<br>Telescope but you can really tell the<br>difference in the curvature of the earth<br>isn't you can there's a really<br>difference in the pictures from the two<br>different altitudes but the shuttle<br>can't go much higher than that it wasn't<br>designed it was only designed to to be<br>at a low Earth orbit I guess the<br>question I've been asked more time than<br>I know how was the moon and I wouldn't<br>know couldn't make it to the moon<br>I wish it could of it okay so I know<br>that I know that when I'm just - call me<br>- that my girls are going to space game<br>in Houston and the secrets geez how its<br>keep<br>experience and I was very expressive we<br>steep the kind of state and they talked<br>to us a little bit about what is it<br>the student is part luckily I didn't<br>need the aid because my artistic ability<br>is pretty limited<br>I wish it were not anything I just<br>marvel at some of the things that people<br>create but there are several astronauts<br>that are very artistic I don't know<br>Allenby he was one of the Apollo<br>astronauts who walked on the moon he was<br>actually when I called today the mother<br>from our class and so I feel very<br>blessed to have him as a mentor and he<br>after he retired from NASA he went to<br>the Class L School of Art which is a<br>really neat art school in Houston and<br>learned to paint and then did all these<br>amazing abilities of lunar landscapes<br>and he always incorporated something<br>from the moon in all of his paintings<br>does little pieces of the oil and just<br>various things that every painting he<br>has so he's had a very successful career<br>as an artist and in fact years later I<br>was talking to him and said that he<br>didn't think of himself as an astronaut<br>that became an artist<br>as an artist that happened to be an<br>astronaut this is the person we were the<br>fighter pilot test pilot walked on the<br>moon and that's how he describes himself<br>Nicole stop and he's also an art very<br>artistic and she gave me a risk that you<br>may not normally wear it but I forgot to<br>bring it on this trip and she made mix<br>jewelry and many things from all the<br>images of pictures that she took and<br>everything so there are definitely in<br>the office that are artistic I think a<br>lot of us tend to be more brand and my<br>ring but one of the best ways of helping<br>people understand what it's like to be<br>in space is through through art<br>photography that's the best way to word<br>it so their words that's why when people<br>ask me to talk about the space program<br>and they say I can't use my slides I go<br>okay but it's not going to be the same<br>because without this visual<br>representation it's really hard for<br>people to understand how amazing it is<br>so there are and then also<br>music-wise which is a another part of<br>the part a lot of the astronauts have<br>carried instruments into and to orbit<br>around the space station they have flute<br>guitar saxophone and a lot of astronauts<br>neither love music and play instruments<br>and I think that's really important and<br>if you'd read about my cold spot here<br>really interesting she's are what I was<br>we had one of our association of space<br>explorers meetings a few years ago in<br>Beijing and the Chinese are definitely<br>you know going into space<br>they love space there<br>a station they already have one they're<br>building another one we have no doubt<br>they're going to the men and they're<br>gonna build a base mama men I tell young<br>people that you know when we were in the<br>middle of the Cold War the Soviet Union<br>if you had asked me that where we're<br>going to be partners with the Russians I<br>would have thought you were crazy and so<br>I think maybe we're kind of at that<br>stage now with the Chinese and hopefully<br>and if sure things will change<br>it certainly doesn't preclude other<br>countries from cooperating with China I<br>know that your visa has definitely has<br>some cooperative thing collective<br>projects with with the Chinese and the<br>Chinese that were very vocal at our<br>meetings saying that they wanted their<br>station to be international so that<br>might actually be a way for some of the<br>younger folks from New Zealand today to<br>go into space because they definitely<br>want an international aspect to their<br>space station and for no other reason<br>than for political reasons<br>then I'm no fool that I'm just like he<br>wanted a partnering Park being partners<br>with the with the Russians and and then<br>I learned<br>hopefully the same thing will happen<br>with the Chinese and one of the other<br>things I tell young folks to do or what<br>I would recommend is learning another<br>language such as Russian and if I were<br>are guessing I would guess that Chinese<br>might be something that would be<br>valuable in the future I can't promise<br>that that will be true that's when I get<br>in and if you're no other reason it's a<br>really good exercise for your brain to<br>learn so do which design a useful but as<br>it just visit or other disciplines of<br>science any other words in terms of the<br>science of useful oh you can mute it any<br>area of science that you want to be an<br>astronaut in fact it's really important<br>that you'd be doing something that you<br>love because the odds are getting select<br>as an astronaut at least now and like I<br>keep saying you know I cannot tell you<br>what because things could change but the<br>way things are you know you need to be<br>doing something really some people come<br>to invite you to be an astronaut and<br>find out they have a medical condition<br>that they didn't know they have like a<br>heart murmur or these donors or some of<br>the things that could you at least now<br>being an astronaut maybe in the future<br>those who won't so they really need to<br>be doing something you love<br>independently being an astronaut and<br>then and so there's really like I said<br>we trying to think the most different<br>thing that anyone in the office does is<br>my oldest mate was a veterinarian and we<br>also have a few science teachers we had<br>a program originally when christa<br>mcauliffe<br>on challenger after that they stopped<br>that teacher his face program so they<br>decided at some point that they were<br>going to accept some teachers but they<br>had to be in in the area of stem number<br>one and they have to get hired as a real<br>as a full-fledged astronaut and that<br>those who the astronaut training and<br>we've had and they were amazing<br>to ask you to have that you have the<br>okay and then with the excitement of<br>being a new mom and then had to go to<br>this mission which evokes a lot of risks<br>for the second part was the first part<br>what was it like being a new mom and<br>training and like yeah go to this<br>mission that it was very hard you know<br>but I wanted to be an astronaut since I<br>was 12 and I had this incredible honor<br>so there was no way that when they asked<br>me to fly in space that I wasn't going<br>to honor that commitment and also for my<br>own self you know but it was definitely<br>car I would not have chosen to do it<br>that way if I if I had been able to do<br>it exactly as I wanted but at the same<br>time it also probably<br>helped me I have two things I love the<br>most and I learned to be very proficient<br>compartmentalizing you know when I was<br>home I was home when I was at work I was<br>at work I did a lot of things like them<br>when I my trainers on the arm remember<br>to be carrying a terrible carry anything<br>but here on the floor while we were<br>working in the simulator with some of<br>our procedures for the robotic arm and<br>and so but leaving her land knowing that<br>there was a chance that you wouldn't<br>come back was probably the hardest thing<br>I've ever done in my life one thing that<br>we did was a lot of video that year that<br>I was training just to make sure that if<br>anything happened to me she could at<br>least watch a lot of video and then she<br>became a broadcast journalist I always<br>tell her that that was probably because<br>we spent so much time she was leased to<br>beam on camera she just made it her<br>career but no it's hard you know it's<br>it's not that much different and then<br>women who join and then enjoy the<br>military and they are away from their<br>families for long periods of time police<br>officers and law enforcement I suddenly<br>thought trying to think about it once<br>like what's different about being an<br>astronaut then these other people that<br>also live in dangerous environments and<br>they go out any day going into combat<br>going to work as a police officer and I<br>think the difference is that there's one<br>day that you're going out to lunch and<br>you know what that day is whereas on<br>these other jobs it's just sort of a<br>constant thing<br>that's the only thing I can think of<br>because there are a lot of people that<br>have jobs where they're at risk in and<br>c'n and can get killed as well and you<br>know in it it's hard but when you have a<br>dream of something that you want it's<br>important to to be true these are the<br>things that that evening I did I didn't<br>mention this that I I did after the<br>first look might I was assigned to my<br>second flight within a month after I<br>landed and when challenger happened I<br>was about six weeks from play and so<br>after challenger happened I knew he<br>would not find two to three years and so<br>we decided to have our second child and<br>then I discovered that two children are<br>a lot more work than one and I wound up<br>taking a seven-year leave of absence it<br>wasn't planned it just kind of happened<br>the year at the time I was very<br>fortunate my boss was a single father<br>raising five children so he was somebody<br>that kind of understood the challenges<br>and and so he allowed me to do that then<br>in 1996 I came back and was probably the<br>hardest thing I've ever done in my life<br>and coming back after being away for<br>seven years because everything had<br>changed all the people that I came into<br>the program with were pretty much gone<br>and with definite out of their positions<br>and I said them and I think that they<br>gave me this thing called a computer and<br>when I left<br>nobody had a computer there was no such<br>thing as<br>now I came back and it was a total<br>different way of doing business it was<br>totally different people and so it took<br>about a year or so to be to be<br>comfortable and and so but then it<br>turned out that I was in the right place<br>at the right time to be chief of the<br>spacestation branch and so it all kind<br>of worked out but there's no easy<br>answers to all of those things that each<br>person has to kind of figure out what<br>works for them and I always tell people<br>you know don't judge yourself<br>according to somebody else you have to<br>do what's right for you and I look at<br>them to this day I have never taken<br>those seven years because those would<br>never come back to me but then I got to<br>go on and continue and have another<br>exciting career continued so anyway<br>you know when I first came to NASA<br>there was only when female who is in a<br>senior management position there were<br>there were women in Mission Control but<br>not too many I mean if you look at the<br>Apollo<br>Mission Control for the Apollo 11 you<br>know it's all man if you look at the<br>launch team there was one woman at<br>control team but very slowly over the<br>years since we were selected and I can<br>honestly say that I have never<br>encountered any stigmatism about the<br>inner female all the NASA cares about is<br>if you're good at what you do they don't<br>care look like color you are whether<br>you're male or they were female and<br>there was one point I actually I felt<br>mission specialists within the astronaut<br>office had less opportunities because<br>you were mission specialists amount of<br>hire because basically when we were<br>first collected the organization was<br>very much a quasi-military of<br>organization it's really changed over<br>the 36 years that I was with NASA but<br>there was one point when the chief of<br>the office was the female and she was<br>the mission specialist the director of<br>flight crew operations was female and<br>she was a mission specialist and the<br>center director was a female mission<br>specialist all at the same time and and<br>and nobody thought anything of it it's<br>just<br>they were the right<br>to do the job I showed you you know we<br>just had a first two females together<br>doing a space walk and everything and<br>that wasn't a stunt they were up there<br>they were trained and they did a really<br>good job I can honestly say that NASA if<br>you're good at what you do and you have<br>the requirements whatever the<br>requirements for the specific job<br>Gmail's are treated exactly the same as<br>as their as the males the flight<br>directors engineers senior management<br>think we've got a female administrator<br>of NASA yet but that's an appointed<br>position so so that's a I really think<br>NASA's one of the most amazing places to<br>work and in fact I saw her my female<br>colleagues Marsha Ivins actually wrote<br>something totally swim around the<br>internet I can't remember where<br>defending NASA because a lot of times<br>speak the perception sometimes that<br>female so NASA Johnson and she does<br>exactly as I do that if you're good at<br>what you do<br>NASA doesn't care who you are and only<br>that you're that you're good and you do</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
