We followed Charlotte down to Kaikoura to find out about her research. <br>Learn more about studying Geography here: www.science.auckland.ac.nz/geography</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9;

with almond my name is<br>Charlotte I'm doing my masters in<br>science at the University of Auckland<br>specifically in geography so I look at<br>fluvial geomorphology I'm down in<br>kaikoura looking at how the 2016<br>earthquake down there is changing the<br>river systems in 2016 it was this<br>massive earthquake especially the most<br>complex surface earthquake that's ever<br>been recorded and the impact that that<br>had on the landscapes down there it's<br>just incredible so specifically in my<br>River it was a huge landslide and I'm<br>looking at how that landslide is now<br>impacting the river further downstream<br>so today we're in the Hapuku River which<br>is where I do my research we have two<br>helicopter all the way up to the top of<br>the dams it's actually really tricky to<br>walk up there there's some really narrow<br>canyon sections once we get up we're<br>gonna be looking at the big landslides<br>down that's up there it's the biggest<br>one that happened after the kaikoura<br>earthquake it's about 23 megatons of<br>sediment and we're going to be working<br>through that sediment sampling seeing<br>what's going on up there working our way<br>downstream and the helicopters gonna<br>have to come and extract us out once we<br>get to the canyon section it's a really<br>awesome day<br>living in a place like New Zealand it's<br>such an incredible opportunity to go and<br>see these incredibly dynamic landscapes<br>and just the changes around us it's I<br>don't know how other people resisted<br>doing geography really and I chose to go<br>down to kaikoura because there's just an<br>incredible amount of really interesting<br>research happening down there at the<br>moment it's this hotspot of scientific<br>data collection so working down there's<br>really great because I have other data<br>sets that can complement the work I'm<br>doing and also I feel like I'm really<br>adding to such a relevant and important<br>sort of interest I really hope that my<br>work will test some of these new tools<br>that are coming out in geography to do<br>with surface sediment and to do with<br>drone technology so really trying to<br>push what they can achieve and the other<br>thing I really hope my research is gonna<br>do is really understand if the same kind<br>of thing was to occur in a river that<br>was directly running past people's homes<br>affecting people's lives however if a<br>response to these kind of things was<br>really important so that we can in the<br>future help manage the hazards the cool<br>thing about being in the school of<br>environment is that it is quite a<br>multidisciplinary area and we do get an<br>opportunity to work with lots of<br>different people so being down in<br>kaikoura I'm working with gns a lot so I<br>get to use their data which is really<br>great when I'm at the University itself<br>I get to work with research and use<br>their amazing facilities to look at my<br>point clouds also there's some engineers<br>who are looking down in kaikoura who<br>i've gotten to work with down there are<br>looking at installing seismometers to<br>understand how cinema is ripping through<br>that River and yet and I'm not in the<br>field I'm using the data I collected so<br>these nice big point clouds to really<br>look at the changes that did occur down<br>there so I'm doing a lot of data<br>processing and from there I'm also doing<br>things like mapping so visually trying<br>to understand the landscape that I'm<br>seeing in these images and trying to use<br>those maps to understand<br>things have changed over time I'm using<br>some of the really top-of-the-line tools<br>that we have at the University to<br>understand the elevation changes and<br>yeah just interacting with all my data<br>and then of course reading and writing I<br>really love studying in the Faculty of<br>science because it's such a nice new<br>building and we've got always incredible<br>facilities but also within that the<br>school environment is a smaller<br>department and it really feels like a<br>family a lot of the time the students<br>will know each other the lecturers are<br>really approachable you get to go on<br>field trips together and actually really<br>get to know each other understand<br>difference research and it just feels<br>like a really great department to be in<br>a lot of the time everyone's there to<br>support you and everyone's interested in<br>what you're doing I think that if you're<br>going into the postgraduate realm find<br>yourself a topic that you love so that<br>when you're researching you're<br>constantly excited to answer your<br>question if you're in the field of<br>geography I think that's so easy there's<br>so many different questions that I would<br>love to answer myself and I bet there's<br>so many students who are going to come<br>through and answer those and that's so<br>cool but yeah I just say find something<br>you love and find some supervisors that<br>you really really look up to and are<br>excited about their work - because<br>they're gonna be the ones that will push<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
