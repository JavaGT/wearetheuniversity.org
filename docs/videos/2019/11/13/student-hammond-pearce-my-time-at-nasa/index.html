engineering PhD student Hammond Pearce talks about his ten-week internship at NASA in 2019, on a New Zealand Space Scholarship.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>Vanessa Ames is one of the larger NASA<br>research centers they have a focus on<br>aerodynamics and reentry systems but<br>they do other things as well and it's<br>notable because it's got the largest<br>intern and check program so for me that<br>was you know it was nice being a big<br>part of a big number of students there<br>as well and give on the whole date they<br>have really fantastic experts working on<br>so there was for Keeley's there overall<br>they were about 250 interns so quite a<br>large number and about 40 of those were<br>internationals like me and the<br>superball is a what's called a teen<br>security robot and which means that it's<br>made out of rods and strings essentially<br>rods and cables and the idea with the<br>tin cigarette ero bot they're quite hard<br>to visualize so feel free to google it<br>if you're watching this but the idea is<br>that they are lightweight robots that<br>are very good at absorbing impacts and<br>they're very good at traversing terrain<br>that might be unexpected or rocky or<br>things like that and so my project was<br>looking at different ways of controlling<br>ant in security robots they're quite new<br>still and so there's still some unsolved<br>questions about what's the best way to<br>get them to roll across the ground or to<br>get them to walk around the project<br>itself was entitled neuromorphic control<br>of a teen security robot and what<br>neuromorphic means in this context is<br>the controller is inspired by the way<br>that our biological brains work it's<br>still running inside a computer and all<br>the you know there's a whole load of<br>different kinds of newer morphic<br>hardware which i won't go into but the<br>idea is is that we want to make it it's<br>a biologically inspired robot to<br>insecurity or biologically inspired<br>maybe we could have a biologically<br>inspired controller as well where we've<br>got an intelligent sort of oscillator as<br>opposed to just a simple mathematical<br>model<br>it was absolutely fantastic there's<br>definitely a weight that the<br>organization carries because of its<br>history and because of its culture you<br>know it's not just the things they've<br>achieved in in the science realm but<br>culturally even you know they they were<br>one of the first organized they're the<br>only for instance they're the only<br>federal government organization that's<br>involved with with a pride parade for<br>instance and they were one of the first<br>organizations to hire people of color in<br>terms of the government organization and<br>things like that so they're not just<br>cutting edge because of the science that<br>they do but also because of the cultural<br>definitely one of the highlights for me<br>was I think just living on-site so it<br>wasn't just that we were working there<br>and because the way the internship<br>programs work essentially a very large<br>number of the interns probably up to<br>about 190 of them we actually lived on<br>site as well in a place they call the<br>exchange lodge so you know for from a<br>terms of cultural exchange and<br>maximizing the time that you're spending<br>on site doing you know coolness of stuff<br>you know in some of the evenings we<br>would go out with telescopes and we<br>watched the ISS fly over one night you<br>know stargazing and things like that<br>that was really really fantastic as well<br>yeah I think it was a mixture of having<br>both the social side of things by living<br>on-site and then also the technical side<br>having such a fantastic job and a<br>so I don't have a robotics background so<br>I had to pick up quite a lot of Robotics<br>stuff too in order to get the robot to<br>do things but in addition despite doing<br>some things with machine learning in the<br>past I'd never used the particular type<br>of machine learning we'd used and before<br>which is spiking neural networks so kind<br>of a two-pronged learning for me with<br>both the robotics side of things and the<br>way we were controlling it and<br>fortunately I was able to pick that up<br>in the limited time that we had we don't<br>have for instance two integrity robots<br>in New Zealand so kind of the only place<br>you're going to be able to work on the<br>motor places like the NASA research<br>centers and the other equipment that we<br>were able to use so they have a rover<br>scape which is you know where we were<br>testing it which is simulating the<br>surfaces with other planets and things<br>anyone would actually I think a lot of<br>the interns coming out of it were like<br>hey you know this is really cool I<br>really enjoyed working here it's quite<br>common for people who intern at NASA to<br>eventually go back and work at NASA and<br>as it turns out a lot of you talk to a<br>lot of the staff members there and<br>they're always like you know I started<br>here as an intern as well so definitely<br>there's a there's a bit of inspiration<br>both of the areas that I worked in are<br>quite still quite new so using spiking<br>neuron it looks to achieve things is a<br>relatively new area spiking neural<br>networks themselves and not new but<br>they've been kind of limited to the<br>research space for a while because they<br>very hard to deal to work with they're<br>now starting to see more interest in<br>both the research and commercial fields<br>so having some experience with those is<br>quite valuable especially since New<br>Zealand's got this burgeoning software<br>area now where we want to do more and<br>more intelligent things so that's quite<br>useful to bring that kind of knowledge<br>back and but also in robotics as well<br>and especially in the case where we've<br>got companies down at rocket lab who are<br>you know they're essentially a rocket<br>that goes to space is just another kind<br>of robot and so any kind of experience<br>that you get working on robotics and<br>they're things like that it's very<br>useful to be able to apply to companies<br>and organisations back in New Zealand as<br>well</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
