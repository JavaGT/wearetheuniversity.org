a<br>hearty hey motorola in a manner in<br>earlier era racketeering I know my Harry<br>my tena koutou katoa no Richard Blakey<br>KOCO lingua hekima here her father wanna<br>taco at NL quarter katoa Acura everyone<br>my name's Richard Blakey I'm the acting<br>vice chancellor but my day job is deputy<br>vice-chancellor research and Enterprise<br>at the University of Otago it's my great<br>pleasure to welcome you here tonight<br>colleagues visitors members of the<br>Dunedin community there's a special<br>occasion for the University and<br>professor Lisa Alice who we celebrate<br>tonight with inaugural professorial<br>lecture it's a special welcome to Lisa's<br>husband Mike and daughters Susie and<br>Alison welcome welcome welcome and do I<br>see that the Chancellor is here welcome<br>Chancellor and I'm even suspect that the<br>Oh USA President James Heath might be<br>here he did threaten to come along so<br>good to see our student body and gate<br>chair James with the special occasion an<br>inaugural professorial lecture is a<br>celebration of all that means to become<br>a professor here at the university of<br>otago from our foundation 150 years ago<br>and our first four professors we have<br>set high standards whether it be for<br>people appointed from afar or grown from<br>within our appointment and promotion<br>process requires some very specific<br>criteria to be met those are that we<br>require sustained outstanding leadership<br>incompetence in two of the core<br>activities expected of teaching research<br>and service and mere sustained<br>outstanding leadership in the third of<br>those one cannot compromise excellence<br>in any of these three pillars in<br>professorial practice at this university<br>when these standards are met it's well<br>worth putting on our regalia calling our<br>community and leaders together and<br>celebrating which is why we're here<br>tonight and also why we're going to<br>invite you to join us at the staff club<br>afterwards for some informal<br>refreshments in celebration but for<br>as academic leaders here at the<br>University this is also a selfish<br>exercise to forget about everything else<br>for an hour or so and hear about the<br>wonderful work and achievements of some<br>of the finest minds from one of our<br>colleagues you know we often say this is<br>pure academics part-time for us my duty<br>here tonight is on behalf of the<br>vice-chancellor who was overseas is to<br>set the scene and then hand over to<br>associate professor Andrew Moore the<br>head of the philosophy program to<br>introduce professor Ellis a new topic to<br>you in more detail then at the end we<br>will we might allow I think we will<br>allow professor Tony Ballentine as the<br>PVC of humanities to give a vote of<br>thanks and lead us to the staff club so<br>as I've indicated already we set very<br>high standards for a professorial<br>promotion and in this process we seek<br>the views of many others I have had the<br>privilege to be able to see some of the<br>things that have been written about<br>Lisa's status and contributions and from<br>those assessments it's very clear to me<br>that the staffing Advisory Committee and<br>the vice-chancellor made a very wise and<br>I think quite a straightforward decision<br>in your case Lisa as DVC research I<br>would particularly like to highlight the<br>strength of your teaching portfolio not<br>only in the way that you have<br>demonstrated and continue to demonstrate<br>the clear link between your research and<br>ongoing review and enhancement of your<br>course materials but pizza particularly<br>in the leadership that you are shown in<br>growing and developing our PPE program<br>in your role as director since 2016 you<br>have taken the programs within that<br>philosophy politics and economics are<br>sweet from strength to strength in a<br>time of great change and for that we are<br>immensely grateful before handing it<br>over to Andrew to introduce you I'd like<br>to just to make a few personal remarks<br>on the topic of your lecture tonight<br>rationale enviromental optimism I'm a<br>physicist but do some work on renewable<br>energy technology so I'm very interested<br>to wonder whether we should be taking an<br>optimistic view of the future or with<br>what we know highlighting the immense<br>challenges and problems that lie ahead<br>to achieve a sustainable future for us<br>in this beautiful planet that we occupy<br>one of my one of the current guides of<br>my thinking is the great modern<br>philosopher Emmett<br>from the lego movie and his everything<br>is awesome approach to the world in<br>perhaps if if we can't claim that<br>something as awesome then in a<br>challenging situation we might describe<br>it as an interesting problem to overcome<br>so I look forward to hearing tonight if<br>you think Emmett was well guided or not<br>in sitting his everything is awesome<br>world view but more specifically I've<br>been inspired just this week actually<br>last Friday with a particularly awesome<br>example of rational environmental<br>optimism a major academic and citizen<br>science study was published last week in<br>the journal Science identifying that<br>concerted reforest ation of a billion<br>hectares of suitable land identified<br>through a Google Maps citizen science<br>survey could remove up to two-thirds of<br>all anthropogenic carbon emitted in our<br>industrial age isn't that awesome or is<br>it interesting<br>the challenge is large and would involve<br>planting a trillion trees a thousand<br>billion trees but breaking that down it<br>comes to only a hundred trees per person<br>on earth<br>so with the right effort we could get<br>that job to underway and act it quickly<br>so is that awesome or is it interesting<br>and the cost are mere 300 billion but<br>that certainly involve affordable anyway<br>as well as testing my general outlook<br>tonight I'm also interested to reflect<br>on whether things like that are wild and<br>crazy ideas that we should put aside or<br>are very rational environmental<br>optimism's from which we can take<br>inspiration and lead to action so with<br>that please excuse my personal<br>reflections Lisa I give you my sincere<br>congratulations for your promotion and<br>my best wishes for the good and<br>important world that lies ahead of you<br>nor later Tina Coto Tinoco 13 at Tata<br>katana thank you<br>hirato professor baekje Kuroko to<br>Couture and got me a newie good evening<br>to all it's my honor this evening to<br>introduce professor Lisa Ellis Lisa's be<br>a summa laude was in Germanic<br>languages and literatures from Princeton<br>her MA was in political science from<br>University of California Berkeley and so<br>was her PhD she has had academic<br>positions at Universe University of<br>California San Diego takes us a and M in<br>two stints I think Princeton is a<br>visiting member at the Institute for<br>Advanced Study and of course here at<br>Otago first in philosophy only and then<br>also in political science and ongoing in<br>Lisa's wider roles to many a number and<br>here I'll just pick out three of those<br>as a revered and highly effective<br>director of Otago is PPE program from<br>2016<br>now Richard has already mentioned that<br>as a panel member in the most recent New<br>Zealand PPR F research assessment round<br>that was last year and as editor in the<br>field of political theory for the highly<br>regarded Journal of politics Lisa tells<br>me with some relief that she's now<br>finished distant the topic area for Lisa<br>Allison's lecture this evening is the<br>environment our environment its<br>vulnerabilities its prospects and what<br>it's best that we do about these things<br>James to present to us good reasons for<br>our action that's the rationale bit of<br>the three word title as well I think<br>experience<br>professor Alice's orientation manner and<br>the content that she'll deliver us to<br>the seasoning is also engaged active<br>optimistic in the election professor<br>Alice will connect also themes of<br>rationality and optimism to parts of her<br>intellectual life and career to date and<br>of course ongoing win political<br>philosophy ethics or political theory is<br>done in a high altitude abstract sort of<br>way it sometimes doesn't engage with the<br>big stakes issues of its time when Lisa<br>Ellis does political philosophy ethics<br>and political theory it does perform<br>well at high altitude but I think we'll<br>also see this evening its performance -<br>powerful effect on some of the biggest<br>stakes issues of our time<br>the themes of optimism and rationality<br>resonate widely too with Lisa Ellis the<br>person teacher colleague and peer lisa<br>is optimistic she sees what's good in<br>others and she gets alongside others<br>effectively together making further good<br>things happen<br>she's a rational person - offering good<br>reasons<br>others can recognize and act on hate and<br>engaging generously with the reasons<br>that others bring forward lisa is also<br>willing to nudge others respectively<br>respectfully respectively as well when<br>they could do even better with their<br>ideas or with their rationale for those<br>ideas to my mind it's an honor when one<br>is engaged with in that serious and<br>constructive way and he said in my<br>experience does this so that reason<br>among many others we're lucky to have<br>Lisa Ellis yeah among us<br>let me now invite professor Ellis to<br>address us<br>got a coach of keturah thank you<br>everyone for coming out today it's just<br>delightful to see all of you so the<br>title of my talk today has already been<br>referenced rational environmental<br>optimism my goal is that many of you<br>will leave here today believing that<br>that is not an oxymoron um we'll see how<br>it goes I'm just gonna list the reasons<br>as they accumulate so we all know the<br>reasons for pessimism it seems like<br>every few days there's a new report from<br>some official place the UN local<br>Commission informing us about our<br>unsustainable use of some resource that<br>we need to flourish it could be the<br>atmospheric sink it could be the species<br>that we need to flourish together the<br>fruits and the creatures of the earth it<br>could be something as ordinary as sand<br>there's a recent US report on our<br>unsustainable use of sand seems like the<br>bad news just keeps coming and if it<br>seems like the bad news is accelerating<br>that's because it is there was six years<br>between Rachel Carson's Silent Spring<br>and the 1968 Population Bomb there were<br>six months between the IPCC's global<br>warming report recommending that we had<br>maybe a dozen years to get down to the<br>prospect of restricting global heating<br>to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial<br>mean and then right away we had the IP<br>BES report predicting about a million<br>extinctions so if you get into the weeds<br>and environmental policy you have even<br>more reasons for pessimism you for<br>example will learn about the enormous<br>barriers we have built for ourselves to<br>transitioning to a clean and<br>economy things like the the scale of<br>subsidies of the fossil fuel industry<br>are staggering and you learn what a tiny<br>fraction of humanity is benefiting in<br>the short term from the structures we've<br>built for ourselves in fact the<br>overwhelming majority of people are on<br>the losing end of the structures that<br>we've built now most people for example<br>have never taken an international flight<br>the most vulnerable are the ones having<br>to adapt the quickest to the changes<br>that have benefited a few if you get<br>into the weeds you might notice the<br>incredibly well resourced and well oiled<br>army of apologists and propagandists for<br>the status quo<br>it's a funny fact about the global<br>public opinion that it tends to the most<br>of the climate deniers tend to speak<br>English actually it's funny that a<br>narrated not so funny so you would maybe<br>be a little pessimistic about the<br>difference between the resourcing<br>offered the status quo and the<br>resourcing offered science and<br>environmental justice which are on the<br>same side maybe most challenging of all<br>for those of us who think about this<br>with any frequency most challenging of<br>all is the mere fact of foul ability a<br>mere fact of porridge ability we are<br>scientists we know that many of the<br>things that we haven't that we've<br>predicted a lot unlikely to happen of<br>those some of them will it's some low<br>possibility contingencies will eventuate<br>really hope not this one if you're<br>having if you'd like to spend a few<br>nights not sleeping the hot house Earth<br>report is for you so despite all this<br>despite all this sobering news I think<br>there are good reasons for<br>optimism so this I'm gonna say now and<br>again this is what hope looks like you<br>guys remember there's been a series of<br>really ordinary community meetings here<br>in Dunedin where people get together<br>across difference and try to figure out<br>how can we come to terms with our future<br>together in this meeting there are<br>academics young people there are old<br>people there are property owners or<br>renters they're representatives of<br>government showing up humbly and<br>listening there are people whose whole<br>job is to engage with the community this<br>kind of stuff is it puts my students to<br>sleep faster than anything except can't<br>this this is what hope looks like people<br>coming together can make good decisions<br>about our collective futures we just<br>have to organize it properly it's<br>institutions and structures that bar us<br>from making progress not some basic<br>human flaw I'm so before I go on I want<br>to stop and say some thank yous and<br>first of all I want to thank my family I<br>want to thank Mike that's not his dog<br>but it's a great picture Mike thank you<br>for all these conversations and I wanted<br>to thank you in public especially for<br>all those times you didn't mention that<br>I'd I've argued the opposite weeks or<br>months or years ago I also want to thank<br>you for being willing to be one out of<br>four or five in an argument so<br>frequently and to persist in those<br>positions even when none of us are<br>getting it<br>speaking of us thank you for being<br>willing to be the sole male member of<br>our family with a female cat and three<br>of us women and thanks to Susie and<br>Allison for all these great<br>conversations over dinner not at dinner<br>about books about things I'm obsessing<br>with that you don't care about I should<br>also thank by the way anyone who's had<br>the bad luck to have to sit next to the<br>four of us at a restaurant who I all<br>those people<br>apology actually okay so I am a<br>political theorist as you've heard and<br>these days I'm interested in how we<br>structure our common relationships to<br>engage with environmental problems but I<br>got started in political theory being<br>interested in the history of political<br>thought in like so many academics I got<br>to this place through a mixture of<br>failure and dumb luck as I showed up at<br>Princeton I wanted to be a physics major<br>the final exam score was 8 out of 200<br>and that was a pretty clear signal that<br>I needed to find something else to do I<br>took the advice of a thoughtful Dean who<br>said I should travel and thanks to a<br>generous donor Fred Fox and his friends<br>I was able to go to Germany and study at<br>the Goethe Institute and it turned out<br>that learning German was exactly what I<br>needed when I returned to my studies I<br>dove into German philosophy German<br>politics German literature and I was<br>very inspired especially by Bernie Yaak<br>whose course on marx nietzsche and freud<br>showed me that the structures we<br>encounter are not just some reality that<br>exists accidentally but actually one<br>paid by people with interests and<br>benefits some people and harm some<br>people and affect all of us in different<br>ways and it really showed me why it's<br>worth thinking about the patterns that<br>we make in society and once we do that<br>maybe we can think about changing them<br>so with Marx's famous thesis 11 firmly<br>in mind I embarked on what ended up a<br>lifetime of political philosophy so<br>first I studied German idealism with<br>Eckert Forster a marvelous teacher who I<br>note is still this is a recent picture<br>teaching the same stuff he was great he<br>did all his own translations he would<br>stand behind the lectern and blush would<br>go up his head he would read this<br>precious stuff you know the the notes<br>of a conversation between Hegel and his<br>roommates late at night at the seminary<br>and Tubingen where they talked about how<br>they were going to remake the modern<br>world and that poetry was going to link<br>science and meaning and make everything<br>as beautiful as the old enchanted world<br>only more rational so in the seminar<br>with Forrester we were like Hegel in his<br>roommates we argue passionately about<br>ideas I remember one time we were<br>reading Marx's 1848 manuscripts one<br>member of our seminar said if only Marx<br>that understood modern industrial<br>relations theory this would have been<br>much better<br>another student she stood up just<br>completely speechless and grabbed a<br>chair and through it to express himself<br>it was a beautiful seminar in a lovely<br>space that we'd happen in the late<br>afternoon the Sun came in perfectly<br>we were like Hagel and his roommates and<br>tubing and it was really a magical time<br>it was the place to fall in love which I<br>did and there he is 30 years later so<br>the last two years of undergrad I just<br>want to say for the students in the room<br>they were intoxicating I've been<br>connected with the university<br>continuously ever since those days I<br>have never had as intellectually rich a<br>time as those two years work and it has<br>been pretty good since then I'm the<br>specific content of what you take<br>matters much less than the depth and<br>breadth with which you engage it and I<br>know that today's undergrads here at<br>Otago are experiencing at least as hatea<br>mix as I did back in the day 30 years<br>ago and this I'd like to say is my first<br>reason for optimism that no significant<br>transformational change has ever<br>occurred without a combination of civic<br>action and leadership and the civic<br>action has to be energy at the<br>grassroots and we are seeing that now<br>thanks to our amazing young people much<br>more boring so I went on to grad school<br>about before I did that I wrote a really<br>Turin thesis on Hamas thanks to my<br>patient advisors<br>I got good advice I moved away from some<br>of that rigidity and I went on to grad<br>school to study at first Heidegger and<br>later can't I was so lucky to happen<br>upon a seminar taught by a new professor<br>Shannon Stimson I some study of Kant as<br>an undergrad a pretty traditional<br>introduction to it was completely<br>different in Shannon's seminar we read<br>Locke and Hume and Kant we looked at<br>their metaphysical work we looked at<br>their moral philosophy and we looked at<br>their political<br>theory these guys engaged in the<br>ordinary politics of the day in a way<br>that just as any of us would<br>passionately not in a way that was I<br>love that phrase high-altitude um so uh<br>Shannon gave me actually I'm still<br>grateful a copy of the book that got me<br>started in my research by Patrick Reilly<br>where he surveyed all these texts that<br>nobody else ever read at this point so<br>from what is enlightenment all the way<br>to conflict of the faculties uh you guys<br>may have heard of these but back then<br>hardly anybody read them I'm so conked<br>he was writing at a time that was really<br>not that different than ours his most<br>famous words were part of an essay that<br>was arguing about whether the state<br>should meddle in the rules about who<br>could marry whom and how but it sounds<br>familiar<br>Conte was writing in these minor essays<br>about how to have good conversations and<br>how to make politicians notice and<br>especially how we could learn to think<br>for ourselves<br>um so these words should be familiar to<br>everybody at Otago right separate haba<br>mujika an agonist forced on stupid Enon<br>not that last bit obviously more like<br>this have the courage to make use of<br>your own understanding or my preferred<br>translation dare to think for yourself<br>I'm so one thing that runs through my<br>work from my early turgid work on harbor<br>mas to my slightly less urgent work on<br>Conte is this interest in critical<br>reasoning so critical reasoning in<br>public for Kant is the key to progress<br>and that is going to be my second reason<br>for optimism I know it sounds hokey I<br>hope it sounds less hokey in a few<br>minutes there really is something about<br>egalitarian reciprocal engaged effort<br>over time to try to reach solutions to<br>problems that affect us together<br>remember that picture that is what hope<br>looks like everybody was sitting at the<br>same level there was no rank people were<br>committed to coming back over the months<br>and years people were respecting each<br>other by writing out what they had to<br>see something about that structure that<br>allows us to get to our best outcomes<br>before I move on I just want to thank<br>some of the people who helped me<br>understand can't so Chris Larson was<br>incredibly generous he didn't even know<br>me I sent him the dissertation chapter<br>he commented on it it was great I also<br>want to thank Michael avec Monte and<br>Tracey strong and Henry Allison them who<br>were all really supportive so I wrote a<br>lot about Conte but I learned from<br>philosophy 103 students that it's not a<br>good idea if you want to hold people's<br>attention to talk about Contra very long<br>in fact if you notice I did this poll<br>green means hated and blue means loved<br>him take a look trust me when I tell you<br>there really are things to love about<br>count what I love about him most is the<br>way he interprets the world as something<br>that is provisional rather than<br>conclusive when it comes to our<br>arrangements to live with each other so<br>concepts always leave open the<br>possibility of entering a rightful<br>condition that's his answer to how it is<br>that we can have principles interaction<br>respect each other as deeply as we're<br>supposed to respect each other and yet<br>have deep disagreement about the<br>principles on which that's based we<br>should make sure that we're always<br>talking and that we retain the<br>opportunity to change these institutions<br>that affect us differently as we go on<br>none of these decisions are permanent<br>Concord have said in a republic cherski<br>says in a democracy this is another<br>source of optimism for me that however<br>poorly we have constructed the<br>institutions that may have us make<br>decisions about for example our energy<br>regime these are always revisable so I<br>know this is too much cut already and I<br>am close to getting back to<br>environmental questions I was working on<br>my sac<br>book on Conte but this time it was Conte<br>and policy analysis and I was interested<br>in this idea of what we do in the face<br>of inconstancy I was so inspired by it<br>that I included this lovely little song<br>by Shakespeare as an epigraph it was<br>completely misunderstood people read my<br>book looking for the feminist theory and<br>never found it I wasn't talking about<br>man is a separate gender at this I<br>wanted to show that human beings were<br>capable of keeping talking in a pleasant<br>way maybe even singing even as they were<br>constantly proving to each other that<br>they couldn't be constant anyway watch<br>out with those epigraphs they're easy to<br>get misunderstood um so when I was<br>working on this book I found a policy on<br>that seemed to undermine this continent<br>optimism about talking having a politics<br>of permanent contestation is great and<br>it's going to continue to be my source<br>of hope but there's one problem with it<br>when it comes to environmental policy<br>and that's when you're making<br>irreversible decisions it turned out<br>that there are lots of policies where if<br>you make an irreversible decision you're<br>not keeping options open<br>you're foreclosing future options for<br>future people the policy I was most<br>interested in with and I won't get too<br>deep in the weeds on this one but at the<br>time I was very interested in a revision<br>of the Endangered Species Act in the<br>United States<br>it went from a sort of standard top-down<br>commanded Control centrally administered<br>policy to being revised something that<br>looked really devolved and democratic<br>local people could deliberate about what<br>were called habitat conservation plans<br>and they could allow development for<br>their collective benefit as long as they<br>promise to mitigate that development<br>somewhere else and this looked like the<br>proverbial win-win and I've since<br>learned that if somebody says to you<br>this is a win-win you should make sure<br>that they're not picking your pocket it<br>turns out as<br>student of mine this is Brian Shrek who<br>is now working at the University of<br>Wyoming a student of mine actually found<br>the smoking gun memo where the lobbyists<br>for property developers literally wrote<br>the revised Endangered Species Act<br>process because they were able to game<br>the system and Brian's dissertation<br>showed using game theory exactly how the<br>revisions to the Endangered Species Act<br>made it almost inevitable that the<br>process would streamline development and<br>fail to protect species in my book I had<br>a case study of one of my favorite<br>critters the fairy shrimp it's hard to<br>get more uncharismatic than the fairy<br>shrimp the fairy shrimp is if you don't<br>already know it's invisible most of the<br>time when it's not invisible it's teeny<br>it spends most of its life as an<br>insisted embryo living in a dry sometime<br>vernal pool most of the time mudhole<br>this particular species of fairy shrimp<br>only inhabits flat land in Southern<br>California within a few miles of the<br>coast guess how expensive that land is<br>right so it was a perfect example of<br>whether the Endangered Species Act under<br>the new process would function to<br>protect against extinction and it turned<br>out that the discourse around fairy<br>shrimp reservation ended up being framed<br>as fairy shrimp versus children there<br>was an attempt to build an elementary<br>school and one of the last vernal pools<br>in Southern California and the people<br>living in the new suburb certainly<br>wanted their school and to them it<br>looked like human interest versus<br>natural interest but if you looked at<br>the history of the decision things<br>looked very different it turned out that<br>all of this suburb it was called Miramar<br>perfect developer named all of this<br>suburb had been developed by one<br>corporation and they took all of the<br>land that<br>have rental pools on it and put<br>privately-owned houses and sold them for<br>to privatize that game and then they<br>gifted the vernal pool land to the state<br>for things like schools oh so it turned<br>out that repeatedly what the new process<br>did was ratchet toward extinction it<br>every decision was either a provisional<br>win for the protection of species or a<br>permanent win for development there was<br>only one way for policy to go and so you<br>can see that this would be a pretty<br>strong sobering message for somebody<br>who'd been so enthusiastic about the<br>content talking cure for what ails us<br>this is not going to be one of my causes<br>of optimism but just wait it turns out<br>that the same style of deliberative<br>mechanism that was so dysfunctional in<br>the revised Endangered Species Act could<br>be remade so that Brian wouldn't have to<br>find a smoking gun and if he'd modeled<br>it game theoretically it wouldn't<br>necessarily benefit developers it is<br>possible to order your deliberative<br>process such that people are able to<br>consider their general interest rather<br>than something short-term and selfish<br>it's possible to get people to respond<br>against these resilient policies<br>resilient against the public will that<br>will go in only one direction as long as<br>they have the capacity collectively to<br>commit consider these general problems<br>like what will happen over hundreds of<br>years think for example of the problem<br>that we're all going to be dealing with<br>soon and that Janice Lord is dealing<br>with in particular these days what kind<br>of trees should we plant should we plant<br>the short run quick hit trees or should<br>we plant the biodiversity enhancing long<br>run carbon sucking lovely native trees<br>how could we make this decision we need<br>to structure the decision so it's<br>possible for us to be collectively<br>rational this is possible and that is my<br>fourth reason for optimism<br>so I got hooked on environmental<br>questions after doing that chapter of my<br>book and I took a year's leave to try to<br>turn myself into an environmental<br>political philosopher thank you<br>Michael Walzer for hosting me that was<br>really great I had a lot of fun walking<br>in these woods<br>I also benefited very much from the<br>mentorship of people who were already at<br>mid-career and had been studying<br>environmental political theory ever<br>since they got started<br>sandi henchmen especially it was<br>extremely grateful putting together what<br>was back in the day a stack of Xerox<br>copies and to get me started I also<br>learned a lot from John Mayer and Steve<br>Vander Heiden<br>and David's lost Berg who is now in<br>Australia no longer in the u.s. I'm so<br>able to work with me even today I also<br>got good tutoring at the Association for<br>political theory meetings there is me<br>running a meeting during a stint as<br>co-president of that wonderfully<br>nurturing group you notice that my<br>fellows are paying a lot of attention<br>but it was it's the best picture I could<br>find of me running those things that was<br>a great place to learn to think about<br>what mattered and not just to rely on my<br>background and so I have become an<br>environmental political theorist and I<br>take a broadly Democratic perspective<br>there's still some content twists like I<br>care about public reason and I care<br>about how we order our relations to each<br>other thanks to the mentorship of Ian<br>Shapiro I learned how to think about<br>problem driven rather than principle<br>oriented political theory I look at what<br>are the affective implications of the<br>way we structure our relationships and<br>tried to reveal those to people and as<br>I've already said it became clear to me<br>that for environmental policies they<br>tend to be very difficult to structure<br>so that we can have our long-run<br>cross difference cross geography<br>interest served instead they tend to be<br>focused on our discrete short-run<br>interests I'm so why is that a source of<br>optimism you might wonder it's a source<br>of optimism because if there's one thing<br>human beings are good at its solving<br>collective action problems I don't have<br>time to talk about my work on Hobbes but<br>anybody who shares enthusiasm for Hobbes<br>with me will know that this is what<br>humans do best give us half a chance and<br>we will solve these problems so early on<br>I focused on the sort of anti<br>majoritarian nature of environmental<br>decision-making but traditionally we<br>think about environmental problems in<br>collective action terms and frequently<br>as tragedies of the Commons anyone who's<br>been my students like Oh God not that<br>again I'm not going to explain it don't<br>worry just referring to it so Commons<br>theorists tend to treat everybody is<br>having the same sorts of interests and<br>if we structure our relationships so<br>that we can't coordinate we end up<br>somewhere none of us ever wanted to be<br>so eating our seed corn polluting our<br>atmosphere I'm not having any pop mmm<br>parking if we don't charge enough for it<br>these sorts of things um and I really<br>like Hardin's theory I think it explains<br>a lot but there are a couple of things<br>that I I don't like about the mainstream<br>Commons theory one of them yeah one of<br>them is that it's just not true that we<br>need a Leviathan like state in order to<br>solve collective action problems from<br>Elinor Ostrom on we've had there's<br>plenty of evidence that people without a<br>Leviathan like state are perfectly<br>capable giving decent needs to be given<br>decent institutions perfectly capable of<br>self-organizing<br>I've got lots of sat on lots of<br>dissertation committees that found<br>evidence of this I think this is one of<br>the reasons we can be optimistic even<br>about the Paris climate agreements<br>because if you look at Kyoto<br>a top-down command and control elite<br>driven kind of can kicking institution<br>where people were able to tell each<br>other they were solving problems while<br>in fact they were distributing slices of<br>not anything right whereas the Paradis<br>agreements for all their faults are<br>bottom up commitments that people have<br>collaborate ly collaboratively worked on<br>that we're expected all the way down to<br>get together and figure out how to do<br>this it's a much more promising strategy<br>so I don't think that Hardin and others<br>are right that we need some central<br>world state in order to solve these<br>problems I think we don't it's hard but<br>it's possible and I also think that the<br>general orientation of Commons problems<br>that makes it look like everybody is<br>equally responsible for these problems<br>that's also wrong mostly with<br>environmental problems because most<br>environmental problems involve very<br>small number of people extracting a lot<br>of value at the expense of everybody<br>else<br>so actually believe it or not I think<br>that's a reason for optimism why is that<br>a reason for optimism because democracy<br>hasn't failed it just hasn't really been<br>tried if you went around and asked<br>everybody on earth do you endorse the<br>status quo how do you feel about a world<br>in which an oil company can send a group<br>of people to your country<br>and they will buy off your leaders with<br>the rents and they'll you turn around<br>use those rents to dominate you and you<br>can suck up that pollution and enjoy the<br>resulting conflict how many people would<br>endorse that right how many people would<br>endorse the status quo in which the vast<br>majority of people or subsistence<br>farmers and fishers are bearing the cost<br>of a few people fewer than 90 companies<br>are responsible for most of the<br>emissions right so how many people are<br>going to endorse this the optimism<br>inducing part of this fact is that the<br>transformative change is going to<br>benefit all of us I think the arguments<br>are on our sides we just<br>the structures to get to them our faith<br>in the human capacity to organized for<br>good should be unshaken institutions are<br>always in flux and we know now a lot<br>more than we ever did about how to build<br>them so this brings me to the last stage<br>of my career in the last stage of my<br>talk which is the incredible privilege<br>it has been and still is to have arrived<br>here at Otago I've been so lucky to work<br>with colleagues across the disciplines<br>since I got here I don't have time to<br>name all of the fruitful collaborations<br>but they have been many from both<br>departments that I teach in to also<br>teaching in the ecology Department<br>liaison with other staff through the<br>Otago Climate Change Network and<br>thinking together about things at the<br>Center for sustainability this Hedgehog<br>stands for the wonderful college<br>community of scholars that is the PPE<br>thank you Charles and David from making<br>the PPE exist and thank you students for<br>thinking with me there is no better<br>group of people to try to solve the<br>problems about of environmental<br>degradation within the people years so<br>it is absolutely extraordinary to be<br>here you say a few things about some of<br>what we've done together so together<br>with my colleagues James hi um and James<br>McLaren I've been working on a problem<br>the collective ethics of flying so<br>everybody knows that effectively I said<br>that what I do rate I'm a sort of<br>problem driven theorist I try to<br>describe what it is this structure of<br>relationships actually looks like how<br>are we relating to each other well if<br>you look at aviation as a sector it's<br>exempted from even the Paris Accords<br>aviation as a sector it looks like a<br>tiny percentage of all the people in the<br>world are taking an increasing chunk of<br>the global carbon budget and<br>transferring all of that<br>onto people who have no prospect ever in<br>their lives of getting on an<br>international flight so I could say a<br>lot more about that but basically we<br>wrote one paper in which we talked about<br>the failure of arguments at the<br>individual level to have any traction<br>with this problem and eventually talked<br>about the potential of collective action<br>solutions of treating this like a social<br>convention where we have to<br>simultaneously step out of it this has<br>potential real potential to make a<br>difference to the enormous Lea<br>unsustainable aviation another problem<br>I've been working on with colleagues<br>here and including James McLaren and<br>others has to do with predator-free New<br>Zealand so James who I think has a cold<br>yeah James has a cold he has this<br>wonderful way of describing New<br>Zealand's expertise global leadership<br>I've been you will like this New Zealand<br>global leader<br>what are we glow bolita at maintaining<br>senescent species for a bit longer<br>that's James not me but it really does<br>say something how can we avoid a<br>ratcheting down in our ambition to<br>protect New Zealand's endemics if what<br>we're really doing is protecting a few<br>senescent species and losing the battle<br>every year we have to think about<br>opportunity costs we have to think about<br>what kind of social licence really needs<br>to be built to make any progress in this<br>area I'm gonna skip a third project on<br>measuring uses of ecosystem services but<br>I do want to thank Alex Gregory whose<br>research assistance on the project was<br>incredibly useful and gonna move on to<br>last project on the risks of sea-level<br>rise so thanks to Janet Stevenson in<br>particular into the deep south national<br>science challenge in general I've been<br>able with a couple of really excellent<br>research assistants Lauren Holloway and<br>Britta Clarke been able to think through<br>these questions of what does the status<br>quo look like for sea level rise in New<br>Zealand and how could we possibly do<br>better and to make a long story quite<br>short we concluded that the<br>two different worlds for sea level rise<br>risk there's the world of risky coastal<br>development and there's the world of at<br>risk existing development and the moral<br>structures of those two are really quite<br>different<br>the for at risk Costa Valley for risky<br>coastal development it's almost as if<br>we've structured a world in which<br>someone with money to invest is drawn<br>not through even any fault of their own<br>but just through the structure they're<br>drawn to play chicken with society we<br>aristocrats due to natural hazard and we<br>have gap enos in the law it's not clear<br>who's going to be responsible for sea<br>level rise and other climate driven<br>losses at the coasts even though we know<br>those are going to happen um so people<br>have quite a strong incentive to pile<br>investment additional socially<br>suboptimal utility right there at the<br>coast where it's most risky hoping maybe<br>even organizing to make sure that<br>ordinary people bail them out and we<br>recommended central government action<br>for this to change and who knows that<br>there's good news on that front from the<br>draft Productivity Commission report<br>when you look at at risk existing<br>development the picture is morally<br>totally different in this case the big<br>worry is that people won't have a say in<br>the policies that affect them people who<br>live in these at-risk areas and we know<br>all about that here in Dunedin are<br>worried that experts from outside are<br>going to show up and tell them all they<br>have to move and this would be a moral<br>outrage fortunately we've seen that<br>there is hope in this area that people<br>really are quite good at collaborating<br>with each other to imagine their futures<br>and there's just such positive work<br>happening right now in Dunedin and<br>elsewhere on this score<br>is where I want to be yes so despite<br>everything it's my view um that we have<br>in fact arrived at what could be a<br>transformational moment what I think<br>will be a transformational moment that<br>will move our structures of relations to<br>each other to a place where we are more<br>able to flourish collectively not to eat<br>our seed corn not to transfer risk on to<br>the most vulnerable whether those are<br>the future people who can't represent<br>themselves at all or people who are<br>economically Willard or even<br>geographically vulnerable we know that<br>this kind of transformational change is<br>possible now because we see this<br>combination of leadership and civic<br>action finally coming together we see<br>adaptive community action in places like<br>south and even led by wonderful teams<br>like the one we enjoy here at the DCC we<br>could not be luckier they here they are<br>mentoring our PPE students thank you<br>very much GCC and I think it gives us<br>legitimate cause for optimism and so I<br>don't want to quit today without saying<br>one final thank you and that's not all<br>my students who have worked with me<br>since I got to Otago I am so grateful to<br>that you are willing to talk to me about<br>the things that I care about obsessively<br>and also the things that you care about<br>and I'm so proud are the accomplishments<br>of these students these are just<br>pictures of a very few of them but they<br>are truly awesome and give us real<br>tena koutou katoa my name is Tony<br>Valentine and I'm the PVC humanity's<br>yellow tiger and it's with great<br>pleasure that I'll deliver a vote of<br>thanks to Professor Ellis I think it's<br>very clear that professor Ellis has<br>delivered a truly excellent lecture she<br>has said err a strong and positive case<br>for rational environmental optimism at<br>the outset she know that it noted that<br>there are many reasons that might<br>encourage us to adopt a pessimistic<br>outlook the constant increasing flow of<br>alarming scientific research policy<br>papers and media reports on the erosion<br>of biodiversity the acceleration of<br>environmental degradation the weight of<br>evidence around the impact of climate<br>change in the power of vested interests<br>committed to protecting the economic and<br>political investments of a small number<br>of companies that effectively control<br>global energy transportation industries<br>and media outlets so there are very real<br>reasons for concern but in the face of<br>these challenges<br>she has see there are many reasons for<br>optimism including the human capacity<br>for cooperation and collaboration and<br>the untapped possibilities of democracy<br>even as we recognize current<br>institutional and structural failings<br>and of course professor Ellis has<br>reminded us of the powerful potential of<br>the passion and vision of students and<br>the younger generation committed to the<br>need for urgent change to address<br>massive environmental transformations I<br>think it was also powerful to listen to<br>professor Ellis reflections on her own<br>academic pathway and the development of<br>a research trajectory that has<br>eventually led her to environmental<br>political theory one of the things that<br>was incredibly striking I think is the<br>generosity of her intellectual<br>Sensibility and that shone through and<br>who taught and surely she clearly<br>communicated the complex<br>and important connections that developed<br>over time we see them here in visual<br>form many of those of course were<br>personal with teachers supervisors<br>collaborators and colleagues and<br>students who she noted at the end in<br>particular but also family she reminded<br>us that for many scholars as well and<br>the humanities and social sciences<br>intellectual trajectories are shaped by<br>key ticks whether those in her case were<br>by Heidegger hubber mouse marks or cants<br>which we engage with and we turn to<br>again and again to revisit until we<br>think Lisa's taught has given us a<br>strong sense of an intellectual<br>trajectory shaped by such engagements<br>and I think an enduring influence of an<br>engagement with the German language or<br>German intellectual tradition one aspect<br>of a talk was really striking and that<br>was talk itself the centrality of talk<br>and conversation and her account of her<br>intellectual life into research this<br>obviously is a key dimension of her<br>pedagogy and of the day-to-day routines<br>of who work and the familial<br>conversations there are so clearly<br>energizing and a forum for her to first<br>test out their ideas but talk and<br>conversation was also central to our<br>understanding of the possibilities of<br>political change even within the context<br>of this contestation in political<br>uncertainty for me in my own work one of<br>the key quotes that frames my thought<br>comes from the great Austrian historian<br>anthropologist of the Pacific regaining<br>who said we make all our relationships<br>by talked all their institutions all our<br>roles and that is a formulation that<br>really Accords I think with what lisa<br>has articulated so eloquently in her<br>lecture this evening and in her vision<br>of the positive possibilities for change<br>at this urgent moment so Lisa<br>professor Ellis I know that all of us<br>are here students colleagues from across<br>the division and the wider University<br>family and friends we are really<br>delighted to be sharing with you and<br>this very special occasion<br>so could you all please join me and<br>thinking Lisa I've a gift to present to<br>her and after there I'll encourage you<br>to follow the academic position to the<br>staff Club will have the opportunity to<br>engage further</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin:
