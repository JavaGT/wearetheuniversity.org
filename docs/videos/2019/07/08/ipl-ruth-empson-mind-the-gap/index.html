vice<br>chancellor here at the University of<br>Otago and it is a great pleasure for me<br>to be here to open this inaugural<br>professorial lecture for professor Ruth<br>Empson these lectures are really a time<br>of celebration for the university<br>community they obviously provide an<br>opportunity for us to showcase the<br>internationally recognised teaching and<br>research expertise of our staff but more<br>importantly perhaps they also provide a<br>unique opportunity for our brand new<br>professors to tell the story of their<br>academic journey and as we've learned<br>over the years these journeys often<br>involve the very special people in their<br>lives people who contributed to their<br>work and people who supported them along<br>the way and in my experience it's these<br>human stories that stick with us long<br>after the lecture is over the path to<br>professor here at the University of<br>Otago is not an easy one in order to<br>receive the promotion the applicant must<br>demonstrate excellence in teaching in<br>research and in service to the<br>university and to the wider community as<br>you will learn during the course of her<br>lecture this evening professor Empson is<br>a motivating teacher she is popular with<br>both undergraduates and postgraduate<br>students she also has an outstanding<br>track record of research and tonight we<br>will learn more about her groundbreaking<br>research on brain connections and<br>behavior and last but certainly not<br>least Ruth has also provided outstanding<br>service to her department to the<br>University<br>to the wider research community Ruth on<br>behalf of the University of Otago it<br>gives me great pleasure to congratulate<br>you on your very well-deserved promotion<br>to Professor and I will now call on<br>Professor Vernon ward who will tell us<br>just a little bit more about Ruth's<br>academic journey to Professor noreda<br>thank you very much Vice Chancellor tena<br>koe to Qatar Hawaii Nui tak welcome<br>everybody this is Professor Ruth<br>empson's inaugural professorial lecture<br>and it's my task and privilege as dean<br>of the school of biomedical sciences to<br>introduce professor incent to you this<br>evening so I'd like to thank you all for<br>coming along and a nice warm evening<br>with no air-conditioning an IPL is an<br>important component of celebrating and<br>recognizing a successful academic career<br>so professor Empson actually got a<br>professorial promotion last year but<br>lives in a way for a year on research<br>and study leave so for anybody thinking<br>that it's an out it's not you'd be sure<br>that you cannot escape from an IPL for<br>those of you who do not know professor<br>signaling a successful act got an MA and<br>Natural Sciences from Oxford University<br>in 1988 before obtaining her PhD at<br>Appirio College in the UK in 1993 in the<br>field of neuroscience so it was a 25<br>year journey for her from gaining her<br>PhD through to professor so then it's a<br>long journey along the way she's held<br>fellowships and the Germany she's also<br>then back to the UK and Oxford<br>Birmingham and she had a period as a<br>senior scientist that service limited in<br>the UK and I did have a little joke but<br>it's probably better I don't say so she<br>spent seven years as an academic at<br>Royal Holloway in the UK before joining<br>us here at Otago as a senior lecturer in<br>2007 she was subsequently being promoted<br>to associate professor in 2014 before<br>receiving her professorship in 2018<br>she's certainly earned her promote<br>- professor she has an H index of 35 and<br>that's a very good H index for those<br>that think of such things over 2,800<br>citations she's published in prestigious<br>journals such as neuron the Journal of<br>Neuroscience Journal of physiology and<br>she reviews widely - whole raft of<br>quality journals she's had substantial<br>research funding as a principal<br>investigator including from the BBSRC in<br>the time in the UK the Marsden fund here<br>in New Zealand and a whole plethora of<br>different funding organizations over her<br>career she's very active and a whole<br>raft of professional bodies including<br>roles and foundations and symposia and<br>conference chair ships advisory<br>committees board roles and all sorts of<br>those things and they and placed like<br>for the neurological foundation for the<br>Australasian neuroscience society the<br>brain research and New Zealand center of<br>research excellence and there's a long<br>list beyond that one area I would<br>highlight is how active professor in<br>saunas and our outreach activities she<br>does a lot of public lectures she does a<br>lot of commentaries and the press things<br>like ask a scientist for the OD tea is<br>there but she also does a lot of things<br>with the discipline speaking in the<br>community organizing various<br>organization meetings in the community<br>talking to you three a and on these are<br>on topics like movement tremors brain<br>and things that actually you know many<br>of us realize are really important so<br>she describes her research life as a<br>journey of investigation into how<br>connections and our brains work these<br>gaps or synapses are where information<br>flow is transformed and also controlled<br>understanding these connections and how<br>they change is critical to understanding<br>how our brains work and how they don't<br>work so for this inaugural professorial<br>lecture professor Empson will explore<br>his scientific and academic path<br>introducing and thanking people and<br>celebrating the work they have done she<br>will take you on a journey from isolated<br>synapse research 20 to 30 years ago to<br>what's happening today in terms of<br>studying sign APS's and living awake and<br>behaving animals quite the journey with<br>that I'd like to invite professor<br>Emerson to present her inaugural<br>professora lecture entitled mind the gap<br>and connections and behavior noreda Tina<br>Tammy IKEA etiquette our peer Nakata<br>so thank you very much humming and thank<br>you very much Vernon for those wonderful<br>introduction and thank you all so much<br>for being here I'm totally overwhelmed<br>and what a huge privilege it is for you<br>to all be here and thank you all very<br>much for coming so I hope what I'm going<br>to do is give you a taste of the journey<br>that my scientific career has been and<br>the title is a little bit of a play on<br>words in terms of connections because<br>the part of the break the part of the<br>brain that I work on is those synaptic<br>connections but the connections with<br>people have been as harine was saying is<br>the is where I want to take you today<br>and show you some of those very<br>important connections and no doubt I<br>haven't and can't talk about everyone<br>because well that would take me a very<br>long time but and so there are I hope<br>that you know if I don't talk about<br>certain parts of my work people won't be<br>offended by that so I'm going to start<br>off with a map of the London Underground<br>and those of you who have travelled the<br>London Underground will be aware of that<br>voice that says mind the gap and they're<br>talking about the gap between the train<br>and the station and I love this image of<br>this map because it's a useful map but<br>it also makes me think about the brain<br>and the stations along the way the<br>junctions if you like that you can take<br>a new train at and go in a different<br>direction and our brains are full of<br>these connections too as we'll see<br>infinitely more complex than the London<br>Underground is if the London Underground<br>wasn't complicated enough for some of us<br>as well so but the thing about the<br>London Underground is it takes millions<br>of passengers every day from one place<br>to another and it does so under immense<br>pressure<br>but it has all of these stations or<br>places where you can change connections<br>and that builds in a huge resilience to<br>this network and our brains are<br>immensely resilient to all of that that<br>we throw at them and so these<br>connections where in where you as a<br>passenger can change or where<br>information flow in the brain can change<br>are fundamentally important and so it's<br>those connections that I'm going to talk<br>about today so what is a synapse and I'm<br>going to call it a synapse showing my<br>British accent you might hear it as a<br>synapse but I'm probably going to say<br>synapse for most of the time it's a<br>junction or gap between nerve cells<br>where a nerve impulse so this is nervous<br>system information your thoughts right<br>now are going across these synaptic gaps<br>and it's where that information gets<br>transferred from one nerve cell to<br>another so it's a it is a real physical<br>gap and information crosses that gap and<br>it's actually transformed as it crosses<br>that gap it crosses that physical gap<br>electrical activity here at what we call<br>the terminus as another transport<br>analogy for you<br>the terminal here the presynaptic<br>terminal gets transferred to this post<br>synaptic terminal via this<br>transformation and that transformation<br>and what might be going on in that<br>transformation has fascinated me since<br>well since I started learning about<br>neuroscience and so why would I spend 30<br>years of my life thinking about these<br>structures and these systems well<br>they're fundamentally important and<br>understanding them is a fundamental for<br>our knowledge of how the brain works and<br>we're a long way from understanding that<br>but the synapse is within our brains are<br>connecting the different parts of our<br>brain that get recruited as you're<br>listening to me right now but sine APS's<br>are also important for us to understand<br>where our body is we've got in from<br>coming to into from our bodies into our<br>brain and our brain is sending signals<br>back out to our bodies and the synapse<br>is and connections that make up all of<br>that are critical to enable us to move<br>for example so when we're thinking about<br>synapse is there fundamental for<br>knowledge sake but in in many or any<br>neurological disease that you can think<br>of sign apps is are going to be altered<br>and messed up in some way so for that<br>reason they're important to study so<br>mind the gap we're going to talk about a<br>slightly different sort of gap now<br>there's a physical gap and there's also<br>a gap in time and this is a recording<br>from my PhD work and I'm going to call<br>it a squiggly line for want of a better<br>word and I want you to remember this<br>image for a little bit later on in the<br>talk as this squiggly line and what I'm<br>doing in this work that I'm going to<br>talk about a little later is I'm<br>recording the electrical activity on<br>this side and I'm stimulating this side<br>and you'll see that there's something we<br>call a baseline and then you'll see<br>there's a gap in time this is time going<br>along here very very fast this is<br>happening and there's a short delay<br>where's nothing it seems to happen and<br>then something happens squiggly line<br>changes direction<br>well actually everything is happening in<br>this gap in that gap it looks as if<br>nothing's happening but it's that<br>transformative process that is going on<br>in that gap in time so this gap in time<br>is very very important and we'll talk<br>about that I'll bring that into<br>something at the end of the lecture as<br>well so synapse is there this gap gap in<br>space gap in time and they're critical<br>for information transfer they're these<br>junctions or connection<br>there are kind of a go or no-go place<br>where information is transferred or not<br>transferred a little bit like coming up<br>to a junction in your car actually you<br>really should stop here but you might<br>not you might decide that you're not<br>going to stop but hopefully you will<br>stop and there will be a decision as to<br>which way you go or you might actually<br>decide to just stay where you are and<br>the way that this works is with another<br>key feature within neuroscience which is<br>something called the action potential<br>and what I'm showing here in the blue is<br>a kind of an artist's impression of a<br>squiggly line that could squiggly line<br>that I just showed you there's actually<br>no there's a little gap here and when<br>that squiggly line when the size of that<br>change goes above a certain value that<br>is defined by natural and physical<br>constants the an action potential is<br>generated and is so-called fired and<br>that action potential is the means by<br>which information travels long distances<br>but it has to be initiated by the<br>synapse by what's happening at this<br>synapse so information travels through<br>our bodies down down effectively<br>biological wires both in and out of our<br>brains via this activation process or<br>this go/no-go system and this is a<br>picture of a cerebellar brain cell it's<br>one of my favorite and Euron's we record<br>from them in in my lab on a daily basis<br>and they're so beautiful you can't<br>possibly not fall in love with this<br>beautiful structure and they're<br>beautiful because they also receive many<br>many thousands of sign APS's the<br>Purkinje neurons they sit in the<br>cerebellum the cerebellum is at the back<br>here of your head and right now you've<br>got thousands and thousands of Purkinje<br>neurons that are actually talking to<br>each other and communicating with each<br>other and if we zoom in on this and this<br>King jr. on actually puts out<br>information down that wire when you make<br>a movement or alter a movement or adjust<br>a movement so that's what the cerebellum<br>is important for and if we zoom in onto<br>that neuron that looks complicated<br>enough as it is what we see is even more<br>complexity we see these little<br>structures that are all individual<br>synapses so I showed you that sort of<br>one on one individual synapse<br>I can't even count them all so you start<br>to see that my map of the London<br>Underground is a vast simplification for<br>so the complexity and beauty of the<br>brain really fascinated me from the<br>beginning of my research career and it's<br>been a huge privilege to be able to<br>explore that beauty and it all started<br>with my PhD I guess and this is this is<br>my supervisor professor John Jeffries<br>this is where I did my PhD it's in<br>Mary's Hospital Medical School in<br>Paddington some of you might recognize<br>this this image if you follow Kate and<br>William or any of the royal family<br>maybe so nobody will own up to that but<br>the Royal babies are all born in the<br>Lindo wing that sim marries and the<br>Lindo wing goes I think just around the<br>corner from here the department where I<br>did my PhD is right here so I it was a<br>department of physiology and biophysics<br>and John took me on board I was<br>interested in learning more about<br>neurotransmitters ion channels and he<br>nurtured that interest in neuroscience<br>in me but I also wanted to just note<br>that John himself has a<br>very distinguished background John is<br>still active he's in Oxford these days<br>but he and I was one of many of his PhD<br>students there's a whole list of them<br>and he himself was a PhD student of a<br>neurologist called Tom Sears at the<br>institute of neurology and Tom Sears was<br>one of many many PhD students of Sir<br>John Kerry Eccles and Sir John Kerry<br>Eccles although it says a and you there<br>which stands for Australian National<br>University that's not that's true but<br>Sir John Eccles was also in physiology<br>at Otago and he is a tar goes only Nobel<br>prize-winner and although he didn't get<br>his Nobel Prize when he was at at agro<br>he got it when he was at amu much of the<br>work that he did towards figuring all of<br>the stuff that he got the Nobel Prize<br>for was done in Physiology in Lindo<br>Ferguson building in the basement<br>actually where my labs are right now so<br>I feel this tremendous connection to<br>John Eccles and John Eccles himself was<br>one of PhD students many PhD students of<br>Sir Charles Sherrington who is one of my<br>heroes<br>I have funny heroes but he was a Nobel<br>Prize winner for Physiology in the early<br>part of the 20th century and I'll come<br>back to Sherrington a little bit as well<br>so I don't want to presume too much but<br>you could maybe say that I was one one<br>of many great great granddaughters of<br>Eccles made me I'm sure he doesn't know<br>what he definitely doesn't matter so<br>John nurtured in me this strong desire<br>to to understand circuits in the brain<br>we were working on a seizure model<br>together understanding epilepsy and what<br>drives epileptic seizures and<br>I learned how to make these intricate<br>recordings getting tiny electrodes into<br>single neurons and recording their<br>electrical activity as they were doing<br>things within their circuit and this is<br>a figure that John always used to show<br>lots because he really loved it because<br>it's actually a very long-lasting<br>seizure-like event that's actually<br>happening within a bunch of neurons you<br>know in a dish but what I want to point<br>out to you is that you'll notice that<br>there are some squiggly lines here and<br>these are if we zoom into those squiggly<br>lines we can see these shapes that look<br>a little bit like that squiggly line<br>that I showed you before except now<br>they're all happening together there's<br>there's a barrage of electrical activity<br>that is happening at a whole large<br>number of signups --is that eventually<br>results in the activation of this<br>seizure-like event and so my PhD was<br>trying to figure out why this was<br>happening and I was very proud to get my<br>my paper published in the Journal of<br>physiology which is still the most<br>eminent physiology journal in the world<br>and long may it be so it was the place<br>we all wanted to publish at that time<br>and still do actually so after my my<br>time in London which was wonderful and<br>fascinating and challenging and all of<br>all of those things I I was very<br>fortunate to get a Royal Society<br>exchange program fellowship that took me<br>to Germany and I originally went to<br>Cologne to work with a epileptologist<br>clinical epileptologists scientist over<br>Heineman and I went to vers la because I<br>wanted to do to learn more about how<br>synapse is change and here we've got<br>some more squiggly lines exactly the<br>same but here we're modulating them with<br>something called v HT v HT is serotonin<br>and serotonin is the chemical that is<br>elevated by many antidepressant drugs<br>and these were in their heyday at this<br>time when we did this work and we wanted<br>to know more about how they how they<br>acted two remarkable people that I<br>really want to say something about is<br>that dima was a student and andreas was<br>a young postdoc in the lab in Cologne<br>and we all moved the lab about a year<br>into my fellowship which was perfect<br>timing we move we'd strip the lab down<br>and moved it in lots of trucks across<br>Germany to Berlin to the Sherratt a<br>which was in the is the old eastern part<br>of Germany and remember this is the time<br>when the wall had not come along come<br>down and it was a very exciting time and<br>a very challenging time actually to be<br>setting up a lab it was a lot of fun and<br>we worked very very hard and Dima and<br>andreas<br>we worked very hard together I really<br>learnt the great value of collaborating<br>and working with other people when I was<br>in Hoover's lab it was a really<br>important lesson we're all a little<br>introverted aren't we or some of us are<br>and learning to work with others is is<br>part of it part of the deal you can<br>achieve so much more<br>so Dima now heads up one of the most<br>powerful and successful neuroscience<br>centres in Europe at the charity is a<br>outstanding scientists in person Andrea<br>and andreas is there a director of a Max<br>Planck Institute in Heidelberg these are<br>very very important people or talented<br>people and we we were very productive<br>and that would became very important for<br>my career but we were brought together<br>by this man who was very very good at<br>bringing people together making people<br>work together sometimes and that's that<br>was his great skill and sadly over<br>passed away a couple three years now ago<br>but he was very very important in my<br>career he he was doing things and I<br>never even knew he was<br>and that's actually what happens that's<br>the Marvel of it all and so a couple of<br>years ago<br>Hoover had Hoover was German of course<br>and he had a great belief in forging<br>German Israeli connections was very very<br>important to him and I actually<br>benefited from some of those Israeli<br>connections as well and here we are at a<br>kibbutz just outside of Tel Aviv to it<br>two years ago Here I am his Dima his<br>Andreas and we got together and we<br>celebrated Hoover's scientific life<br>which was just amazing and it just shows<br>the esteem that he was held in and what<br>a what an amazing legacy of all the<br>people all over the world who benefited<br>from his mentorship so I was enormous ly<br>privileged to to be there a couple of<br>years ago so the work in Hoover's lab<br>was really really powerful it was really<br>it was really important but I was like<br>interested I was getting interested in<br>what what drives this transformation<br>what drives the the synapse is to work<br>and it comes down to calcium and calcium<br>y'all know is important in your diet you<br>have to make sure you take it in and<br>you'll think oh that's important for my<br>bones yes it is it's also important for<br>many many many other things and not<br>least is the triggering of these<br>synaptic events I wanted to learn more<br>we did a little bit of they did a little<br>bit of this in with Dima in Germany and<br>we used a very old technique which was<br>to look at extra set so we would we were<br>looking at calcium not in the terminal<br>which was where I really wanted to look<br>at it but outside and calcium is at a<br>high concentration outside of living<br>cells and at a low concentration inside<br>living cells and calcium can enter the<br>cell or enter the compartment<br>such as this terminal it goes through<br>channels that allow it through and we<br>what we did was that we actually<br>measured the outside calcium here<br>there's a little trace here another<br>wiggly line slightly different kind of<br>wiggly line but what we showed was that<br>serotonin was actually decreasing the<br>calcium signal and that and that was<br>part of how it was acting but this was a<br>very I don't know unsophisticated way of<br>looking at this problem and I wanted to<br>actually be able to measure the calcium<br>inside the terminals and at the towards<br>the end of the time that I was in Berlin<br>on my fellowship I actually suffered a<br>quite serious health setback<br>I became incredibly allergic to<br>laboratory rodents which is a bit of a<br>problem you might say that they got<br>their own back but it happens to many<br>people and it was largely due to some of<br>the conditions we were under in in in<br>Berlin because things were very chaotic<br>and so I my immune system needed to have<br>a rest from being close to laboratory<br>animals and oh there were people who<br>said oh well you that's the end of your<br>career you can't do it anymore I didn't<br>really want to listen to that obviously<br>and I was very fortunate to actually<br>find a way through but actually turned<br>out to be even better than I could have<br>imagined because I learnt how to measure<br>calcium using some of the really modern<br>techniques that were around at the time<br>using something called calcium sensitive<br>fluorescent dyes and I went back to<br>Oxford to pharmacology in Oxford and I<br>worked with Antony Galliani who is a<br>very very smart man and now if he's um<br>he was head of department of<br>pharmacology for nine years and has now<br>just got a Wellcome Trust senior<br>investigate<br>that gives him time to just focus on his<br>research he's a very very smart guy and<br>I benefited hugely from working with<br>Anthony even though I was working on of<br>all things sea urchin eggs and what you<br>see here is a sea urchin egg at the at<br>the time at the moment of fertilization<br>the sperm has bound to the egg here and<br>there's a calcium wave that crosses the<br>egg and the mechanisms that are involved<br>in that calcium wave are actually also<br>present in many many other cells their<br>primordial mechanisms that are<br>fundamental for calcium handling in<br>neurons hearts eggs and also we did a<br>little bit of work in synapse is towards<br>the end and that period of time in<br>Anthony's lab was enormously productive<br>at gaining publications in what we call<br>high-impact journals this was a very hot<br>field a little bit like this lecture<br>paper it was a very hot field and it was<br>competitive and we were we were there<br>amongst amongst that competitive field<br>and it was really I guess those papers<br>plus the the productivity that I'd had<br>in ubers lab working with andreas and<br>dima that really was was the foundation<br>for getting my first academic position<br>at Royal Holloway and as I said this was<br>a competitive field and as a young<br>scientist you can't necessarily play<br>with the big boys because you this is<br>just a little bit for the young<br>scientists among the audience and I<br>decided that I needed to look at the<br>problem from a different angle than<br>everybody else and so I decided to look<br>not so much at what was happening with<br>calcium coming into the cell but what's<br>happening when calcium goes out of the<br>cell so the fact that calcium at a high<br>concentration can come in to the<br>CEL where there's a low concentration of<br>calcium is something we call a chemical<br>gradient it's like a downhill calcium<br>goes downhill along its chemical<br>gradient and easily gets into the cell<br>but if there's too much calcium in this<br>compartment or in this cell things can<br>go wrong<br>and it has to be got back rid of and if<br>you've ever skied you'll know that to<br>have this you have to go back up the<br>hill at some point and that takes energy<br>or you can take the the chairlift<br>which also takes energy so my my I don't<br>know my niche that I started to dwell in<br>and to learn in when I went to Royal<br>Holloway as a young academic was to look<br>at what this this getting calcium out of<br>the neuron was important for and again I<br>was really really lucky because I was<br>able to collaborate with other people on<br>this kind on this kind of question and<br>this this this is us getting 400,000<br>pounds for our neuron project this was a<br>big deal in 2001 still seems like quite<br>a lot of money and this is the on campus<br>and i my auntie died last year and i<br>cleared out her house and she had saved<br>this so we're thankful for all the<br>people for saving real pieces of paper I<br>think we should learn from that so here<br>we are this is philipbeasley myself mark<br>Crompton and George Dixon and we had<br>this collaborative grant which was<br>really pivotal for the beginning of my<br>scientific career my independent<br>scientific career I was also lucky to<br>get some good students and I'll talk<br>about a few good students so this this<br>molecule here p.m. CA this doesn't roll<br>off the tongue very well but this is<br>like the ski lift taking you back up the<br>hill this is the molecule that gets<br>calcium out of cells and is<br>important for controlling the the<br>calcium inside the cell and Tom Jensen<br>who's now a research fellow at<br>University College London Queens Square<br>very talented hard-working young PhD<br>student and he's at the Institute of<br>Neurology now which is a very<br>prestigious institution in London he set<br>out to look to see if he could find this<br>this protein this mechanism at synapses<br>and he found it at the presynaptic<br>terminal and not on the postsynaptic<br>terminal so it's perhaps important for<br>controlling the calcium that's going to<br>be that trigger for the synapse to work<br>and what he also showed is that it was<br>this this protein this pmc a chairlift<br>doesn't matter what it is called really<br>that it was important because it was<br>enriched or a greater levels than we<br>might expect in presynaptic terminals so<br>he said about looking at what the impact<br>of this protein might be and we've got<br>some more squiggly lines here they're<br>going in a different direction that's<br>just technical but what you'll see is<br>these events here are marked by these<br>little bars these represent a trap that<br>transformative process within that<br>little squiggle the transformative<br>process that the synapse is happening<br>and when he blocked this molecule I<br>think you'll agree if you look at the<br>red squiggly lines that there are more<br>of them there and so this told us that<br>excuse me this told us that this was<br>important for the way in which the<br>synapse would work and this was great<br>and Tom got a great publication out of<br>another Journal of physiology paper and<br>he was happy but I wasn't particularly<br>happy because<br>we didn't know how this relates to<br>behavior how does this relate to<br>behavior what's what's the point of all<br>of this and this is where another very<br>important connection became clear in the<br>literature it had been shown that this<br>p.m. CA was when you removed it from an<br>animal the animals developed an ataxia a<br>movement disorder and this gave<br>indications that this was important and<br>it had also been shown that the p.m. CA<br>was very highly expressed in the<br>cerebellum that area of the brain back<br>here that is important for movement and<br>so I wanted to study synapse is in the<br>cerebellum and I wrote to this man<br>Thomas crop 'fl who was in Japan at the<br>time and I wrote to him and said please<br>can I come to your lab and learn how to<br>record synapse is from the cerebellum<br>thinking I would never hear anything<br>more and he wrote back and says yes of<br>course you can come when do you want to<br>come so I went to Japan and I learnt<br>these techniques as a young academic and<br>I learned how to record calcium in<br>presynaptic terminals which is what I<br>had been wanting to do<br>and these presynaptic terminals are<br>these so called parallel fiber synapses<br>like railway tracks war railway<br>analogies and they run the full length<br>of your cerebellum and along these<br>little railway tracks are these sign<br>apps it's that I was going to study so<br>what I did was I learnt how to measure<br>that presynaptic calcium and what I'm<br>going to show you is this is where the<br>fluorescent dye we use the fur essent<br>dye to monitor the calcium and we fill<br>the the railway tracks with that dye and<br>then we can stimulate those sign-ups<br>ha's and you have to be careful you<br>don't miss it<br>and that is that rocket-like like signal<br>is a presynaptic event event in those<br>terminals<br>there it goes I what we showed is that<br>the behavior and the kinetics of those<br>terminals and the way in which calcium<br>was being handled in those terminals was<br>slower I won't go into the details and<br>that this might be really really<br>important for why these mice have this<br>cerebellar ataxia or movement disorder<br>so we were at the start of linking the<br>biology or the synapse physiology with<br>the behavior so this got me interested<br>in spinocerebellar ataxia which are rare<br>a rare movement disorder seated within<br>the cerebellum within the part of the<br>brain I've talked about and there are<br>rare disease and I'm going to say<br>something about rare diseases because<br>rare diseases can often illuminate<br>things that we that we wouldn't see in a<br>more widespread disease and it's a<br>reason why we should study them because<br>we can learn new and important things<br>from those rare diseases and of course<br>they're not well treated either so I'm<br>just going to play you a little clip<br>it's not very long of someone who has<br>attacks yet it's happened to me a few<br>times people thinking that I was drunk<br>now I was getting in my car Brighton and<br>I was getting in and lady came over to<br>the car her hands to stop me pulling<br>away and just said you can't drive in<br>that condition and I then sort of got<br>out much so bad I said what my cycle<br>condition attack see it's a degenerate<br>neurological disorder and which affects<br>your balance and coordination<br>obviously some things I can't do like<br>I've gotta get things off high shelves<br>and taking hot things at the ovens it<br>weighs bit of an issue I'm okay I'm<br>still driving around I just sit down a<br>lot as far as the future goes I really<br>don't know what to expect it could be a<br>case for us at the same level or it<br>could be a case where I get a lot worse<br>so that gives you a glimpse into the<br>life of someone with ataxia it's<br>terrible oh no we won't listen to it<br>again it's terrible so we were fortunate<br>when I came to at our go to get again<br>through a collaboration to get access to<br>a mouse model of ataxia a different one<br>and this is where another talented PhD<br>student Emmitt power comes in so Emmitt<br>started working on this model and here's<br>Emmitt so Emmitt got his PhD a couple of<br>years ago and his other great<br>achievement in the last couple of years<br>is is roan and sat here I don't know if<br>moments here maybe not but so Emmett in<br>Nicole is and Ronan<br>so Emmitt started looking at the sign<br>APS's in this model and what he noticed<br>was that a particular type of action at<br>actually these railway track parallel<br>synapses were overactive that's unusual<br>in a neurological disorder we tend to<br>think of losing things<br>rather than gaining something and so<br>this was quite important in the field it<br>was it's become a little controversial<br>in the field but these these animals in<br>the early stages of their ataxia when<br>they're not very behaviorally<br>compromised they have these altered type<br>the timing of these connections is<br>altered and it went on then to try and<br>understand what was behind this and of<br>course<br>came down to calcium again so that's a<br>little what Emmet is doing here he's<br>recording from a Purkinje neuron and<br>he's stimulating those railway tracks<br>and if you didn't catch it the first<br>time there it goes again<br>so a very local area of that neuron is<br>the calcium is elevating in that cell it<br>turns out that that calcium is probably<br>what's driving some of the neuro<br>degeneration in this disorder and we<br>took that work forward and actually were<br>able to rescue the behavior in these<br>mice with a drug that just tweaked down<br>that over activity and Mohammed what<br>going to the details but Mohammed in the<br>lab who's a PhD student has been working<br>on that problem for about three years<br>and we've had an immense luck and to get<br>money from Roche to help us do this and<br>you'd learn just how long and how<br>complicated is it is to start developing<br>drugs for real youth so Roche has a rare<br>diseases group and they focus and put<br>put funding around the world to look at<br>these rare diseases because they value<br>their importance and we're a long way<br>moment for trying to get this drug into<br>into patients but we're still trying so<br>in the last few minutes Mohammed has got<br>that task in the last few minutes I want<br>to go back to Sherrington my my hero and<br>Sherrington was a great physiologist and<br>towards the end of his life he wrote a<br>philosophical book which is highly<br>poetic and actually way beyond me to be<br>honest and in it he has a vision about<br>seeing electrical activity in the brain<br>something but he couldn't even<br>and this is an artist's impression of<br>what came to be known as Sherrington<br>sparks so what you're seeing here is<br>lighting up of these synaptic<br>connections and Sherrington was saying<br>what would the brain look like if we<br>could see the activity and we've<br>actually been working on this problem<br>for the last four or five years and<br>largely because we've been very<br>fortunate to work with Thomas and this<br>is of where he's been incredible again<br>and working in a collaborative manner<br>internationally and so Thomas was<br>working at Rican brain brain Science<br>Institute in Japan a large amount of<br>money being allocated to research into<br>the brain and he has spent 25 years<br>developing a means of seeing electrical<br>activity in the brain and it's coming to<br>from to fruition and his is continuing<br>to come to fruition so Thomas had<br>developed this so-called sensor so<br>instead of me putting tiny electrodes<br>into single neurons with painstakingly<br>and frustratingly amounts of time<br>required we can now image just as we<br>have been imaging that calcium we can<br>image electrical activity and we were<br>fortunate to get collaboration with the<br>Allen Institute for brain science in the<br>US all of you will know who Bill Gates<br>is I'm guessing and Paul Elam co-founded<br>Microsoft and Paul Allen put an enormous<br>amount of his philanthropic money into<br>on developing pipelines for<br>understanding the brain and we were<br>lucky to get on for one of those<br>pipelines and sadly Paul Allen passed<br>away I think last year or a couple of<br>years ago and so we threw out the Allen<br>Institute developed a mouse we got<br>access to that Mouse and we've started<br>working with it and we are now<br>doing work in mice that are awake and<br>behaving and doing things that I'm going<br>to show you<br>Xavier here is we call we call Xavier be<br>Mouse whisperer<br>because he can train my students and<br>train them to sit still and train them<br>to do things that he wants them to do<br>it's a very big skill and Dan here is<br>it's also a bit of a mouse Whisperer on<br>the quiet but has been important for<br>developing all the computational tools<br>that we've needed to do this work so we<br>are imaging the mouse brain through<br>their skull so we're not that the skull<br>is intact<br>the mouse is imaged the brain is imaged<br>and their mouse is awake and I'm going<br>to show you one of our really exciting<br>maps so the mouse gets a little<br>vibration - it's poor it's a bit like<br>youth feeling a haptic feedback on your<br>phone just like that not at all painful<br>or just a little stimulus very short we<br>call it light touch and what you're<br>looking at is the nose here and the tail<br>here and something happened that was the<br>light touch I'll play it again so what<br>we're seeing is a spark of activity<br>maybe something like Sherrington spark<br>in the brain of this mouse as it's<br>perceiving that light touch so this is a<br>brain signature for a perception and we<br>think that's very very exciting you may<br>not but I definitely do and what I'd<br>really like to say coming back now<br>remember that squiggly line I wrote<br>showed you right at the very beginning<br>when we look at the time course of those<br>events that I've just showed you in the<br>living awake Mouse there's a baseline<br>there's an activation which is the light<br>when the light touch happens and then<br>there's something there's a gap there's<br>a space in time before the activity<br>happens and of course what's happening<br>in this space of time is the activation<br>of those connections that I've just been<br>talking about so we are now seeing real<br>connections at work in a real living<br>awake and behaving mouths and that is<br>very for us and for Neuroscience<br>actually really rather important so I<br>hope I brought you a full circle from an<br>old-fashioned style of work to something<br>that's very new and hopefully is really<br>groundbreaking and not too many people<br>have seen these light sensation touch<br>maps so it's a real privilege to be able<br>to show them and we've pioneered all of<br>this here at Otago and it's been it's<br>been really fantastic so I don't enjoy<br>it on too long but I do just want to say<br>a little bit about people if my computer<br>hasn't frozen there we go<br>so I think it's really important that I<br>am but I thank my parents for bringing<br>me into the world there they are and<br>that's probably the only time you've<br>ever seen me in a dress it's a bit of a<br>weird dress but anyway I liked it and<br>yeah I'm very grateful for my family for<br>bringing me into the world I'm also very<br>grateful for other families along the<br>way that have been really pivotal as<br>well not least my scientific family that<br>I've just talked about but um this is<br>probably the only photo that you'll see<br>me wearing makeup so it's it is me I<br>promise just that's just the teeth you<br>can see so I I this was on reserve<br>forces army training commissioning<br>course actually and this is a<br>general-purpose machine gun so I don't<br>know how many IPL's have got where<br>you're faced with a gpmg anyway somehow<br>I always ended up carrying it and this<br>is another part of that army family so<br>I was 18 did it but did that for 18<br>years and you know I think I look about<br>12 there and and probably there as well<br>so the the army family shared values<br>shared connections different different<br>life completely was very very important<br>to me as an academic trying to<br>understand that people outside of<br>academia are a little bit different and<br>think about things differently and here<br>in Otago and here in Dunedin I'm really<br>privileged to be part of to church<br>families and it's really wonderful to<br>see my church family here today both at<br>some Pauls and at All Saints and if you<br>want to understand what taizé chanting<br>is we do it on a Sunday night and we'd<br>be very welcoming all the saints and of<br>course to my rotary friends and again I<br>am very very grateful to the rotary<br>people that I can see thank you for<br>coming as well and I'm just going to<br>love oh yes<br>education I'm the only person in my<br>family to go to university and for me<br>education was a very powerful force and<br>I think Senator Fulbright says said that<br>education is a slow and powerful force<br>and it is and it always should be and I<br>feel enormous read privilege to be in<br>education being able to maybe influence<br>a few people along the way as people<br>influence me and it's really important<br>to hold on to the great value and<br>empowerment that education brings so I'm<br>just going to finish there with several<br>acknowledged months all the people who<br>all the various organizations and money<br>that has powered this work over the<br>years which I'm immensely grateful for<br>and take very very seriously<br>comes out of people's pockets and we<br>should treasure it and use it well and<br>I'm gonna now leave with a few names<br>hopefully that come so just family we<br>started with the Caples we're ending<br>with the green stone and family their<br>school teachers University Army some<br>not longer here with us some of you<br>might see your name some of you might<br>not divvy you don't then you know who<br>you are and physiology mentors and<br>colleagues very very importantly my time<br>in in Otago and internationally too with<br>cool okay got it now so as I said my<br>privilege to be able to think Ruth it's<br>an enormous event for her to tell us<br>about her journey and for one I really<br>appreciate that I've learned quite a lot<br>about Ruth things I didn't know where as<br>I felt I knew her relatively well you've<br>showcased a lot of your strengths and I<br>just want to spend a couple of minutes<br>kind of gathering together those<br>strengths that you've shown us through<br>your talk first your passion for<br>neurophysiology and how that came full<br>circle as you said from when you were a<br>student to now where you're pioneering<br>new techniques another big one is kind<br>of tackling the big questions a texia<br>it's a may be rare but it's Ruth said if<br>we can find out what's happening at the<br>molecular level down in the brain then<br>that will help understanding the brain<br>and other disorders but Ruth doesn't<br>tackle it from one angle<br>she's a physiologist she's a great you<br>know does a lot of tradition<br>electrophysiology but she combines it<br>with molecular approaches dynamic<br>imaging is you saw whole animal<br>behavioral models that you've seen in a<br>lot of computational analysis behind it<br>and of that package together as a real<br>strengths of Ruth's research Ruth's an<br>early adopter of novel and often<br>untested technology and she showed us it<br>was through that collaboration with<br>Thomas not full and she's that's been<br>carrying on for a decade or more and<br>she's shown us today with that light<br>touch image you know that's using that<br>technology and we should be very proud<br>that she as she said as she's pioneering<br>it here at Otago she's able to do that<br>work here with the help I should add of<br>all these people that she has mentioned<br>and she has a large lab and they're all<br>very committed to that research finally<br>I think as an audience we've seen Ruth's<br>really powerful scientific communication<br>skills<br>professor Ward mentioned previously<br>Ruth's invited to give publicly<br>where she can break down this really<br>quite complex physiology to something<br>that is accessible to a public audience<br>not only with community groups but she's<br>had a long history working with brain<br>day working with students high school<br>students for example who come into the<br>university International Science<br>Festival and so on she really takes it<br>quite seriously that as scientists we<br>need to be communicating with the public<br>in helping them to understand where<br>their tax dollars go to support us in<br>our research so please join me and thank<br>him Ruth again for a really great OPR<br>you're an important event next we can't<br>let this occasion go without some<br>commemorative gifts so Ruth would you be<br>able to come and accept this is on<br>behalf of the University and the<br>department of physiology and I like you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
