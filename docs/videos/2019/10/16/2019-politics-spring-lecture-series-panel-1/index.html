pleasure to welcome you to the<br>first of our four politics spring series<br>lecture series the idea would be doing<br>this for a few years is to think about<br>some of the topical issues and how<br>people that we know might help everybody<br>understand these issues are better so we<br>invited panels of people to come and<br>speak about issues and we give you lots<br>of time to ask them questions so welcome<br>to the first of these which is about<br>localism it's partly inspired by the<br>fact that we are about to have our local<br>government elections and we hope to be<br>able to think about local issues for<br>that reason but it's also inspired by<br>the fact that localism is certainly a<br>growing issue of discussion and<br>community so one of the things before I<br>introduce the panel that I would bring<br>your attention to is the little ads<br>there that I have from local government<br>New Zealand about the fact that they had<br>written the discussion paper about<br>localism and they're seeking feedback on<br>that so if the issues that we discussed<br>tonight inspire you to think of things<br>you'd like to say about localism local<br>government New Zealanders certainly came<br>to hear from you and there's more<br>details there but without any further<br>ado I'm delighted to introduce the panel<br>of people that we have speaking to you<br>tonight about localism first as<br>jeanikins Mayor Dave Cal who's actually<br>here tonight with his president of local<br>government New Zealand hat on 216 in<br>terms of talking about localism so<br>welcome thank you very much Melissa Lama<br>in the middle here who is one of our<br>politics students who was also a<br>fantastic advocate in her various<br>communities sick island and muslim<br>communities and hasn't been engaged in a<br>number of community initiatives and<br>projects and she's currently going to be<br>working with the Christchurch mosket<br>ex-world Commission in particular so I'm<br>delighted that you agreed to come speak<br>to us mother so thank you and associate<br>professor Janet Stevenson who will be<br>known to some of you from Otago who is<br>the director for the center of<br>sustainability and for reasons that will<br>become<br>here's a good person to talk to you<br>about how localism is being carried out<br>locally in Dunedin and the region and<br>finally Mike talks who's the director of<br>Catholic Social Services and South<br>Dunedin and a Dean thank you Mike coming<br>along and talking specifically about how<br>TVs experiencing so the format is that<br>I've asked each of them to talk for<br>about 10 minutes or so and then we will<br>just open it up for discussion with all<br>of you to ask some questions as<br>everyone's sharing their thoughts so<br>without further ado can I ask you to<br>welcome our panel I think you did yeah<br>can I cut you cut talk before we go in<br>my name in the mana my god al they roll<br>like a tear to my tent okay Amy we tend<br>okay tena koutou tena koutou katoa I<br>want to start with the purpose of local<br>government as set out in the legislation<br>the purpose of local government includes<br>now the for again the four well-beings<br>so the full well-beings are<br>environmental cultural social and<br>economic and it's the purpose of local<br>government to promote those well beings<br>and the various council communities and<br>areas the full well beings recognized<br>that the sustainability and ongoing<br>health of our communities cannot be<br>encapsulated<br>in one dimension so it's not all about<br>economics but equally it's not all about<br>social well-being<br>it's about all of them and how they<br>interact with each other and so it<br>recognizes that those well beings are<br>entwined and it's the job of local<br>government to promote all four and to<br>manage the trade-offs between them as<br>guided by our community so for instance<br>when we're in city council are sitting<br>out its annual<br>it's long-term plan we promote to what<br>we propose priorities and we ask the<br>community to come back and comment on<br>that and as much as anything it's asking<br>them to comment on the balance between<br>the various some priorities that we've<br>proposed now these these four<br>well-beings were introduced with the<br>promulgation of the Local Government Act<br>2002 and they bestow upon local councils<br>the power of general competence and this<br>is another way of saying that councils<br>should be free from narrow constraints<br>such as roads or the need to just<br>provide roads rubbish although obviously<br>they are still very important to promote<br>the broader well-being of their<br>communities so in other words the way we<br>like to look at it is the for well<br>beings are the hallmarks of what<br>distinguishes local government as a tier<br>of government in its own right from that<br>of simple service prevent of a simple<br>service provision organization and you<br>will hear and you'll probably hear it<br>during the election people standing up<br>and saying we've got to get the council<br>back to basics it's roads and rubbish<br>and drains that's what they need to do<br>well I'm pointing out for the best law<br>at the legislation asks us to do it's<br>much broader than that so we move on to<br>the principles of localism the full well<br>beings dovetail perfectly with the<br>concept of localism if we as stewards<br>for our communities are to be given the<br>job of growing well being then we should<br>be given the powers to do so it's not<br>much point in having a purpose that's<br>prescribed for us but then not being<br>enabled to to give effect to that and<br>that's because a core principle of<br>localism is that local big people are<br>best placed to know the unique<br>dimensions of the problems they face<br>they are also uniquely placed to inform<br>how solutions to these challenges should<br>be shaped taking into account the<br>different<br>and resources on the ground so localism<br>is not adversarial to central government<br>but it recognizes the advantages of each<br>tier are complimentary to the<br>disadvantages of the other that's<br>central government and local government<br>and I think this is best stated in the<br>principle of subsidiarity that<br>decision-making should occur at the<br>level closest to the people that the<br>decisions affect now I think we need to<br>understand the implications of that it<br>doesn't mean it stops at councils it may<br>them may be levels of responsibility and<br>decision-making in some jurisdictions<br>are are below councils among the<br>community boards or in Auckland there<br>might be local boards but the principle<br>of subsidiarity and localism is not just<br>about empowering councils it's about<br>empowering communities and that may be<br>expressed through their councils or it<br>may be expressed through other levels of<br>government so the next question I'd like<br>to address is what functions are next or<br>activities are required and responding<br>to climate change whether that's<br>adaptation or mitigation now it's<br>important to establish New Zealand's<br>bona fide ease when it comes to climate<br>change although we account for less than<br>0.2% of global missions we have a moral<br>duty and in fact we have a legal duty<br>since we signed up in Paris to do our<br>part to reduce the carbon footprint net<br>will require pricing carbon in some way<br>and maintaining a regime for reporting<br>and tracking of emissions and sinks we<br>equally have to recognize that we are a<br>climate taker that doesn't absolve us of<br>any responsibility but the point is that<br>fossil fuel decisions made now and in<br>the past and to a significant extent<br>elsewhere in the world still affect us<br>in the form of climate change effects<br>both now and increasing the end of the<br>future and we know that given the<br>inertia and the system even if we<br>completely stopped all carbon emissions<br>right now sea-level rise would continue<br>to carry on because of their inertia and<br>that would be happening to us regardless<br>of what we do so we're going to get<br>greater flooding we're going to get<br>drier summers storm events and rising<br>sea levels regardless and of what<br>happens so that's what we have to adapt<br>to so that begs the question of course<br>in the context of localism a how we<br>respond to climate change what is best<br>decided or done at a local level and<br>what is best decided or done at a<br>central government level now I would<br>argue that no issue better illustrates<br>the need for decision making to be<br>distributed between the two using the<br>principle of subsidiarity subsidiarity<br>then climate change mitigation is a<br>match an a tional issue for enter the<br>pilot affects all New Zealanders<br>differently and sadly too often based on<br>inequities and wealth the answer is a<br>nationally consistent framework such as<br>the emissions trading scheme you can't<br>have that you can't constructively have<br>a comprehensive response to mitigation<br>wherever the mitigation only at a local<br>level it has to be done at a national<br>level and then of course it filters down<br>a debt adaptation is a different story<br>the effects of climate change will be<br>experienced differently across the<br>country and we're seeing that now the<br>Fox it in Fox it's a faster erosion of<br>stop banks in the Hawke's Bay it's the<br>ocean breaking on the front steps of<br>Beach homes in Dunedin it's the steady<br>sinking of the neighborhood but they're<br>all climate change effects and each<br>community is different as are their<br>resources and risk tolerances and as<br>such their response should be different<br>so I would argue and local government<br>New Zealand would argue that at<br>essential government mental<br>what we need is a legal framework around<br>adaptation identifying risk to some<br>extent of the birthplaces and a mandate<br>and what I mean by that I'll illustrate<br>for the case of cuppa tea Council a few<br>years ago company Council on the east<br>coast of the North Island decided that<br>it needed to express the risk and and<br>communicate the risk to various<br>properties along the shoreline by<br>putting the risk line if you like where<br>they saw sea level rise creating an<br>extra risk putting it on the land<br>information memoranda of all the<br>properties along there they did that and<br>all the proper a good number of the<br>property owners along there who are<br>pretty wealth well hoofed individuals<br>took the Kapiti council to court and<br>they won they've got it they got those<br>taken off because they argued that I<br>don't I'm not absolutely sure about what<br>they argued but I'm pretty sure that<br>we've part of it would be about process<br>and part of it would be around whether<br>there was an evidential base to put the<br>line on that on the in the first place<br>the point is that the company council<br>had done the right thing but they were<br>being held liable for doing that and<br>they could be in the court so what local<br>government New Zealand is asking central<br>government to do is not is to enable us<br>to empower us to do the right thing by I<br>would argue and I value this with the<br>government ministers to require councils<br>to put that information on the limb as<br>long as they've got a good evidentiary<br>basis rather than leaving it up to the<br>courts to decide what's right and what's<br>wrong so that's what we mean by a legal<br>framework and a mandate what it's<br>example is there's other examples and a<br>local government level where adaptation<br>is the main focus infrastructure build<br>urban renewal options community<br>consultation that's that they're the<br>sorts of things that local government<br>needs to be empowered to do because and<br>as well as the the legal thing that they<br>that's what we will be doing you know in<br>South Dunedin we're looking at the<br>substrate where we're looking at where<br>the patterns where<br>at all sorts of things of trying to<br>figure out what we put in in in the way<br>of future infrastructure to to deal with<br>that now as noted earlier central<br>government and local government should<br>and can work closer together in a<br>complementary way to tackle this<br>challenge central government has a duty<br>to it to ensure consistency of national<br>policy mechanisms such as the ETS and<br>this is a stewardship role it's also the<br>only entity that can pass laws that<br>support good climate change<br>decision-making through Parliament<br>equally it is only is the only agent<br>with a financial heft to ensure that the<br>effects of climate change are not unduly<br>carried by the poorest and least<br>well-off in our society and what we're<br>out what local government is Eiland is<br>arguing with the central government is<br>saying look there will be things that<br>require a good amount of funding of<br>Finance sinless local government won't<br>have necessarily all of the wherewithal<br>central government won't be inclined to<br>provide at all insurance companies will<br>need to be involved<br>most people have got a mortgage so if<br>it's about retreat from home so banks<br>will need to be involved and in all<br>probability the homeowners will have to<br>take a haircut at the same time it all<br>it has to be a collaborative effort from<br>a local government perspective we have a<br>duty to factor in the long-term<br>consequences of our decision making<br>because we're putting infrastructure in<br>the ground of we expect us for a hundred<br>years so we it's pretty difficult to<br>know how much to spend and how durable<br>to make it if you're not sure it's going<br>to be needed in 30 years time so it's a<br>tricky investment decision now about 50<br>percent of councils balance sheet is<br>accounted for by long-lived<br>infrastructure such as roads and water<br>networks so you can and local government<br>you Zeeland just did a survey a little<br>while ago looking at the quantitative<br>value of the infrastructure owned by<br>local government that was at risk from<br>sea level rise around New Zealand I<br>don't mean to seem level rise it was<br>getting on the three three billion<br>that's just the infrastructure that's<br>not the houses and the businesses and<br>everything that rely on it that's just<br>the infrastructure and half a meter at<br>two or three meters it it's about 14<br>billion and for many years with rokosz<br>New Zealand we've enabled the building<br>of infrastructure where it's nice and<br>flat in other words close to the ocean<br>and on floodplains it tells you where<br>we're at that's where most of us live we<br>need to ensure that the infrastructure<br>we enable today does not become a regret<br>in the future so finally what's local<br>government is in a demanding of<br>government regarding both adaptation and<br>mitigation we're demanding that central<br>government recognizes that New<br>Zealanders need both tiers of government<br>to be working together to tackle a<br>threat that climate change poses that is<br>both mitigation and adaptation we<br>recognize that mitigation decisions of<br>assisted system they will sit best with<br>the central government so we're not<br>going to try and solve and invent the<br>wheel and every community adaptation is<br>however our responsibility what we want<br>is the legislative resupport we need to<br>do our job so we don't end up in court<br>for making the right decisions and you<br>can see the double bind here for<br>councils the homeowners the who say by<br>putting that risk on my limb you've<br>devalued my property therefore you're<br>liable for it balanced out by the<br>homeowners and tinniest I'm say Council<br>is aware of Ave a bubble but because of<br>the risk of litigation and going to<br>court we say right we won't put anything<br>on the Left ten years down the track a<br>new owner has bought this not knowing<br>what the risk is the sea comes crashing<br>her front porch they come to Council and<br>say you knew about this and you didn't<br>put it on the limb you're liable so we<br>need as I say a legislative mandate to<br>protect us so we can do the right thing<br>we need to planning system that allows<br>us to take the long-term effects of<br>climate change into account when<br>considering developments most of all<br>we're pushing for an adaptive system<br>that best responds to the needs of news<br>and it's varied communities regardless<br>alright I'm feeling pretty nervous so<br>I'm just gonna go like this and say my<br>lolly lay everyone cured us some allah<br>salla malik and what happen some love<br>for the cutler my name is again melissa<br>Lama and I've been briefed for us<br>talking about community engagement first<br>of all what is the importance of having<br>community engagement as well as how to<br>do community engagement well now let's<br>make it clear I don't know everything<br>and I don't know all the tips and tricks<br>to fix everything in regards to<br>community engagement but I'm gonna share<br>some of my work experience as well as<br>background in this area<br>chuckle NICs online so whoever mine I'm<br>26 I'm first generation born New Zealand<br>born in South Auckland and grew up most<br>of my life in crush church I'm a mother<br>of two young boys ages seven and five<br>and sorry if they make a lot of noise at<br>the back and I'm also an undergrad<br>student here at the University of Otago<br>studying political science my work<br>experience is NGO in the community<br>sector as well as I did a bit of time as<br>a policy advisor regional advisor with<br>the Ministry for Pacific people's and in<br>fair I also said on some boards and<br>advisory groups and yes i recently just<br>joined the royal commission of inquiry<br>into the croatia text more so in the<br>engagement department which is quite an<br>interesting space to the end and I was<br>chuck some of this stuff that I'm<br>supposed to share and this presentation<br>I do have a massive passion for<br>immigration and I call it lobbying sort<br>of fishy lobbying but for me it's<br>something close to my house<br>and it's work that affects a lot of my<br>family and also from the Pacific quota<br>perspective as well as the working visa<br>policies that we have and the elections<br>that come with it and if anything my<br>brothers Pacific community active<br>activator active advocate and my<br>brothers call me and nagging member of<br>the community because some people here<br>they're probably sick of hearing these<br>things that I could be talked about so<br>what is the importance of having<br>community engagement now this is quite<br>broad so I've narrowed it down to what<br>does it take to build effective<br>relationships before starting to engage<br>it's really important that you do your<br>homework so in order to know an<br>environment you need to know you need to<br>know and understand your pathways of<br>respect and engagement this involves the<br>values of how to connect depending upon<br>which cultural group and an ethnic group<br>you engage with respect is often<br>articulated in many different ways so<br>for example in Western society when<br>you're speaking to people you expect<br>them to look into your eyes right<br>because it's the sign of engagement and<br>respect and Pacific rock culture for<br>many of us we tend to not look into the<br>eyes of the person speaking to you<br>because sometimes it's seen as dismiss<br>people see just because I might be<br>looking at the floor or looking away<br>often the rhetoric from Western society<br>and cultures is disengaged or they don't<br>actually care actually that's not the<br>case at all it's more so that we tend to<br>I don't know it's just a sign of I guess<br>lowering yourself when you're not quite<br>looking at sterically at someone they<br>make things but again it's different for<br>many different cultures the importance<br>of Doha vas so I don't know if people<br>so dolibarr means to nurture or maintain<br>the relational space and between a<br>person and it can create harmony or<br>beauty particularly when there is a<br>symmetrical or mutual exchange of Doha<br>VII and return so when we do things<br>that's really important for us to<br>cherish whatever relationship or space<br>that you have with the<br>person that you're engaging with a four<br>gauge meant to be successful it has to<br>be a conversation that goes both ways so<br>that's just way too often we have<br>engagements out in our community where<br>you have people standing at the front<br>presenting to the audience and usually<br>the silence that you get from the<br>audience is taken as acceptance of what<br>you're saying so the best form of<br>engagement I could I guess suggest is to<br>ensure that these times for Q&amp;A kind of<br>like what we're doing here as well as a<br>pathway to have private conversations or<br>conversations within communities<br>community spaces that are comfortable<br>for them allowing stories and lived<br>experiences experiences to be at the<br>forefront of discussions now what we're<br>finding in some of our communities for<br>example I'm going to say that our<br>Pacific youth community we have a lot of<br>engagements with departments like insert<br>who come with you know amazing<br>initiatives of how they see young<br>Pacific leaders you know stepping into<br>some of these internship and roles you<br>know and often they share the<br>expectations as opposed to listening to<br>the lived experiences that we have they<br>could potentially feed into how the<br>internship could work and be successful<br>and so if anything making sure that we<br>listen and we we do say lived<br>experiences this is not a mean for<br>parkia or for non pacific people to feel<br>that we're trying to just value whatever<br>comes you know whatever conversations<br>they add it's more so just to allow us<br>to have a space where we feel<br>comfortable enough to protect who we are<br>so yeah and I guess different<br>communities and narratives not one<br>homogenized stroke on how you engage<br>therefore understanding youth and older<br>groups of people and best ways to engage<br>moving on here's a prime example of<br>local government and I'm going to use<br>Christchurch sorry the Crushers City<br>Council because it's where I love<br>available so I'm just here and so I'm<br>part of a group called Pacific youth<br>leadership and<br>information trusts and pretty much we<br>help young pacific people to feel<br>empowered in to thrive in all worlds and<br>one of our main focuses is with<br>democracy so we run a series of talks<br>called I speak and what I speak we bring<br>in peers from government and you know<br>and people from local government as well<br>as experts and certain fields of climate<br>change housing poverty and we have a<br>panel similar to the to this but the<br>discussion is I guess the questions are<br>driven by young Pacific people at the<br>end of I speak we have breakout sessions<br>where we have more intimate<br>conversations and it's often in these<br>discussions you get richer Intel and<br>information that people often don't want<br>to share in a public forum and so we<br>take and collect all the information<br>given to us and we we as a group these<br>15 of us we form some form of submission<br>or some sort of draft write-up that we<br>use to go to select committees or we are<br>annoying and we send it to every MP in<br>Parliament so every time we have I speak<br>they will know because we tell them that<br>you're going to get one and we demand a<br>response it's so this is how we choose<br>to engage and get the voices of our<br>young people into the against of<br>decision-makers as well into central<br>government and local government is that<br>after we do this and we bring them into<br>our space we ensure that we give them<br>our feedback of their discussion as well<br>as give them our views and often when we<br>take some of those views to Select<br>Committee some people and they will be<br>like oh maybe you guys we've heard about<br>force them to Freder because we want a<br>response also from i speak russian city<br>council and decided to build like he<br>said a diversity fund for youth there's<br>no exact name but it was fifty thousand<br>dollars and it was to go for two years<br>and so they allowed us to run and i<br>speak and figure out how the council<br>should spend their money so they pretty<br>much said here young people here is<br>fifty thousand dollars you guys come up<br>with initiatives that you can spend this<br>money<br>and so we were like wow this is $50,000<br>I mean so what we did was we got<br>together with three other big youth<br>groups in Christchurch and we formed<br>Dragon Skin which really is an our plan<br>but with borrowed dragons gene if we ran<br>it and the council chambers in<br>Christchurch and so we asked for anybody<br>you didn't have to be Pacific to submit<br>a business idea and ask for some meta<br>money like a dragon scene and then we<br>had young people in business and<br>politics and stuff who came and sat on<br>this panel and so they got to come into<br>the council chambers they got to present<br>the idea I mean the young people got to<br>decide actually was this good or not it<br>was a little bit harsh at some point so<br>I was like guys remember this is for us<br>you know but I'm it was a huge success<br>to the point that the council has now<br>put invested more money for next year<br>and so it's that type of engagement from<br>I speak leading into the earth getting<br>into the council chambers and using<br>their facilities that you know allowed<br>for rich engagement and once it says<br>you're gonna stick for a long time okay<br>and so we actually when we do I speak we<br>have rules and so our rules are one if<br>you're having the event at dinner time<br>food should be first or not left till<br>the end of a long program because they<br>will yeah<br>thicker least features should be very<br>short nothing longer these seven minutes<br>I'm pretty ruthless for the bout it<br>actually met does he he always comes out<br>to be nice I'm being is so mean to me<br>the - we feel because you guys ever seen<br>minutes a night you know well I like<br>yeah cuz we have to stick to time three<br>is there should be a chance for lots of<br>interaction with the crowd and four they<br>should always be games in prizes and<br>five always stick to the time or finish<br>early no going over time yeah what<br>specific that we tend to go over time<br>anyway but we are working on it we are<br>we got it<br>so moving on how to do community<br>engagement well so I'm I feel like most<br>of my responses to this will come from<br>some of the questions the easy questions<br>I hope you're going to ask but I'm so<br>being efficient in doing things well no<br>one off transactions okay so<br>that means that genuine are sorry no one<br>off transaction means it's not a one-hit<br>wonder so don't comment on it community<br>ask for information go back and not go<br>back again and only turn up the next<br>year to us another question or so that's<br>probably similar to the last one you are<br>so what we're finding is as much as we<br>love to be consulted and engaged with<br>there is a tendency for groups and<br>organization and government to come and<br>over consult and it's usually around<br>education strategies and we love that we<br>definitely do but it's like what's<br>different to last year you know and so<br>also you need to make sure that you<br>leave time to feedback so if you're<br>gonna come and talk to us about a<br>strategy one year you come back the<br>following year before you determine it's<br>finalizing the strategy and you ask us<br>whether we see our words represented in<br>the work that's been produced by your<br>policymakers and everybody else so<br>that's a huge tip and it's also a form<br>of respect for a lot of us because it<br>means that you're not only taking our<br>words for your benefit but you're also<br>ensuring that this piece of work is<br>representative of us and so a genuine<br>engagement from the outset so ensuring<br>that when you go in that you haven't<br>preempted what the outcomes going to be<br>in some of your questions so making sure<br>that the question is open and inclusive<br>and ensure the community see themselves<br>are presented in your organization and<br>practice now this one is definitely<br>definitely important<br>some organizations and government groups<br>come into our Pacific community and<br>after an engagement they say oh man like<br>you know we've got nothing you know no<br>one was engaged and you know part of<br>that is really looking at the audience<br>that you're trying to engage with I mean<br>looking at the people that you're hiring<br>and then your answer will be beer so<br>it's ensuring that when you bring people<br>that you have people that we can relate<br>to and the other thing is the elevator<br>approach so that is from ground level up<br>that guards our ground level up so it's<br>not from policy decision makers down to<br>the community saying this is what you<br>have to do it's more so listening to the<br>community ensuring that it goes back up<br>to the people and then coming back down<br>to the communities so let's say<br>you know I call that an elevator<br>approach that it helps to label it but<br>I'm look I look 40 any more questions<br>you may have<br>sorry it's quite a quick overview of<br>community engagement but thank you very<br>much for listening<br>I'm Dennis Stevenson and I'm coming<br>tonight to you with bringing some<br>experiences from research that I've<br>undertaken myself and with with why<br>groups of other researchers from across<br>New Zealand and some wonderful PhD<br>students some of whom are in the room<br>tonight and in my research over the last<br>probably five to ten years has has<br>focused a lot on two things one is one<br>is how do we transition from an energy<br>system in New Zealand that is heavily<br>reliant on fossil fuels to one that is<br>really very carbon light and the second<br>is how do we as as communities and<br>councils and eveing start to adapt to<br>the major challenges of climate change<br>so tonight I'm bringing both of those<br>areas of research together and I took<br>this photo actually and I think it's a<br>really great one because it's kind of<br>the looming challenges ahead so so the<br>question was can local government<br>address the challenges ahead but<br>actually I thought the answer to that is<br>quite a simple no local government can't<br>on its own address the challenges so I'm<br>actually changing that slightly to say<br>why is a local response and I'll explain<br>what I mean by local response later<br>essential to address the challenges are<br>hidden so first of all what are these<br>challenges let's do a big scoping very<br>quickly about what those challenges are<br>and one of them obviously is is<br>adaptation<br>so we're actually seeing the impacts of<br>climate change in New Zealand already<br>and not just in South Dunedin this is<br>Tonga Park and in other parts of South<br>and Eden in the 2015 floods they have<br>been a couple of other floods since then<br>and many of you remember this is the<br>kind of a skipping off point for us<br>realizing actually that it's right on<br>our doorstep as Dunedin but it's not<br>just a need and this is just from a few<br>days ago this is in the the port waikato<br>area where houses are right on the<br>forefront of falling into the sea Farms<br>are suffering droughts forests burning<br>infrastructure is being washed away and<br>I'm hoping you're noticing that all of<br>these news articles are just from the<br>last 18 months or so and towns are being<br>flooded and this this is Edgecomb<br>actually ichika as a as an area where<br>many people are are unemployed through<br>no fault of their own<br>there have been industries in their area<br>that have have moved away and and it<br>raises really an issue for for many<br>people faced by adaptation which is how<br>do we respond to these kinds of crises<br>which are going to become more and more<br>frequent how do we respond adequately<br>before these crises hurt in a way that<br>is equitable that gives us the fairest<br>response possible and that doesn't lead<br>to to inequitable outcomes and is<br>empowering for the communities that are<br>going to be affected<br>so that's adaptation that's a huge<br>challenge and it is across every aspect<br>of New Zealand mitigation is another<br>challenge and this diagram here just<br>indicates how quickly we need to reduce<br>our greenhouse gas emissions in New<br>Zealand to get to our commitment of net<br>carbon zero by 2050 that Green Line<br>going downwards is where we aim to be at<br>as a country in just 30 years as you can<br>see the the dotted light blue line which<br>is our<br>projected net emissions that's our<br>emissions - what is absorbed by forests<br>or other carbon sinks is looking to go<br>pretty much steeply upwards we have to<br>go equally steeply downwards that is a<br>big shift in everything that we do and<br>Dunedin City Council but it's cotton<br>socks just very recently said that it<br>wished to be knit cabin 0 by 2030 an<br>even bigger challenge and those those<br>challenges and we know as well<br>particularly in the energy area because<br>there's a center we've been doing energy<br>audits for the council for the last four<br>years the places where those changes<br>need to happen is in transport it is an<br>industry it is in the way we use our<br>land it's in the way we deal with our<br>waste it is in the kinds of food that we<br>eat it's the way we build our buildings<br>whether we are retaining the heat and<br>keeping out the the or keeping up the<br>heat in the summer and many other areas<br>so there's a huge amount to do here and<br>it's not just in what we have now but<br>it's what we're investing in right now<br>that is going to be locking us into<br>producing carbon in the future so if we<br>are investing in motorways that are<br>going to attract more people to use more<br>cars we're actually creating a path<br>dependency for more greenhouse gas<br>emissions in the future so that's<br>challenge number two and challenge<br>number three is actually even bigger and<br>this is global destabilization from<br>climate-induced global change and this<br>this diagram that I've just thrown up<br>here you don't need to look at the<br>details but it's from the global<br>Economic Forum they do a global risks<br>assessment every year and this is the<br>most recent one and as time goes on the<br>global risk and increasingly in terms of<br>impact and likelihood are becoming the<br>risks related to climate change<br>ecosystem collapse climate migration<br>food and water crises globally<br>energy shocks and the political<br>instability that will fall from that and<br>also obviously the migration that will<br>fall from that as well and those are our<br>challenges that are not just going to be<br>over there<br>they're actually going to be hitting us<br>here in New Zealand economically<br>socially and environmentally so that's<br>kind of the challenges but why is our<br>local response important well first of<br>ly firstly we're really bad as<br>individuals and as a species in<br>understanding how all of our tiny<br>actions the actual that we take to to<br>choose to drive our car to the d-r-e to<br>get the milk rather than walk even<br>though it's 500 metres away and every<br>other action is actually contributing to<br>the problems that we're seeing in the<br>world today so multiples small and large<br>large actions can cumulatively lead to<br>the collapse of of a natural system and<br>we're seeing that with our waterways in<br>New Zealand at the moment and equally<br>we're seeing it globally with our<br>climate so local is where these<br>collapses are felt we feel them on our<br>doorsteps we see them in South Dunedin<br>we see them in our polluted rivers local<br>is also important because that is where<br>these multiple actions positive actions<br>small and large actions are needed for<br>effective climate response and these<br>these positive actions either put amaz'd<br>here by three photographs the one on the<br>left is the page from from night on<br>who's climate strategy a really<br>insightful production of the high level<br>thinking about how they can respond to<br>adaptation and mitigation within the one<br>set of actions the middle one is the<br>Dunedin city council and and land rates<br>for New Zealand investing in cycleways<br>and the right-hand one is a delightful<br>group of people from transition value<br>for 73 in North East Valley I'm doing<br>some gardening in the collective gardens<br>so these are examples of the kinds of<br>multiple actions we've all got to<br>undertake in order to get to those big<br>challenges and address them through<br>multiple positive actions rather than<br>in the work that we've been doing on<br>climate adaptation we've been listening<br>to the stories of community members and<br>people in councils about why it is so<br>challenging to start to think about<br>adapting to climate change and out of<br>that we've developed to to easyread<br>publications and they're both here and<br>this one here is called community<br>development for adaptation and this is<br>really a cry for councils to engage<br>really strongly with communities and a<br>wee about how collectively we might work<br>towards equitable just appropriate and<br>compassionate solutions to things like<br>what we're facing it's after meeting at<br>the moment the other is a cartoon strip<br>which is reflecting the kinds of stories<br>that we're hearing from real people<br>about what they're experiencing and the<br>kinds of solutions that people are<br>starting to come up with for adapting to<br>climate change at a local level<br>that's what localism I think it was all<br>about so my final slide what I'm saying<br>is that local is the best place to<br>realize our collective power to make a<br>change to make a change to the triple<br>challenge of mitigation adaptation and<br>building resilience to global<br>destabilization that will inevitably<br>occur in one way or another this<br>landscape that we're looking at is new<br>and it's scary and there are no road<br>maps and where there are no road maps<br>you've actually got to go back to your<br>compass and pick up that compass and say<br>what are the fundamental principles that<br>need to be guiding us here not<br>necessarily what does that ancient law<br>there which is probably outdated tell us<br>what to do we need to start going back<br>to first principles and building a new<br>and also we need to focus on solutions<br>that are both on the one hand climate<br>resilient and on the other hand are<br>actually low-carbon so how do how do we<br>find solutions because one thing that<br>concerns me a little bit about what Dave<br>was saying which was that the government<br>national government is responsible for<br>reducing greenhouse gas emissions and<br>the local government is responsible for<br>adaptation is that we could potentially<br>end up in a situation where investments<br>for adaptation are actually creating<br>more problems in terms of greenhouse gas<br>emissions so can we bring those together<br>into the one handful together and I<br>think this bullet belongs in the space<br>of collaboration between councils but<br>Andy we in businesses and community<br>organizations and communities and and<br>and and everybody who is involved in the<br>locality and by working together we can<br>actually envisage what is possible what<br>might be possible and what might be<br>creative and also hope inducing because<br>we need to create an atmosphere of hope<br>for ourselves but particularly for our<br>young people and if we can't do it here<br>we can it be done thank you<br>me tonight may be here to Theatre in<br>Roman drama for you today pop to nuclear<br>war on Tina :<br>Tina Cordova no long as you don't mean<br>Clara he finally Tara I caught up with<br>more to to the key core team wanna to<br>talk or to leave your home<br>Mike to Tonks tackling war so that as we<br>come here and just recognize that under<br>God and in this house we we stand but<br>we're on where was in a special place<br>and to say that originally I'm from<br>Wellington but some 26 years ago I moved<br>to what 240 with my wife and three<br>daughters was one more to be born here<br>and now my client my mahi here in in<br>this place in particularly in something<br>that and my present role is as the<br>director of Catholic Social Services<br>based in the kingsroad where we do some<br>really cool stuff with people both<br>helping them families and Ferno and all<br>sorts of stuff in having a part to play<br>and what happens in South Sydney them<br>and it's probably through that got<br>involved with the South need and<br>community network which is probably why<br>I'm here<br>although existential extensive you know<br>that would I'm probably here for some<br>other reason as well so<br>so this is where I'm gonna be talking<br>about tonight in my corridors but at the<br>work we're doing in South the South<br>teeny to create connections across the<br>community facilitate the realization<br>that it is indeed a great place to work<br>live and play now there were a couple of<br>challenges when we looked at South Eden<br>and one of the things that he was about<br>was to actually decide waters south<br>Dunedin we've had some photos of a<br>little bit assassin Eden who's in who's<br>out and it takes a few hours to kind of<br>work out is it just the teen streets<br>which is a suburb of assassin Eden it is<br>the is it the flat doesn't include those<br>that fit the souther need and<br>deprivation index and skirt the hills<br>is it 901 two and 901 three or is it<br>just part of the floodplain I don't<br>quite sure if we've actually answered<br>that but generally is the conversation<br>about climate change and water and the<br>excess of water has become a serious<br>topic I think those affected want to be<br>part of what we're doing so it's number<br>one the second thing about South Salinas<br>it's and you might know that I spoke<br>about a deprivation index it's probably<br>because the thing to note about sassanid<br>is often the narrative around our place<br>has been that it's is negative you know<br>low incomes lower outcomes high density<br>inadequate housing poor disabled elderly<br>as you would probably find summed up by<br>the quote that's on the writers walk in<br>the Octagon Kristine Johnson wrote 1991<br>a city built in stone on half a century<br>of gold from known hinterland a wealthy<br>little city where the rich inhabit the<br>hills and look out on the poor who<br>inhabit the flat and look at each other<br>she talking about Dunedin so for those<br>of us in south near work diff rages have<br>seen it been criticized you know analyze<br>people keep coming and doing stuff to us<br>and often we felt like Stephanie<br>the poor cousins left behind with the<br>hand-me-downs and the second-hand good<br>enough idea from Council and the rest of<br>the city now 30 years ago and turvy said<br>lobbied the council for a library and<br>South indeed and I was met with the<br>astonished reply from a counselor who<br>asked can people here use or appreciate<br>a library 15 years ago I remember<br>speaking to the council about the need<br>for a South Dunedin library as working<br>with a number of our kids to extend<br>their opportunities and what do you know<br>two years ago two and a half years ago<br>we've got a pop-up library and South<br>Dunedin and soon very soon we're gonna<br>have a real one so it's just awesome<br>these are part of the issues which<br>affect us and assassinated me and you<br>know as climate change is coming that's<br>recognizing a little of this is really<br>important as well but it was as has been<br>mentioned there is floods which have<br>kind of galvanized some community<br>response and has could have helped us<br>coordinate ourselves and then for this<br>community and a need for a plan around<br>what we can do if this happens again and<br>what can we do to ensure that those with<br>the power and responsibility can do all<br>they can to protect us from this again<br>so from this we've done a couple of<br>community Hui and drawn on the years of<br>engagement of people that have been<br>working in this afternoon area vision<br>sales Sassanian Got Talent the Action<br>Group proud to say be Stephanie D all of<br>these kind of things and so a few years<br>ago we who he was about 30 of those<br>mainly working in the area who turned up<br>to a cold wet night and we convinced the<br>flood was happening again it wasn't to<br>be but we started a conversation and the<br>last one we had just a month and a half<br>ago 170 odd people came along depending<br>a few camper counselors and hopeful<br>counselors that was<br>we had a lot of residents and a lot of<br>people that were there representing<br>others within their community interested<br>in the conversation that we're going to<br>have with the DCCC around how placed and<br>what was happening next we've been<br>really grateful to have the the<br>supporter of the DCC was the community<br>visor for the community and funding<br>coming available from the place-based<br>funding pool which is seen there kind of<br>draw together around something which<br>we've called the Sassanid and community<br>Network which is umbrella by Catholic<br>social services it's not really part of<br>my work but it's something I do for fun<br>I think and together employing two<br>amazing community workers we greet meet<br>as the people of our community seeking<br>to draw in business individuals<br>community groups small clubs all those<br>that work live and playing in the place<br>and together we're about coordinating<br>facilitating celebrating advocating<br>congregating in fact anything to do with<br>a teen but I'll talk about it a little<br>bit later and now you know while climate<br>change is a big factor for us it's not<br>the only issue that we're interested in<br>and it's important we have these<br>conversations that we've recognized<br>complexity and difficulty of people's<br>lives<br>no that's they need and as we're we're<br>occupied it's our place of leisure<br>it's our homes and so network's vision<br>is that as we work have been playing<br>here we would help to see the risks of<br>the the place of South inian and the<br>risk for city rise above that narrative<br>which we've got about what that places<br>and recognize that these heaps are<br>potential we've got people are creative<br>resourceful<br>got experienced people that have long<br>histories and thus in this place the<br>grandchildren parents were born here and<br>their children were raised here it's<br>where people have found freedom to live<br>without dependency and place where<br>people who have been able to live and<br>get the help they need and it's not just<br>an academic exercise<br>it's place which people are living and<br>invested in the outcome so you know the<br>sapling community network is has a<br>copper power of that we're not there to<br>do the work but with their money<br>bringing people together of all these<br>different factors that we can dream form<br>ideas and work on some shared solutions<br>which means not just those in the<br>community those with the power with the<br>council with the OIC<br>all of that coming together and<br>recognizing that you know while there<br>might be strong feelings on this matter<br>and there often are if she would keep<br>yelling at each other nothing's gonna<br>get done you know we just raised a lot<br>of hot air<br>ways that we can work through that and<br>have serious but difficult conversations<br>together and look at how we can achieve<br>this together because South Elena's part<br>of them it's all part of us and it's<br>important that we work together on this<br>so Harry was particularly on water<br>issues and what we did was gather people<br>around together and had DCC staff<br>members come and talk a little bit about<br>what's going on and I see people coming<br>along<br>jeanny scientists tell and share in this<br>time but an important part of all our<br>Hui is hating food is really important<br>and we like to wait really good and not<br>just a snack either you know it's it's a<br>meal it's a meal where people can stand<br>up and line up together the CEO and the<br>cleaner rubbing shoulders together<br>eating and recognizing that together you<br>know we have a need for for sustance we<br>need have a need for connection we need<br>to do this together and it's kind of<br>about creating a place which is more you<br>know it's a place which is a safe place<br>where we can I recognize that we can<br>share what needs to be done without<br>being shut down a share of what needs to<br>be said together and so you know how we<br>created this was some<br>I caught a rule from the TCC and then<br>there was an opportunity for people not<br>just to hear that but like number two<br>said the only say the whole thing of<br>sorry it's a guarantee now so Melissa<br>yeah yeah I've got four daughters<br>everyone's 1 2 3 or 4 so much easier<br>than trying to remember anyway what<br>number 2 said you know it's not just<br>about that<br>they're back conversations about us<br>sharing in this together so there was a<br>bit of a talk and then the teens around<br>the table set reflected in what they<br>heard discussed what they actually means<br>for them what their idea is their<br>engagement because it's about us as a<br>community recognizing that there's a lot<br>of experience a lot of what is there so<br>that's kind of what we're trying to do<br>and with the food together we we break<br>down some barriers from our food I noted<br>in the piece lecture last night you know<br>food is a way of breaking down barriers<br>between us so that for knowing that<br>anger can happen menarche toner can be<br>experienced which is vital if we're<br>going to have some difficult<br>conversations so in in all that we do<br>we're pretty keen to have language which<br>people can understand clarified and sure<br>that the talk is not just between those<br>at the front but around the tables as we<br>said and it's important very but and all<br>of this conversation because we're<br>talking about this climate change and it<br>can be kind of academic unless you are<br>living there unless you know you are the<br>one that digs a hole in your backyard<br>and sees the tide come up up and go out<br>and it's important that you know this is<br>not just something which is to be<br>thought about this is their livelihoods<br>it's their relationships friendships<br>it's all about that and it's important<br>that we work together and don't just<br>impose an idea on that because it's<br>charging it's also important when you<br>think that you know climate change is<br>not the only issue that we face down<br>there so it's about how when we pay the<br>this week how will we get the kid new<br>shoes where's that next meal coming from<br>the thing you got to break through and<br>watch this all the way it's important<br>that we take that time to recognize also<br>that when we're having these<br>conversations with the people that are<br>living them that they're not just an<br>idea out there it can be a real thing<br>which focuses their fear and the<br>frustrations and can affect how they<br>might then manage their family life<br>because you all know what it's like if<br>you have that conversation and it just<br>sticks there and you can't deal with the<br>other stresses which we're having to<br>deal with so I think it you know we're<br>having localism conversations with<br>people who are affected by this we need<br>to think carefully about how we raise<br>these issues and then we don't overwhelm<br>people a lot of things we'd like to do<br>in the network stuff and when we do this<br>is recognize we've got to have fun<br>so--but asked us can you catch cotton<br>ball okay you go oh you can could you<br>catch him I okay cool can you pitch a<br>caramel sometimes of you getting<br>everything thrown at you have you how<br>can you take all that on when other<br>things are going on it's important when<br>we have these conversations just to<br>remember our people you know one of the<br>other things which I suppose is the fear<br>of us as we look to bring about a great<br>place and stephenie them is that all the<br>resources go into climate change and we<br>forget to not develop our playgrounds<br>rejuvenate our shopping centers plant<br>color connect to our neighbors create<br>canals for boat races and Shore jobs and<br>occupations for our citizens and<br>invocate from living wages and work from<br>sure we have safe streets and free from<br>the scourge of drugs and all the other<br>stuff that goes on all of this stuff is<br>important as well<br>people's lives are complex and there's<br>moldy things going on so talk about<br>climate change let's remember all the<br>other stuff as well so that people can<br>so time for engagement we have plenty of<br>time now just some questions engagement<br>what the rule try and keep the questions<br>short so we can get through lots of them<br>because we're recording this event if<br>you can just show if you want to ask a<br>question I'm gonna really inelegantly<br>race around and give you a mic so that<br>we can hear your questions so who would<br>like to begin first thanks Jimmy I'm<br>stopped Willis and thank you I think<br>there's a lot covered there and clearly<br>climate change puts us into uncharted<br>and unprecedented territory and it's<br>really great to see the the meeting city<br>councillors put on the twenty thirty<br>goal we'd like to see the IRC do there<br>something someone but that's going to<br>put real challenges on local government<br>and when we think that there's a<br>compression of time as number four just<br>spoke about there for people to make<br>decisions what what impact is that going<br>to have on local government are we going<br>to see politicians making the popular<br>choices rather than the right choices to<br>build resilience for our communities is<br>there going to be a real tension there<br>well clearly when you've got an<br>aspirational goal like that it throws up<br>challenges but the way that local<br>government works is that when a<br>resolution like that what a motion like<br>that is put through it becomes council<br>policy and it is the responsibility of<br>the council and its officers to work<br>towards fulfilling that I can't tell you<br>whether a future council might rescind<br>that of course they might because that's<br>the nature of governance in this country<br>whether it's a central government level<br>or local government level but the<br>council was certainly under no illusions<br>about the challenge of attempting that<br>and it was put to me yesterday actually<br>I gave a submission to the Select<br>Committee on this and they put to me<br>the question was council aware of what<br>the economic cost of this aspiration<br>would be had we measured it before we<br>made it and I said no we haven't and I<br>was questioned as to whether that was a<br>little foolish if we didn't know what<br>something was going to cost why were we<br>going to do it I think there are two<br>answers to that the first is that if we<br>waited until we knew all effects would<br>be beyond the time we were talking about<br>and the second is which I didn't think<br>about that the time extra matter of fact<br>but I reflected on it later we know damn<br>well what the cost of not doing anything<br>is going to be so we just better get on<br>so I know that we've got a Paris<br>agreement signed and I was just<br>wondering with that has any power to<br>make a change if we have climate change<br>denying councilors or even a mayor not<br>saying that you are but is there<br>anything that can be done about that is<br>there anything that legally binds<br>counselors to follow science or are we<br>able to have that be put into our public<br>directives if you like from for instance<br>the ministry for the environment where<br>they may say we think you should allow<br>in your planning for sea-level rise of X<br>over a certain period of time and every<br>now and again those projections are<br>amended and there's the expectation that<br>you that councils take those into<br>account there's also pressure on the<br>government at the moment to allow<br>climate change considerations to be<br>taken into account in resource<br>management applications at the moment<br>they're not and it leads to some lost<br>opportunities I think but yes you can<br>you can you can as we've seen all around<br>the world fools are elected<br>democratically you just touched on my<br>question actually um in terms of the<br>primary piece of legislation determining<br>land use and the power of local<br>authorities in determining land uses the<br>considering the court didn't listen to<br>Shawn Elias we have the local<br>authorities power is limited to at it<br>not any mitigation in terms of that<br>hurdle<br>it seems currently what are initiatives<br>that the local authorities are empowered<br>to make under other pieces of<br>legislation and for example what do you<br>think of the climate action framework<br>that the Auckland councillors is<br>currently taking submissions on is that<br>something we could implement here in<br>Tunisia I'm aware I'm not look I'm not<br>too familiar with the Auckland when so<br>I'm not going to comment on it but only<br>four days ago I signed the letter of<br>support for an NGO appealing to the<br>government to make the RMA consistent<br>with the impending zero carbon built in<br>other words allowing not having a<br>conflict between the two and indeed the<br>reason that I could sign a letter of<br>support on behalf of local government<br>you zealand is that a rement asking for<br>just that or pretty much close to it was<br>passed at the last local government New<br>Zealand conference AGM in July so we're<br>aware of the issue and we're asking<br>government to address it yeah I'd like<br>to add that to to say yeah that there<br>needs to be a lot of attention paid to<br>how different mechanisms will complement<br>one another to achieve the outcomes we<br>want both with mitigation and adaptation<br>alongside each other and I think early<br>on there was a governmental belief that<br>the emissions trading scheme would be<br>the answer to our prayers and that the<br>economic signals would actually achieve<br>all of the behavioural changes that have<br>enabled that that were necessary it's<br>now obvious and and the Productivity<br>Commission has has made this statement<br>they actually until we get to about $200<br>a ton it's currently $25 a ton we're not<br>really going to make one iota of<br>difference in behavior<br>for that reason it's really incumbent<br>because of the urgency of getting action<br>on climate change in particularly<br>mitigation at this point in time we need<br>to put in place I believe every bit of<br>complementary supporting legislation all<br>and also supporting strategy and policy<br>so it's not just what is legally<br>required but what councils are building<br>into the everyday decision-making that<br>like Auckland and like to some extent<br>and BCC as well who's got some some<br>really good strategies around this to to<br>build us into the everyday<br>decision-making so that there the<br>procurement their decisions about<br>infrastructure the decisions about about<br>about what to do with their wastes are<br>all determined and influenced by this<br>this overriding ambition of of reducing<br>greenhouse gas emissions so the more we<br>can do at every level the better<br>can I throw in a question at this point<br>for about youth engagement and Melissa<br>and Mike and we've been hearing quite a<br>lot in various reports at the moment<br>about the local elections coming up<br>about the number of young people<br>engaging can you so in terms of youth<br>engagement that I've involved in these<br>like a I think it's really important<br>that when we talking about youth<br>engagement there were not that are<br>getting any voices of older people and I<br>think you get a bit a little bit<br>sensitive when we say youth in certain<br>conversations because it's like<br>involving us but if anything we are<br>really are the future and so we want to<br>be able that right now that we want to<br>make sure that right now when we in<br>these discussions and then these groups<br>and to partaking and democracy that<br>we've set up the best possible chances<br>for ourselves for when we've reached<br>those positions but also for those<br>coming behind us and so the youth today<br>I'm so inspired and so as we call it<br>hyped to ensure that their conversation<br>keeps going in there and you know please<br>know that we are looking at what<br>come before us and we do learn from the<br>great work and also the big mistakes<br>that have happened before us and I'm<br>sure we'll make some but it is it's it's<br>youth engagement is so rich today and<br>you know I'm actually not youth anymore<br>makes you look it up so out of there but<br>I'm still gonna call myself you so<br>thanks number two I wouldn't call myself<br>use anymore either so but it's the mid<br>work part of our he is around engaging<br>young people because ultimately the<br>decisions we're making is gonna be the<br>things that they have to live with and<br>so how we they haven't been a big part<br>of a Hui but they are part of the<br>facilitators role in actually connecting<br>with schools and so on around what they<br>see and what they would like for their<br>community as well so um we're getting<br>some of those voices we pulled up some<br>of that recently with a TDS picnic<br>well TB is hospital which we had and<br>Sasson Eden which brought together<br>University the Medical Students dental<br>and all sorts of others and hit some pop<br>up playground and a few other things<br>that happen and we're talking to some of<br>the young ones that came along most of<br>them just wanted better playgrounds and<br>cellphone Eden but you know it's it's<br>about engaging their voice and we know<br>this is totally important because<br>they've got a stake or hopefully a<br>mistake in this er no future development<br>around I'm hearing lots about people<br>about human beings we are not the only<br>inhabitants of this place<br>I have not heard anybody have anything<br>to say about are we happy to lose all<br>our seabirds we which were online to do<br>we okay with the decisions that were<br>made for wealth and power<br>turn nourishing wetlands into problems<br>is there any concern for the other<br>inhabitants of the earth it's definitely<br>a lot of concern for other inhabitants<br>of the earth and and as we all know<br>there there is we are currently facing a<br>mass extinction of many species globally<br>and this is of huge concern United<br>Nations has been putting out reports<br>about this for for some time this<br>tonight's about localism so so I think<br>we need to put our minds to what we can<br>do at a local level to encourage the<br>creation of healthy ecosystems that will<br>support life and those that's not just<br>human life but but all life forms and I<br>don't have the answers but I think<br>there's a lot of opportunity in some of<br>the the ideas and experiments and an<br>actual new ways of operating that are<br>starting to occur with things like for<br>example regenerative farming which is<br>looking at farming in a way that that<br>builds biodiversity in the soil and<br>encourages biodiversity within within<br>farm practice and another example is the<br>is the planting of of indigenous forests<br>as carbon sinks but also to encourage<br>the the evolution of of biodiversity<br>back into our areas and actually I see<br>another interesting opportunity which<br>which one can be slightly cynical about<br>but if you if you look at somewhere like<br>the tyree plain which most of which is a<br>drained wetland as sea level rises<br>that's that's actually going to become<br>wet again it's going to return to a<br>wetland I'm not saying this is the<br>solution to biodiversity but I'm seeing<br>a kind of interesting take here that<br>that potentially areas like that can<br>I just I just want to talk about public<br>transportation because you know unless<br>you make an effort to have a serious bus<br>service there's there's no way you're<br>going to get people off the roads and<br>and do anything to prevent some of the<br>problems you get from more and more cars<br>I live in white Chevy we don't really<br>have a service we have three buses a day<br>no weekend's no evenings to get out to<br>my Mirai in no taco I have to plan a<br>month ahead for meetings because they're<br>always on weekends unless it's a<br>tonguing so to get to get neighbors on<br>board who sometimes cancel on me<br>it's hugely difficult for me to get up<br>there to pick up my grandkids from the<br>airport I'm 10 15 minutes from the city<br>but I it the cost of getting in you know<br>as they try if they come on a weekend<br>and then getting out to the airport on a<br>bus you know if there's no public<br>transport to the airport as you all know<br>so yeah so that that's an additional<br>difficulty the try calling the Regional<br>Council and they say that their<br>schedules are made up on demand I've<br>tried talking to all my all three of my<br>community board members and and though<br>they've made notes of it they say it's<br>not really their area and in fact none<br>of them have ever taken the bus so<br>that's kind of interesting they said<br>they would if there would be more<br>convenient but obviously it's not<br>convenient for them so they don't take<br>it so you're not going to get cars off<br>the road there's a but there's a train<br>that goes through every couple of hours<br>but of course it's it's working for<br>Frontera I would say it's usually milk<br>powder or something isn't it<br>it won't and they frequently stopped to<br>reshuffle @ny taffy but they don't they<br>wouldn't there's no way they tell me we<br>can get passenger trains<br>area they only goes up to Middlemarch so<br>yeah the question is about public<br>transport and you know I just believe<br>there needs got to find a way to get<br>well as you're probably aware the<br>Regional Council is given responsibility<br>for public transport in the city council<br>is not allowed to have responsibility by<br>law but I would I would say that we<br>don't have ajust a public transport<br>problem we don't just have a car problem<br>we have a multimodal transportation<br>problem and what we've got to figure out<br>is how to give people options that are<br>affordable but I would point out that<br>there's a danger in going through far in<br>thinking that and I'm all for you know I<br>own an electric car I'm all for the<br>shift to non-fossil fuel transport but I<br>would point out that there's a danger<br>and saying because we don't drive<br>internal combustion Eastern engine cars<br>we won't need roads we will need roads<br>for buses<br>we'll need roads for electric cars more<br>lead roads for a bicycles and things<br>like that so that doesn't solve your<br>problem in public transport but as I say<br>a DC we're not allowed to have<br>responsibility for it anyway so just<br>it's part of this happening community<br>network it's part of our conversation<br>with community and engagement around<br>that because it's an issue that we face<br>and looking at a conversation with OIC<br>and also what other solutions we might<br>come up with that work for people<br>together<br>but listen my name is Michael I was<br>really taken by your ideas about the<br>Christchurch work called I speak and<br>Dragon's Den and the elevator concept<br>you talked about and made me think about<br>a bee in my bonnet about local<br>like I've really came to see the idea of<br>youth councils established as advisory<br>groups to the existing local governments<br>and I understand that in Christchurch<br>either the city or the region I'm not<br>sure which has such a thing I'm keen to<br>see such a thing in Dunedin and the<br>cross Otago made up of say seventeen to<br>twenty five-year-olds of all kinds of<br>educational experience all kinds of<br>ethnicity all kinds of location who<br>would look at the work that the council<br>City Council Regional Council District<br>Council has in front of it and gives<br>them advice and the climate change that<br>a particularly relevant concept I think<br>because young people have far better<br>informed far more switched-on about<br>climate change issues that all backers<br>like me I completely afeared supports it<br>what you've just said um so in terms of<br>building the Youth Council in<br>Christchurch it really was driven by the<br>local council and that was from their<br>individual interactions that they made<br>in their own communities and so that's<br>where the idea grew and so a group of us<br>that I was fortunate enough to be asked<br>to be in this we had various engagements<br>with the Muslim if the communities the<br>Korean communities and all sorts of that<br>you know with manaphy noir and very ways<br>and all the communities there and then<br>we formed a Youth Action Plan and from<br>there we made recommendations to local<br>council so it took about six months to a<br>year made recommendations to local<br>so from that youth action plan we<br>created something we called a youth<br>order and so when they create council<br>hubs or you know new buildings or some<br>sort of service they would ask that you<br>audit group to come and all of it using<br>their young perspectives and experiences<br>and from that we would either give them<br>the tech will make recommendations or we<br>would highlight exactly where we see<br>there's going to be you know some issues<br>with engagement from young people what<br>the actually done is it's actually from<br>that type of organizing and establishing<br>of pathways for young people but the<br>recent events of Christchurch it takes<br>for example we already had an<br>established action plan as well as risk<br>management solutions and such a good<br>relationship with the council as well as<br>funding that I mentioned in my talk that<br>we were able to have wraparound services<br>for the Muslim community in the youth<br>groups so we brought in youth people who<br>work in mental health from around the<br>country we paid for their brought the<br>men ran workshops for the young Muslim<br>community and this was driven by<br>non-muslims from the Youth Council which<br>sits alongside the City Council it's so<br>definitely agree in terms of the climate<br>change conversation and we having a<br>month so we have it amongst our own<br>groups already it's like a matter of<br>against our Council and heard you know<br>not just using us for youth advisors to<br>compensate for clumsy decisions but<br>actually using us to be to embed some of<br>our ideas and the actual structural and<br>system and policies that are created so<br>thank you better understand for the<br>University of Southampton in the UK and<br>also from Janet's Center for<br>sustainability so I come from a country<br>which is now headed by a smart fool who<br>has taken power partly because<br>subsidiarity broke down in the EU not<br>just because it's slightly broke down<br>but because subsidiarity is very poorly<br>understood by people citizens within the<br>which has led to some of the issues that<br>we now face now you put your finger very<br>neatly on one of the problems about<br>subsea subsidiarity and the Localism<br>which is the decisions which are<br>subsidized to local decision-makers can<br>therefore be different between different<br>regions so a decision taken by for<br>example Dunedin City Council all by the<br>OIC is not necessarily replicated in the<br>same form 100 meters away across the<br>boundary now you may have seen this<br>already with your district health boards<br>we certainly seen it in the UK it's<br>called the postcode lottery movement to<br>health treatments are you ready for that<br>kind of disparity across boundaries and<br>if so how are you going to deal with it<br>I think that I'm not sure I explained<br>that quickly why I think local decisions<br>should be made I think they should be<br>made because the different circumstances<br>require different solutions in different<br>places so on where it's appropriate more<br>than comfortable with that what I meant<br>by the need for central government<br>having more of an oversight on<br>mitigation measures was not that local<br>government wouldn't was was that was<br>that's where you need the consistency<br>it's in the mitigation its and the<br>adaptation that you have to add that you<br>have to address difference but from the<br>mitigation point of view central<br>government should be setting the targets<br>and the head would signed up to them in<br>Paris but then they need to be drive<br>driven down at a to a local level so<br>that we all play our part but going back<br>to your to actual the question about<br>difference I'm only worried about it<br>where it matters if if adaptation as I<br>said if adaptation in the Dunedin area<br>needs us to address rising ground water<br>levels in South Dunedin that's what we<br>focus on whereas adaptation in the<br>Hawke's Bay may be something quite<br>different it might be more around the<br>different patterns of flooding that they<br>get from short rivers so<br>I'm pretty comfortable where it's<br>appropriate for difference hello<br>so you sort of talk about this like top<br>down effect in terms of mitigation<br>strategies where you believe it will<br>trickle down I sort of believe it I feel<br>like I speak for a lot of people when I<br>say that mitigation strategies need to<br>be the opposite way around and go from<br>the bottom up so more of a concentration<br>of mitigation at the local level<br>I was wondering your thoughts on that<br>look I don't think we're at odds on this<br>I just think that if we've got if if we<br>have a lot of local efforts that are<br>disparate and we don't have a national<br>target and a national aspiration and<br>also then it spreads over and more into<br>the adaptation thing as I said a<br>national mandate and enable Minh 10 it<br>won't work but I'm completely with you<br>I'm you know buying at the local level<br>is absolutely essential and and I think<br>it goes to the to the conversation about<br>youth as well because there's no reason<br>why in this Texas every reason why have<br>youth would have more pertinent ideas on<br>this then older people for the simple<br>reason that there was no precedent for<br>the issues that we face now so in<br>traditional societies when you were<br>confronted with a problem the first<br>thing you did was ask the question well<br>what would we what it our forefathers do<br>last time that's happened and that was a<br>pretty good luck because the usually<br>things that happened before that was a<br>pretty good way of doing it I would<br>point out that what we face now what<br>humanity faces now they have never faced<br>before certainly the combination of<br>climate change and species extinction<br>and resource depletion and OH<br>population all coming together we've<br>never faced it so there's no point in<br>looking back and saying well what when<br>did this happen before<br>and there's no point in asking an old<br>person and expecting them to know from<br>experience how it deal with them younger<br>people's ideas there's wisdom in the<br>past but what I'm saying is that young<br>people are likely to have as many good<br>ideas about it as experienced people all<br>right the conversation is really only<br>just beginning and I'm sorry that we<br>didn't mean the chance to get to<br>everybody's questions but I'd like to<br>thank you all for coming out and<br>engaging in this discussion<br>there are remember if you know anyone<br>who needs a bit of a nudge to get<br>themselves registered to vote we have<br>the things here to help you out and of<br>course we've got Janet's information<br>also that you're welcome to take on your<br>way out but could I ask you now please<br>join me in thanking very much could I</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul
