sincere<br>apologies if anyone has come as the<br>consequence of the ODT ad which was<br>advertising a completely different<br>seminar on the postcode cold war but<br>that one's in October so come back in<br>October for that one don't you need to<br>lead do so but if you stay we would be<br>very pleased of you so populism as the<br>picture for our poster suggests it's<br>generally seen in everyday speech and<br>also in political thought to be<br>dangerous and particularly dangerous for<br>sorry I'm Vicky Spencer from the<br>politics program and I'll be introducing<br>my colleagues very shortly so populism<br>has generally seemed to be in very<br>negative terms it tends to evoke<br>right-wing authoritarian leaders who<br>have a tendency to appeal to the more<br>debased elements of the masses and to<br>manipulate them in order to have certain<br>scapegoats and to go against certain out<br>Cylons like refugees or immigrants so<br>from the perspective of progressive<br>democratic politics on the whole most of<br>the rhetoric is very anti populism but<br>that seems to also be somewhat of a<br>paradox because we live in democratic<br>societies and in order to be able to win<br>an election you have to have be popular<br>and popular leaders or often to see be<br>seen to be an asset to their parties so<br>on the one hand it evokes images of<br>Hitler in Germany Pauline Hanson in<br>Australia where I'm from and Donald<br>Trump<br>our most recent leader to hate in the<br>United States and the ghost has come<br>back obviously doesn't want us to talk<br>about this particular issue but on the<br>other hand there are certain Democratic<br>leaders who have been really popular and<br>the Democratic Left and liberals really<br>love like for example Obama Barack Obama<br>in the United States and going back a<br>few years because it's probably being<br>not one for a while but Bob Hawke in<br>Australia who seemed to in one year when<br>pretty much every sporting event in the<br>world that was important for Australians<br>so he was definitely loved at the time<br>so this evening our panel is going to<br>challenge their conventional political<br>wisdom that it's something negative and<br>explore under what conditions can a<br>populist charismatic leader actually be<br>good for democracy and I'm very pleased<br>tonight to be able to introduce and<br>welcome very good colleague and friend<br>from Victoria University Willington who<br>is a senior lecturer in political theory<br>and also the head of the school of<br>history philosophy political science and<br>international relations which is rather<br>a mouthful he is the author of two books<br>non democratic politics and<br>authoritarianism dictatorship and<br>democratization and his other book is a<br>stranger's knowledge statesman<br>philosophy and law in Plato's Statesman<br>he's also the editor of collection<br>entitled democratic moments and his<br>interests include non democratic<br>politics so you're welcome to asking<br>questions about that as well as well as<br>Greek ancient Greek and Roman thought<br>he's written book chapters and articles<br>and other thinkers like Foucault and<br>Arendt<br>John Rawls<br>and here's also an expert on the history<br>of democratic thought and his paper<br>today is entitled demagogues charisma<br>and representation in the age of Trump<br>so javis going to give his talk for<br>about half an hour and then my other<br>very good colleague who we're lucky<br>enough to have in politics program and<br>our Otago and she's also in philosophy<br>professor Lisa Ellis is going to talk<br>for 15 maybe 20 minutes in response to<br>Harvey as paper and it's actually<br>because Xavier gave both of us early<br>drafted this paper that we read earlier<br>this year that we decided to invite him<br>because we thought it was such an<br>interesting paper and so relevant for<br>current politics now Lisa if you don't<br>know her is the author of two books on<br>cants political thought and also an<br>editor of collection on cants political<br>theory she's also the co-editor of the<br>wily black will eight vol encyclopedia<br>of political thought<br>however since she's given up can't she's<br>become an environmental political<br>theorist and she's also from the United<br>States so the particular events at the<br>moment certainly she will have some<br>useful reflections on them<br>so after that then we're going to do the<br>roving TV presenter with the microphone<br>so that you can ask questions and I'll<br>be running around that so I'll turn the<br>thanks Vikki thanks everyone<br>thanks for having me here Vicki said I'm<br>gonna talk to you<br>demagogues charisma and representation<br>in the age of Trump um she just clicker<br>works<br>so we start by thinking about demagogues<br>the idea of a demagogue has long been<br>seen as a pathology of democracy so ever<br>since the first discussions in ancient<br>Greece about democracy the demagogue has<br>been seen as a kind of death<br>ever-present danger democratic politics<br>faces we think of the demagogue as you<br>know the kind of person who appeals to<br>prejudice passion bigotry and so on<br>mislead the public to make them mislead<br>them about their real genuine interests<br>to incite the basic passions of the<br>public to make the weaker argument<br>appear the stronger as the ancient Greek<br>phrase had it now the word didn't always<br>have this meaning the earliest usage the<br>demagogue simply means the leader of the<br>demos the leader of the people but very<br>early on it no appeared that's the the<br>bad leader of the people the person who<br>threatens to turn democracy into the<br>rule of the mob or trade sensitive and<br>move democracy towards steering now even<br>today we find that demagogue is sort of<br>remains a stubborn persistent problem in<br>democracy it only has to mention trump<br>classic demagogue big politics and in<br>order to think about this I want to turn<br>to the thought of Max Weber next lever<br>is of course towering figure 20th<br>century social sciences and he was<br>writing around the time of the First<br>World War<br>ambivalent view of the demagogue we<br>thought that you know demagogues were<br>actually kind of not only inevitable but<br>sometimes quite necessary and democratic<br>politics only that they could be a<br>positive force and democracy so so I<br>want to talk about kind of three<br>questions so good person why is it that<br>demagogy kind of been a broad sense of<br>elizabeth's kind of inevitable and<br>modern democratic politics and what<br>might it be necessary don't know I'll<br>talk about a little bit about how your<br>way to demagogues get their authority<br>why are you why can't they be effective<br>you know why is it that demagogic<br>appeals seem to be quite effective<br>sometimes and the final bit is about<br>what under what conditions you can think<br>demagogic leaders into responsible<br>politicians<br>how is demagoguery potentially a<br>positive thing now there's a kind of an<br>ambivalent view you know favor didn't<br>claim that demagogues were good in<br>general but he didn't claim that they<br>were bad in general either what's that<br>but you know the first question um when<br>we think about modern democracy they're<br>kind of two facts that they thought were<br>very important to keep in mind the first<br>of all is that politics is always what<br>we might call agonistic it's about<br>struggle there are contending visions of<br>the common interest people disagree<br>about fundamental values and they fight<br>about them they're not simply satisfied<br>with letting the other side win so so<br>politics expresses a struggle between<br>contending parties literally political<br>parties<br>which Express different views of what<br>the common interest or the national<br>interest<br>actually I and the second thing to note<br>here is that politics in modern<br>democratic society is this mass politics<br>where societies are large complex<br>they're not small-scale places even New<br>Zealand is by the standards of say<br>ancient democracies a pretty large place<br>and so the contest between these<br>different visions of values of interest<br>and so on it's always about loyalty of<br>very large numbers of people you have to<br>persuade the voters and persuading the<br>border is a kind of mass industrial sort<br>of enterprise so there's a development<br>of persuasive techniques people trying<br>to persuade people voters to support one<br>side or another of this struggle over<br>visions of the common interest<br>um and so very thought that when you<br>think about these two conditions you<br>basically you're going to get two<br>different kinds of leaders emerging<br>democracy these are kind of rough<br>tendencies is not the only thing that<br>happens but the first one we can call<br>sort of the vote-getting specialist a<br>professional politician the person who<br>knows the way about campaign<br>contributions PR you know how to get the<br>retail vote out and so on and so forth<br>create or produce large numbers of<br>folders for a particular vision of the<br>common interest and then there is a<br>another side to this which is what you<br>might call the specialist in persuasion<br>so it's the party man the party person<br>and the demagogue the person who is able<br>to who has a neck or a gift for crafting<br>and the persuasive narratives of<br>identity or of interest and so on and<br>therefore can put people on their side<br>in fact he even said that you know this<br>is one reason that why lawyers have a<br>comparative advantage in democratic<br>politics because they are trained to<br>argue their case they're trained to make<br>speeches and so they end up you know<br>being the kind of people who can thrive<br>in the environment of democratic<br>politics so when he was writing he had<br>in mind something like the Gilded Age of<br>American politics we have a so called<br>machine politics of the time a<br>professional party man professional<br>machine politician of the time it's a<br>sort of guy wasn't necessarily very good<br>at giving a speech but he was good at<br>you know transactional leadership look<br>the kind of you know getting benefits<br>doled out so that both voters will turn<br>out and you know put the party in power<br>favors are given ok so there's like this<br>is whole a form of retail politics that<br>led to a kind of politician who had<br>power but wasn't necessarily<br>representing any larger cause right so<br>these are people who only cared about<br>power and their rewards it brings the<br>sort of unprincipled politics where you<br>know we can find many examples of this<br>today we see political leaders<br>don't seem to have a very clear set of<br>principles they go where the wind blows<br>they go with whatever votes whatever<br>whatever you where will you get the most<br>votes where ever you can get the most<br>campaign money where ever you can get<br>the most favors and so on and so forth<br>I think perhaps one example of this is<br>particularly clear is Mitch McConnell a<br>leader of the Senate right now in the US<br>I think of this it's a political figure<br>who is clearly sort of machine<br>politician he's not a charismatic<br>political leader he's not the sort of<br>person who has a clear ideological or<br>grand vision politics he seems to be in<br>it for the power I never thought this<br>all I know this is not a good thing if<br>all you have are politicians who are<br>machine politicians represent kind of<br>narrow interests you get a plutocratic<br>politics of business interests of a very<br>narrow interest groups contending<br>together without any larger set of<br>values so what's the alternative here<br>and he thought well the alternative to<br>this sort of narrow interest based<br>politics is the politics of charismatic<br>leadership<br>one sample here and this is a politics<br>of you seems to articulate big visions<br>big convictions tickle eights in you big<br>values seems to be about something<br>grander than narrow bits of inches its<br>articulated to rhetorical speeches media<br>and so on that that create big<br>narratives about identity about values<br>about hope center today sort of most<br>kind of the appeal of Obama in his<br>campaign you know the first time he run<br>for president posters like this kind of<br>express the idea that people had about<br>him now might have disappointed those<br>hopes but he did the example here is<br>simply meant to illustrate the sort of<br>the the alternate edition of this um<br>what exactly is this charismatic quality<br>I'm very very famous for being this big<br>picture sort of distinction between the<br>sources of authority Authority is not<br>the same as power you can have power<br>because you control resources or force<br>and so on third is the ability to have<br>other people do things you want them to<br>do because I think it's the right thing<br>to do all right<br>and you thought well they're kind of<br>three sources there's the legal person<br>the authority of that comes from having<br>a legal position right you obey because<br>it's the Prime Minister telling you to<br>do it or because it's a president who's<br>telling to do it um the authority of<br>tradition and custom you obey because<br>it's a customary thing to do the sort of<br>norms of the place is what we normally<br>do you obey because of also because<br>there's something special<br>the individual charismatic quality do<br>you think that the individual has some<br>some gift that makes them wart following<br>them makes them what doing things I ask<br>of you now not every demagogue it's a<br>charismatic person these are sort of<br>somewhat separate ideas be a demagogue<br>without being charismatic just won't be<br>that effective in some way um but the<br>thing about charismatic leaders is that<br>if ever so this is kind of in tension<br>so the charismatic you know somebody who<br>has charismatic Authority is the kind of<br>person who can articulate new values new<br>visions of what's possible to change the<br>narrative in some way and because<br>they're in so this is a distinct source<br>of authority charismatic leader can<br>overcome those constraints of tradition<br>law institutions and so on there's a<br>kind of you know if ever sees modern<br>society is having a kind of an inertia<br>now we do things in particular ways<br>legal bureaucratic constraints encroach<br>on society all the time tradition<br>customary ways of doing things existing<br>values are kind of way on everyday ways<br>of doing things the charismatic leader<br>breaks with that you can articulate new<br>ways of doing things change the<br>narrative break the norms say and do<br>things that are in some sense taboo or<br>they're not that the things that<br>everybody says now he said David takes<br>theology the tempter is my term that<br>first appears in the letter to the<br>Corinthians the first letter to the<br>Corinthians Paul it means the gifts of<br>the Holy Spirit<br>I mean until he starts speaking about<br>charisma it's a pretty obscurity<br>people didn't use it that much it's a<br>kind of technical term in Christian<br>theology and what he goes is you know he<br>picks the stamen he connects it to the<br>idea of a Tori says how come some people<br>have this kind of special way of have a<br>special kind of authority that goes<br>beyond what's given by legal position or<br>tradition and custom so it takes this<br>idea of this sort of this religious idea<br>like the gift of the Holy Spirit and he<br>says you know what charisma does good<br>Christmas is this like when enough<br>people think that you have something<br>special then that gives that person<br>now we tend to use the same charisma<br>very loosely so we talk about<br>charismatic leaders all the time and we<br>you know if you're asked to explain what<br>a charismatic leader is you might say<br>well is somebody who has a kind of<br>personal magnetism or somebody who can<br>give a good rabble rousing speech or<br>something like that man well look what<br>matters is not like the specific thing<br>that the person does but the fact that<br>other people think they have a gift they<br>have been and other people have to<br>validate that charisma charisma is not<br>an inherent quality of the linear it's<br>something that other people see in the<br>leader and they validate it and so<br>they're kind of two ways of doing this<br>you know thinking about this um you can<br>think of something like sociologist<br>sometimes called success carries man<br>what is where is the source of charisma<br>was when you have a leader<br>who somebody who does something that<br>other people in the group considered<br>kind of mayor activist very unlikely<br>they achieved something that other<br>people thought couldn't be done you know<br>maybe there's a big crisis in the<br>country<br>this person comes through you know gets<br>elected to office and they achieve<br>something quite unlikely turn the<br>country around this is by the way this<br>is sort of one the classic explanation<br>of Hitler's charisma and ian kershaw<br>book admit it's not so much about speech<br>making it's about having come to power<br>at just the right time so that<br>determines situation suddenly improved<br>once the Nazis came to power and this<br>seems very unlikely a big crisis all of<br>a sudden Germany starts doing well<br>gaining all this victories and so on so<br>the person is seen as having achieved a<br>kind of miraculous success but they have<br>to keep proving this if they don't<br>succeed over time their charisma is lost<br>and again this is sort of sometimes used<br>to explained Hitlerian charisma once you<br>know the Nazi armies know loose<br>Stalingrad praise month Hitler sort of<br>goes down or you can think of this model<br>sort of more broadly see success I'm<br>doing something that actually furthers<br>the interest of a group and it's<br>something very difficult and it's<br>therefore unlikely and so vivid speaks<br>of like miracle making and his examples<br>are about historical examples are always<br>about people who achieved things that<br>seem miraculous to others but there's a<br>different kind of charisma as well which<br>has less to do with achieving something<br>that further say interests of a group<br>articulating ambition a narrative around<br>a structure of value that's important to<br>you the charismatic leader paints a<br>picture that is extremely convincing to<br>a particular set of people it makes them<br>understand themselves better then they<br>themselves used to be able to also the<br>case nautical either kind of gives them<br>a vision of who they are<br>um so can think of it as so what is a<br>representation the other case medic<br>leader makes represents a particular<br>group and representation is about two<br>things I like I have this picture there<br>is less my meanness by the last case so<br>classic picture I spoke about the<br>representation the artist is<br>representing the Spanish royal family<br>but also about the representing who is<br>in the picture as well so when a<br>politician represents they do those two<br>things they provide kind of a picture of<br>the group that they're representing you<br>are the people was pure the people who<br>is you know Kiwi or British or American<br>your real Americans who have these<br>characteristics it paints a picture of<br>who they are and it paints a picture of<br>with these characteristics and so on so<br>representation you know you can play<br>with the meaning of like the ideals so<br>we think of political representation as<br>we might think of pictorial<br>representation do we represent in both<br>senses politician paints a picture of<br>the people that they are representing<br>and not themselves as they're<br>represented oh and that's more obviously<br>clear in the case of the charismatic<br>leader who has a kind of<br>representational charisma they're good<br>at drawing pictures for a particular<br>group they create a picture of a group<br>through their actions and speech that is<br>sort of like you know in the case of<br>Trump not here you know what Trump is<br>good at is being a larger-than-life<br>version of the people he represents it's<br>not that he is like them it's not it's<br>not that he is you know he has an<br>identity in the sense of being same<br>social background or class and so on<br>he's sort of like a larger-than-life<br>version of them of the people he claims<br>to represent um now in representing them<br>another thing that's interesting about<br>the way in which Trump represents people<br>sorry you just want to get this right<br>right<br>so you charismatic politician like I was<br>saying carries mais norm breaking when<br>you think about how Trump speaks for<br>instance to use constantly breaking what<br>constantly saying things that get people<br>you know drive people crazy because you<br>know he's saying all the steps the stuff<br>that you're not supposed to be able to<br>say right because it's you know big<br>addicting prejudiced and horrific and<br>all kinds of other things I'm but<br>precisely because of that no I'm<br>breaking he sort of provides this<br>picture people who he is he's not<br>beholden to tradition custom the<br>existing set of institutions right um<br>and articulates at the same time a<br>different vision not a particularly<br>inclusive vision but he paints a picture<br>of who are say real Americans rather<br>than the unreal ones who don't count<br>now I spoke up earlier about kind of two<br>kinds of case my kind of success carries<br>manda or presentation or symbolic<br>charisma and they go together you can't<br>survive on representation alone the<br>charismatic leader has to constantly<br>prove themselves they have to constantly<br>show that they can further the interest<br>of the group they get to constantly show<br>that they're actually providing those<br>miracles in a sense um it's a little bit<br>about why Trump constantly says that<br>he's waiting you have to win all the<br>time if you're a charismatic leader you<br>don't win enough lose your followers<br>desert you have to pick a lot of fights<br>and charismatic a leadership he's<br>precisely about constantly winning those<br>fights and remember you know when max<br>ever thinks about a very ambitious of of<br>democratic politics is about struggle<br>it's about ultimately about different<br>various positions of value so at the<br>highest possible level we're talking<br>about leaders who can further their own<br>mission of those values their own<br>mission of those interests why they're<br>important and so on now you can do it at<br>the Trump way appealing to prejudice<br>exclusionary tendencies and so on or you<br>can do it in a different way but the<br>another leader was often thought to be<br>charismatic the late / Chavez have him<br>here because I'm originally from<br>Venezuela so he's somebody I'm fairly<br>familiar with and no leaders like Chavez<br>they were very good at bringing into<br>being a new group lots of people who<br>felt marginalized in Venezuelan politics<br>before he came to power<br>poor excluded awesome and he gave it<br>narrative to those people and in giving<br>them a narrative he kind of created the<br>group he brought it into being as a<br>self-conscious group suddenly saw itself<br>as yes we are the people who were<br>excluded before we are the people who<br>have this genealogy who are connected in<br>this ways to know the figures and<br>independence and this this particular<br>anti-colonial anti-imperialist struggles<br>and so on so there is my is about<br>creating those groups and it's also<br>about struggling for them I mean Chavez<br>was a deeply polarizing figure<br>he was also constantly fighting I'm<br>prevailing over his opponents again this<br>is connected with the success bin he was<br>very fortunate in fact that during most<br>of his time in power he had a favorable<br>economic environment we could do a lot<br>of things do a lot of those miracles and<br>his followers demanded but he also was<br>able to create that particular narrative<br>so finally I mean you have somebody like<br>Obama again you know creates a<br>persuasive narrative of embodying<br>certain kinds of hopes it's the first<br>african-american president and so on<br>but if you fail on the success side if<br>it's all representation with no<br>substantive success then that dims<br>afterwards there's a lot of<br>disappointment Obama in politics right<br>even though he's still well-liked but<br>the kinds of narrative with people like<br>this you know created resonated because<br>they seem to be about something larger<br>than themselves you know very different<br>from the sort of professional politician<br>who seems to be only about narrow you<br>know transaction all sorts of interests<br>so it's kind of summarized here so a<br>demagogue creates a kind of credible<br>representation of the group as the<br>people as what makes populism kinda<br>standard where you stand their kind<br>discourse that the demagogue is going to<br>use the language of populism is is going<br>and they're going to divide but the my<br>gogo is always saying the people against<br>the elites the good people against the<br>bad people whether or not we agree with<br>this is a different matter<br>so people some people agree with this<br>particular addition some people want but<br>this is clearly going to be more<br>credible<br>whenever other institutions have failed<br>we normally hear about sort of the<br>crisis of representation and democracies<br>think of us you know so when by this<br>Trump win there's a kind of failure the<br>establishment is one of the reasons it's<br>convincing enough to enough people that<br>there is a failure in offer presentation<br>people turn to the demagogue who paints<br>a convincing picture of themselves as<br>the people versus those who fail you'll<br>be establishment and so on yeah so for<br>me they were looking at you know early<br>twentieth century thought that you know<br>modern societies have lots of<br>constraints that come from their fact<br>that they're kind of highly complex<br>societies hemmed in by all kinds of<br>technical bureaucratic processes it's a<br>lot of a lot of stuff that seems out of<br>people's control in modern society<br>public action and so on<br>and you see is a charismatic leader<br>charismatic figure that's one way of the<br>main way perhaps of breaking through<br>those constraints charismatic leader<br>there's a one figure that has enough<br>authority to break through those<br>impersonal<br>processes but it is a double-edged sword<br>I try to put examples of charismatic<br>figures that for most of us might seem<br>bad okay it's medic figures like for<br>most of us might seem good some way but<br>it is a double-edged sword because<br>charismatic leadership is destructive of<br>institutions it is norm breaking it is<br>institution breaking might articulate<br>new visions of order new visions of<br>identity and values but it's also can be<br>irresponsible escape the constraints of<br>legality president tradition and so on<br>and do strange stuff on Twitter some way<br>of David puts this is it the kind of two<br>vices in politics for him the political<br>leader who loses a sense of what's<br>possible ejected Lee you know the<br>constraints of political action and the<br>political leader who doesn't take<br>responsibility for their actions who<br>engages in things without consideration<br>of the consequences and charismatic<br>leaders are very prone to the spices<br>like during a bubble of adulation your<br>followers who tell you that you're great<br>because that's what they see you know<br>they truly genuinely see me figure of<br>great significance whether it's a stable<br>genius or a vessel of hope right there's<br>something something special about them<br>so the demagogue is always in danger of<br>taking themselves to be beyond the<br>constraints of everyday politics taking<br>the responsibility for his actions too<br>lightly and being concerned only with<br>the impression he's making so what do<br>you do<br>Sookie the key thing here is about when<br>very caustic ethics of responsibility<br>and he makes a distinction here we might<br>call so he talked about two different<br>kinds of ethics and one of the ethics of<br>conviction the ethics of conviction is<br>what you might might think of somebody<br>who holds fast to a particular set of<br>values no matter what and charismatic<br>leaders are often like this they may<br>have a vision and they want to hold on<br>to that but having a vision doesn't<br>necessarily mean that you're going to<br>have you're going to take responsible<br>action<br>um<br>any ethics of responsibilities<br>politician looks at the consequences of<br>their actions and they owned them and<br>there's there is a kind of existential<br>dimension to this because ultimately<br>whether state power is uses coercion<br>uses violence and it's you know and it's<br>its extreme case it's the power of war<br>and peace the bodies dead bodies on the<br>line at the end of the day so the<br>responsible politician has to understand<br>that don't try to understand what the<br>consequences of their actions are and to<br>own them to understand that these are<br>the compromises I'm making now the<br>because they think that they fly about<br>the loss of political gravity so what<br>you need to do what a democracy is<br>supposed to do is to keep holding them<br>responsible you hold people responsible<br>so there has to be ways in which<br>ordinary citizens even if they're in<br>troll the charisma of the year validate<br>you know it's kind of the duty of the<br>citizen it's also a duty of other<br>politicians<br>to the extent possible other politicians<br>have to challenge one another you know<br>when democracy is working well the<br>charismatic leader can't just simply<br>paint a nice picture all their<br>politicians have to be able to challenge<br>it and in that way they can point out<br>the flaws in the picture<br>they can bring alternative pictures of<br>the people to their on the charismatic<br>leaders victory and so there should be<br>ways in which political leaders are<br>selected in ways that promote that<br>ethics of responsibility promote that<br>disposition to understand that politics<br>is not a game that politics ultimately<br>has real consequences down the line and<br>that we only know sometimes we have to<br>own those consequences you know people<br>say here I stand I can do no other<br>that's the phrase it there the quote<br>comes from neuter you know that there<br>are convictions on the line but once I<br>understood what the consequences of my<br>actions are I still stand by those<br>to finish up so the charismatic<br>demagogue is this kind of double-edged<br>figure because in some ways is the main<br>way in which new values new visions of<br>the common interest can break through to<br>the existing ordinary traditional ways<br>of thinking so it's a revolutionary<br>force and he's going to articulate this<br>and struggle with other leaders they can<br>only be a positive force you know credit<br>politics if we therefore people other<br>politicians can hold them responsible so<br>it's a constant struggle between new<br>thank you<br>oh thanks happy ending that was really<br>wonderful so many questions<br>so well I'm pulling up my powerpoint I<br>will tell you that that I'm just gonna<br>say a few things about populism and then<br>Oh<br>there really is a ghost in here so that<br>was so interesting about demagogues and<br>I really want to spend most of our time<br>talking about that but I'll just say a<br>few things about the phenomenon of<br>populism to frame my thoughts and then<br>we can talk next ourselves which is<br>going to be fun so the first thing I<br>wanted to say is that I'm echoing a lot<br>of what Xavier said people really<br>disagree about populism and as Vicki<br>said right at the beginning what we're<br>trying to do here is to shake up the<br>received notions and not necessarily<br>begin with a preconceived notion about<br>what's good and what's bad about<br>populism and demagoguery for democracy<br>for progress for the people there's lots<br>of disagreement even about what the<br>phenomenon is so I'm going to contrast<br>here we have Nadia Orban Adi with a<br>really sort of negative reading of<br>populism she's talking about the way<br>that populist always defined themselves<br>against another and she talks about the<br>way that populist may use the language<br>of constitutionalism but they always<br>undermine it and these temples of this I<br>gotta say these days they really are<br>legion and just think about what the<br>peace party in Poland is doing with<br>regard to judicial authority and that's<br>just one of countless examples and not<br>to mention my regrettable countrymen so<br>but then we have been McKean who has a<br>very different view of populism who's<br>interested in the resources that you can<br>get from populism and it bends populism<br>is much broader than the sort of<br>parodist<br>right-wing movement he's interested in<br>contrasting people against exploitation<br>but not necessarily according to some<br>sort of a scripted difference and from<br>McKean<br>it's possible to have weirdly populist<br>solidarity across borders it just<br>depends on who is the not the sort of<br>oppressor that is being identified is<br>the oppressor disadvantaged local<br>minority or is the oppressor quite<br>advantaged global capitalist for McKean<br>that makes all the difference so what I<br>want to say in just a few minutes now is<br>for democracy we shouldn't be too proud<br>to learn from populist even the ones we<br>dislike we should be willing to learn<br>from them because they're popular for a<br>reason they are demonstrating things<br>that are unsatisfactory about the status<br>quo or about recent history they show us<br>as Xavier cited so beautifully they<br>paint us this picture about what's wrong<br>and they are objecting even when they<br>even when populist express disgust which<br>is often morally extremely wrong which<br>is straight out wrong a populist disgust<br>is you know a Donald Trump talking about<br>foreigners there's no defending that<br>okay but some populist disgust has to do<br>not with descriptive characteristics<br>some populist disgust has to do with<br>misbehavior with unseemliness and with<br>corruption with practices that unjustly<br>disadvantaged them and undo us all as a<br>potential unified people and that kind<br>of disgust is something we should learn<br>from so the basic elements of populism<br>whatever valence you put on it are the<br>same and they're unobjectionable on the<br>face of it we should have respect for<br>the lived experience of most people<br>right and that is one of the things that<br>Donald Trump for whatever one thinks of<br>him it's hard not to think of him life<br>would be better if we could not think of<br>him but his followers insist that their<br>material experience<br>and their last 30 years or so of<br>material experience is something that<br>ought to be paid attention to and not<br>just ignored by elites and the criticism<br>of elite free-riding is another thing<br>that we should learn from populace so<br>the populist criticism is often taboo<br>breaking know I'm breaking as you said<br>very scary<br>it's especially scary when it's directed<br>at vulnerable minorities but it is vivid<br>for a reason right the language of those<br>who would unjustly exploit us is the<br>vivid language that has been like that<br>over the centuries because it's hard to<br>break that norm of respect toward our<br>betters yo it could be 18th century<br>talking about tyrants as if their<br>polecats<br>or it can be turn of the century robber<br>barons who were supported by those party<br>machines they it's the language of<br>vermin right all of this is dangerous<br>and scary sometimes it's even close to<br>hate speech sometimes it is hate speech<br>but it's something that we should pay<br>attention to because it identifies a<br>real problem often elite exploitation so<br>generally speaking it's democratically<br>unjust when you replace the interests of<br>the many with the interests of the few<br>and that is what a lot of however in<br>articularly a lot of populist discourse<br>is trying to bring out think of what<br>happened in France over the last six<br>months or so when the supreme technocrat<br>emmanuel McCraw attempted to impose his<br>vision of environmental policy on the<br>country and to do this at the expense of<br>ordinary and especially rural people<br>right after having been associated with<br>a tax break for his capitalist buddies<br>right there was mayhem there were riots<br>and he was forced to withdraw his tax<br>right we might not think that the yellow<br>vest people are our favorite people that<br>we want to have coffee<br>but we need to learn from their message<br>the message is top-down policy however<br>rational from within the bubble what did<br>you call it that was beautiful language<br>the bubble of adulation that's really<br>good<br>top-down politic policy from the within<br>the bubble of adulation is a mistake and<br>the populace will show you in no<br>uncertain terms that it won't work and<br>so I think I'm going to skip my section<br>on how did we get to this juncture and<br>just point out that Thomas Piketty wrote<br>a very good book that may look like a<br>doorstop but it's actually incredibly<br>entertaining and he's got a new one out<br>that should be in English soon so we'll<br>take Piketty as read and will notice<br>that traditional parties have been<br>declining and some of us would attribute<br>at least part of the traditional party<br>decline to elite capture and lack of<br>responsiveness there's a particularly<br>interesting version of populist takeover<br>in the European elections this year in<br>Germany it was associated with the Rezo<br>effect then it was really fun to consume<br>German media after the recent European<br>elections the mainstream centre parties<br>had been just blanked it was amazing<br>they were still able to field anybody<br>and the non mainstream parties on the<br>left and right picked up a whole bunch<br>of seats and all that the sort of<br>ordinary elite could talk about was how<br>unfair it was that the election was<br>stolen from them by YouTube influencers<br>but what was interesting is that people<br>chose to listen to the YouTube<br>influencers so people like reso and<br>people who make their living teaching<br>other people how to do their makeup in<br>their hair made a video together and<br>said we don't care how you vote but if<br>you're unsatisfied with the status quo<br>don't vote for the people's parties and<br>you know what the the greens and the<br>far-right both picked up votes we should<br>listen to their lessons I'm gonna skip<br>the the how we got here<br>it would guess you know<br>it was oligarchy and I just echo a few<br>things that Javier said no kidding<br>real democracy is agonistic and there's<br>something really dangerous about the<br>desire to put it into that contest if<br>you have technocrat who's telling you<br>that this is a win-win<br>you should look and make sure that your<br>pockets not being picked and we've had<br>anti agonistic politics for too long<br>it's not surprising that there has been<br>a reaction um so what sorts of positives<br>can we take from this I think<br>populist lessons ought to be learned<br>across the spectrum and the example I<br>want to give us to discuss if we're<br>interested if we need one more thing to<br>talk about there's a party so much is<br>that environmental populism is actually<br>quite a powerful rhetoric and as I was<br>listening to Xavier just now I was<br>thinking is gratitude burger responsible<br>charismatic demagogue<br>no I think I could make that argument if<br>I had more than three minutes lead time<br>she certainly is a norm breaker and she<br>paints a picture and she shows people<br>who they are so it's an interesting<br>thing to think about the nice thing<br>about environmental populism is that it<br>identifies another it is in unsatisfied<br>with the status quo but it is also<br>transnational so here is a democratic<br>argument that is also a populist<br>argument that has to do with<br>environmental things the interests of<br>the overwhelming majority of people on<br>earth are being subverted by the<br>interests of a few extractors most<br>people on the planet are sustained the<br>their subsistence farmers and fishers<br>and many of the rest of us would prefer<br>to go on breathing going forward so we<br>have the perfect recipe for populist<br>complaining in fact there's a reasonably<br>small but reasonably good literature<br>I'm arguing for environmental populism<br>in particular they say we need to pay<br>attention to the material experience of<br>ordinary people in this case with regard<br>to things like groundwater pollution or<br>air pollution or being subject to having<br>to drink tap water that's been poisoned<br>right these sorts of very ordinary very<br>material concerns are the basis for a<br>potentially quite subversive<br>environmental populism on their offsets<br>of interesting things that we could do<br>to pursue the right kind of populism<br>most of them have to do with<br>institutions javier's right again<br>populism demagoguery it is destructive<br>of institutions maybe sometimes that's<br>not a bad thing it's a dangerous thing<br>it's not necessarily a bad thing maybe<br>we should have institutions for<br>selecting leaders that are a little less<br>predictable and technocratic my favorite<br>surveillance mechanism right how are we<br>gonna hold our charismatic politicians<br>to account<br>I like the institution of ostracism<br>myself we should identify threats to the<br>people and you know take their stuff and<br>kick them out I think that we could<br>really make out like bandits and also do<br>democracy a lot of good so it doesn't<br>have to be as violent as ostracism or<br>conventional populism<br>I think getting beyond elite capture<br>need not be extreme and violent in fact<br>there was a recent article in that most<br>conventional of outlets science that rep<br>talked about how we can use grassroots<br>deliberative institutions like citizen<br>assemblies not coincidentally being<br>recommended by extinction or rebellion<br>these days in order to get around the<br>log jam that has enabled technocratic<br>elite stood amin 8 the rest of us thank<br>you<br>hello yes okay well thank you very much<br>looser and happier for raising so many<br>interesting ideas so it's now time to<br>turn it over to all of you so you can<br>actually either one of them any<br>questions I think what I was saying<br>about populist having to prove them<br>charismatic leaders having to prove<br>themselves okay case mean it's not a an<br>internal that should be that you always<br>have so you look and lose it and then go<br>on to have a normal life or you know<br>what what says the difference between<br>the technocratic religion sometimes to<br>call it and the technocratic evidence or<br>war or fear application so we see<br>repeatedly the technocratic policies had<br>been one little better<br>this isn't far Mac there's been the most<br>powerful we have a populist reaction<br>which undermines that now we could have<br>heard that bit more dialogue about<br>extending it but the populism totally<br>undermines that which has advantage<br>right across in terms of water quality<br>health education the New Zealand we see<br>repeatedly the technocratic or the<br>expert policies have been the ones we<br>should be looking at all the advice from<br>the EM Commission recently on social<br>welfare and so on and we don't have a<br>dial on what it takes that forward<br>principally because of the development<br>demo dog so can easily take account of<br>simple primitive emotional responses to<br>undermine that image and the media<br>assists in stopping up a debate so<br>surely as the certificate science<br>communication says we must start taking<br>the scalpel to these entirely erroneous<br>and merciful responses and use the same<br>techniques of persuasion as they are<br>using such as was used against the<br>tobacco industry in California<br>very successfully so rather than<br>resolved from good sound policy we need<br>to make sure the public begins to<br>appreciate and sees the flaws of keeping<br>it sure yeah yeah I mean from the point<br>of view of the sort of thing I was<br>thinking about yeah it's about fighting<br>right so you have to fight back if you<br>know if your view is that hey but but<br>it's not simply articulation like<br>politics it's never going to be<br>seminary debate with clear rules and so<br>on not that some inner debates are that<br>way<br>what politics is always going to be some<br>ways a dirty sort of being and the<br>charismatic politician can articulate<br>that side of the debate I as well as the<br>other side that you're gonna have to<br>fight with the same sorts of weapons<br>since you can't expect this in the<br>technocratic evidence to simply prevail<br>in those debates now it's not to say<br>that the technocratic arguments and the<br>technical science behind these things is<br>is bad way but it won't prevail by<br>itself in the political game well<br>thankfully some things have you two<br>excellent presentations my question is<br>this well firstly a comment I I think<br>it's possible being a charismatic<br>politician without being populist but<br>the second my question is this do you<br>think that in a sense because pop this<br>often exploit legitimate grievances<br>within a society those issues which have<br>been neglected by establishment<br>politicians do you think in a sense they<br>actually are catalyst for transformation<br>now let me explain that because many<br>populous they exploit legitimate<br>grievances but they cannot actually<br>deliver on the promises they make but<br>they do sensitize people to those<br>underlying proper problems I'm just<br>interested in your take on this that<br>when populist do fail do they actually<br>in their wake - we actually tackle some<br>of the problems that have been around a<br>long time and they've played a role in a<br>sense that maybe you know a negative<br>role in some senses but in heightening<br>our awareness of those problems in both<br>the United States and the UK where we've<br>seen populist movements and Popular's<br>leaders they've exploited long-standing<br>problems within the society the<br>the relationship with the haves and the<br>have-nots and they people who are<br>responsible but that's not true but your<br>take on this whether we may see with<br>their failure trying to resolve these<br>problems I think one thing I would say<br>that is definitely possible for this to<br>happen but when charismatic politicians<br>are at the voyage sword and they can<br>leave a trail of destruction their wake<br>so even if people pay more attention to<br>say issues with inequality and say the<br>u.s. still there's a lot of damage that<br>can be done and and it's kind of in the<br>nature of the thing like you know if<br>curious medical authority is destructive<br>of norms and institutions and can<br>destroy them in ways that are not<br>particularly productive for later<br>politicians so it might be that after<br>Trump we get you know more seeing a<br>phobic more nativist politicians you<br>know trying to copy the success of Trump<br>as well<br>even if they have exploited certain<br>legitimate grievances among a part of<br>my guru what I wouldn't say my doodoo is<br>a particularly yeah I mean so you know<br>the Chavez government sort of set a<br>particular path and stuck in a<br>particular year and the Maduro is an<br>organization man you know is the other<br>kind of labeling very good at<br>maintaining a particular coalition<br>together the very good at staying in<br>power uh even and they're very dire<br>circumstances for a majority of the<br>population so again there's a kind of<br>institutional there's destruction and<br>then there's things they've said in a<br>I have a question up here but could the<br>two of you share that particular<br>see more than a question it's what I<br>learned from you from the two of you I'm<br>here as a member of the public and I'm<br>quite a science background not in<br>politics or economics so what I've<br>picked up is that when the elites in a<br>society proved inadequate to the needs<br>of society the phenomena that you<br>discussed would emerge now with the<br>elites like note this historically<br>there's a culture of responsibility but<br>given the very rapid progress in science<br>and no general prosperity etc I believe<br>there's also a need for like there's a<br>it's as if that it's as if the elite<br>needed to learn how to deliver a<br>responsible<br>responsible solutions to society so the<br>gentleman there spoke about PHARMAC for<br>example you know therapeutic products<br>have that the sea change they're<br>expensive as well needlessly expensive<br>but our politicians and officials have<br>not like it's as if there's it there's a<br>need for a culture of responsibility and<br>this there's an educational need for the<br>elites as well and when it's a failure<br>of elites that you spoke that's my take<br>sure yeah I mean it's I mean it's<br>certainly the case like I was speaking<br>about crisis of representation when<br>people feel that existing elites longer<br>delivering benefits or they don't<br>address some important grievances and<br>yes they have a tendency to turn to<br>people who paint the right sort of<br>picture right indicate in a credible way<br>that they can do better but you know<br>that picture might be misleading like Oh<br>pictures are right just because somebody<br>comes along and says I alone can fix it<br>doesn't mean they can know something<br>they can't deliver and those so it's<br>what I was trying to get at DNS you know<br>it's kind of the role of society to try<br>to hold these people responsible when<br>hi I just wonder from your both of you<br>actually your knowledge on populism and<br>demagogues what is your perception of<br>the recent comments made by Simon<br>Bridges leader of the Opposition he said<br>that every day New Zealanders don't care<br>about the Christchurch call do you<br>perceive this as a red flag it is a very<br>good observation because I think it's<br>mr. bridges attempt to inject a bit of<br>populism into the New Zealand foreign<br>policy scene he went to Beijing and gave<br>a gushy interview there and he came back<br>and pronounced the Christchurch call is<br>not really connected with ordinary<br>people in New Zealand they're their<br>focuses as he put it on solving problems<br>like you know a failing health system<br>etc etc I think that he will pay a big<br>price for that though because he said<br>last week to the questioner wouldn't<br>achieve anything and we already know<br>this week I don't know if anybody heard<br>it but there was a fascinating interview<br>this morning with Suzy focus and Suzy<br>focus on the R&amp;Z interviewer and she<br>really gave him so if you want to live<br>if you want to hear a populist or an<br>attempted populist in action who gets<br>ambushed and caught please listen to it<br>tonight because it's a wonderful it's a<br>wonderful example of someone who's<br>trying to 8 populist tactics who've got<br>found out so I think in New Zealand it's<br>going to be difficult to pull this off<br>the nearest we've have to a populist is<br>mr. Winston Peters but he calibrates his<br>populism he is a populist when he's in<br>opposition and he talks about<br>immigration and problems like that<br>but he lowers that profile assuming he's<br>got the property does that to win<br>popular support or get he's 7% of the<br>vote that he needs and then when he's in<br>government he forgets all that rhetoric<br>he becomes very responsible he's a<br>how I am another member of the public<br>too so I understood it was to that I<br>want to follow up on Roberts question<br>really a Christian and sort of been a<br>little bit provocative in the sense that<br>if you accept your argument that some of<br>my Trump as a as a creature of you know<br>the Rust Belt 30 years of neglect and<br>sort of being trampled into the dust<br>once again and also if you accept the<br>sort of consensus that the effect of<br>Trump is going to be a long lasting<br>after he leaves office in terms of you<br>know the damage it's done to<br>constitutional and sort of other<br>institutions in the US and probably also<br>you know then the international order as<br>well like the or even the WTO those<br>sorts of places what's it going to take<br>for that the opposition for one of the<br>bit of work to get their own rally<br>behind their own sort of charismatic<br>candidate who you know actually respects<br>the rule of law and respects<br>constitutionalism and respects the place<br>of the courts and and doesn't see it<br>cabinet members because they have a sort<br>of a country view into him on things<br>like Syria or you know it's big deal<br>with ever get there and just what's the<br>antidote to to trump Azam<br>I don't know but I want to say that<br>sometimes the antidote is not so much<br>about any particular individual I mean<br>this is sort of a two-way street here<br>right so the charismatic leader can<br>articulate new ways of thinking new<br>norms new values can break the existing<br>norms and traditions and rules and so on<br>but other people and more collective<br>sense can hold them to account can you<br>know bring back certain<br>and forms of accountability that are<br>destroyed by the charismatic politician<br>so it's not necessarily that it's going<br>to be that the opposition the Democrats<br>rally around a new charismatic leader<br>that may or may not happen<br>um but I don't want to give the<br>impression that charismatic politicians<br>are all there is to politics<br>what charismatic politicians are good at<br>doing are precise it kind of disrupting<br>the existing order you know providing an<br>alternative vision but in various you<br>have you would need something I didn't<br>you know talk about but it's a big you<br>know consistent pattern that you know<br>curious my it's not really sustainable<br>it always gets you know the person<br>either loses it or it gets routinize it<br>gets incorporated into new institutions<br>new ways of doing things that's sort of<br>the life cycle of charismatic the<br>disrupter but then you know have<br>institution building that's not<br>thanks for that good question um I think<br>it would be a mistake for us to hope<br>that the institutions that are being<br>destroyed and disrupted can come back in<br>the same form I think it would make more<br>sense to look at new resources of<br>surveilling the charismatic leader of<br>exercising sort of citizen<br>responsibility by holding people<br>accountable by doing things like<br>regularly saying things that are true in<br>for like the one depicted on this slide<br>and I going back to a defunct 1970s<br>vision of representative democracy about<br>which we probably remember more good<br>things than were true would be a mistake<br>you have to sort of move through and it<br>is interesting to think about the<br>different resources that New Zealand<br>offers versus that we've mostly talked<br>about the Europe and the<br>and there are some reasons to think that<br>the path that has happened there is<br>going to be quite different here it does<br>seem to me I'm not an expert on this<br>local stuff and I'm not an expert on<br>Simon bridges but trying to enact that<br>sort of politics here from some so<br>almost anti populist because it paints a<br>picture of the different people anyone<br>else<br>well it looks like I get lucky last then<br>Xavier you ended up what I talking about<br>Valens epic self responsibility as a<br>solution to the problems caused by<br>populism but I'm interested in finding<br>out what you actually think about that<br>solution is I'm kind of thinking in<br>terms it seems to be working to some<br>extent in Britain in Westminster with<br>the certain Tory MP standing out to<br>Boris Johnson but I'm not an expert on<br>American politics but from the outside<br>it does look as if Republicans are not<br>really standing up to Trump in the way<br>that many people would hope would happen<br>so I was just wondering about your<br>reflections well that's what any sort of<br>ethical yeah the problem is that people<br>don't do what they're supposed to do<br>many times and so I mean vivir has this<br>marvelous image at the end of this<br>lecture and the profession and vocation<br>of politics politics about you know<br>politics about a long slow drilling of<br>hard boards there's number one thing you<br>know you're never you're never done<br>right and it's it's kind of like you<br>know when we think about politics kind<br>of disparaging<br>most of the time you know it never seems<br>to end well the Republicans does stand<br>up to Trump or you know politicians<br>don't act on you know various pressing<br>problems from climate change to any<br>number of other things right um until<br>the message here is basically<br>about well it's not one you know it's<br>not that you get you know the politician<br>with the right ethics of responsibility<br>which would be nice to have it's like<br>you have to keep
