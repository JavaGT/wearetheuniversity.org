that we can continue<br>to achieve successes like these and<br>enhance our contribution to future<br>generations of graduates and to our<br>nation the university must do three<br>things first we need to attract students<br>of high academic potential and give them<br>an outstanding academic and<br>extracurricular experience in this<br>respect we are doing very well the<br>proportion of students entering the<br>university with a high grade point<br>average is growing each year and we<br>produce outstanding graduates just like<br>you second we need to attract develop<br>and retain outstanding staff this we are<br>doing as illustrated by the achievements<br>I described earlier many of our staff<br>are world leaders in their fields and<br>you will have been privileged to learn<br>from and work with them it is no<br>coincidence that in the qsr world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>University of Auckland came top and New<br>Zealand and 30 were 37 of the 41<br>subjects ranked and in the new times<br>higher education impact rankings which<br>measures each universities performance<br>against the United Nations<br>sustainability goals we were ranked<br>first in the world both overall and for<br>health and well-being and third we need<br>to create the kind of academic<br>environment and facilities that support<br>and encourage excellence to the send the<br>university has been investing heavily in<br>its campus renewal program so as to<br>ensure we do provide back facilities of<br>many of you will graduate today were the<br>first qualification and you'll be<br>rightly proud of that achievement<br>however I also want you to reflect on<br>the ongoing learning opportunities and<br>the wide range of postgraduate options<br>available to you at this University<br>you must never rest on your laurels in a<br>challenging any of a changing world but<br>rather be prepared to embrace change in<br>new technology and make the most of the<br>opportunities presented to you

David<br>gamester many of you here today are<br>focused on the future but it is the pass<br>that Shea often shapes our present and<br>enriches our worldview how we see<br>ourselves no one knows that

professor<br>and museums and heritage at the<br>University of Auckland with a collection<br>of more than 5 million items the<br>Auckland museum can only display one<br>percent at any time so online

past present and<br>future enriches us all<br>please welcome dr. gamester to the stage<br>tena koe day a cart our Chancellor<br>vice-chancellor members of council<br>members of the university graduates<br>farno and friends it's a great honour to<br>be here today to help celebrate the<br>graduation of students from the<br>faculties of Business and Economics<br>Social Work and the Faculty of Arts at<br>first we'd like to congratulate you and<br>your families who without doubt feeling<br>a great sense of fulfillment and pride<br>in your achievements your graduation<br>today is a public recognition of your<br>hard work and commitment to study and<br>the pursuit of knowledge and it's a<br>double honor to be invited to<br>participate in your graduation ceremony<br>today as CEO of Auckland Museum Tamaki<br>pine Ajira the museum and the university<br>of auckland our partners and our<br>collaboration is set to grow and<br>sophisticate in the next few years as<br>the museum and the university engaged<br>together in new research and enjoy<br>teaching and training opportunities 30<br>years ago when I left school and<br>graduated from University for most<br>people of my generation this was the end<br>of their formal education they then<br>entered the workforce and commenced<br>their career people are expected to make<br>a career choice and stick with it and<br>anticipate staying and progressing<br>within that institution company or field<br>pretty well until they retired that<br>anyone should need to undertake any<br>further academic or professional<br>development could not have been further<br>from their thoughts so it was when I<br>graduated with a PhD in archaeology from<br>the University from University College<br>London and made a short walk across<br>Gordon Square to the British Museum I<br>stood back in admiration at my new<br>colleagues who done 30 years or so in<br>this not only in the same department<br>in the same job and I honestly believed<br>that I would do the same continuity of<br>course is everything in the museum<br>business and to a certain extent it<br>still is given that our institutions are<br>in it for the long term by their very<br>definition and today we just simply call<br>it succession planning but that world<br>and that experience has changed very<br>dramatically over the course of my own<br>working lifetime and even in the arts<br>and the cultural heritage sector the<br>days of a steady single stable career<br>are pretty much over organizations have<br>become flatter and less ladder like<br>making upward progression less common<br>and the rapid pace of Technology makes<br>many jobs and crafts and skills go out<br>of date in only a few years LinkedIn<br>founder Reed Hoffman believes that<br>careers are now simply tours of duty<br>prompting companies to design<br>organizations that assume people will<br>only stay for a few years research now<br>shows that new degree holders have twice<br>as many jobs in their first five post<br>college years now than they did even in<br>the mid 1990s my two eldest children now<br>in their mid to late 20s have both had<br>half a dozen different jobs each since<br>graduation<br>I read that members of Generation Y are<br>those born between 1980 and 1994 are<br>expected to have at least 7 separate<br>careers during their working life<br>increasingly people of course want to<br>change jobs roles and structures as and<br>when they want for generations EDD are<br>those born after 1994 people are<br>expected to have between 7 and 15<br>different careers during their working<br>lives around 60 percent of those careers<br>of course have not yet been invented so<br>let's examine what a career really is<br>the traditional idea of a career has<br>three components a career represents our<br>expertise our profession and ultimately<br>our right<br>entity it defines who we are and what we<br>do in this form of identity makes<br>changing careers dauntingly difficult a<br>courier is something that builds over<br>time and indoors it gives us the<br>opportunity to progress to advance and<br>to continuously feel proud and thirdly a<br>career gives us financial and<br>psychological rewards it makes life<br>meaningful and gives us purpose the<br>changing world of work has disrupted all<br>these three elements expertise duration<br>and rewards as scary as this may be for<br>us employee US employees trying to stay<br>ahead it's equally disruptive for<br>employers who must try to hire and<br>develop the workforce workforce of today<br>tomorrow and five years from now<br>I started off quite well I work for 15<br>years at the British Museum as an<br>archaeologists in the collections<br>curator and working in the in the UK's<br>leading Museum was an early career<br>experience second to none it gave me the<br>platform to experiment and deploy my<br>skills and accumulated knowledge beyond<br>the organisation since leaving the BM in<br>2001 I've led a so called portfolio<br>career I've worked in central government<br>as a policy adviser as a CEO of a<br>conservation charity as a director of<br>university museums galleries and<br>cultural services and I'm now a busiest<br>CEO of the largest metropolitan cultural<br>asset in New Zealand I've worked in five<br>to six year stretchers and each move<br>demands the acquisition of course of new<br>knowledge sets new situational skills<br>and professional competencies my family<br>of I and I have had to move countries<br>three times over that time the shelf<br>life of a CEO is getting shorter and<br>shorter<br>agility adaptability and commitment to<br>learning are everything in the forging<br>of a portfolio career<br>in the workplace survival race Mark<br>Twain<br>famously said that all you need in life<br>is ignorance and confidence and then<br>success is sure some of our British<br>politicians seems still seem to think<br>that that is a truism I'm not sure that<br>formula still works at all but let me<br>say to every one of our graduates this<br>afternoon in this hall whatever your<br>stage in life the know in a rapidly<br>changing an increasingly disrupted world<br>now more than ever<br>knowledge and skills require regular<br>updating to remain current and relevant<br>sorry to say this today of all days but<br>today skills are not sufficient to see<br>you through to tomorrow's workplace<br>expertise has an ever shortening shelf<br>life it used to be in only certain kinds<br>of jobs think of computer programmers or<br>IT Troubleshooters they thought that<br>they needed constant training and<br>upskilling now all of us are expected to<br>continuously learn new skills new tools<br>and new systems and this is true of the<br>developed world and even more so in<br>Auckland where we have probably the best<br>educated population in the country to<br>stay in employment never mind enhance<br>your career mobility options it's<br>essential both to remain well skilled<br>and also to anticipate the skills you<br>might need for tomorrow and with the<br>escalating cost of supporting retirement<br>that working life is now getting longer<br>and longer study and training are<br>essential for navigating the modern<br>world of work and ensuring our<br>employability for the duration investing<br>in lifelong learning and continuing<br>professional development enhances our<br>ability to take control of our own<br>destinies these new patterns in the<br>workplace bring significant advantages<br>to organizations of course at Auckland<br>Museum we see colleagues joining us from<br>highly successful and multiple portfolio<br>careers<br>in corporate business marketing retail<br>university research education digital<br>technologies and in the creative<br>industries the knowledge and experience<br>that they bring from those sectors are a<br>critical success factor in our role as a<br>leading cultural heritage institution<br>visitor attraction and social enterprise<br>but there are very few single skill sets<br>anymore<br>in that case what are the skill sets and<br>what are the mindsets<br>and behaviors that we as a leading<br>cultural organization are looking for in<br>graduates and in the early career cohort<br>what are the skill sets that will help<br>you prepare for the jobs that don't yet<br>exist<br>museums are like so many modern<br>employers in addition to the situational<br>and discipline professional knowledge<br>we're increasingly looking for people<br>with the so-called soft skills these<br>include communication cooperation<br>negotiation in research skills and in<br>critical and synthetic thinking so just<br>the kind of attributes that you've<br>acquired in your university training in<br>Business Studies in education Social<br>Work and in the arts to progress in an<br>employment world increasingly dominated<br>by hybrid jobs and museums are plenty of<br>those today and the rise of the digital<br>designer or the digital marketer or the<br>content developer are just some amongst<br>many so you this afternoon are actually<br>best place of your peers to navigate the<br>workplace jungle of the 21st century the<br>world economic forum has made similar<br>claims citing the need for skills like<br>complex problem-solving coordinating<br>with others cognitive flexibility and<br>boundless curiosity it's also medicine<br>mentioned something called deep<br>generalism I'll have to ask my<br>colleagues what that could possibly be<br>about<br>the modern workplace where people move<br>between different roles and projects<br>actually closely resembles the preschool<br>classroom where we all learn social<br>skills such as empathy cooperation and<br>social intelligence in fact that's a<br>pretty decent description of the modern<br>museum as a creative organization where<br>mobility agility and collaboration are<br>core requirements of our workforce for<br>the mindsets and behaviors that we're<br>looking for in recruiting and developing<br>our workforce of the future we've just<br>captured these in the new manifesto hey<br>worker eka Noah which is a well-known<br>metaphor of course for a body of people<br>all on the same Walker paddling in one<br>direction so a local museum we want our<br>people to be connected connected to each<br>other our work and our communities we<br>want them to be authentic that they<br>understand our purpose practice and our<br>values and lead with their hearts we<br>want to be respectful that we honor each<br>other and value our differences that<br>we're growth oriented that we see that<br>we see challenges as opportunities and<br>customer centered we create a memorable<br>positive experience for each other<br>and our audiences these mindsets are all<br>about leading ourselves and leading<br>others in other words as a cultural<br>organization we're looking for both<br>individual creativity and innovation but<br>we're also looking for the ability and<br>commitment to lead in the same direction<br>and these mindsets will strengthen our<br>collective sense of purpose and<br>belonging so that we can all do our best<br>work we're looking for people who can<br>work together to respond to the<br>challenges that society now faces now<br>and in the future in a way that's<br>relevant to our communities and harms us<br>all our lives these approaches to skills<br>and development and mindsets and<br>behaviors are helping Oakland museum to<br>evolve its career development model that<br>encourages continuous learning<br>improves individual mobility and fosters<br>a growth mindset in every one of our<br>people year after year if we can find<br>the right formulas we will maintain our<br>position as the leading employer of<br>choice in the arts and culture sector in<br>New Zealand all this is intended not to<br>taunt you in any way I just wanted to<br>reinforce what you already know about<br>our fast changing world of work so long<br>as you stick to a few basic rules being<br>curious open ready to experiment<br>committed to learning new skills and to<br>follow the direction the world is moving<br>in you'll be fine so just to finish and<br>while I'm at it a final word of advice<br>technological change is both life<br>enhancing but it's also amongst the<br>leading disruptors to our well-being<br>we're currently experiencing a pace and<br>scale of change that's akin pretty much<br>akin to the first Industrial Revolution<br>back in my youth back in the 1970s there<br>are only two public TV channels and both<br>of which shut down with the national<br>anthem at 11 o'clock at night<br>we're told relentlessly that sleep or<br>rather the lack of it remains the single<br>biggest threat to the economy and to our<br>personal salvation sleep is acknowledged<br>by the CEO of Netflix as the channel's<br>number-one competitor<br>its business model is to deny you that<br>increasingly precious commodity so the<br>sleep industry is now worth around US<br>dollars seventy six billion a year and I<br>contributed it to it last month by<br>buying our first new bed in 15 years and<br>that purchase has really seriously<br>changed my life so if I have one final<br>piece of advice to give you today as you<br>embark on your first career on your next<br>one or your last it's this please ensure<br>you get as much sleep as you can<br>whenever you can as we all need to work<br>and study longer<br>so we're going to need it Tayna Cotto<br>Tina Cotto 10 Oh tartar cartel David I<br>hear you and thank you for sharing those<br>insights with us<br>this is a meeting of Council
