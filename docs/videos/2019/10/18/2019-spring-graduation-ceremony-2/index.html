to ensure<br>that we can continue to achieve<br>successes like these and to enhance our<br>contribution to future generations of<br>graduates and to our nation the<br>university must do three things

of students<br>entering the university with a high<br>grade point average is growing each year<br>and we produce outstanding graduates<br>just like you<br>second we need to attract develop and<br>retain outstanding staff this we are<br>doing is illustrated by the achievements<br>I described earlier many of our staff<br>are world leaders in their fields and<br>you will have been privileged to learn<br>from em work with them there is no<br>coincidence that in the qsr world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>University of Auckland came top in New<br>Zealand and 37 of the 41 subjects ranked<br>and in the new times higher education<br>impact rankings which measured each<br>universities performance against the<br>United Nations sustainability goals we<br>were ranked first in the world but<br>and third we need to create the kind of<br>academic environment and facilities that<br>support and encourage excellence to this<br>end the university has been investing<br>heavily in its campus renewal program so<br>as to ensure that we do provide<br>facilities of genuinely international<br>quality many of you will graduate today<br>were the first qualification and you<br>will be rightly proud of this<br>achievement however I also want you to<br>reflect on the ongoing learning<br>opportunities and the wide range of<br>postgraduate options

guest speaker this<br>afternoon Mitchell family the world of<br>business is one of opportunity and no<br>one knows that better than our next<br>speaker he is an incredible life story<br>Mitchell fam likes to say born in<br>Vietnam made a New Zealand<br>Mitchell arrived in New Zealand alone as<br>a refugee at age of 12<br>his entire family had had tried to<br>escape post-war communist Vietnam they<br>were all put in labour camps Mitchell<br>made it out alone on the third escape<br>attempt after after three days in a boat<br>in the South China Seas New Zealand<br>accepted him from a refugee camp and<br>Mitchell made the most of his<br>opportunities he studied here at the<br>University of Auckland graduating in<br>business and computer science the<br>friends he made at this university were<br>also life-changing with four fellow<br>students he founded the organ Software<br>Group which now employs more than 40<br>people as an entrepreneur he's won<br>multiple awards and expanded his<br>software company into his homeland<br>Vietnam where he's won excellence of<br>what's there to and been Rinat reunited<br>with his family giving back is important<br>to him he serves on countless boards and<br>tech hubs to foster connections and<br>business he lends his expertise to the<br>Auckland refugee family trust and many<br>other social enterprises he is<br>co-founder of the Kiwi connection tech<br>hub and a New Zealand trade and<br>enterprise tech advisor for Southeast<br>Asia these are just a few of his roles<br>along the way he found time to win the<br>Australian serach dance title he has<br>been named a kia world-class New Zealand<br>er and a young global leader by the<br>World Economic Forum Mitchell is a tick<br>ambassador for New Zealand taking tech<br>innovation to a world stage now it's my<br>pleasure to invite him to the stage<br>i I do travel a lot for work as well as<br>for family reasons and and when I get<br>asked where I'm from<br>indeed I I do say that I was born in<br>Vietnam and made in New Zealand and I<br>graduated at this University of Auckland<br>business school exactly 25 years ago and<br>it was this school that made me and that<br>firstly congratulations to everyone who<br>are graduating today and joining the<br>amazing 200,000 strong alumni all around<br>the world it's really amazing to be part<br>of that network and it's real privilege<br>certainly I've always felt to be able to<br>be part of that extended fan out I I was<br>born originally born in Ho Chi Minh City<br>I used to because I go on and indeed<br>when I was 12 I did escape Vietnam as a<br>refugee and I went through all that<br>journey had several near-death<br>experiences and and all of those things<br>before I arrived in New Zealand at the<br>age of 14 and then I spent several years<br>trying to sponsor my family to reunite<br>with me here in New Zealand but<br>unfortunately for a number of reasons<br>back in in those days my family couldn't<br>migrated to New Zealand and for me that<br>was part of the mission of my life<br>journey and so you know I I was I was<br>devastated<br>and in fact it took our family 30 years<br>after I left home to reunite here in<br>Oakland a few years ago and and so on my<br>graduation day 25 years ago when all of<br>my friends had their families with them<br>for their graduation I decided not to<br>attend because I really couldn't face it<br>I'll go through with it at the time I<br>just didn't feel that I had the strength<br>to to graduate alone amongst everyone<br>else and their and their fan-out and I<br>have really regretted it ever since you<br>know and that's the sort of thing that<br>you could end up missing out on if you<br>stopped living and start feeling sorry<br>for yourself I think and so today it's<br>not just special to you but it is also<br>very special to me for that reason I am<br>literally rewriting my own history today<br>and I'm very honored that you're all<br>part of that history as I am of yours so<br>so thank you for that um and I've had<br>the fortune of growing up in<br>entrepreneurial family and so really all<br>I know was the business career path that<br>I have followed all my life and in<br>business I have two professional passion<br>if you will the first passion is that of<br>everything to do with technology<br>innovation from the technology itself to<br>tech business to the tech industry and<br>how technology impacts everything and<br>for a small country you know of 4.6<br>million people New Zealand has 29,000<br>tech companies right it is one of the<br>highest per capita ratio in the world<br>why because we're really good at this we<br>are very very good at this and so it's<br>great to be able to be part of that and<br>it's great to be able to see in the last<br>25 years of my career in the tax<br>face how technology has managed to<br>transform the world in fact my other<br>passion professionally is in connecting<br>New Zealand to Asia I first I believe<br>that the relationship with Asia is<br>really important<br>because next year in 2020 the economy of<br>Asia is once again bigger than the rest<br>of the world combined so it is important<br>that New Zealand really developed and<br>strengthened and further how our<br>connection in our relationship with Asia<br>with all of the diverse markets that<br>make up Ava because that's really going<br>personally I also have two passions the<br>first is what I call leadership in<br>making a difference I really apply this<br>in everything that I do and for me<br>leadership is not really about about<br>myself but much more about demonstrating<br>was possible to set examples and then<br>really inspire and empower others to<br>lead because leadership is within all of<br>us certainly everyone in this room is a<br>leader my other personal passion is that<br>of being a new Kiwi and doing my part<br>to build this country now please raise<br>your hand if either you or your siblings<br>or any of your parents or grandparents<br>were not born in New Zealand okay so<br>there are three of you who are not thank<br>you my point right so really shaping the<br>future of this country and and getting<br>New Zealand to get to that future needs<br>and and it's really exciting to see how<br>diverse New Zealand's today and how many<br>new Kiwis bring talent and passion to to<br>add to this country because we really<br>are both the asset and the opportunity<br>for for New Zealand<br>now I a friend of mine his grandfather<br>is a when he was alive he was a French<br>Foreign Legion heir in Vietnam in<br>Indochina and so he shared with me<br>amazing stories with his grandfather and<br>I shared with him my story about being a<br>Vietnamese Kiwi and and he asked me well<br>so what was it like to for Vietnamese to<br>become a Kiwi and and I I said to him<br>well look becoming a Kiwi is very much<br>like joining the Foreign Legion it<br>really doesn't matter where you came<br>from as long as we all match in the same<br>direction and I generally believe that<br>in all of the new key ways that are here<br>and for the last two and a half decades<br>if you look at my profile on LinkedIn<br>everything that I've done in business<br>industry leadership government work or<br>community service and all the<br>organizations that have been involved<br>with all of it has been very consistent<br>to the four passions that I've shared<br>with you just now and and I think when<br>you step out there into the world it is<br>really really important to really be<br>true to yourselves and why is that I<br>think one of the answer is that often<br>when I speak at conferences people come<br>up to me and say well you know what is<br>your prediction of where FinTech is<br>going to be of where this how this is<br>going to change the world and and so<br>forth and and I often say well look<br>I'm really not here to predict the<br>future but I am here to create it so if<br>that's what you're about then I'm very<br>happy to work with you<br>so again you know the the power to shape<br>the world and the future of the world is<br>actually in our hands as soon as you<br>step out there and last but not least I<br>would like to share one more thing with<br>you and this thing is very very deep<br>very personal for me but my most<br>favorite saying that I've ever heard<br>that I've committed to memory and I've<br>lived it ever since<br>is this the two most important days in<br>your life are the day that you were born<br>and the day that you discovered why I<br>know it's pretty deep right but it<br>actually is very very meaningful<br>especially if you really I think that's<br>kind of how we add meanings to our lives<br>right so what does it all mean so what<br>well you graduating today you've spend<br>somebody else's money on your education<br>you put your own time and labor into it<br>to get here got those assignments and<br>tests and projects but you're here now<br>right you educated so the question<br>really is for you what are you gonna do<br>with your education how is the world<br>going to be a better place because of it<br>or more importantly because of you right<br>so once again congratulations to all of<br>you<br>kia ora koutou katoa and cin comer and<br>Michell
