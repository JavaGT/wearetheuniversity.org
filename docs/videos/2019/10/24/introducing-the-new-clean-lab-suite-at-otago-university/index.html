This facility will allow us to do some incredible science here at Otago. <br><br>Music: Bensound.com</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>we have a new clean room suite at Otago<br>that's virtually metal free there's<br>essentially no metal in it and so that<br>allows us to have no background levels<br>of metals at all we have high purity<br>filtered air coming into the lab it's<br>about a hundred thousand times cleaner<br>than outside and in the corridor and on<br>top of that we have high purity acids<br>and things that we use to process our<br>samples as well there aren't very many<br>facilities like this worldwide actually<br>let alone in Australasia or in the<br>southern hemisphere so in terms of the<br>scale of the lab it's big for the type<br>of lab that occurs and therefore it<br>allows us to do lots of different<br>projects in different areas ranging from<br>Forensic Sciences to geological sciences<br>even to the biomedical sciences and<br>therefore that can attract a lot of<br>great students great post-grad students<br>and researchers to this part of the<br>world which wouldn't have been possible<br>previously and the scenery of research<br>I'd really like to thank all of the<br>people that made having these labs<br>possible they are quite unique and it<br>took a lot of different groups to bring<br>this lamp together a lot of architects a<br>lot of people at the University and a<br>lot of construction personnel and so I'm<br>just really grateful to them for the<br>quality of the product that they've<br>delivered that's going to let us do some<br>really amazing science</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
