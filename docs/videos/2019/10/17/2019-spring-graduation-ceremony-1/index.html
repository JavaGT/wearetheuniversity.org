work and marine research<br>and conservation who campaigned to<br>increase protection for the Hauraki Gulf<br>whale population led to slower speeds<br>for large vessels dramatically reducing<br>the number of whales injured or killed<br>in order to ensure that we can continue<br>to achieve successes like these and to<br>enhance our contribution to future<br>generations of graduates and to our<br>nation the university must do three<br>things first we need to attract students<br>of high academic potential<br>and give them an outstanding academic<br>and extracurricular experience and this<br>respect we are doing very well the<br>proportion of students entering the<br>University with a higher grade point<br>average is growing each year and we<br>produce outstanding graduates just like<br>you second we need to attract develop<br>and retain outstanding staff thus we are<br>doing as illustrated by the achievements<br>I described earlier many of our staff<br>are world leaders in their fields and<br>you will have been privileged to learn<br>from and work with them it is no<br>coincidence that in the qsr world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>University of Auckland came top in New<br>Zealand and 37 of the 41 subjects ranked<br>and in the New Times Higher Education<br>Impact rankings which measure each<br>universities performance against the<br>United Nations sustainability goals we<br>were ranked first in the world both<br>overall and for health and well-being<br>and third we need to create the kind of<br>academic environment and facilities that<br>support and encourage excellence to this<br>end the university has been investing<br>heavily in its campus renewal program so<br>as to ensure that we do provide<br>facilities of genuinely international<br>quality many of you will graduate today<br>were the first qualification and you<br>will be rightly proud of this<br>achievement<br>however I also want you to reflect on<br>the ongoing learning opportunities and<br>the wide range of postgraduate options<br>available to you at this University<br>you must never rest on your laurels and<br>a challenging and ever-changing world<br>but rather be prepared to embrace change<br>in new technology and make the most of<br>the opportunities presented to you<br>although it may seem a daunting prospect<br>right now through the study and learning<br>is inevitable for all of us as the world<br>changes around us at an<br>ever-accelerating pace whatever path you<br>follow I urge you as alumni of New<br>Zealand's leading University to

Michael statement is our<br>Chancellor his mittened the DPD pro<br>vice-chancellor Maori or Kai aratake a<br>former staff member of the Faculty of<br>science in the Graduate it's my sincere<br>an absolute privilege to be able to<br>offer this quarter little here today to<br>be part of your celebration so thank you<br>ever so much for allowing me to say a<br>few words over 20 years ago<br>I set in your position incredibly happy<br>to finish my journey at that point with<br>the University having had the<br>opportunity to share the moment with my<br>family by the graduation of teddy bear<br>take my graduation photo which<br>incidentally in my my left eye was<br>slightly closed at the time it's sort of<br>stares at me as a reminder that<br>technology such as filters or Photoshop<br>weren't available at that point and if<br>only I had the original file so a<br>graduation cheek your photo<br>make sure you happy with it otherwise 20<br>years later you'll be standing on stage<br>telling people about it it is an honor<br>to accept this wonderful opportunity to<br>be able to share some of my experiences<br>as a science graduate and the hope that<br>something will resonate with what you<br>hear today the first thing that I have<br>to say is that my pathway has not been a<br>straight line<br>at all it's not your typical outcome<br>that might be promoted in Anna pamphlet<br>highlighting vocational pathways from<br>the science degree I had no idea what I<br>was doing some my mum in this case might<br>say that I have no idea what I'm doing<br>now I keep my head down I did my work<br>and I graduated and then headed into the<br>world not really knowing where I stood<br>now when I get the chance to look back<br>on my career and the different pathways<br>it took I'm clear that my time with the<br>faculty and in this case the Sport and<br>Exercise Science Department set me up<br>well for the places that I ended up in<br>firstly at disclosure I chose my major<br>sporting exercise science based on what<br>I thought was going to happen rather<br>than what it actually was<br>it hits bought in the title so I just<br>assumed we were going to be doing PE for<br>three years<br>so listen know what you're getting into<br>don't assume anything and be clear the<br>key point here though is that I chose it<br>because I was sincerely interested in it<br>in any challenges that I had at the<br>University were usurped by their<br>interests so looking back now<br>everything I've ever spent some time and<br>was because I enjoyed the work love what<br>you do or learn to love it you have to<br>learn to enjoy things or try new<br>experiences to learn more about yourself<br>my first proper job was as a youth tutor<br>not because I had experience but because<br>I had a degree yes the week was<br>something that I can contribute to and<br>in this case running Sport and<br>Recreation programs for young people<br>that win at school anymore<br>it wasn't the stat that I had hoped for<br>but it was a starting under the lease<br>and warriors trainers job wasn't<br>available at that point but I was happy<br>in thankful to be part of those young<br>people's education experience and their<br>role I met three of my mentors with whom<br>I have close relationships to this day<br>their contribution to my personal<br>development and helping me build<br>confidence in areas I hadn't been<br>exposed to in my life was crucial<br>mentals<br>are important<br>at the beginning of my speech<br>you heard me open it and said al-mahdi<br>or multi-language when i left the<br>university in or through school before<br>that i had limited or no knowledge of my<br>own culture and language so i would have<br>had no idea of what I just said<br>at that moment sitting where you are now<br>in my ceremony I was given the<br>opportunity to be guided through the<br>next step of my journey which is to open<br>up a key part and that key part of my<br>personal history the key lesson for me<br>then was know who you are this is the<br>bedrock of Who I am now and how I relate<br>to others because I'm now clear of Who I<br>am and what I can offer there wasn't<br>always the case at that point in my life<br>I couldn't say that I knew the answer to<br>that question but I was open so it and<br>it formed the basis of everything that<br>was to follow the next opportunity that<br>came out of the relationships that I had<br>developed with my mentors and the belief<br>that they had in me that I hadn't yet<br>developed and myself I became a teacher<br>of Maori language when I thought I had<br>indeed developed the expertise for it<br>yet what I did here though was people<br>they believed in me people who were<br>prepared to sorry adversity at me and<br>hope for the best in some ways that I<br>want to do it that way no not at all<br>am i thankful for it yes absolutely I<br>was given the opportunity and trusted in<br>the relationships that I had built they<br>pushed me beyond my comfort zone<br>and gave me a chance to grow look for<br>growth opportunities you all have a<br>wonderful opportunity to make a<br>difference in your own lives and their<br>of your families and if possible for<br>others too knowing that sitting in this<br>room today we're future developers of<br>world needed leading technology<br>developers of life saving saving<br>pharmaceuticals influences of<br>sustainable practices and policy<br>development in this country in the world<br>that's humbling<br>so James Hemery a graduate of our<br>University not science but he's still<br>pretty cool<br>see it Qatar 50k - hiding America Korea<br>hurry Tony a new era or mihika Korean<br>Maha Tony was translated as we've come<br>too far and not to go further you've<br>done too much not to do more and he was<br>talking about the position that we're<br>all in today eventually these<br>opportunities lead me back to the<br>Faculty of science where had started<br>this part of my journey and I was<br>fortunate to get a chance to work for<br>the faculty and ten years later I stand<br>here now offering you my faults and what<br>awaits you now you've completed this<br>part of your journey when I think about<br>some of my mates from Sport and Exercise<br>Science I'm quite clear that the place I<br>ended up I couldn't have conceived of<br>nor plan for on day one of stepping off<br>the bus from Helens ville and catching<br>the shuttle that the Tamaki campus some<br>of my classmates design equipment for<br>Team New Zealand during the Blitz that's<br>managers and healthcare organizations<br>ones the coats of world champion Lise<br>clay okay Lisa Carrington all<br>conceivable outcomes from the training<br>we received in Sport and Exercise<br>Science Department not all of you will<br>have that experience and that's ok I<br>didn't and in the end things have worked<br>out ok but not without first<br>understanding Who I am<br>did my science degree count without a<br>shadow of a doubt I apply the strategic<br>and analytical thinking I developed in<br>my degree everyday they're combined with<br>the personal experiences I've ever<br>sought or had thrust upon me<br>I'm thankful did I hit the chance<br>certainly you are now what I change<br>anything that question yes heaps loads<br>of it I try harder on some assessments<br>try not to procrastinate so much try not<br>to generally be so awkward<br>and social settings but I am thankful<br>for my Bachelor of Science degree and it<br>is one of the reasons I'm standing here<br>today so I say again congratulations to<br>all of our graduates we're very very<br>proud of you thank you also to the<br>families and friends that are here today<br>we to share in
