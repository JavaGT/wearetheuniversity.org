booklet<br>please be seated I call on the public<br>orator to present a candidate for an<br>honorary degree the Honorable justice<br>Forrest Miller is one of New Zealand's<br>foremost legal innovators a judge of the<br>Court of Appeal is at the forefront of<br>efforts to bring the administration of<br>justice in New Zealand into the 21st<br>century making it more effective and<br>more available to New Zealanders with<br>typical modesty when asked why he became<br>a lawyer<br>forey says I wasn't good at maths and I<br>didn't like the sight of blood but ask<br>what excites him about his work and for<br>his passion for the law shines through<br>every cases a challenge she says a<br>problem to be solved it's like a jigsaw<br>puzzle a story about people 4e was born<br>to a farming family in South Otago he<br>was educated at 4e par primary John<br>McGlashan College South Otago High<br>School and at the University of Otago<br>graduating with a Bachelor of Arts and<br>history and a Bachelor of Laws Otago is<br>also where he met and married Bev Dean<br>with whom he would share his life and<br>raise four much-loved children ami James<br>Alex and Kate and we're delighted that<br>Bev James and Kate are able to be with<br>us here today<br>in 1984 II joined the Alexandra firm of<br>Bodkins solicitors thrown in at the deep<br>end as for a puts it he eventually<br>learned to swim went they have graduated<br>she joined 4e in Central Otago for a<br>year but eventually the young couple<br>decided to move to Wellington where<br>there was a better prospect of them both<br>getting the jobs that they wanted in<br>1984 for a joined Chapman trip one of<br>New Zealand's most prestigious law firms<br>becoming a partner in<br>1987 and eventually chairman Han a<br>year's sabbatical in 1996 he took a<br>master's in law from the University of<br>Toronto is a wide general practice in<br>commercial and public law litigation<br>specializing in securities regulatory<br>and competition law he remained a<br>Chapman trip until after prolonged<br>persuasion from the Solicitor General 4e<br>agreed to appointment to the High Court<br>of New Zealand in 2004 and the Court of<br>Appeal in 2013<br>colleagues praised his unerring focus of<br>the fundamentals of what a justice<br>system is meant to be about access to<br>law the rule of law relevance to the<br>community cost predictability 4e Miller<br>has been a great friend to the Faculty<br>of Law at the University of Otago often<br>returning to judge competitions and<br>engage with students where he would<br>advise them to work hard to make the<br>most of opportunities and to maintain a<br>down-to-earth fair and just approach to<br>all people whether it be building a<br>backyard pizza oven or crossing the<br>andes by motorbike Furi doesn't do<br>anything by house as in life so in his<br>work for E is a committed legal<br>researcher recently publishing a major<br>report on delays in the High Court with<br>the University of Otago legal issues<br>centre such work has led Farid to the<br>realization that there's an enormous<br>unmet need for empirical work in our<br>court system research should drive our<br>understanding of the administration of<br>justice in New Zealand but that's<br>difficult to achieve in a system that<br>records cases on sheaves of paper in<br>physical folders so far I set out to<br>change the system developing electronic<br>case books for daily use in criminal and<br>civil jurisdictions he now changed the<br>judicial reference group across bench<br>committee working with the Ministry of<br>Justice on<br>electronic content management system<br>which will lead to electronic filing and<br>case management systems in all New<br>Zealand courts the Christchurch<br>earthquake created a massive burden on<br>our court system with the risk that<br>other important court matters would be<br>put to one side because the overwhelming<br>number of both quake related issues that<br>would come before the court recognizing<br>the risk fari created and then managed<br>the earthquake list this is not just a<br>list but in innovation in procedure<br>which provides closed case management<br>and expedites earthquake related cases<br>freeing up court time and minimizing<br>stress for those affected by natural<br>disaster for his expertise and<br>innovation in case management has been<br>applied across New Zealand and in<br>Australia where he was jointly awarded<br>the Australasian Institute of judicial<br>administration Award for Excellence in<br>2013 for has also taken on major<br>leadership roles outside the law he is<br>the chairman of unasyn networks limited<br>the electricity distributor for hawkes<br>bay rotorua and Topo regions and chair<br>of the wellington girls college board of<br>trustees asked about why his successful<br>in leadership roles 4e says if you annoy<br>people for long enough they put you in<br>charge<br>others have less deflationary<br>explanations of forest success one<br>colleague told me that 4e is the ideal<br>mix of down-to-earth farmers Sun the<br>researcher with a thirst for knowledge<br>and the reformer who cares deeply about<br>institutions and the ideals they uphold<br>but my favorite answer came from a<br>friend of his who said to me in passing<br>do you know if people had something<br>written on

they're going a little<br>bit nuts my analyst told me that I was<br>right out of my head 3 he described it<br>he said I'll be better dead and alive I<br>didn't listen to his joke I knew all<br>along and he was all wrong and a new<br>daddy thought I was crazy but I'm not<br>Oh Noah analyst told me that I was right<br>out of my head he said I need treatment<br>but I'm not that easily lazy I am the<br>type that is most went out of his sight<br>to be out of my mind and he said I was<br>nuts no more air surrounds or bucks<br>oh no ahead they say as a child I<br>appeared a little bit off with all my<br>crazy ideas but I knew what was<br>happening I knew I was a genius I'm so<br>strange when you know that you're a<br>wizard at 3 I knew that this was meant<br>to be well that's why I drink a fifth of<br>vodka one night my parents got frantic<br>didn't know what to do but I saw some<br>crazy scenes before I came to LA do you<br>think I was crazy I may have been only<br>three but I was stunned so why should I<br>feel sorry if it just good along the<br>sand the reasoning and the logic that<br>went on in my head I refused because<br>there was no driver on the top analysts<br>told me that I was right out of my head<br>but I said dear doctor I think that it's<br>you instead<br>I have a thing that's unique and new it<br>proves that I'll have the last laugh on<br>you cousin said I've won ahead I got to<br>hand you know two heads are better than<br>one this next song is a song that I<br>wrote about meeting the man who is now<br>my husband and I made him while I was at<br>university
