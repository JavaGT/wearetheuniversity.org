English the words are printed<br>inside the back cover of the graduation<br>booklet please stand<br>please be seated I call on the public<br>orator to present a candidate for an<br>honorary degree Sir Julian Smith who we<br>honor today has deep and cherished roots<br>in Otago as does his family we welcome<br>his wife Beverly and two son James and<br>family here today 150 years ago sir<br>Julian's<br>ancestor George Bell had the foresight<br>to create a single newspaper from two<br>existing publications making the evening<br>star a central part of Dunedin life in<br>1975 sir Julian oversaw the merger of<br>the evening star with the Otago Daily<br>Times through the formation of allied<br>press which he has led for more than<br>three decades his commitment to the<br>importance of an independent press in<br>Dunedin means that today the Otago Daily<br>Times is the only independently and<br>locally owned morning daily paper in the<br>country born in Dunedin in 1943 Julian<br>Smith attended John McGlashan college at<br>age 15 he bought his first car a model<br>Ford T Ford beginning his lifelong<br>passion for vintage and classic motor<br>vehicles determining on a career as an<br>accountant so Julian combined work for<br>the firm of Broderick and Charma with<br>part-time study for a Bachelor of<br>Commerce at the University of Otago in<br>1962 part-time study did not preclude<br>participation and capping in rugby and<br>debating and it was by gate-crashing a<br>law for Co therapy barbecue at work away<br>et that sir Julian met his future wife<br>Beverly<br>at that time a physiotherapy student sir<br>Julian's<br>dedicated work ethic and his business<br>acumen were quickly realized in 1970 at<br>age 26 he became manager of the John M<br>Fraser company limited by the end of<br>that decade he was managing director of<br>the publicly listed company allied press<br>in the years that followed he oversaw<br>privatisation of the company using his<br>controlling interest to ensure that it<br>remained New Zealand owned he also<br>oversaw the expansion of allied press<br>publications today these comprise not<br>only the Otago Daily Times New Zealand's<br>oldest daily newspaper but also a suite<br>of local newspapers serving communities<br>in Canterbury Westland and in Southland<br>as well as Otago together with a local<br>television channel allied press plays an<br>important role in both employing and<br>informing people in much of southern New<br>Zealand allied press undertakes what is<br>one of the most difficult tasks in the<br>age of digital media giants providing<br>accessible print media to local<br>communities to enable their engagement<br>in the events and issues concerning<br>their region one academic study shows<br>that the local news coverage offered by<br>the Otago Daily Times for example is<br>almost twice that of other daily papers<br>so Julian's Business School's led to a<br>number of directorships notably for the<br>New Zealand Press Association from 1983<br>to 1990 and for Southern business groups<br>such as retro and son Arthur Barnet<br>Limited and Naylor loved construction he<br>was president of the New Zealand<br>Publishers Association from 2002 to 2006<br>beyond the business world he has engaged<br>in the community in a variety of ways<br>cheering the John McGlashan College<br>Board of Trustees for example serving on<br>the advisory board of the oldest and<br>charitable foundation<br>and as a member of the oricon OE<br>foundation the coastal settlement of<br>Warrington holds a special place for the<br>Smith family who holiday there annually<br>the past of that place is important and<br>so Julian delights and cheering its<br>heritage with his family and<br>grandchildren if the passion for<br>Warrington is exceeded by anything it is<br>so Julian's passion for cars daughter Jo<br>recalled spending time in the garage<br>with her father just as his son Archie<br>loves to do so now from that initial<br>Ford car two Bentley's and Rolls Royces<br>sir Julian loves the challenge of<br>restoring and maintaining classic<br>vehicles perhaps too many in lady<br>Beverly's view that devotion extends<br>beyond his own collection sir Julian was<br>instrumental and the restoration of the<br>1901 kempthorne locomobile a<br>steam-powered machine which was the<br>first privately owned automobile in<br>Otago its restoration to full running<br>order which took decades was completed<br>in 2018 though as Sir Julian would be<br>the first to point out the restoration<br>of the vehicle was never really complete<br>just as the University this year<br>celebrates a hundred and fifty years<br>since its founding so does 2019 marked<br>the sesquicentennial of Sir Julian's<br>family's life as newspaper publishers<br>the University and the paper have<br>developed in tandem if not always in<br>agreement exactly it should be as it<br>should be in a society that values a<br>free press and robust debate today we<br>honor sir Julian's major national and<br>local achievements and in particular his<br>commitment to a thriving regional press<br>in doing so we note the importance of a<br>value shared by the University and<br>quality newspapers the commitment to<br>being a critic and conscience of society<br>Chancellor I have the honor to present<br>the

Chris Laidlaw<br>to deliver today's graduation address<br>I'll kill Naruto Chancellor Vice<br>Chancellor members of the academic staff<br>family members and particularly<br>graduates thank you for inviting me to<br>share some reflections of this<br>celebration of academic achievement at<br>Otago before I say anything else I have<br>something of a confession to make<br>having gained two degrees here in the<br>1960s I didn't show up to the passing<br>out parade on either occasion having<br>been somewhere else in the world both<br>times and in those days of course there<br>was only one graduation Day event and if<br>you missed it that was that<br>congratulations to everyone receiving a<br>degree today I'm honored to be able to<br>share that moment with you I might have<br>missed the graduation ceremonies but I<br>didn't miss much else that this<br>university has to offer<br>Oh taiga always had and still does have<br>a healthy balance between serious study<br>and serious fun we all know that Dunedin<br>is the only genuine University city in<br>this country and the interdependence of<br>town and gown is a massive advantage for<br>both the city knows its future is<br>dependent on the lifeblood of the<br>University and the university knows that<br>its own future depends on the symbiotic<br>relationship with a city it works two of<br>my most enduring memories here as a<br>student were being part of the<br>pioneering of mixed flatting which until<br>then was akin to a capital crime and<br>secondly having the responsibility of<br>negotiating on behalf of the student<br>body the vital supply of donated capping<br>weak alcohol from dear old mr. Speight<br>I'm not sure this generosity from<br>Tunisians most famous industry still<br>persists I certainly hope so<br>mr. Speight believed that students<br>needed to relax in order to learn and<br>that balance between the serious and the<br>madcap is something o Tago has managed<br>to preserve exceptionally well ever<br>since you will all no doubt be leaving<br>with memories of both the study and the<br>fun hopefully in in that order of<br>priority when my generation went through<br>university we had the luxury of what was<br>more or less a free education and the<br>guarantee more<br>less of a choice of jobs when we<br>graduated most certainties are now gone<br>almost certainly never to return it's<br>now accepted to someone entering the<br>workforce these days outside a few<br>specialized careers will most likely<br>have five or ten or more different jobs<br>during their working life occupational<br>agility will become the norm skill sets<br>will need to be broadened adaptability<br>will become the driving force the<br>boundaries between occupational sectors<br>will become increasingly blurred a<br>willingness to up sticks and go<br>somewhere else to work or to work<br>remotely for more than one employer will<br>become much more common but there will<br>be more flexibility of working hours<br>more opportunities for more fulfilling<br>careers based on more meaningful work<br>and more space for independent thinking<br>Otago is a university that is reassuring<br>a certain of itself and it's vocation<br>it's not like that everywhere in<br>Wellington we've been locked in a rather<br>unseemly squabble between those who want<br>the name of the university changed and<br>the word Victoria dropped and those who<br>don't the Vice Chancellor announced last<br>year that the University Senate had made<br>up its mind about this the name was<br>changing there were too many other<br>Victoria University scattered around the<br>world and people were getting them mixed<br>up he might have had a point but it was<br>roundly rejected by former students and<br>staff he lost and the whole business has<br>not has not done the University much of<br>a favour when it comes to its sense of<br>self I mentioned this particular episode<br>because it reveals the deep and enduring<br>vein of affection and kinship that<br>underpins the relations between a<br>student and his or her university it's<br>something that gives way to a sense<br>almost of ownership as the years go by<br>and that relationship is fundamental to<br>the well-being of that institution<br>there's nothing confusing about the name<br>Otago University here or anywhere else<br>and there's nothing confused about OU<br>Tigers identity when it comes to its<br>dedication to research and inquiry and<br>the primacy of truth over opinion it's<br>known and respected internationally not<br>just as the oldest of our universities<br>but the one with the greatest substance<br>as the world of tertiary education<br>shifts from its primary responsibilities<br>of broadening the mind to supplying a<br>much need<br>meal ticket taco stands out as an<br>institution dedicated to resisting that<br>slide toward production line education<br>and that resistance is going to be<br>crucial as costs and competition<br>accelerated others particularly in the<br>poly tech community simply can't survive<br>without international full feed paying<br>students nobody can blame them for that<br>it is quite simply market forces working<br>in the way that market forces always do<br>well if more or less unfitted but the<br>truth is it's probably not sustainable a<br>University's most fundamental<br>responsibility to broaden the mind to<br>inspire students to think and to<br>question as its greatest virtue but it<br>also its most profound challenge and<br>it's becoming even more complex<br>research has shown unequivocally that as<br>our lives become more digitized<br>especially via social media the more our<br>attention span diminishes we become less<br>able to consider both sides of an<br>argument or to delve more deeply into a<br>subject that is more than<br>uni-dimensional it's now becoming<br>evident that a young individuals very<br>sense of self and of emotional security<br>has come to depend on their social media<br>connections they are increasingly locked<br>in competition for popular validation<br>among their peers social media has<br>become a battleground for attention the<br>ammunition is selfies videos and<br>personal advertisements your generation<br>are going to have to grapple with this<br>potentially toxic phenomenon just as<br>you're going to have to make the running<br>on climate change and rising inequality<br>massive challenges on which my<br>generation so far has patiently failed<br>let's look at what the digital era has<br>done to politics<br>we're ceaselessly bombarded with<br>information some of which is rooted in<br>reality much of which isn't and the line<br>between truth and hearsay is<br>increasingly blurred the media<br>establishment with a few heroic<br>exceptions and I include the ODT very<br>firmly in that understands this and<br>actively cannot connives with it to suit<br>their purposes which are essentially<br>commercial most of the content these<br>days is comprised of opinion pieces<br>masquerading as journalism not greatly<br>concerned with facts or hard data the<br>intent is now to persuade just like the<br>way Donald Trump canned<br>it's government policy by personal tweet<br>rather than reasoned analysis reading<br>the comments section at the end of an<br>article online posted by Emmy or duck or<br>stuff you can fight your if you can<br>fight your way through the ads can be an<br>arresting experience facts are<br>incidental there are now even<br>alternative facts seriously paraded<br>anger real spleen is often on display<br>the explosion of hate speech is an ugly<br>symptom of this faith in the competence<br>of government has inevitably the victim<br>as the angry crowd protected by its<br>collective anonymity heaps its invective<br>on institutions and individuals with an<br>almost medieval relish interest in<br>voting declines accordingly Donald Trump<br>states of proposition which is patently<br>false and a large slice of the American<br>electorate promptly agree with them and<br>resolve to vote for him and as we all<br>know alike and travel halfway around the<br>world before the truth can get its boots<br>on more information was supposed to mean<br>more freedom to stand up to the misuse<br>of power but we seem less capable of<br>reasoned debate than ever we live in a<br>world of dark ads hacks BOTS trolls soft<br>facts and fake news researchers at the<br>University of Oxford called this process<br>manufacturing consensus the Chinese<br>government apparently posts about 500<br>million social media comments a year the<br>aim of which is not to engage but to<br>distract as critical stories are simply<br>swamped by the propaganda of the ruling<br>elite they are not alone in their actual<br>policies and coherent ideologies are<br>replaced by ever more strident calls to<br>arms around a leaders personality these<br>are bolstered by an avalanche of slogans<br>such as take back Britain built the wall<br>or drain the swamp the facts are<br>incidental all this is now rampant in<br>the democracies of the Northern<br>Hemisphere and the signs of it are<br>starting to appear in our part of the<br>world how long will it be before that<br>kind of cynical manipulation takes hold<br>in New Zealand and more particularly<br>what is it what does this imply for<br>universities or for you as graduates<br>with a respect for the truth now as<br>never before universities must challenge<br>those who<br>willfully distort the truth the more so<br>when a claim flies in the face of<br>empirical evidence without vigorous<br>academic underpinning of the hard<br>reality of climate change for instance<br>we wouldn't be seeing finally the<br>realization that we simply can't<br>continue to duck this primal challenge<br>and we owe that progress to the voices<br>of universities who have taken on the<br>naysayers but there's a long way to go<br>yet and I hope that everyone here<br>graduating today will see it as a<br>responsibility to insist on the truth in<br>public debate to demand the facts or<br>better still to provide them<br>congratulations to all of you change is<br>accelerating it it might seem daunting<br>but it's also exciting filled with new<br>opportunities and new flexibilities I<br>wish everybody here tonight crossing<br>that great threshold between study and<br>work a happy and fruitful transition<br>thank you
