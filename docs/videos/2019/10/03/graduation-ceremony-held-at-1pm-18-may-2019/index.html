publisher<br>Bridget Williams has produced stand like<br>fence posts that mark the road taken by<br>New Zealand over three decades they<br>taught new and formerly untold histories<br>which have played a pivotal role in how<br>the nation understands itself today they<br>have opened conversations about history<br>identity and about the directions the<br>country might take in the future Bridget<br>was born in Wellington in 1948 the<br>middle child of a family of three a<br>studious older sister Janet and a<br>creative younger brother Tony<br>Bridget attended Wellington girls<br>College where she was a high achiever<br>and a promising florist chosen to play<br>with the National Youth Orchestra<br>she began University study at Victoria<br>University of Wellington but transferred<br>to the University of Otago when her<br>father Robin became vice chancellor here<br>Brigid completed her honours degree in<br>English at Otago soon after she joined<br>her then partner who was studying at<br>Oxford University<br>there is surrounded by other talented<br>English graduates Brigid created her<br>point of difference by learning to<br>touch-type their skill led to a post<br>assisting Dame Helen Gardner the first<br>woman to be appointed Merton professor<br>of English literature at Oxford at that<br>time Dame Helen was working on the New<br>Oxford book of English verse 1250 to<br>1950 when Bridget assisted typing and<br>discussing poem<br>here she blossomed learning from a<br>professor came to discuss ideas and in<br>the knowledge that his skills were being<br>put to excellent use more work followed<br>in publishing and with Professor Richard<br>Elmen and it was he when the time came<br>to come back to New Zealand who<br>encouraged Bridget to contact the<br>Wellington branch of Oxford University<br>Press<br>she was hired immediately it did not<br>take long before Bridget display that<br>rare combination of intellectual<br>ambition an entrepreneurial Flair which<br>has distinguished her career recognizing<br>the need for a new look at New Zealand's<br>past Bridget was responsible in<br>partnership with WH Oliver for the 1981<br>multi authored and groundbreaking Oxford<br>history of New Zealand soon Bridget<br>determined that New Zealand was ready<br>for a new publisher and with minimum<br>capital but plenty of skill resolve and<br>business acumen she established Port<br>Nicholson press an important predecessor<br>to Bridget Williams books from the start<br>of her independent publishing Bridget<br>initiated a series of critical debates<br>in 1988 she published Marilyn Waring's<br>counting for nothing a feminist critique<br>of economics which has had a global<br>impact Bridget has been instrumental in<br>the expansion of the fields of women's<br>history Mari history and social policy<br>successful publishers begin with a<br>passion for books and a vision of what<br>makes a good one<br>this requires thinking ahead of the<br>crowd what isn't there that should be it<br>was such foresight that led to the 1991<br>runaway success of the book of New<br>Zealand women<br>Kakui Mata Kaupapa witch Bridget not<br>only published but co-authored with<br>Charlotte Macdonald and Mary Mary pin<br>fold she has the ability to woo authors<br>to convince writers that they have<br>something important to say to guide<br>their work through production and to<br>convince booksellers<br>that this is a book which readers are<br>eager to buy close working relationships<br>with their authors over many years such<br>as Claudia orange Judith Bernie Aroha<br>Harris and myself has led to<br>award-winning books on the treaty of<br>waitangi on to hoy history tango 1300<br>and a history of New Zealand women these<br>books occupy a special place in bringing<br>scholarly works to the attention of a<br>wider public through expert editing and<br>beautiful design the description of<br>Bridget's 2003 publication a concise<br>dictionary of the New Zealand sign<br>language might well apply to every BWB<br>book an immaculately groomed<br>thoroughbred a triumph of printing<br>crafts and editorial skills Bridget has<br>also made significant contributions to<br>the wider publishing industry she was a<br>founding member of the listener women's<br>book festival which succeeded beyond<br>everyone's expectations she was a<br>managing director at a time when few<br>women were in the boardroom she has been<br>a driving force behind initiatives such<br>as the New Zealand local publishers<br>forum and the independent publishing<br>group Bridget has worked to forward the<br>cultural life of the country to a number<br>of levels from her commitment to getting<br>books into schools to mentoring young<br>publishers the letter include Tom Rennie<br>who has been the driving force behind<br>the invaluable BWB text series of short<br>books that raise discussion about<br>matters of vital importance to New<br>Zealanders Bridget Williams has forged a<br>career around a commitment to producing<br>outstanding books that encourage debate<br>his steadfast vision and commitment have<br>taken her through the storms that have<br>shaken the publishing trade in a small<br>country with the digital world emerged<br>and offered an alternative to the<br>printed book she has treated change as<br>an opportunity to find new niches to<br>enrich our cultural capital Cicero is<br>reputed to have once said<br>that a room without books is like a body<br>without a soul<br>Bridget's publishing has fed the soul of<br>our nation and her books will

to this graduation feeling<br>very honored quite old and privileged to<br>be here with you the different<br>generations of today I would like to<br>start by making a connection between our<br>several worlds through the words of a<br>young to hoist scholar<br>matariki Williams speaking at a similar<br>ceremony last year and math Ricci said I<br>want you to know you have a voice it is<br>powerful I urge you to always look<br>around and to ask who isn't in the room<br>I challenge you to do things that scare<br>you and lastly look after each other<br>look after yourselves she said it all<br>but I will continue Matariki was a<br>student when I first met her working in<br>the research community that grew around<br>the six-year project published in 2014<br>as Tonga Tuffy Noah and

of museum<br>curator and publisher it is this web of<br>connection that I draw on as I turn to<br>her phrase know that you have a voice it<br>is powerful for these are words that lay<br>well below the surface as I crossed the<br>same stage as a very uncertain young<br>graduate in 1969 but words that have<br>made a key part in propelling me forward<br>into the orbit of independent publishing<br>in New Zealand in the 21st century the<br>place of voice the power of voice these<br>are phrases that I use confidently today<br>but then in the 1960s and 1970s<br>my experience was of neither power nor<br>voice female quiet literary questioning<br>but not an activist this seemed little<br>place for me in New Zealand at that time<br>although of course there was of every<br>kind of place for a young parking a<br>person from a bookish family then that<br>is only to observe that life is apt to<br>be contradictory perhaps particularly in<br>times of change and particularly to as<br>we ourselves moved from youth to<br>adulthood well like many young woman<br>before me I fled and in a distant place<br>found a little more of my own voice<br>England in the 1970s held the heady<br>challenges of resurgent feminism radical<br>protest movements which often<br>marginalized the women's agency debates<br>with fiction and politics could<br>intersect places where class and race<br>were lived experiences fiercely<br>contested so and thus enchanting new<br>invigorating Miglia I learned to type<br>what else could a young woman with a<br>degree in English literature from New<br>Zealand do I could it seemed to become a<br>graduate secretary despair had<br>definitely struck so one sunny afternoon<br>I sat down at a borrowed typewriter and<br>whisked off a letter that said I have<br>always wanted to work with English<br>English literature and I can type this<br>did seem at the time as absurd as it<br>sounds now but I recommend the strategy<br>a little courage a lot of faith and<br>something practical in the mix<br>a few days later I received a<br>handwritten note from a distinguished<br>professor and I worked as her research<br>assistant for several years reading<br>typing discussing English poetry from<br>those ancient voices of an on to what<br>then past for contemporary writing which<br>I think stopped around TS Eliot those<br>years of reading the old British poets<br>were wonderful but I am so glad that<br>global literature today speaks with<br>quite different voices of genders<br>ethnicities places histories my own<br>place as it turned out was New Zealand<br>when I returned almost serendipitously<br>in 1976 there was something that held me<br>here not words not opportunity not even<br>family nor history but something to do<br>with the land the hills<br>I knew the landscapes of my childhood<br>and of my family Sittler past<br>simultaneously however my young<br>woodworking self rebelled against what I<br>experienced as a land of empty silence<br>to quote a writer from the 1950s New<br>Zealand and the 1970s seemed to me a<br>place where much that was might be said<br>written or known lay undiscovered or as<br>I felt deliberately misplaced buried by<br>the friendly but formidable institutions<br>of parking how patriarchy and that<br>phrase simply shorthands all that was<br>soon to be challenged in the 1970s and<br>1980s by women's liberation by maori<br>leaders and activists by the radicals of<br>my generation there were powerful forces<br>at work insisting on political and<br>social change it was in this contested<br>context that might agent somewhat<br>impatient curiosity about a land of<br>empty silence which of course was not<br>empty at all led to tentative<br>explorations of the maori past to<br>connections in the Maori world that<br>began as con<br>fashion and brought friendship as well<br>as again challenge small steps in a<br>search for the voices of this place for<br>a resonance rather than a silence for<br>the multiple Cadence's of the people in<br>the land a search that has driven my<br>publishing journey forward over the<br>decades to many different territories in<br>this country's intellectual landscape<br>and as the books were made along this<br>path they were welcomed to in their<br>geographical communities from Auckland<br>to Dunedin and also in Pomeroy and the<br>far north while Kirikiri in the heart of<br>Toyota WeDo there are our AHA at Bluff<br>to name only son here an otaku I am glad<br>to speak also of a particular connection<br>that the people of my Tahu have to this<br>publishing history one that men began<br>many many years ago hey Tanya time hey<br>Tanya time it is with collective<br>strength that we do what we do and that<br>so often begins with the welcome of<br>strangers as Ethel Anderson Otago and<br>night aho scholar titled his book about<br>life some two centuries ago in southern<br>New Zealand breaking the historical<br>silence<br>David Ali Shogo used these words in The<br>Guardian recently pressing pressing<br>British universities to apply their<br>customary rigor to uncover in a past<br>that was whitewashed the history of the<br>slave trade and its contribution to the<br>wealth of these and so many other great<br>British institutions today I am NOT a<br>researcher or a writer but I have worked<br>alongside many scholars as some of this<br>country's historical silences were<br>broken as new but actually ancient<br>women's history burst onto the page as<br>very specific local narratives were set<br>alongside the webs of transnational<br>analysis<br>as the language of the deaf community<br>was made manifest in a magnificent<br>dictionary researchers writers often but<br>not always academics surfacing into the<br>present the facts of the archive the<br>potentiality of stories told over<br>generations the context of the artifact<br>or tonga in the museum knowledge in<br>plain sight stories therefore the<br>hearing<br>Judith Burnie bringing hundred-year-old<br>news of Thurman in the 1920s amongst<br>much other devastating evidence to the<br>attention of the government and the<br>nation again shifting our understanding<br>of land and ownership until better and<br>today<br>the disruption of another kind of<br>silence as a younger generation takes<br>hold of the future the power of voice<br>the responsibility of your own voice the<br>place of many voices and the making of<br>history the place of the researcher the<br>writer the scholar these are the threads<br>that I would like to draw together and<br>pass to you graduating today to hold and<br>use well as you go forward whatever<br>unforeseen trajectories your lives may<br>take as they certainly will I hope that<br>you will remain curious seeking to know<br>simply what is there or rather what is<br>here for knowing this place its land its<br>peoples its past is critical to<br>understanding our future here in these<br>South Pacific Islands here in the world<br>the future looks fearful alarming to us<br>all about two decades into this<br>transformative century I hear many<br>voices that are not only urgent but also<br>courageous questioning serious<br>imaginative three books and blogs<br>perform<br>and protests research and writing in<br>ways of living and working there are<br>young voices everywhere<br>speaking powerfully about a future that<br>they are concerned to have and<br>determined to make I am very hopeful the<br>future is in your hands and I wish you<br>strength and
