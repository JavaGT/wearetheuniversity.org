great privilege of<br>being the vice chancellor at the<br>University of Otago and it gives me<br>great pleasure to welcome you to this<br>phenomenal professorial lecture for the<br>circular now these lectures are a time<br>for celebration for the university<br>community it's an opportunity for all of<br>us to take an hour out of our incredibly<br>busy schedules and just slow down a bit<br>and literally bask in the glory of one<br>of our local scholars I'm really really<br>happy to see so many people here this<br>evening and I am particularly delighted<br>to welcome some important people in<br>Lois's life who have come here to<br>support her this evening we're joined by<br>her mother Ruth her brother and<br>sister-in-law Karl and Ingrid and some<br>very special friends and colleagues have<br>come together from not only Christchurch<br>but also Dunedin and Wellington to be<br>here with her this evening it's also<br>great to see so many staff and students<br>from the University of Otago<br>Christchurch and I'd also like to<br>welcome any members of the general<br>Christchurch community who are here with<br>us this evening to each and every one of<br>you know my had a my welcome now it's<br>not easy to become a professor at the<br>University of Otago in order to be<br>successfully promoted to this particular<br>rank the candidate must demonstrate<br>excellence in teaching in research and<br>in service to the University and the<br>broader academic community now as you<br>will learn over the course of this<br>evening Louis has exceeded all of the<br>university's expectations for promotion<br>she's internationally recognized<br>her innovative research on eating<br>disorders she is an incredibly effective<br>classroom teacher and she's provided<br>exceptional service to the University of<br>Otago and to the psychological<br>profession on that note<br>when we were considering at Lois's<br>application for promotion we sought the<br>advice of international referees and one<br>of her referees told us there can be<br>absolutely no question about her<br>commitment and contribution to advancing<br>professional practice I can think of no<br>one who has given as much her leadership<br>has been calm considered able and fair<br>so Louis on behalf of the University of<br>Otago I would personally like to<br>congratulate you on your very very<br>well-deserved promotion to Professor and<br>I will now call on professor David<br>Murdoch who is going to tell us just a<br>little bit more about Lois's journey to<br>Professor noreda tena koe tena koe tenet<br>avocado tena koe toka toward Thank You<br>Harlan and for those who don't know me<br>my name is David Murdoch I'm the Dean<br>and head of campus here at the<br>University of Otago Christchurch and<br>it's my absolute pleasure to have the<br>role of introducing Louis tonight Louis<br>was born in fama Nui one of three<br>children she moved to Christchurch<br>just after starting primary school and<br>that move was prompted by her father<br>being promoted to a new role here in<br>Christchurch your father was a career<br>policeman and I must have but when I<br>found her when I lived that he was a<br>police when I couldn't help but reflect<br>on Lois's skills of Investigation and<br>wondering whether there was some<br>familial element associated with that<br>and I also just a little bit more<br>searching had and those that her father<br>was actually quite well known on the<br>profession and particularly I found a<br>record about the staff of the dog<br>handling section of the police where he<br>I think it creeped me Louis I think he<br>was one of the first<br>Constable's to receive one of the<br>original puppies in that program last<br>went to live with high school here in<br>Christchurch engaged in many sporting<br>music school leadership activities and<br>actually was was quite a sports person<br>was a Canterbury secondary school<br>representative in athletics was clearly<br>good sprinter 100 meters 200 meters long<br>jump as well as hockey and carried for<br>continued with the with competitive<br>sports through to her mid-twenties she<br>went to university of canterbury that<br>are undergraduate training their early<br>postgraduate training<br>graduated with a BA in 1981 in May 1983<br>certificate and alcohol Council in 1985<br>and a diploma in clinical psychology in<br>1986 and from 1986 has held varying<br>roles and Christchurch as a clinical<br>psychologist and they are included at<br>what was then Sunnyside hospital now<br>home more from the hospital student<br>health eating disorder service and the<br>clinical hematology unit here at<br>Christchurch Hospital and as well as the<br>the the clinical roles as Holly Malouda<br>- she's had increasing number of<br>professional roles and well note with<br>the New Zealand's like psychologists<br>board doing roles complaints assessment<br>committees accreditation and<br>investigation professional adviser and<br>clearly developing and honing those<br>skills of Investigation and that role<br>alone and receives us circa of<br>appreciation from their board for all of<br>work and also in 2012 was awarded the<br>fellowship of the New Zealand College of<br>clinical psychologists for significant<br>and preeminent contribution to the<br>psychology profession over an extended<br>period of time she's worked at the<br>University of Otago and varying roles<br>since 1994 did a PhD here was awarded<br>that in 2002 expect we might hear<br>something about that a bit<br>the title was investigation of core<br>phenomenon of anorexia nervosa the role<br>of psychological control and last his<br>current role as professor in our<br>department of psychological medicine key<br>teaching and research roles but also is<br>the associate dean academic for the<br>whole division of Health Sciences for<br>the University and that's a major role<br>with delegated authority and a wide<br>range of academic matters a really big<br>role and I think it's very very obvious<br>from looking at Lois's CV all of the<br>service roles apart from anything else<br>and I think that really indicates her<br>interest and involvement in both that<br>service role professionally and<br>academically but also I think reflects<br>her skills and the demands that others<br>place on her or request of her because<br>of those skills lesser-known skills and<br>these are actually Lois's words listen<br>and skills landscape gardening and tree<br>planting fishing in the marver sounds of<br>her academic interests listed health<br>practitioner regulation and malpractice<br>eating disorders and weight loss surgery<br>brain injury health psychology quite<br>diverse and Lois says studied and<br>published widely on on that range of<br>topics and so Lois invite you to take<br>the stage and for your your talk<br>entitled journeys through eating<br>disorders the interface between<br>psychological and physical health in<br>health<br>you probably did it better than me David<br>so expectations I just wanted to use the<br>opportunity to talk about some of the<br>things that I've really enjoyed which is<br>helpful and also happen to be things<br>that have been quite passionate about<br>which is a lucky Association and the the<br>uniting theme really is about teams and<br>collaboration and so that's what I<br>really want to highlight today is the<br>teams of people I've been involved with<br>um I couldn't not have predicted that I<br>would have ever done you need these<br>research projects actually um so you<br>don't want to protect your career too<br>far ahead because actually you probably<br>not do those things I would never a<br>thought I would be doing research when I<br>first got involved in professional work<br>and I think that it's been really good<br>to be able to unite professional work<br>with academic research so I start quite<br>small and I was still at the desk<br>I was the disc some people say I'm still<br>looking like that but I don't think<br>that's quite fair<br>so I've always pretty studious and doing<br>things and running around I enjoyed<br>school a lot and did lots of<br>extracurricular activities in fact<br>sometimes doubling up on any individual<br>day I did run everywhere David's right<br>and sometimes I ranked quite fast - I<br>enjoyed athletics in hockey especially<br>and unfortunately just gave those up as<br>I got really busy also do a lot of horse<br>riding and playing in various orchestras<br>and various instruments so one might<br>call it a very unfocused approach to<br>I did do an undergraduate and<br>postgraduate degrees at Canterbury and I<br>did this in education and psychology<br>really just following the good teachers<br>I'm not necessarily thinking that this<br>is what I was going to do it but I just<br>followed really inspiring and<br>and competent teachers our so chose<br>partly chose these things because they<br>just fitted around the sports and this<br>fear to say that I chose subjects<br>because I just stood in the wrong line<br>sometimes and that was fine I just took<br>that and I enjoyed university life I did<br>attend a lot of sports competitions I'm<br>including attending some rather<br>chaotically and poorly run winter<br>tournaments in fact I was just made to<br>find that sometimes there were no games<br>organized it went attorney and but I<br>found other things to do and I made lots<br>and lots of friends through those things<br>I think doing a spread of undergraduate<br>subjects is really important and not too<br>narrow too early so I did do papers and<br>philosophy and statistics thinking well<br>these does fit around but a sport but<br>actually they were very very crucial<br>when I got started doing research and<br>I'll come to that a bit later so it's<br>important not to narrow down too early<br>in my opinion and doing academic work<br>those were also the days of Student<br>Health student job schemes quite nicely<br>funded by the government and so you<br>could stand on the line somewhere in the<br>square for hours and then see what card<br>you got offered for a job and so over<br>many summers I learned lots about<br>laboring and practical skills such as<br>painting and landscaping and more<br>painting and more painting and more<br>painting and I think over the course of<br>those undergraduate years a paint of<br>most of the community facilities at I<br>type in Lincoln so sometimes when I<br>Drive past I just check what the quality<br>of the paint and job is now I still<br>enjoyed these things and over the years<br>I've learned scapes several big sections<br>from nothing to pretty good guidance I<br>think and I learned a lot of practical<br>skills<br>adesh it turned out that summer jobs<br>also gave me a really really big break<br>and had a big influence on my career<br>because one of the jobs are headers to<br>go to mrs.<br>then and ask if I can have that please<br>could I have that so much old place and<br>so that was the summer far far away and<br>I was interviewed for that job along<br>with a few other people and I became a<br>research assistant at what was known as<br>Sunnyside hospital which at that time<br>had over a thousand patients which was<br>pretty shocking to think about that now<br>it's called Hill more from hospital so<br>what's very grateful for all of who's<br>here who now who gave me these jobs and<br>I keep returning over a couple of years<br>to collect follow-up data with a few<br>other people as well and that break<br>really gave me the confidence and idea<br>of applying for professional career and<br>psychology which I hadn't really<br>seriously considered just as well I<br>started to consider something a later<br>point actually pour glue who was a<br>psychiatric registrar join that team to<br>do some writing up off the research and<br>of course publications from there and<br>Paul of course is now professor of<br>psychological medicine at Otago so what<br>comes around goes around<br>I then don't apply for postgraduate<br>training and clinical psychology and I<br>was really surprised to get selected I<br>think I did my interview running between<br>some sports things I turned up and<br>shorts and t-shirts and I was really<br>surprised that that wasn't the envy but<br>I got an effusion Gordon and I just<br>involved quite a lot of academic work<br>and heavy hands-on training over three<br>years it was a good time to be training<br>because we as a group we're seeing the<br>fading of the old institutional<br>treatment good and bad and the rise of<br>community based services that old<br>institution is now gone but being able<br>to see the history both God embed was<br>really helpful and understanding people<br>who are presenting worth long term into<br>illness I still got the Jo like keys to<br>the old gray building I admit I never<br>handed them in but I don't think anybody<br>were looking at them for them because<br>the buildings have been demolished<br>major teachers until the clinical<br>program included Ralph owner Steve<br>Hudson and Bill Blake it was one of the<br>first clinical training programs in New<br>Zealand and I think in my mind biased<br>mind was one of the best ones at that<br>time and I was really grateful for the<br>many people who supervised me during<br>those years including many people who<br>are here today and are still friends so<br>clinical training took six students per<br>year which wasn't many we spent three<br>years intensely working together getting<br>to know each other really well and I'm<br>friends and trusted colleagues with most<br>of those people even 30 years later we<br>were an unusually nerdy group on<br>reflection didn't realize it at the time<br>and so five or six of us went on to do<br>phd's which was unusual so I did qualify<br>as a psychologist and I did some short<br>work at student health and then I went<br>back to sunny South Hospital working in<br>a variety of settings including setting<br>up a new service and education explained<br>extending a new service and an education<br>lots and going up and down the main road<br>which was where I learnt to find good<br>firewood on the way home so I was in the<br>right place at the right time I also got<br>a job at Princess Margaret Hospital<br>specialist eating disorder service and<br>that was and still is the only publicly<br>funded and patient unit in New Zealand<br>so it was a it was a quite a unique<br>setting the service wasn't a phase of<br>major overhaul and having to rethink how<br>to manage increasingly escalating<br>numbers of referrals on the same number<br>of services but were the limited you<br>know resources so I was very grateful to<br>be given some dhb funding to visit some<br>Australian Canadian and American clinics<br>looking at different ways to deliver<br>services those trips especially<br>impressed on me the importance of doing<br>clinical research and longside and<br>practical and service<br>so I started doing a few research<br>projects and got my first publications<br>in the area of eating disorders around<br>1990s in 1994 I did joined half time as<br>a joint clinical academic with the DHB<br>and the University of Otago and of<br>course one has to do a PhD dean so I got<br>cracking and it did do a PhD on the role<br>of psychological control I did this<br>topic because it's squarely hit me in<br>the face that this was a bit of a miss<br>really in terms of what we offered<br>patients and what we see to patients and<br>what patients said to us I had some<br>excellent supervisors and Steve Hudson<br>who many will know who unfortunately<br>died before I submitted but and we did<br>get to see my loosely bound main script<br>and also Jackie horn and let me primer<br>each what did I do this well I was<br>interested in rare things and so this<br>seemed to be important topic as many<br>theories about anorexia to talk about<br>control it's littered with this talk yet<br>when you look at what these things say<br>they don't necessarily line up and say<br>consistent things so that seems<br>confusing things to patients and it<br>certainly seems confusing things to do<br>collisions as as well so this PhD<br>involved a lot of looking and<br>theoretical boxes that's what it did<br>feel like I read about unpacking leading<br>theories and extracted the claims made<br>on each of the theories and then said<br>about testing how these theories bore<br>out with empirical literature so<br>sometimes I looked in the boxes there<br>was nothing there other times I was<br>overwhelmed you know they would say<br>we're done and ask other questions about<br>whether there was anything unique about<br>enteric siakam people with other<br>disorders that claim to have quite a lot<br>of uncontrolled issues involved and<br>illness maintenance and development and<br>I<br>just by looking at people with alcohol<br>dependence and diabetes which sound like<br>diverse groups but there are some over<br>lips and then finally I looked at the<br>case is that the case that certain<br>symptoms but not others are related to<br>control issues and again it's a slightly<br>different way of looking at this<br>question but quite an important one when<br>it comes down to what you're going to do<br>in treatment and finally which was<br>probably a tricky thing for me was I was<br>looking at how people were thinner it's<br>the universe a construct themselves<br>construct the owners and how they talk<br>about control so this did involve people<br>with interests who talking to each other<br>and me not me listening and been a<br>research assistant listen again and I<br>hate the that the need to learn about<br>different ways of doing research not<br>just counting numbers and being a<br>empirical researcher but diving into<br>qualitative research and social<br>constructionist theories which I still<br>don't quite know much about but there<br>you go so after my PhD I was really<br>lucky to be able to extend this work<br>quite a lot for a number of years and I<br>was great to be able to work with Marisa<br>so from University of Sydney and she had<br>active links with Singapore clinics<br>which is handy and so we looked at<br>social norms about control in both these<br>countries and how these different norms<br>may relate to symptoms of anorexia<br>nervosa we did find some important<br>differences and we thought this had<br>significant bearing on treatments and<br>depending on what sit in your own so in<br>effect western-centric treatments may<br>not fit an asian settings but there's a<br>complicated story because we also looked<br>at cultural assimilation and if you live<br>in one country but you're of a different<br>background or a different Asian<br>background how does that play out in<br>Australia and likewise how does that<br>play out for Australians living in Asia<br>so it ended up being a butt bigger PhD<br>that I would hope for but we've got<br>there<br>so we built some cultural specific<br>theory about control and then we draw on<br>to look at some other things like diet<br>profiles nutritional knowledge and body<br>image dissatisfaction and those settings<br>h-how'd of the earlier trips to<br>Australia took me to eating disorders<br>and services and suddenly and that's<br>where I met Peter Beaumont and Steven<br>tells Peter was the H OD of<br>psychological medicine and Stephen was<br>the h OD of psychology perfect fit<br>so both these people turned out to be<br>very important and opened doors for me<br>though both world leaders and eating<br>disorders research and practice and they<br>were extremely generous and asking me to<br>join some of their collaborations so I<br>got involved with sitting up the New<br>Zealand side of the Australasian<br>treatment database so when you're<br>dealing with really rare disorders<br>multi-site databases are really<br>important to build the numbers and this<br>helps benchmark clinical outcomes and<br>understanding changing profiles of<br>people presenting Peter and Steven also<br>invited me to included me in part of a<br>group that set up the Australia New<br>Zealand Association of eating disorders<br>and that Association is still going<br>strong they also invited me to write<br>some of the teaching curriculum for<br>helping GPS and New South Wales to<br>manage people with eating disorders so<br>both Peter and Steven opened doors for<br>me internationally and that Peter has<br>now died I must still am involved in<br>working with steep Steven and a number<br>of PhDs it just got a bit of a neck of<br>those Stephens got a bit of neck and<br>bring these that I know they're bored<br>with us so Peter and Steve are also<br>excellent at building new research teams<br>and for me this included a new research<br>team member in the form of serum aquire<br>who these days remains a good friend and<br>colleague one of the big jobs we did is<br>that we started to explore a staging<br>model of off illness<br>anorexia nervosa so in the summer<br>illnesses like kids so we already have a<br>staging model which helps us predict<br>treatment and prognosis edge plan<br>planned service delivery we wondered of<br>the same could be developed an anorexia<br>nervosa especially given that the only<br>historical marker of severity and Rexie<br>has been weight which seems a bit<br>shallow in terms of understanding<br>severity so we collected data and three<br>countries over several years and we did<br>come up with a four stage model which<br>could be reliably measured and could<br>predict treatment needs on use I really<br>enjoyed this work as a broad a large<br>team together and it was designed to<br>help clinicians and think about other<br>severity Marcus building on these<br>international collaborations led to<br>other things and this is the you know<br>the street that joins all this together<br>so I got involved in writing teams<br>developing clinical guidelines for<br>eating disorders in 2003 in Lima Guinea<br>eleven years later these were very<br>time-consuming projects working with<br>large groups of people but they're<br>really important and helping<br>non-specialist clinicians deliver<br>evidence-based care most people with<br>eating disorders are not seen by<br>specialists clinicians so we need some<br>way of communicating up the good<br>standards and expected protocols in the<br>last decade have also been had editing<br>roles on two international journals<br>again very time-consuming as it involved<br>overseeing the peer review of articles<br>submitted to journals and making<br>recommendations about publications or<br>not so all of these were new teams for<br>me or be it from a distance often and<br>unfortunately most of the editorial<br>board meetings are held in these really<br>exotic places at 2:00 a.m. a New Zealand<br>time so 18 most of these video<br>conferences<br>Jonah's turning off the video so they<br>can't quite see so along the way I've<br>was involved in a number of organizing<br>of conferences and nationally<br>internationally perhaps the biggest one<br>was that of being part of the Scientific<br>Committee for international conference<br>on eating disorders in New York this was<br>two to three years in the planning of<br>regular meeting again not at very<br>sociable it hours for me but it ended up<br>being very successful with over 1400 to<br>10 days so we didn't really well it was<br>the biggest ever held conference on<br>eating disorders in the world at that<br>point it's another example of working<br>with colleagues some of whom you know<br>working with academic strangers and<br>actually coming together from a distance<br>into it for a common goal other<br>alongside this I've been involved in<br>some other areas of interests around<br>eating disorders and such as estimating<br>the economic and social burden of eating<br>disorders worldwide looking at how we<br>can cost these things out are there ways<br>of predicting treatment drop out when<br>people are intensive and patient here<br>for an eating disorder you think that<br>might be easy but it wasn't<br>and really about the relationship<br>between self like and self-confidence an<br>eating disorder symptoms and how these<br>things are dynamic and change over time<br>and how does unhealthy perfectionism<br>drive eating disorder symptoms or is it<br>the other way around<br>so just data that involved following up<br>people in looking at relationships<br>backwards and forwards so around 2003<br>and four I shifted to clinical<br>hematology 0.5 as my dhb component this<br>was a newly created position for the<br>service I was interested in this because<br>I quite interested in service<br>development work and I'd done quite a<br>lot of that at Princess Margaret<br>Hospital and this seemed quite a nice<br>challenge this was also an excellent<br>team to work with<br>very challenging area of Medicine I got<br>involved with some research looking at<br>clinical care delivery and set up a<br>postgraduate paper on cycle oncology and<br>wouldn't you know it this introduced me<br>to some other roles so between 2002 and<br>2015 I've been on a number of ministry<br>health expert advisory groups looking at<br>different aspects of care these groups<br>came and went as the reports claimed in<br>which so these are sort of short bursts<br>of activities that at one of these I met<br>meets Betsy Marshall who is the person<br>on the Left who's received a Queen's<br>service order for her work in kids<br>Archaea she later asked me to be on the<br>trusty IB as trustee on the New Zealand<br>cancer control trust and this included a<br>group of experts some of you know some<br>of these people who work for Otago<br>they're experts in public health policy<br>patient rights and cancer research<br>we had some initial government funding<br>but operated quite independently of the<br>ministry we were a bit like an NGO and<br>educating for care and the trust wound<br>up in 2015 but it was really enjoy being<br>part of a ginger group not being bought<br>by government money but actually<br>challenging the Ministry of Health about<br>meeting their targets or choosing the<br>wrong target so we felt that was the<br>case um so there's no automatic leap to<br>this group about running alongside all<br>this work I got involved in another<br>really great research team that<br>continues to work together for over a<br>decade now and this is focused on<br>rehabilitation recovery from illness and<br>injuries this included Debbie Snell<br>who's here today at Richard Secret who<br>used to wait for Otago but no Auckland<br>and Jean Highsmith Whois and Otago we're<br>all from slightly different backgrounds<br>in areas of expertise but we came<br>together to look at what could we bring<br>to bear on understand during recovery<br>interestingly Debbie was a who's he<br>was also a co-author of some of my<br>earlier publications so it just shows<br>you the links that you build early are<br>really important later and we're still<br>publishing together 20 years later so we<br>have looked at concussion we've looked<br>at coping in recovery and an other<br>population such as emergency first<br>responders and an ongoing project with<br>weight loss surgery candidates so<br>alongside all this I as David mentioned<br>and 2002 I was appointed to the New<br>Zealand psychologists board I just<br>applied in those but surprised to get<br>appointed by the ministry and this is<br>the regulatory authority which oversees<br>the regulation of psychologists in New<br>Zealand about 3000 or so of them and<br>I've got a point at about the time just<br>before the new legislation came in the<br>hpc a it and this was the first time<br>that all the regulated health<br>professionals like doctors nurses<br>dentists and so on had one piece of<br>legislation to determine how they would<br>be regulated and we had lots to do I got<br>heavily involved in writing teams we<br>developed policies and procedures in<br>order to apply the it correctly and<br>apply the right functions at the right<br>time didn't quite know it but I was on<br>the psychologists board for a night I<br>didn't have years which was quite a long<br>time nothing but some prison sentences<br>ER but anyway I didn't feel like that<br>but it was at that time just flew by and<br>I did share it for six years as well<br>which was a massive job and on top of<br>that towards into that time I also<br>shared the health regulation authorities<br>of New Zealand group which has all the<br>all all the 16 regulator authorities<br>under one umbrella to share some common<br>grounds I have to say this was<br>extraordinarily hard work done in the<br>weekends and being really organized<br>think about three lessons out of us<br>first preparation preparation<br>preparation and managing meetings and<br>decisions and it just makes it a lot<br>easier although all the workers<br>obviously done before you go to a<br>meeting second I learned more than I<br>thought I needed to know about surviving<br>political processes and managing groups<br>sometimes quite sharp politics and so I<br>especially like to thank Steve Osborne<br>who's here today in n Godhead for<br>supporting me in their work sort of<br>literally propping me up at the end of a<br>meeting and say that's all right carry<br>on and I learned a lot about<br>fundamentals of God governance and<br>administrative law and also that<br>sometimes unpopular decisions have to be<br>made and learning how to do that fairly<br>and robustly as a good skill to acquire<br>it certainly helped me as and other<br>roles but a lot of hard work long days I<br>then after I left the board a some<br>continued and I said a bit of an<br>advisory role or three and which with<br>the board Secretariat which is the<br>operational arm of the board here are<br>mostly the check I've been chairing the<br>accreditation professional of<br>professional training programs that lead<br>to registration and quite a lot of<br>investigative teams a lot of that work<br>has gone behind the scenes it's not<br>something you can go to work the next<br>day and talk about<br>but having a good grasp of processes has<br>been essential it actually turned out<br>that this regulation work would open<br>other international opportunities little<br>did I know so especially in Australia<br>where I got great support from<br>Australian colleagues on the psychology<br>board of Australia particularly Bren<br>grinia who was my equivalent in New<br>Zealand so that collegial relationship<br>led me to chair the first ever joint<br>meeting between the newly formed<br>psychology board of Australia and New<br>Zealand psychologists board and so I<br>think that's good that New Zealand lead<br>Depp and later I was also invited as a<br>keynote speaker on international<br>regulation standards for psychologists<br>so Brennan remains the support of<br>colleague and wish<br>some research interests and then 9 2013<br>another important opportunity would<br>directly lead to new research<br>collaborations so at that time I was<br>selected by Otago University to attend<br>the woman and Leadership Program and<br>thank you to the vice-chancellor for<br>being part of the funding that scheme so<br>that involves a block horse meeting<br>which doesn't sound like much for a week<br>working with other academic strangers<br>completely outside my research in my<br>University and it has follow-up meetings<br>which I think about good at going to<br>because at one of those meetings at a<br>coffee break completely standing<br>accidentally next to each other<br>I started up a conversation with Kate<br>Dee's field who's an academic lawyer<br>from Auckland and we quickly found I<br>think more than about 10 minutes minutes<br>some shared research interests and we<br>went on to bring together another<br>research team Kate QC a lawyer starting<br>a PhD murder record<br>another trained lawyer towards the end<br>of a PhD and Michael who as a public<br>defender he does apologize for the mug<br>shot that says my decoy to get into the<br>Auckland courts but a great team and<br>again people I'd never met before that<br>we instantly clicked and so we turned<br>our attention to their act that I told<br>you about because of us uniqueness<br>perhaps internationally it's unique and<br>there was a relatively absent body of<br>research I think it was one or two<br>papers talking about one or two tiny<br>aspects of it so we were especially<br>interested in the workings of the<br>disciplinary process is heard by the<br>health practitioners disciplinary<br>tribunal so what this mean we were in<br>general teams we were said about asking<br>a whole lot of series of questions about<br>how well as the act working we had a<br>decade of legal decisions as a source of<br>data and the reality of this is that we<br>pored over thousands of pages of legal<br>surgeons as it doesn't everybody's idea<br>of fun and it doesn't look like you're<br>doing much when you're sitting at your<br>desk but you are just really reading<br>reading and processing so persistence<br>was needed and this was and still is<br>truly interdisciplinary work I came from<br>a science background and had to learn<br>other ways of thinking about data and<br>writing academic arguments so those<br>early lectures and philosophy have been<br>especially handy in making me have<br>succeed in the transition so we we've<br>been asking questions like how do<br>different health practitioner<br>professions go equipped into hearings<br>why might some professions possibly<br>receive more severe sanctions than other<br>disciplines for the similar<br>transgressions which I think it's really<br>interesting<br>what's the public perception of an<br>expectations of the act and disciplinary<br>tribunals<br>how has rehabilitation built into<br>penalties and what name suppression<br>principles are used in declining the<br>proven name suppression and we also<br>looked at health issues implicated in<br>health practitioner lapses because as a<br>health practitioner I'm interested in<br>well people might have done sort of<br>slightly unhelpful things but what's the<br>route out to rehabilitate people all<br>these things have led to some<br>publications so the work continues<br>unfortunately so we're now this us and<br>we're looking at their health and<br>discipline each Commissioner cases<br>before the Human Rights Review Tribunal<br>and again actually this is just a more<br>paper there's a lot more people but<br>applying a academic and professional eye<br>on the consistency of decisions in<br>atypical cases and again thank you for<br>the new University New Zealand<br>universities women and leadership<br>program for providing the means for me<br>meeting people I would never have come<br>across outside my alone efficient so<br>just so happens that my experience and<br>regulation and policy work has also<br>helped in other roles because<br>the final teams I really have joy being<br>paid off as various teams and academic<br>governance and ickiness not everybody's<br>so I how I got under this as my<br>colleague jean Highsmith I refer to<br>earlier Remy up and said I'm going on<br>sabbatical can you fell and cheering a<br>moral status okay not quite realizing<br>that this would lead to other things so<br>on who returned Jean said I've got other<br>things to do go for it so I applied for<br>the post grad studies associate dean<br>role and got that and I stayed on that<br>role for eight years actually mixing<br>with a whole group of people there's<br>many of these people here today<br>Casey warden Andrew Howard and pet Craig<br>of course so they seem to have fun on<br>days I wasn't there but I'm sure they<br>would have invited me of Urbania that<br>day but a really excellent group of<br>people and very dedicated and ethical<br>people to work with so thank you wait I<br>guess I got involved in a number of<br>things we did postgraduate academic<br>procedures and guidelines again not even<br>buddies a cup of tea but a bit of a<br>problem if you don't have them looking<br>at academic governance best practice I<br>got involved in sharing multiple campus<br>boards and working parties managing and<br>parcels and improving the efficiencies<br>has been probably big blown of my work<br>and university-wide governance<br>collaborations and working across the<br>divisions and especially we're doing but<br>more of that since I talk on the role of<br>associate dean academic win pet found<br>some interesting things to do so I guess<br>one of the big things we did and this<br>doesn't seem much but I just wanted to<br>highlight a sort of years of work<br>summarized in two slides which we<br>actually changed the academic structure<br>of the division<br>in terms of boards from this to first<br>now there doesn't look like much change<br>but actually it's thousands of hours<br>saved among dozens of academics getting<br>the same work done and quick a time so I<br>think the work that I did in previous<br>governance roles and restructuring<br>really caught both us and the good thing<br>about it actually nobody complained if<br>what he said thanks very much got this<br>meetings to go through so thank you for<br>all those team members featured the<br>previous slide who helped me do all<br>those things so in conclusion I think<br>it's been a career of being given<br>opportunities by others and I'm very<br>grateful for those other picky people<br>who have linked me to others who have<br>linked me to others<br>I think teamwork has been the most<br>rewarding work over any solo if it so I<br>get a lot of pleasure of working with<br>colleagues and interdisciplinary<br>interprofessional collaboration really<br>pays off so it pays to get outside of<br>your own little area and seek out others<br>who might share same goals but come up<br>from a different perspective and I've<br>really enjoyed the serendipitous<br>collaborations with people I've never<br>met before and we've just taken a punt<br>and got all of them so finally there's<br>other people I'd like to thank and that<br>is people I've published with many<br>people I've published a lot worth and<br>then there's people of just a few<br>publications but it's a really divisive<br>Darius group across many countries and<br>so thank you and the final thing is<br>we're thanks to the professional staff<br>colleagues here and indeed in Wellington<br>who gave me an advice and support a my<br>teaching and my board sharing and<br>achieving research airports and actually<br>also helped me be in the right place at<br>the right time so there's one final team<br>I want to mention that's my fishing team<br>and so when the saying goes that gone<br>fishing I really do mean that I have<br>gone fishing so there's been a series of<br>teams that warm comes together and we<br>don't keep minutes and I could talk a<br>great deal about those teams but bass<br>not and but it's a really important time<br>for me to not be doing anything other<br>than focusing on doing this so thank you<br>for the University Otago for organizing<br>this and thank you for coming<br>kyaa tenets at home counsel my name's<br>Paul Brunton I'm the pro vice-chancellor<br>of Health Sciences and I'm delighted to<br>be here tonight to see those give her an<br>overall prophecy little lecture these<br>are very special occasions for the<br>University and tonight was no exception<br>we learned a lot about Lois early days<br>and what she likes to do in her spare<br>time but we also learnt about a personal<br>journey in research and research that<br>has real meaning which I'm very very<br>keen on because it's research that<br>improves the health of patients and has<br>real impact and also story around the<br>translation of research into public<br>policy to improve the loss of New<br>Zealanders and I think that's fantastic<br>as well what Lois didn't tell you she<br>referred to it slightly at the end is<br>that in addition to all that she does<br>she's now the associate in academic in<br>the division of Health Sciences and that<br>role in itself is substantial so I don't<br>know how she finds the time to do all<br>the things that she does it's amazing<br>an amazing achievement so on behalf of<br>all of us I would like to thank Lois and<br>I think we should give her another round</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001;
