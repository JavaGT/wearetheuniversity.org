the<br>university with a high grade point<br>average is growing each year and we<br>produce outstanding graduates just like<br>you second we need to attract develop<br>and retain outstanding staff thus we are<br>doing is illustrated by the achievements<br>I described earlier many of our staff or<br>world leaders in their fields and you<br>will have been privileged to learn from<br>and work with them there is no<br>coincidence that in the qsr world<br>rankings of university subjects the<br>University<br>of Auckland came top in New Zealand and<br>37 of the 41 subjects ranked and in the<br>New

and families<br>many of whom are here I am sure a very<br>proud of you<br>you have concluded a significant journey<br>a journey of learning and I am<br>privileged and honored to address you on<br>this occasion your knowledge and<br>contribution to society is very much in<br>demand our world is facing unprecedented<br>challenges there is rapid change due to<br>digital and technological advancements<br>we face serious adverse effects from<br>climate change there are environmental<br>challenges from increased urbanization<br>and threats to regional communities<br>smaller communities are becoming even<br>smaller and larger communities are<br>getting larger aging population and<br>aging infrastructure are throttling the<br>economic viability of communities<br>regions and even countries the gaps are<br>getting bigger<br>between those who have and those who<br>don't<br>between the North and the South we are<br>concerned about the growing inequality<br>amongst us yet we could we are becoming<br>more tribal societal rules and<br>regulations are not in keeping with the<br>pace of change there is urgency for<br>action we know and understand this<br>urgency the youth are marching in the<br>streets cities and countries are making<br>declarations of emergencies tragically<br>we are moving too slowly knowing is not<br>enough knowledge is wasted if not put<br>into action you have been well prepared<br>at this fine institution you understand<br>the importance of discipline and focus<br>you have worked in teams and understand<br>the power of collaboration you have<br>solved problems and you have influenced<br>the University in its thinking for the<br>future you are now being unleashed into<br>society empowered with knowledge you are<br>connected more than others before you<br>the power of networked individuals with<br>passion Drive and determination is<br>immense but I do not want to give you<br>advice because I have three grown-up<br>daughters who are graduates of this<br>university and from experience I know<br>they don't like to be given advice so<br>instead I will share with you personal<br>insights and you may if you wish to<br>take something out of those now from<br>personal experience I started late<br>I waited not by choice but by fear the<br>fear because I assumed that I needed<br>permission before I acted that someone<br>would ask me no one did and no one will<br>and no one will ask you so the three<br>insights that I will speak as myself but<br>this could be advice for you firstly the<br>relationship that I have with myself I<br>am comfortable in Who I am I am<br>confident<br>but I make sure that I do not become<br>arrogant I apply good judgment and I do<br>not fear failure I am open to ideas and<br>I am NOT stubborn I am comfortable in<br>leadership and if there is a vacuum I<br>will fill it and while it may be<br>uncomfortable I need to be visible<br>because if I stain for something I need<br>to be outstanding and that is only then<br>that it will be noticed secondly how I<br>relate to others I readily interact with<br>people I create trust and certainty in a<br>volatile and uncertain environment I<br>respect positions of authority even when<br>I do not agree with the persons who<br>occupy those positions I avoid judging<br>others an attempt to be fair-minded<br>respecting opinions and differing views<br>I do not have expectations of others but<br>I realize that I am not that independent<br>thirdly the problems in challenges that<br>we face I see them as opportunities I am<br>highly motivated to strive and to excel<br>but I'm not a perfectionist and I do not<br>wish to emulate Steve Jobs or Bill Gates<br>I plain and understand structure but I<br>love flexibility the world is changing<br>what worked in the past may not work in<br>the future I understand<br>I share but most importantly I get<br>results I get things done so as I said<br>we have local and global challenges we<br>need leadership to drive the innovation<br>and to bring about changes we need<br>resilient solutions this is your<br>leadership moment we need you to provide<br>leadership and to take bold action the<br>knowledge that you have gained the<br>celebration that we here for will be<br>wasted if you do not take action you do<br>not need permission you do not need to<br>wait you can act now so I say to you go<br>forth and make a difference tackle what<br>seems to be impossible go beyond<br>creating safety for yourself and your<br>loved ones venture into the<br>uncomfortable<br>embrace change make the change be the<br>change be the solution be brave<br>and I wish you all well thank you ravine<br>thank you for a most insightful speech<br>this is a meeting of Council and<br>convocation of the University at which<br>the Pro Chancellor Cecilia Tarrant and I<br>will be awarding diplomas and conferring<br>degrees I invite the pro Chancellor to<br>award the diplomas and confer the<br>degrees in the first
