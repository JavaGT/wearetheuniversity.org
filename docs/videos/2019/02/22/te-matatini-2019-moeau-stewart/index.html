Now the couple are studying together at the University of Waikato, and competing together at Te Matatini.<br><br>They’re both 21 years old, and now performing with Tū Te Manawa Maurea. They’re helping each other to train before sharing their first Te Matatini together. Moeau (Rongowhakaata, Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāi Tūhoe) says when they got together they were in their early teens at different high schools and in different Kapa Haka groups. They had a rivalry on stage. But only on stage. Seven years later they are preparing for Te Matatini ki te Ao together. They both had their first performance together with Tū Te Manawa Maurea back in 2012 and since then have always been a part of the Tū te Manawa Maurea whānau.<br><br>They both come from Kapa Haka families. Moeau says his parents tell him that when he was very young, every time they put the TV on, if there was Haka he would sit there and watch it all day.<br><br>https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/success-stories/moeau-stewart-and-olinka-matete<br>facebook.com/MaoriandIndigenousStudies</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>you're funny<br>for those balance ft they like to do few<br>comments my heroine is a party row with<br>a lizard twist on to and it looks pretty</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
