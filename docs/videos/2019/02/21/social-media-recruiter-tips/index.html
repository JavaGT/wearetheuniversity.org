organisations share their top tips on social media.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>social media is extremely important when<br>you're in the recruitment process<br>particularly because some recruiters<br>will actually look you up online to see<br>what your online presence is like we<br>don't know the Accenture but it's<br>definitely something that you need to<br>take into consideration if you do have<br>like it most people personal social<br>media accounts that you don't want your<br>interviewer to see make sure that they<br>are set to private or that your handles<br>are different so use a different email<br>address for your personal and<br>professional social media accounts it's<br>also really important to Google yourself<br>if you can use someone else's laptop so<br>that your passwords aren't automatically<br>saved and just see what other people can<br>see when they look you up I think it's<br>really important to think of social<br>media as that first impression a number<br>of companies will be out there<br>researching on social media about<br>candidates so as important if you are<br>posting content that you are thinking of<br>it as my first impression and making<br>sure that you don't have any<br>questionable photos on social media that<br>your settings are set to private and<br>that you what you can do is actually<br>look on Google search on Google and see<br>what comes up from your personal brand<br>social media interesting one of the my<br>tips and social media is to one you need<br>to be on it because that's where your<br>important the potential employers are as<br>well but in terms of the do's and don'ts<br>do have social media pages so whether it<br>be Facebook or LinkedIn so we we do go<br>looking to see if you're on social media<br>but in terms of the don'ts Facebook page<br>make sure it's locked I don't want to be<br>able to see all your pictures and all<br>that kind of stuff and it's really<br>important because the image of who you<br>are are once you start working for<br>Deloitte it's it's Hoda loiters as well<br>so it's really important that we can't<br>see anything that we shouldn't see so my<br>recommendation is keep your pages locked<br>and so only your friends can see what's<br>on them do use the company social media<br>for research it's a really good way to<br>see what they're up to at the moment<br>their current direction and their<br>culture as well I would also say do<br>utilize the message<br>so if you want to clarify something<br>about the program or the role that<br>you're going for or the company's<br>culture do get in touch and that's why<br>we have our social media platforms but<br>in saying that don't be too casual<br>because the people who are managing<br>those accounts are at Maine freight I<br>manage this the discover Maine Freight<br>page so a few put your best foot forward<br>in those messaging areas I will take<br>notice or conversely if you may be a<br>little bit too casual I will also take<br>notice for that too so Linton is a great<br>tool as a recruiter I use it daily so<br>platform connecting professionals and<br>that's how you want to be portrayed so<br>my tips would be to complete your<br>profile as comprehensively as as<br>possible<br>it is pretty much an online version of<br>your CV so ensure again that you're<br>including all relevant educational<br>history work experiences any<br>achievements sporting interests as well<br>as again any voluntary or<br>extracurricular activities connecting<br>with like-minded people is also really<br>important so connecting with individuals<br>who have the same interests who work in<br>the same industry and also maybe<br>connecting or joining LinkedIn groups<br>these are a fantastic platform where<br>people will share relevant industry<br>trends so it's great way for you to stay<br>abreast of what's happening in your<br>industry so LinkedIn is a great tool to<br>use even at a graduate level<br>it's basically your online CV so there's<br>also sections where you can get people<br>to endorse your skills and you can ask<br>for references if you've completed an<br>internship add them in there as well and<br>just make sure that you don't abbreviate<br>any skills that you list on there<br>because recruiters sometimes will<br>actually search for a particular skill<br>and a location and if you've abbreviated<br>they won't be able to find<br>gee it's a great networking platform we<br>use it on a daily basis at fresh local<br>health care for searchers as well as<br>building our networks so it's important<br>to get a professional photo you don't<br>have to get a professional photography<br>photo but make sure it's professional in<br>the way that you look and your<br>surroundings we've definitely had some<br>interesting ones along the years ones<br>with Christmas trees or people's<br>personal pets that type of photo would<br>be seen so on our Facebook profile and<br>so more of that social network rather<br>than a professional networking site<br>other things that you can be getting<br>from LinkedIn as treated as a networking<br>platform so when you are meeting new<br>people out at events University at work<br>you can connect with them and keep that<br>connection person personal so sending<br>them rather than just a link invitation<br>you can actually tailor it and say look<br>I really enjoyed meeting with you at<br>this event or if you haven't met them<br>with them before maybe hey look I'm<br>really interested in connecting with you<br>and to get the most from LinkedIn I<br>think it's really important to be active<br>on there as much as you can and so try<br>and get on there at least once a day and<br>keep in contact with old connections<br>make new connections along the way and<br>it's really important to not kind of<br>spam your Linkedin with you know it to<br>be a replicate replication of your<br>Facebook and you want it to be it is a<br>professional network you want it to be<br>professional connections that you can<br>make and one of the things that I<br>personally do is I don't accept any<br>requests that a I don't know I'll be<br>aren't relevant to my role on my<br>industry and so I think that's a really<br>good thing to keep in mind with LinkedIn<br>the more you put into it the more you<br>get out of it like most things in life<br>and it really is limitless as to the<br>time you can spend on there and what you<br>can achieve from from doing that so grow<br>your network ask people who you have met<br>in real life to connect with you from<br>that you will have access to more<br>information and your feed<br>you'll probably see more useful content<br>or companies you hadn't considered<br>before in that industry that you want to<br>explore<br>you can join groups so ey has a LinkedIn<br>group for instance so you can keep up to<br>date with what's going on with us we'll<br>provide you with advice or access to<br>events so really get involved with that<br>side of things as well and finally I'd<br>advise that you contribute as much as<br>possible to that community because it is<br>a community people are there to learn<br>grow develop professionally and they're<br>not looking for you to be a silent<br>observer they want you to contribute to<br>the dialogue so get stuck in but be<br>professional<br>I think we're building your LinkedIn<br>profile it's really important when you<br>are filling out your profile to think of<br>it as a CV so keeping the format quite<br>similar to a CV making sure that you're<br>using all the keywords so the LinkedIn<br>search algorithm is based on keywords so<br>making sure that that's relevant to your<br>skills and your experience also if you<br>are liking content or posting content to<br>to keep it professional and to also<br>think of it as your first impression so<br>the important thing to remember with<br>LinkedIn is that employers will search<br>for you so even if you aren't employed<br>you can say graduate seeking opportunity<br>and that'll absolutely help you stand<br>out when they're doing searches make<br>sure that you get endorsements if you<br>are part of an organization or a society<br>on campus you can add them there as well<br>as well as well as charity organizations<br>and and any certifications that you have<br>in terms of getting the most out of<br>LinkedIn when you reach out to connect<br>with somebody seen the personal note so<br>I have people reached out to me all the<br>time due to the nature of my role at<br>Deloitte but if somebody can say hey I<br>met you at event last week or I heard<br>you speak or whatever so you know<br>sometimes you go to these events and<br>these because you know hundred people<br>via so and I'm terrible with names so<br>I'm good with faces so yes if you photos<br>on you think - in Page there helps but<br>you know reach out and say why you want<br>to make contact with me that actually<br>has so much more gravitas than just<br>sending a connection and I believe in<br>terms of business networking and it's a<br>great way to kind of build those<br>networks one of the things that we<br>really value at KPMG is how you and<br>present yourself and how you write<br>potentially blog posts or any posts on<br>LinkedIn and even if you the thought of<br>you know writing something that will be<br>then so public and it shows real<br>initiative from us and it shows that you<br>have understood the platform and you've<br>got an opinion on an important subject<br>that's been raised in the week and so<br>don't be afraid to put you know put a<br>blog out there don't be afraid to write<br>your opinion and as long as it obviously<br>isn't going to offend or upset anybody<br>again you get back what you<br>ten so always be mindful that the more<br>time you spend on there the more time<br>you invest the better your profile is<br>going to be on your network and you<br>might not know immediately how that will<br>pay off but in the future I can<br>guarantee that something will come<br>through from that whether it's a future<br>client or a recruiter who gets in touch<br>with you or an important contact where<br>you see an event that you want to go to<br>the more time you spend on there the<br>more things that are going to come your<br>way which is something I really like<br>about it I think as well it's something<br>that people adopt later on in life<br>perhaps people sealings him more as a<br>way to move careers or to find new<br>clients and generate new revenue streams<br>into their own work or organization so<br>if you get ahead now while you're still<br>studying at university that means you've<br>got a head start on your competition<br>ultimately so again talk to your Career<br>Service or talk to ey or other employers<br>about what you want to see from students<br>on LinkedIn and and really understand<br>why we use LinkedIn to access students<br>and learn more about them there's a<br>really nice part that you can put on<br>your profile where you can ask for<br>recommendations or endorsements from<br>people who've interacted with you so ask<br>a tutor or a lecturer they wouldn't mind<br>putting something on there or perhaps a<br>teammate from one of your projects or an<br>organization you volunteer with that can<br>be a real differentiator for us when<br>we're deciding who to interview for<br>example finally a word of warning it can<br>be more damaging to have a profile that<br>you don't update than it is to not have<br>one at all so if you have a profile<br>that's out-of-date or it's very stagnant<br>and stale what does that say to us as a<br>brand it doesn't show that you're very<br>engaged or perhaps proactive so I would<br>rather commit to it or don't commit to<br>it at all<br>so committing to it it doesn't have to<br>be a big investment it can be just going<br>on there once a week and doing a couple<br>of bits and bobs it doesn't have to be a<br>massive time commitment from you but<br>just keep it as fresh and up-to-date as<br>possible<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align:
