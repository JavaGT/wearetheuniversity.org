As the only daughter and youngest child of Te Arikinui Kiingi Tūheitia, she carries her birthright in the Kīngitanga with her when she performs and competes.<br><br>Ngawai (Waikato) is with Nga Pou o Taniwharau. After a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship to study for her BA, at 22 she is now doing her masters degree in Tikanga Māori. When she was in her second and third years at University of Waikato, Ngawai got a job teaching Kapa Haka. That was a way for her to play with her creativity in the medium. She was also involved with primary and secondary schools, so was constantly in Kapa Haka. Is there a day in her life when Kapa Haka isn’t present? “Not really. I walk around my house and I see a taiaha. I get into my car and my poi is on the seat. I go home to my parents house and my little nephew is there and he’s trying to do the Haka. So it is just everywhere. I’ve been brought up in it, I am it. A lot of people are Kapa Haka. It’s the embodiment of Māoritanga.”<br><br>https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/success-stories/nga-wai-hono-i-te-po-paki<br>facebook.com/MaoriandIndigenousStudies</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>stage tip for you<br>ekifano is number one being present<br>in the moment number two being yourself<br>and number three being unique to who you<br>are<br>because you ain't gonna see a pokemon<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
