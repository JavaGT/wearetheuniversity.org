It was in 1997 at the Hui Ahurei ā Tūhoe, the biannual tribal Kapa Haka and sports competition. I grew up to do the same Haka my mum did with me in her tummy.”<br><br>Sarah (Tuhoe, Ngāi Tai, Te Whakatohea) is a reserve with Ōpōtiki-Mai-Tawhiti. At 21, she is a Maori mentor and doing her masters degree at the University of Waikato.<br><br>After her very early introduction to the stage, she didn’t actually start doing Kapa Haka again until she was 12 and at intermediate school. “It was more of an identity thing. I had gone through Kōhanga Reo, and been fully immersed in te Reo Māori. Then I went to a mainstream school, and I lost a lot of my reo. Even though I was brought up on the marae, I still hadn’t kept it. I went to intermediate in Hamilton and I took one te Reo class, and the teacher insisted I do Kapa Haka. So I went, and I’ve never looked back. It’s a way for me to revitalize myself, my language and my culture.”<br><br>https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/success-stories/sarah-brown<br>facebook.com/MaoriandIndigenousStudies</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>the greatest thing about kopaka for me<br>as being able to return back home to if<br>I saw how back to a poor Sookie I've<br>learnt about my head footy my off<br>ah<br>and now my farm oh who doesn't go home<br>very often can't go back home and learn<br>about that suit<br>I love own people that and being a part<br>of the farm oh no so helpful help<br>good night</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
