Her one-and-a-half year old daughter is definitely the priority. “She’s also my drive to do all of that. It sounds a bit cliched but it’s true. Before, I had her everything was a struggle, I felt obliged to do things, but now it’s not a chore.”<br><br>The 23-year-old is performing with Ngā Tumanako and this is her third Te Matatini.<br><br>She was raised in a Haka family, and she has always lived Haka through uncles and aunties. “I’d jump in their cars to go to any noho I could. I’d be at every regionals; babies, high schools and adults. It was my world. I fell asleep to Haka, even though they were really loud. I looked up to anyone doing Haka. Now I see little kids singing the words to Mōteatea they learnt when they were six months old. In summer you’re practising all weekend, every weekend. You have your moments, when you’re over it and don’t want to go to practice, but then you go and it just makes you happy.”<br><br>https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/success-stories/roiana-pihama<br>facebook.com/MaoriandIndigenousStudies</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>come on looking at the camera is crazy<br>the cotton our mama - and I keep a<br>topper - why why ultimate attorney and<br>if you have a clingy baby like mine and<br>you work full time you study full-time<br>and you have to travel to all your<br>normal and I'm going to stand for you<br>this today and we're going to smash it</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
