BFecause my parents don’t have reo, it was their way of encouraging us to learn. And it is an easy way to pick up te Ao Māori, and the most traditional way as well. There has almost never been a time when it wasn’t part of my life; it is who I am. For a while in my high school years it wasn’t around, because I was busy being ‘cool’ and doing my own thing. Otherwise it’s been my bread and butter.”<br><br>There are two really strong childhood memories for Mahara. “My brothers had Kapa Haka videos, and they thrashed them over and over and over on the VHS. The other is a really vivid image in my mind of watching my aunties and uncles have a jam at the sports club my dad was involved with in Ōtautahi.”<br><br>https://www.waikato.ac.nz/study/success-stories/mahara-hepi<br>facebook.com/MaoriandIndigenousStudies</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>No transcript available</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
