font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>for my PhD I looked at social movements<br>in World of Warcraft studying at the<br>University of Auckland Business School<br>in information systems helped me to get<br>my job at the University of East Anglia<br>and using Auckland as a name globally<br>was very useful in looking for an<br>academic career when I started talking<br>and more details about the topic and the<br>researcher I'm going to do I also<br>started checking the ranking of the<br>University because it's a main factor<br>when you're choosing to do a PhD and the<br>university had a good ranking<br>that was one of the main reasons why I<br>chose to study here<br>the basic reason that I choose Open<br>University a business school is that I<br>would like to study with my supervisor<br>Bowser sharp because he's an expert in<br>agricultural economics he is a very<br>supportive supervisor and it's really<br>happy for me and very fortunate for me<br>to work with him all the lecturers are<br>really supportive so even if they're not<br>working directly with you<br>we have department gatherings so it<br>becomes more like an academic family<br>that's what essentially the marketing<br>department has become for me when I<br>first came you know I I'm an<br>international student and have no idea<br>about what the business school what the<br>department likes but I feel very<br>welcomed from the professors that<br>research fellows as well as a PhD<br>students I really love all the<br>facilities that's the business school<br>provided to the PhD students I also like<br>the Prisoner school building the ogg be<br>building because it's really beautiful<br>but when I came to Oakland I find it's<br>quite a diverse city when you're walking<br>on the street you can meet different<br>you may find different kinds of<br>restaurants and that's fantastic for me<br>I like the style for City very much<br>because I think I'm a outside person<br>we also have travel grants can have one<br>travel grant each year to go for a<br>conference if you have an accepted paper<br>and we also have the press account which<br>is an annual budget for research related<br>there are scholarships available and I<br>was fortunate enough to be awarded one<br>so the the scholarship gave me some<br>financial support and paid my university<br>fees which enabled me to work and study<br>in Auckland financially working in the<br>department has helped me up since I<br>started I was a graduate teaching<br>assistant for the marketing department<br>so what that role really entails is<br>helping tutor students helping mac<br>helping grade helping lecturers and any<br>other aspects that they might need so<br>that's really helped me financially in<br>terms of day-to-day finances ultimately<br>when you apply for jobs in academia they<br>want to see teaching history and student<br>evaluations so fortunately I have three<br>years worth of information to give my<br>employers when I was looking for a job<br>publication is key you push now to get<br>the job and I remember from the very<br>beginning when I started my PhD when he<br>started to ask me to start applying for<br>conferences like I had my first<br>companies after three months she's<br>always asking me to start writing papers<br>which is really good because now I have<br>the papers one under review and two<br>others working progress you publish a<br>paper you can get an award my<br>supervisors were very willing to help<br>making sure the quality of the paper was<br>high enough to be submitted to academic<br>journals ultimately when they were<br>published that was very useful and I<br>you</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem;
