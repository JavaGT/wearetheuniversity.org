University of Sheffield, UK.<br><br>The highly esteemed Professor Hughes was awarded a University of Otago William Evans Fellowship in 2018. <br><br>Professor Hughes' research examines the influence of health and developmental difficulties on the risk of criminality and criminalisation among young people and young adults, with a particular focus on experiences of neurodevelopmental disorders and traumatic brain injury.<br><br>Strong international evidence shows that neurodevelopmental disability, poor mental health, trauma, and experiences of child maltreatment all appear to increase the risk of exposure to criminal justice systems in adolescence.<br><br>Come along to find out more about the persuasive evidence that could influence approaches to reforms relating to criminalisation on the basis of health and developmental difficulties.</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>William evens fellow please the Nathan<br>Hughes nathan is a professorial research<br>fellow at the university of sheffield<br>his research examines the relationship<br>between childhood neurodevelopmental<br>impairment and engagement was the youth<br>justice system this has involved<br>examining levels of impairment among<br>youth justice populations utilizing<br>neuroscience and developmental sciences<br>to consider the mechanisms that increase<br>risk of offending and critical<br>reflection on the operations of the<br>youth justice system that might<br>discriminate against and therefore<br>criminalized disability Nathan's<br>interdisciplinarity as evidenced through<br>publications and journals related to<br>criminology social policy adolescent<br>health neuro psychology and<br>developmental science as well as a range<br>of practice focused journals his<br>publications include articles and<br>discipline leading journals such as<br>Lancet psychiatry and the Journal of<br>child psychiatry and psychology his lead<br>author of a commissioned article in The<br>Lancet Child and Adolescent Health will<br>be published later this year examining<br>global patterns of health determinants<br>of justice involvement for adolescence<br>the topic that Nathan will talk on today<br>his publications have also included a<br>series of reports and papers that have<br>achieved significant policy and practice<br>impact most notably nobody made the<br>connection a review of the prevalence of<br>neurodevelopmental disorders among young<br>people in custody this research has had<br>a significant impact in New Zealand<br>being attributed by Andrew Beecroft who<br>was the principal youth court justice<br>and is now the Children's Commissioner<br>as underpinning reform of youth court<br>processes<br>Nathan substantive impact on national<br>international policy debates is also<br>illustrated by an invitation through the<br>New Zealand Human Rights Commission to<br>address the United Nations conference of<br>state parties to the Convention on the<br>Rights of persons with disabilities at<br>the UN headquarters in New York and<br>being called to give oral evidence to<br>the UK parliamentary just a select<br>committee inquiry into young adults in<br>the criminal justice system and this<br>evidence is heavily cited in subsequent<br>and I'm going to beit's he has a<br>sustained record of research from key<br>academic research agencies as well as<br>income from multiple government<br>departments quasi government<br>organizations and leading charities in<br>the field of Social Policy and criminal<br>justice<br>a recent prestigious European Commission<br>Marie Curie a research fellowship<br>included two years based at School of<br>Government at the University of<br>Melbourne and the Center for Adolescent<br>Health and the Australian Centre for<br>child neuropsychology studies at the<br>Murdoch Children's Research Institute<br>and Nathan retains honor appointments at<br>both those institutions so welcome<br>Nathan thank you for coming to speak to<br>us today<br>okay fantastic<br>we'll go okay thanks pretty much for<br>coming everyone I'd just as a very brief<br>recap of that for people that just<br>joined in if the introduction so my my<br>background is in the social sciences my<br>particular interests around youth<br>justice in and criminal justice and most<br>recently my research has been about<br>trying to make sense of how in that in<br>that kind of criminal justice and youth<br>justice space we can learn from the<br>expertise of people like yourselves and<br>Health Sciences through food through the<br>neuro scientists who newer scientists so<br>try to think about how the emerging<br>understandings there can really help us<br>to improve real floors in our in our<br>practice in the in the you've justice<br>space and this paper that I'm going to<br>give today it's part of the series<br>that's been commissioned by The Lancet<br>Child and Adolescent Health as part of<br>well you might be aware of a growing<br>emphasis in that in The Lancet kind of<br>family of journals on Adolescent Health<br>which they've recognized recently as a<br>real gap in terms of sort of global<br>thinking about about health policy and<br>practice so it's part of a series as a<br>parallel paper to this one on health<br>following detention and mortality and<br>morbidity after experience of criminal<br>justice that's being led by colleagues<br>at the University of Melbourne I should<br>start by acknowledging the yeah the<br>impressive list of co-authors who helped<br>me draw this together and I'll say<br>something about some of their expertise<br>as we go yeah I also just want to say<br>before we start that this is a paper<br>that's about to be submitted so I'm<br>really really keen to hear the critiques<br>now rather than wait for this anonymous<br>peer review process to get them all so<br>pleased there will be some things that<br>I'll highlight some things that I would<br>really welcome your your critiques<br>however harsh and also I'm very keen<br>given my interest I'm very keen to<br>provoke some comments and reflections<br>from from you guys in terms of your own<br>expertise and in particular I'm going to<br>end with a few questions about the New<br>Zealand context that I'd really be keen<br>to hear from from your and so hopefully<br>questions at the end but also just<br>comments and reflections would be really<br>helpful to but I should say something<br>first I guess so yet so as as as we<br>probably all now know well adolescence<br>is a really key<br>dynamic phase of of maturation that's<br>shaped through interaction with the<br>social environment enabling the<br>acquisition of a whole range of kind of<br>complex cognitive social and emotional<br>abilities that we need to make this kind<br>of transition into into adulthood in<br>particular we increasingly know about<br>the the neurological development that's<br>taking place in this in this period so<br>rather than kind of prior assumptions<br>that everything was done by the kind of<br>early teenage years there's now much<br>more of an understanding that that we're<br>still developing we're still maturing<br>neurologically during this period and we<br>know that this development is<br>underpinned by the health and well-being<br>that we experience in in childhood and<br>adolescence and so the range of things<br>I'm going to talk about today<br>childhood neurodevelopmental disability<br>mental health difficulties experience of<br>adversity experiences of trauma are<br>already key to their to the development<br>that's taking place at this at this<br>point we also know that the adolescence<br>is a really critical period in terms of<br>the development of delinquency and<br>antisocial behavior across across the<br>life course and the onset of delinquency<br>typically occurs in in the adolescence<br>year in the adolescence years when<br>there's a peak rate in you know in early<br>adulthood essentially I many of you be<br>familiar with this is the the kind of<br>ubiquitous aid crime curve which is seen<br>as being a kind of consistent finding<br>across various national contexts this<br>particular example comes from Australia<br>I couldn't find the New Zealand ones as<br>close as I could get but shows you a<br>peak in both violent and nonviolent<br>offending between the ages of about 15<br>and 21 and then a dramatic can sort of<br>drop-off so we know that there's a<br>significant proportion a sacred number<br>of young people who are becoming<br>involved in the criminal justice system<br>we also know that importantly one of the<br>best predictors for kind of adult<br>criminality is an early onset of that of<br>that criminality yeah so the greater the<br>risk of more persistent the serious<br>criminal careers the earlier that<br>currently offending starts we also know<br>that involvement in the criminal justice<br>system is not necessarily offending<br>itself but the involvement in criminal<br>justice system in this period can have<br>real consequences for<br>those developmental milestones and that<br>maturation that we're talking about<br>particularly around access to education<br>and employment opportunities so<br>longitudinal studies have shown that<br>this atypical Adolescent Health and<br>development that's characterized by<br>difficulties in cognitive or emotional<br>or neuro psychological functioning have<br>significant influences on those sort of<br>trends that we were looking at and the<br>christchurch study in the Dean Dunedin<br>study have obviously been kind of<br>crucial in our understandings of these<br>trajectories however I would argue that<br>our understandings of this have been<br>kind of fractured across across<br>disciplines and in my own discipline in<br>criminology we only really understand<br>these kind of complex health and<br>developmental and difficulties<br>impairments challenges as being kind of<br>specific and discrete risk factors so we<br>plug them into our research as though<br>they were individual things that we can<br>isolate as opposed to understanding the<br>kind of complexity of experience that<br>comes with that for for a young person<br>and as I say what's more it's actually<br>you know spread across across<br>disciplines so our aim with this with<br>this body of work is to draw together<br>these disparate bodies of evidence and<br>to do so to address these kind of key<br>aims so firstly to identify the health<br>and the related social experiences that<br>are impacting upon adolescent<br>development that then serve as<br>determinants of criminal justice<br>involvement in that in that part of the<br>life course and to think about how<br>aspects of social disadvantage interacts<br>with those health and developmental<br>difficulties so that they place<br>particular sections of our populations<br>at risk of of criminal justice<br>involvement and then of course to<br>reflect on what that might might mean<br>for how we might think about you know<br>better legal policy and practice<br>responses the additional aim here being<br>you know because it's for the lancet<br>they were to think globally so to think<br>about the extent to which the evidence<br>that we have is is kind of consistent<br>across various national contexts<br>including in this thinking about the<br>emerging evidence that we might have in<br>low and middle income countries and all<br>kind of reflect on that a few times so<br>something very brief on on our methods<br>but I won't bore you with it but we we<br>sought to illustrate the extent of<br>evidence across the widest possible<br>range of topics and therefore<br>to be kind of inclusive of research from<br>various global regions as have said and<br>so our search strategy reflects that and<br>his attempt to be inclusive rather than<br>to be too rigid in our in our criteria<br>in our searches so we've used the means<br>that we think will get us to the<br>evidence that we might not otherwise<br>identify particularly in those those 11<br>million contexts so no restrictions on<br>your publication no restrictions on the<br>less restrictions on the kind of quality<br>of evidence that we might or might do or<br>but but given that and given the<br>inconsistency in evidence the way that<br>we present this is a propositional<br>approach so which ought not to be too<br>kind of you know deterministic and what<br>we're saying and it we get to get your<br>reflections on that okay so I'm going to<br>present to you the kind of three kind of<br>key propositions that our paper argues<br>the first one is the is the main one<br>we'll take the kind of bulk of the time<br>and then a couple of others that to<br>reflect on so the first proposition of<br>course is that adolescent health and<br>developmental difficulties serve as<br>important determinants of criminal<br>justice involvement and there are a<br>disparate range of influences on<br>adolescent development that we will<br>argue increases the risk of involvement<br>in the criminal justice system and so<br>the following slides illustrate the<br>range of influences from<br>neurodevelopmental disabilities to<br>traumatic brain injury mental health<br>difficulties childhood experiences of<br>trauma and adversity and the different<br>and try and make sense of how these kind<br>of influenced their trajectories so it<br>was start with the as the introduction<br>said the area of research that I'm<br>calling the most most personally engaged<br>with the nuts around childhood<br>neurodevelopmental disability and people<br>were probably familiar with this term<br>but it's inclusive of a wide range of<br>conditions beyond those listed here<br>which manifests early in life and it<br>characterized by a kind of varied<br>combination of functional impairments<br>and recent research including some of<br>our own as has established the<br>disproportionate prevalence of a range<br>of these forms of disability among<br>justice-involved young people for<br>example young people with a learning or<br>an intellectual disability appear to be<br>over-represented throughout throughout<br>the system so compared to general youth<br>population estimates of about two to<br>four<br>% it would seem that studies of<br>prevalence amongst beef justice<br>populations range from 7 to 15% with<br>custodial populations being higher<br>including the kind of to UK studies that<br>bookend this at 2070 to 32% and what's<br>more to surveys of over 18,000 young<br>people in there in the UK would suggest<br>that conduct disorder is is about six<br>times more likely among young people<br>with with learning disability similarly<br>if we look at ADHD then rates of 3 to 7%<br>are commonly kind of identified in the<br>general population of young people but<br>meta-analysis that reviewed some 25<br>studies from across various national<br>contexts suggest the rate of 11.7% among<br>incarcerated young people similarly<br>longitudinal studies suggest that<br>childhood ADHD predicts later on social<br>behavior which again supported by<br>meta-analysis that sees ADHD is a<br>substantially important predictor<br>there's also a whole body of research<br>around the the particular symptoms of<br>ADHD so impulsivity hyperactivity and<br>the influence that they have the<br>strongest oshi asians we've obviously<br>with certain forms of of criminal<br>behavior you know being indirectly<br>mediated through the kind of coping<br>notions of conduct disorder and illicit<br>drug use in relationships with peers and<br>so on and one that I know has high<br>profile in in New Zealand at the moment<br>is the fetal alcohol spectrum disorder<br>and again similarly the the<br>relationships between particular<br>symptoms and expressions of fetal<br>alcohol spectrum disorder and offending<br>are very very clear so again<br>hyperactivity but also deficits in<br>cognition and executive functioning the<br>quite clear links between those<br>challenges and engaging in certain forms<br>and there's really insufficient evidence<br>I guess in this space to make very firm<br>conclusions but a systematic review we<br>carried out suggest that there are four<br>studies in Canada that have diagnosed<br>FASD in around 11 to 23 percent of young<br>people in custody and a more recent<br>study in Western Australia puts the rate<br>even higher at 36 percent but it's no<br>weather as you can see there that<br>there's a real distinction between the<br>rates that all those studies<br>identify in the Aboriginal populations<br>of Canada and Australia compared to the<br>non Aboriginal populations so authors<br>these studies point out it's very<br>difficult to kind of separate the<br>experience of FASD from those wider<br>experiences of intergenerational<br>disadvantage and poor access to<br>healthcare and the complexities that we<br>know these populations here are facing<br>probably probably the most prevalent<br>form of development of difficulty among<br>young people in the criminal system is<br>traumatic brain injury and as you'll<br>know that can result in a whole range of<br>kind of functional difficulties that<br>that can impact upon young person's<br>behavior including again deficits in<br>cognition and communication in impulse<br>control in empathy in understanding the<br>emotions of other people and again these<br>are routinely repeatedly identified as<br>risk factors for for offending and our<br>recent systematic review suggests that<br>somewhere between 32 and 50 percent of<br>young people in custody typically report<br>experience of a traumatic brain injury<br>that resulted in a significant loss of<br>consciousness compared to a broad range<br>but somewhere between 5 and 24 percent<br>and interestingly as the seriousness of<br>the brain injury increases then that<br>however again it's the first time I'll<br>say this and I find myself saying this<br>frequently all the studies that we have<br>here undertaken in Australia in the UK<br>and in the US and although we have<br>strong evidence of high rates of TBI in<br>low and middle income countries we don't<br>have much evidence of the the<br>populations that were interested<br>here's a real kind of gap in our in our<br>understanding and interesting this I<br>promise I've always making this point<br>it's the the the point of contention<br>here what we know that those<br>neurodevelopmental disabilities often<br>emerge early in childhood and there they<br>are current developmental clearly with<br>traumatic brain injury it can occur<br>later in life and is often seen to be<br>linked to the sorts of behaviors that<br>I'm concerned with here but there are<br>some really good population studies that<br>have suggested increased propensity to<br>criminality after that after that brain<br>injury in particular a study of a whole<br>population study in Sweden that that<br>compares those who've experienced brain<br>injury with unaffected siblings and<br>still shows that those who've had a<br>brain injury twice as likely to to go on<br>to offend you know it taking account of<br>all of the kind of social factors that<br>so similarly if we look at literature<br>around around mental health there's an<br>extensive evidence of the high<br>prevalence of mental health difficulties<br>among this population in these contexts<br>and rates among justice-involved young<br>people appear consistently considerably<br>higher again than those general<br>population estimates that you can see so<br>for example rates of serious<br>psychiatric disorder among young people<br>in criminal justice custodial<br>institutions in the u.s. range from some<br>sixty to seventy percent for young men<br>and sixty to eighty percent for young<br>women compared to as you can see kind of<br>seven to twelve percent in there in<br>comparable general population studies<br>and this trend is reaffirmed by that's a<br>meta-analysis of about twenty five<br>studies that I mentioned that some<br>including studies in the u.s. in the UK<br>and Australia in Russia the Netherlands<br>Denmark and Spain which in total<br>incorporates something like sixteen<br>thousand seven hundred fifty adolescents<br>and suggest that around 11 percent of<br>young men 29 percent of young women have<br>a major depressive and disorder or<br>diagnosable kind of depressive disorder<br>at a similar rate of around ten percent<br>in in Russia so really kind of<br>consistent evidence around<br>these rates and similarly we couldn't<br>see in some in studies the comorbidity<br>of depression and and externalizing<br>disorders so it's a really interesting<br>set of narratives here as to whether<br>it's the depression that leads to the<br>conduct problems or conduct problems<br>that lead to depression but they've<br>become the comorbidity in the mix that's<br>that's going on there is very clear and<br>and the consistent message was the the<br>kind of causal pathways differ in<br>different studies that consistent<br>message seems to be that when you get<br>the two there's an amplification of<br>those those kind of bend the contact<br>problems that there's something here<br>about the entirety and depression that's<br>fueling the the challenge as similarly<br>well the association the evidence of the<br>association between mental health<br>difficulties and criminal justice<br>involvement in high-income countries as<br>you would expect is is relatively strong<br>again we've got limited evidence in low<br>and middle income countries so there's<br>some evidence we've got high rates of<br>psychiatric disorders reported in<br>Nigeria compared to you know much sample<br>similarly in in Kenya but but there's<br>actually systematic reviews led by some<br>of my my colleagues that identify<br>longitudinal studies related to anxiety<br>in depression in China Chile Columbia<br>and Puerto Rico<br>none of which show this anything more<br>than a weak association between<br>depression and an offending in those<br>populations so there's some complexity<br>here in terms of what's what's going on<br>in these in these different contexts for<br>us to reflect on to move to move on to a<br>slightly different topic there's also<br>growing evidence of the potential<br>negative impact of experiences of<br>childhood adversity on long-term<br>neurological development and recent<br>research posits that the prolonged<br>exposure to toxic stress can disrupt<br>this kind of brain development and the<br>kind of functioning that that goes with<br>it might reduce the ability to regulate<br>impulses might intensify their kind of<br>physiologic responses to stress and<br>therefore ultimately increase the<br>likelihood that one will kind of engage<br>in<br>we might call common maladaptive<br>behaviors so aggression and delinquency<br>included and in the US and the UK I<br>don't know I don't know about here again<br>I'm interested in your reflections the<br>dominant framework really for<br>understanding the impact of childhood<br>adversity now on future life outcomes as<br>emerged from this adverse childhood<br>experiences framework as a few people<br>nodding so include some familiarity with<br>it and these are studies born out of the<br>u.s. initially but as I say now now<br>routinely carried out in the UK that<br>gives this framework of 10 of 10 aces as<br>you can see listed there and a person's<br>score as they're measured by Counting<br>how many of these aces they've they've<br>experienced now I've got some fairly<br>strong reservations about how this<br>framework is has developed and how it's<br>being used and applied in ways that<br>actually the people as always the people<br>that develop the framework didn't<br>develop it in order for it to be used to<br>do but nonetheless there's a body of<br>research which is emerged from this<br>which is in our in the UK at least have<br>been really helpful in getting a range<br>of professionals to really think about<br>how adversity is impacting on the<br>populations that they're that they're<br>working with and so here are some some<br>examples of what these studies have<br>shown again always in these kind of<br>high-income country contexts so there's<br>a really well-known study of over 64<br>thousand young people involved in the<br>criminal justice in in the u.s. that<br>suggests that somewhere around 96<br>percent have had an experience of<br>adversity and as you can see 27 percent<br>of males and 40 percent 5 5 percent of<br>females have experienced five or more<br>races<br>and as an aside this is one of the<br>things that that the one do reservations<br>have about this we've got this to this<br>magic number of four or five that now<br>everybody's kind of concerned with and<br>all the criteria is is set to and if<br>you've experienced 3 I'm sorry that's<br>not adversity enough regardless of how<br>regardless of the kind of qualitative<br>experience and adversity we it's become<br>a kind of numbers game but nonetheless<br>you know this is fairly stark evidence<br>that that this is important there's a<br>whole group of studies that are drawn on<br>this and Florida juvenile justice system<br>in particular which the relevance here<br>which has shown a really increased<br>likelihood once within the system of<br>being maintained in that<br>so you have been continuing to offend<br>being incarcerated but also earlier<br>engagement which as I said earlier is<br>one of the things that predicts<br>longer-term engagement and also more<br>serious more violent offenses coming<br>from these populations and again some<br>really complex mechanisms for us to<br>think about but but there's clearly<br>something here about how the system is<br>engaging in and you know drawing in<br>people with with with challenging<br>backgrounds so as I say the the Aces<br>framework is really importantly kind of<br>quantified this strong relationship but<br>it doesn't really pinpoint the<br>mechanisms whereby this childhood<br>diversity leads to to delinquency and<br>furthermore what's the population<br>violence in 21 countries reporting at<br>least one ace in childhood is similar in<br>high and high middle and low and low<br>middle income countries<br>we've still got really limited evidence<br>on the impact of adversity and on<br>criminal behavior in those in context<br>outside of the high-income countries of<br>those various forms of adversity that<br>I've kind of listed on that previous<br>slide the one that gets the most<br>attention is experiences of child<br>maltreatment in so experiences of abuse<br>and in particular there's a seminal<br>longitudinal study in the u.s. that<br>found that those with official records<br>of maltreatment were more likely than<br>those without such records to be<br>subsequently arrested in adolescence I<br>mean and in adulthood and this is backed<br>up by a meta-analysis of 33 perspective<br>longitudinal studies that have the total<br>population of 23 24 thousand young<br>people which again show these real<br>strong correlations between child<br>maltreatment and being picked up by the<br>adolescent criminal justice system yeah<br>I know it won't surprise you I'm sure to<br>know that that final point there that<br>the reported rates of sexual abuse seem<br>to be particularly high among young<br>women in detention as in real link<br>between these experiences of<br>maltreatment in childhood for women and<br>okay so I can't say this already but<br>yeah we have strong evidence and strong<br>focus in the US and the UK and some<br>other places but very very little<br>evidence emerging from other country<br>context there are some where we have the<br>same pattern is is apparent so where<br>when maltreatment correlates strongly<br>with with behavioural difficulties but<br>again that same systematic review that I<br>talked about before highlights these<br>this we called null association between<br>charm maltreatment or the<br>witnessing of domestic violence and<br>subsequent and and social behavior in<br>those in those settings so there's only<br>there were only three studies that were<br>identified there two in South Africa one<br>in Brazil and none none share anything<br>more than a weak Association so one of<br>the one of the mechanisms that by which<br>childhood obesity is understood to<br>influence criminality is through the<br>experiences of trauma and this obviously<br>includes some of those those tops<br>adversity have talked about before but<br>this K also literature around<br>experiences of war of community violence<br>of displacement of serious accidents and<br>injuries of loss of home and so on a<br>whole range of different other traumatic<br>events and at a year again you can see<br>the stats in in front of you but but<br>again mainly drawn from the US we can<br>see the comparison and estimates of<br>somewhere between a quarter and a half<br>having experienced some sort of<br>potentially it should release a<br>traumatic event and you know rates as<br>high as 90 percent in the youth custody<br>populations and when we look at it<br>particularly diagnosis of post-traumatic<br>stress disorder again that you know the<br>disparity becomes massive in these in<br>these US studies so some you know as<br>high as eighty seven percent for males<br>and 50% for females being able to get to<br>be diagnosed in some sense as having<br>post-traumatic stress disorder compared<br>to this you know relatively small<br>general population right and this is the<br>this evidence is mainly drawn from the<br>US but it's repeated in several<br>countries so we've got similar studies<br>in Australia in Russia and Japan and all<br>but to echo myself again you know you've<br>you've got you've got the the the the<br>the narrative here that we still have<br>very limited evidence in other countries<br>even where we might expect the<br>experiences of traumatic events are much<br>higher so again big gaps in the research<br>literature so so that's off that's the<br>first proposition obviously the main<br>thing that we kind of hang this this<br>argument on and I'll return to some of<br>those kind of some of the conclusions<br>and reflections on it later but I leave<br>you I'll leave you just to kind of<br>ponder what this might mean for what we<br>might want our youth justice systems to<br>be doing you know our all right if these<br>are the populations that we see so<br>highly prevalent in that in the earth<br>justice system you know what is that<br>you've just a system doing and who you<br>know how is it engaging these young<br>people and and is it is it sort of<br>providing the pathway that we might need<br>so the second the second point that we<br>argue is that experiences of societal<br>marginalization of structural<br>disadvantage of a whole range of forms<br>of inequality influence how these health<br>and developmental determinants of<br>experience and therefore exacerbate in<br>doing so exacerbate the risk of being<br>associated with a criminal justice<br>system so what's our first proposition<br>states that health and developmental<br>difficulties have an important influence<br>on trajectories into the criminal<br>justice system the review also suggests<br>that this risk is greatly amplified<br>where these difficulties occur in the<br>presence of one or more of a variety of<br>social and economic disadvantages and in<br>turn that the socio-economic advantage<br>is clearly a very protective factor<br>again against criminal justice<br>involvement even in the context of a<br>whole range of other sorts of<br>difficulties so for example there is<br>very strong evidence from multiple<br>countries that adolescent mental health<br>is highly influenced by various types of<br>social disadvantage and marginalization<br>including levels of youth unemployment<br>experience of discrimination<br>particularly in relation to racism<br>neighborhood deprivation levels of<br>community support and experiences of<br>social cohesion and a systematic review<br>including stays in the US and Canada in<br>Norway shows depressed mood<br>anxiety to be 2.5 times more prevalent<br>among young people with low<br>socioeconomic status than those in<br>higher compensation economic status and<br>the evidence would suggest that exposure<br>to disadvantage has a cumulative effect<br>on the conversational psychosocial<br>development that we're talking about<br>here and therefore on the behavior that<br>comes with that with both the kind of<br>biological and the social mechanisms by<br>which that might happen being kind of<br>increasingly well understood similarly<br>well we know that child maltreatment can<br>clearly occur in all sections of society<br>it would appear that they're more likely<br>in families experiencing other types of<br>adversity and how so stress and this<br>overlap again makes it kind of difficult<br>to unpick the different sorts of<br>relationships and the unique<br>contributions going on here so for<br>example in the world report of violence<br>and health evidence from countries as<br>kind of geographically and culturally<br>diverse and distinct as Bangladesh and<br>China and Colombia Egypt India Italy<br>Mexico Palestine the Philippines South<br>Africa Sweden and the US all show the<br>potential for child maltreatment is it<br>is increased when families are affected<br>by low education low income domestic<br>violence all their communities are<br>experiencing a high concentration of<br>poverty and an unemployment a further<br>kind of social factor that we know to be<br>really important in trajectories towards<br>crime is disengagement from education<br>and again if we look at that in relation<br>to some of the factors that the health<br>and developmental factors we've talked<br>about there clearly some some key<br>overlaps and interactions here so<br>disengagement from education is<br>particular risk for young people with<br>who have unmet needs in relation to<br>specific learning difficulties and<br>functional difficulties so young people<br>with kind of oral language deficits and<br>that might be related to<br>neurodevelopmental disabilities can<br>experience real kind of cumulative<br>challenges in engaging in education as<br>they move through through the system and<br>problem behavior has been shown to serve<br>as a kind of means to disguise these<br>difficulties as a way in which the<br>challenge in engaging in the classroom<br>really comes out and unless the<br>underlying cause is understood then the<br>young person quickly<br>gathers the label of being kind of<br>behaviorally difficult and that becomes<br>a trajectory on which there their needs<br>are understood so the underlying<br>disability can often be what we get<br>would be overshadowed or ignored by<br>after that we also know that social<br>inequality can heighten the risk of<br>neurodevelopmental disabilities I've<br>said already about FASD being<br>particularly high in Aboriginal<br>communities and Iraq will be linked to<br>kind of border experiences of extreme<br>disadvantage and discrimination and<br>oppression and we also know that social<br>factors affect the experience and<br>progression of neurodevelopmental<br>disabilities across across the globe so<br>socioeconomic status clearly affects<br>access to specialist support it affects<br>the likelihood of you engaging with with<br>them with services it affects access to<br>services so and without that kind of<br>sufficient support in the context of<br>developmental difficulties we know that<br>these kind of secondary difficulties can<br>emerge so as I say unless these needs<br>recognize and support it then<br>cumulatively that developmental<br>difficulty becomes a real challenge for<br>a young person as they move into<br>adolescence so in short then the same<br>the same kind of health and<br>developmental difficulty that I kind of<br>outlined in in the first proposition a<br>clearly not experience the same way by<br>all the young people by all the young<br>people that have those difficulties that<br>they might be exacerbated by social<br>disadvantage and that there's an<br>interaction between these between these<br>things and again I invite your<br>reflections on this you know what does<br>this mean for how we might think about<br>the systems that I'm concerned with<br>today<br>so if I last proposition then this one<br>focuses on the the kind of inner<br>workings of the criminal justice system<br>itself and here we argue that systemic<br>biases in criminal justice practices<br>increase the risk of criminalization for<br>young people with specific health and<br>developmental difficulties so you know<br>you'll all be aware but exposure to a<br>criminal justice system is clearly not<br>simply a product of an individual's<br>criminal behavior we know that it also<br>reflects the practices of the<br>in itself both in determining whether a<br>determining which behaviors are<br>criminalized but also in targeting<br>resources across populations to identify<br>and to process individuals that are<br>involved in those those sorts of<br>behaviors and and it's well established<br>that the unequal application of policing<br>and other criminal justice resources<br>leads to a very varied likelihood of<br>criminalization of different different<br>groups or individuals so if we're going<br>to try and understand the the health and<br>developmental determinants of criminal<br>justice system involvement we need to<br>understand the mechanisms by which<br>certain kind of health-related<br>characteristics might increase these<br>these risks have been engaged in they're<br>in the criminal justice system so here<br>we're here we're concerned with a range<br>of practices we argue that insufficient<br>professional training and a lack of<br>appropriate assessment and screening<br>tools limit the identification in<br>support of young people with these<br>mental health or developmental<br>difficulties at various stages of the<br>criminal justice system and this is<br>particularly the case where these needs<br>may be hidden where they might not be<br>severe but might be kind of mild and<br>moderate where they come slightly under<br>there under the radar or of course where<br>young people have developed some very<br>effective strategies to hide their their<br>difficulties particularly in contexts<br>like this when they're in front of<br>police or people of authority yes sir so<br>generally people that are engaged in the<br>systems that I'm kind of working within<br>and not are not well trained to<br>understand but to understand these kind<br>of health and developmental needs and<br>how to spot them however police officers<br>can often play a key kind of gatekeeper<br>role in terms of whether a person well<br>by determining whether person who has a<br>mentor has a mental have difficulty or<br>not and then deciding whether the<br>subsequent response should be referral<br>to a mental health service or into the<br>criminal justice systems there's a real<br>kind of key decision-making point here<br>about which way things might might go<br>but as I say police officers aren't<br>routinely trate provided with training<br>and<br>there might be some good examples here<br>where I know you have a kind of a youth<br>focus police officers who perhaps and<br>you know counters what I'm arguing but<br>but generally in certain in the UK we<br>don't have good operational guidelines<br>regarding how to identify how to respond<br>to to mental health needs or<br>developmental needs furthermore we know<br>that there is restricted access to<br>specialist mental health services in<br>many contexts and that can mean that a<br>criminal justice response might be seen<br>as the only way in which there will be<br>any kind of intervention for this child<br>so it's seen as being a kind of<br>necessary evil in terms of getting did<br>someone to see this child so the<br>criminalization is with the best<br>intentions of supporting a child but<br>yeah as we were argues not really in<br>their long-term interests we there's<br>also research in various kind of<br>Anglophile criminal justice systems that<br>have highlighted disabling processes<br>that increase the risk of<br>criminalization of young people with<br>newer developmental difficulties for<br>whom cognitive functioning may not<br>correspond to the levels expected by<br>those those systems or expected even by<br>the age of criminal responsibility in<br>those systems or therefore to match the<br>kind of inherent assumptions that there<br>might be in those systems about how<br>people can engage and the capacity to<br>engage in a legal process we know that<br>language of communication difficulties<br>can pose barriers to to engaging in<br>forensic interviews that are typically<br>used by the police and joined kind of<br>cross-examination in court so that<br>that's a challenge for any young person<br>but you add into the mix any kind of<br>cognitive or communication difficulty<br>the kind of the repeat questioning and<br>the attempt to kind of almost trip<br>people up in terms of how they're<br>telling their story clearly poses real<br>real challenges and if unrecognized as<br>being related to communication or<br>executive functional cognition or<br>whatever it might be then these<br>difficulties appear to be danger being<br>interpreted as being attitudinal<br>behavioural and that doesn't play out<br>well in front of a in front of the judge<br>so it really could be impacting upon the<br>decision making it you know different at<br>different points in that system we also<br>know that specialist support to address<br>health and developmental needs<br>seems rarely to be available within<br>criminal justice systems so<br>interventions<br>typically fail to a degree adequately<br>address these underlying difficulties<br>that might be linked to the to the<br>behavior and so they serve in that sense<br>to kind of maintain that behavior if<br>they don't if they don't address it and<br>the young person's engagement in the<br>system so it increases the risk of<br>recidivism increases you've been back<br>within that system which what you get a<br>higher dosage of the same intervention<br>that's not working and it fails again<br>and so on and so on until we find the<br>young person in their kind of final<br>resting place in this system which is<br>the custodial environment that I've<br>described as being you know highly<br>highly prevalent you're and of course<br>without you know without that kind of<br>specialist intervention you might<br>actually be exacerbating some of those<br>underlying difficulties so it's kind of<br>there's the reach Walmart I think that's<br>going on through these systems as the<br>you know the the impact on mental health<br>so so yeah our final sale reflections<br>there for you I guess about the needs of<br>our criminal justice professionals the<br>needs of our criminal justice systems<br>and how you is you know health as a<br>health research and practice community<br>might be in a position to to inform and<br>to to develop here so just you know just<br>a few conclusions and then you know open<br>it up to you for for comment so that we<br>feel that again I'm interested in<br>reflections here but we feel that the<br>evidence that we have here if if<br>sometimes geographically inconsistent<br>suggests the existence existence of<br>important health and developmental<br>determinants of criminal justice<br>involvement in our lessons and whether<br>these are working as a direct or an<br>indirect and cause or influence of<br>conduct problems and delinquency or a<br>contributory factor to its continuation<br>and its escalation the the range of<br>factors I've presented to you all appear<br>to increase the risk of exposure to to<br>criminal justice systems so this risk<br>then as I said is amplified by<br>experiences of social modulation<br>marginalization inequality and by<br>criminal justice processes that seem to<br>discriminate and keep these young people<br>within the within the system more<br>readily so that means that significant<br>numbers of young people and therefore<br>left vulnerable to criminal justice<br>involvement due to this kind of toxic<br>combination of health difficulties and<br>and social disadvantage so what does<br>that suggest we should be doing clearly<br>there's a this weight of evidence calls<br>into question the extent to which<br>adolescent health and developmental<br>difficulties are being appropriately<br>understood recognized and responded to<br>as early warning signs for possible kind<br>of future criminal justice involvement<br>implies a need for early identification<br>of these needs through routine<br>assessment of young people including we<br>would argue when behavioral problems are<br>first observed when a child at risk of<br>exclusion or disengagement from from<br>school and on the first contact with the<br>criminal justice system and then<br>likewise it applies the monitoring of<br>behavior when these kind of you know<br>health and developmental difficulties<br>are first observed and this suggests you<br>know some challenges for our systems it<br>suggests stronger information sharing it<br>suggests easier routes of referral<br>between our health systems with<br>community mental health services with<br>family support services and with schools<br>and it supports calls for<br>community-based preventative services<br>that target all young people who are who<br>are at risk now of course it's easy to<br>argue for any intervention it's more<br>difficult to provide it without kind of<br>real real investment and tickling the UK<br>but we're in a context of disinvestment<br>from all of these sorts of services that<br>we're talking about but there is some<br>there are some trailing lights here<br>we've seen examples in in various<br>countries of what we call models of<br>justice reinvestment and the these these<br>models which actually had their biggest<br>impact in the more right-wing states<br>argue that we should seek to reduce both<br>the the level of crime and the costs<br>associated with with current kind of<br>criminal justice processes particularly<br>incarceration through the redirection of<br>funds out of the criminal justice system<br>and into other are the sorts of services<br>and to today these sorts of initiatives<br>have been primarily focused on areas<br>where there are high levels of crime but<br>there's no reason why we can't kind of<br>take that same model and apply it to the<br>context of health and and development of<br>course I've also clearly argued for<br>reform of criminal justice practices and<br>this evidence about the extent of Health<br>and developmental<br>Cortese among those exposed to criminal<br>justice system suggests that these<br>systems are the primary service provider<br>for many young people with complex needs<br>and for many it's a prison that's<br>providing the care for these kind of<br>complex difficulties and that to me<br>feels an entirely inappropriate the lack<br>of kind of specialist provision also<br>calls into question whether the rights<br>of these young people being fully upheld<br>and recognizing children engaged in<br>criminal justice systems as children<br>first and offenders second the UN<br>Convention on the Rights of the Child<br>makes it very clear that responses to<br>youth crime have to be governed by<br>principles of welfare and also to a<br>responsiveness to a child's individual<br>needs and circumstances and it would<br>appear to me that we're really failing<br>to do that we can again we can think<br>about how how we how we might affect<br>change in systems and in one way is to<br>be thinking about the principles of<br>therapeutic justice and we were arguing<br>arguing that this offers us an approach<br>that embodies the the rights and whereby<br>the kind of primary aim of a criminal<br>justice system and any kind of<br>intervention with a young person is to<br>address and quote here the main the main<br>factors the the roots of what may lead<br>the individual to come into contact with<br>the law and these may be the sort of<br>factors I've been describing or they may<br>be economic they may be social or more<br>likely a complex combination with the<br>argument being we it's the needs of the<br>young person we need to be concerned<br>with not their deeds it's not they not<br>the behavior itself so it shifts the<br>discourse therapeutic justice shifts our<br>discourse away from criminality towards<br>kind of vulnerability towards the kind<br>of needs that are apparent when a young<br>person is engaging in these sorts of<br>behaviors and just lastly an awareness<br>of the processes and practices leading<br>to the kind of potential criminalization<br>that have described we argue gives<br>sufficient impetus for generic reform so<br>we don't need to be reliant on effective<br>assessments of the needs of the young<br>people coming before a court if we<br>assume that these these stats are<br>accurate that there are high proportions<br>of young people coming in front of<br>courts that have these developmental<br>needs why are we not just changing all<br>of our practices<br>they assume that as opposed to awaiting<br>an assessment a professional assessment<br>of diet a diagnosis that says we should<br>change our practices for this particular<br>young person and we would argue that and<br>these sorts of generic reforms will<br>actually serve the needs of a whole<br>range of of young people whether they're<br>they can get to a clinical diagnosis or<br>not so that's we've done I did just want<br>to end by saying so I am really<br>interested in your critiques and he<br>won't go through this in detail but I'm<br>particularly concerned about some of the<br>holes in the in the data particularly<br>around the the inconsistent Geographic<br>evidence and what that means<br>particularly for the implications that<br>we're describing what what should we be<br>arguing for in a global stage here and<br>as opposed to this slightly high-income<br>country reflections that I feel like<br>I've just had there yeah whether there<br>were any kind of particular particular<br>gaps that from your experience you'd<br>think screaming out to you in terms of<br>the the evidence base that we need to<br>present to the health and justice<br>communities but as promised I you know<br>and with some day genuine questions for<br>you about about the New Zealand context<br>I wonder because from all the studies of<br>draw line you will live and you will<br>have noticed that New Zealand doesn't<br>get mentioned an awful lot in terms of<br>the research there is the longitudinal<br>studies that you are clearly leading the<br>world on the the studies in the youth<br>justice population perhaps less so so I<br>do wonder what what you is a you know<br>it's a health research and clinical<br>community know about the health and<br>developmental profiles of young people<br>in their New Zealand youth justice<br>systems<br>I wonder how robust the assessment<br>processes the data sharing that I've<br>just been arguing for plays out in your<br>in your context and not similarly how<br>would your yeah how would your use<br>justice system respond to these needs if<br>it was identifying them and yeah how<br>would it respond better what what might<br>the role of view as a community be to<br>address and the problems that I've<br>thought I've raised so a few tough<br>questions for you but yeah or</p></main><footer
