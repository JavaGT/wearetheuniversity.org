welcome<br>everyone my name is Harlan hain and I am<br>the vice chancellor here at the<br>University of Otago and it gives me<br>great pleasure to welcome you to this<br>inaugural professorial lecture for<br>professor Sarah young now these lectures<br>are really a time for celebration for us<br>at the University of Otago and I am so<br>happy to see so many people here to help<br>us celebrate this incredibly important<br>milestone in Sarah's career on behalf of<br>the university I would like to extend a<br>particularly warm welcome to the members<br>of Sarah's family who have joined us<br>this evening her husband Chris her<br>children Emily and James her parents<br>Lorraine and Mike her sister Katie and<br>Chris's parents Margaret and Hamish how<br>lucky Sarah is to have so many members<br>of her Fano here tonight to celebrate<br>with her and your presence is yet<br>another example of why this evening is<br>so incredibly important so to all of you<br>know my head am i welcome now as those<br>of you who attend these lectures<br>regularly have heard me say quite often<br>the path to professor here at Otago is<br>not an easy one in order to reach the<br>rank of Professor the applicant must<br>demonstrate excellence in teaching in<br>research and in service to the<br>university to the community and to their<br>profession now as you will learn very<br>shortly this evening Sarah is an<br>outstanding teacher she is popular with<br>both undergraduates and post<br>graduate research students she also has<br>an outstanding research career and<br>tonight you will learn more about her<br>groundbreaking research but in addition<br>to teaching and research sarah has also<br>provided exceptional service to her<br>department to the University and to the<br>wider research community I would like to<br>particularly highlight Sarah's<br>leadership here at Otago Sarah's not<br>only the current h OD of the Department<br>of Pathology but she has also served as<br>the acting head of the department of<br>preventive and social medicine she is<br>currently the deputy dean of the Dunedin<br>School of Medicine and is an active<br>member of multiple boards working<br>parties governance groups and advisory<br>panels now some of you might say that<br>Sarah's heavy administration load is<br>simply a sign that she is a sucker for<br>punishment but the truth of the matter<br>is that Sarah is invited to hold these<br>positions because her peers and her<br>colleagues and I all recognized that she<br>is a very strategic thinker she is firm<br>but compassionate and she goes beyond<br>the weeds of the issue at hand to see<br>the big picture so I for one am<br>extremely grateful that Sarah is part of<br>our university community and I strongly<br>value her research and teaching but I<br>also very much value her leadership so<br>Sarah on behalf of the University of<br>Otago it gives me great pleasure to<br>congratulate you on a very well earned<br>promotion to Professor I will now call<br>on the Dean of the Dunedin School of<br>Medicine professor Barry Taylor to tell<br>us just a bit more about Sarah's journey<br>to Professor noreda tena koutou tena<br>koutou tena tato katoa<br>you are everybody it is indeed my<br>pleasure to introduce Sara and say a bit<br>more about how she got to where she's<br>got I've known have quite a long time<br>but in fact the journey starts way back<br>and it starts actually for her being<br>born in Invercargill where her parents<br>were on placement for Teachers College I<br>understand welcome to be here and after<br>which there was a move to twice or for a<br>short period and then 30 years and why<br>Metis so that meant that she went to<br>high school in Timaru girls and then<br>moved to the University of Otago wish<br>you did a BSC with honors graduating in<br>1996 and then moving straight on to a<br>PhD so four years later so almost<br>exactly in the prescribed time she<br>graduated with a PhD in the 2000 she<br>then left the country for the UK and had<br>two years as a research fellow at the<br>Imperial cancer research labs in London<br>and then at the Cancer Research UK which<br>is in Leeds and after which she was<br>recruited back to Dunedin she came back<br>as a research fellow and then moved<br>fairly quickly to senior research fellow<br>and then came into the pathology<br>department where I guess I had since<br>then I've had in most contact with ASUS<br>any Electra that is in 2010 and so she<br>rapidly progressed within the pathology<br>department making associate professor<br>three years later and a year after that<br>took on the head of department role in<br>2014 so I've had a lot to do with her<br>and that was about the time that I was<br>appointed as Dean and so in 2017 I was<br>with a lot of support from my colleagues<br>asked her to take on the deputy dean<br>role which she has been very ably taken<br>and has been extremely helpful in<br>running the school so this year<br>professor so it's and I totally endorse<br>Harlan's comments about<br>service not just to the department but<br>to the school and to the University<br>broadly she's well known to be probably<br>our most engaged senior academic in<br>terms of her involvement with the rest<br>of the university<br>perhaps I just saw Tom into her<br>involvement with the community<br>she is community focused she is head of<br>the board of trustees for the school<br>that her children attend she's been<br>involved in swim club and and so there's<br>a lot of activity in her local<br>environment northeast Valley in<br>particular I wish she's well known and<br>participates a lot in community<br>activities not just University<br>activities so in the research area she's<br>published greater than 41 peer-reviewed<br>papers brought in 11 millions worth of<br>New Zealand dollars in where she's<br>either the PI or Co P I of the project<br>and in involvement and the yeah a total<br>of 18 million dollars worth of research<br>income that has been bought into the<br>university she's an immunologist and for<br>you<br>well Tinoco Takata Acura everyone and<br>thank you so much I'm really grateful<br>for your attending tonight and listening<br>to my journey through to where I've<br>achieved as we said earlier so it has<br>been alluded to I started my school<br>career and a little school of 30 kids<br>and black mount no one will know who<br>that is because it's 45 minutes from any<br>town it's halfway between two at Aparri<br>in tiana and in those days my dad was<br>principal the year and in those days I<br>think there was three kids my age at<br>school and it was a it's a great school<br>environment you all had to pitch in<br>together the thirteen-year-old boys took<br>turns driving the school bus down to the<br>local farm on a Friday afternoon to fill<br>it up with diesel and so quite an<br>unusual school in Korea and then we said<br>and we dared got a job and twice all so<br>twice at the time of the dams project it<br>was actually the biggest primary school<br>in the South Island over a thousand<br>children so I went from this tiny little<br>school to this massive school and then<br>carried on to I Metis where I went to do<br>my intermediate why Metis high school<br>and then went on to Timaru Gil's high<br>school and I and here's a picture of me<br>not long after I started school and I<br>think you can probably glean from there<br>that I a career in fashion probably<br>wasn't on the cards during my schooling<br>career we learned about lots of things<br>of course but these are some of the<br>mottos of the schools at the school that<br>I went to and when you're preparing a<br>lecture like this you've become quite<br>reflective and you think about what are<br>the influences that you've had over your<br>career and when I look at of course<br>black mat was in the middle of the<br>takitimu Mountains and so climbing up<br>the steps of the mountain of learning<br>you know a learning a lifelong learner<br>I'm thinking caring achieving and you<br>know Cynthia purchased our cysts<br>knowledge is power and all of those are<br>still pertinent today<br>you know and relevant now when I was at<br>Tamra girls high school I was influenced<br>I did a number of different subjects I<br>didn't just do science and I didn't just<br>do humanities I did subjects that I<br>really loved and I did subjects that I<br>loved primarily because I had fantastic<br>teachers and it was those teachers that<br>I really connected with gave me a<br>passion for those particular subjects so<br>I did German and English but a biology<br>not so much physics and sorry for those<br>physicists in the audience um and this<br>was my first of a research project<br>it was bleak and it should have really<br>put me off for the rest of my life this<br>is the way nono Lagoon and halfway<br>between tomorrow and amritsar near why<br>Matty and we had these transit lines and<br>plant on those transit lines and the<br>cold and so I must have enjoyed it<br>because I continued on biology was one<br>of my favorite subjects and so school<br>was fantastic experience like I said<br>tried a whole lot of different subjects<br>had some fantastic teachers I did lots<br>of extracurricular activities<br>so I played lots of sport I did debating<br>and I went on a FES to Germany so I was<br>I think quite a well-rounded individual<br>when I came to University and this is my<br>university prospectus that was handed<br>out to me it when I was at high school<br>wasn't very big effect I should have<br>brought it along there's only about sort<br>of 30 pages and in those days these were<br>the only subjects that are available for<br>first-year students quite different from<br>today and we didn't have really<br>prescribed courses and so I did a<br>mixture of course as I did some biology<br>botany and ecology I did some German<br>because I love German I took a paper in<br>anthropology because I thought well that<br>sounds interesting we've never got to do<br>that at school and so not really what<br>you would I would have ever been able to<br>do if had I come<br>to university today because I probably<br>would have been shunted into more of a<br>science or a humanities type degree I<br>went to st. Margaret's College and this<br>is one of the fantastic things about the<br>University of Otago we are a true<br>residential University we have these<br>amazing colleges I didn't know what<br>college to apply for but I applied for<br>sent Margaret's because the master<br>happened to come and visit tomorrow<br>girls high school and I thought well<br>that sounds quite good and so that was<br>really why I made the choice to go there<br>and I was amazing experience met some<br>really lifelong friends there as most<br>people would experience in a hall of<br>residence at that time in 1991 or why<br>started in 92 was the year that they<br>just introduced fees so the government<br>in October the year before I started<br>University announced that they were<br>going to charge all the students fees<br>and of course we had to start paying for<br>university and we weren't prepared for<br>it<br>so my first person and there was lots of<br>student protests at the time you can<br>read more about that in the history of<br>the University of Otago the first person<br>that I met at the University of Otago<br>sitting up the back here was John price<br>and John had to sign me up for a student<br>loan he was a very pleasant man but very<br>serious and I remember sitting there<br>thinking I think I should be taking this<br>a lot more serious than I am as I<br>signing the forms and then I did what<br>all good University students did at the<br>time we've got this lump sum payment<br>into our bank accounts and we went<br>straight downtown and bought a stereo<br>and in some books from the investor<br>bookshop and of course that necessitated<br>me thinking about well maybe I shouldn't<br>be spending my money on stereos and I<br>might have to earn some money in a<br>different way so I actually got a couple<br>of jobs including this one at Pizza Hut<br>and I worked a few nights a week handing<br>out pizzas and welcoming people hello<br>welcome to Pizza Hut would you like the<br>smoking on the non-smoking section and<br>so I worked all the way through and my<br>undergraduate degree<br>which you know you had to be pretty<br>organized to get through and then it was<br>really i still talk a lot of papers I<br>took papers that just really interested<br>me and if I'd really thought about it a<br>bit more and thought about actually I<br>should be doing fewer papers and trying<br>to focus on my grades but no I took sort<br>of ten papers in a year or something<br>like that because they all I couldn't<br>pick I couldn't decide between one or<br>the other and but it was at the end of<br>my third year when I did a summer<br>student shape I was lucky enough to get<br>funded a summer student trip to work and<br>glean buckins laboratory and that's when<br>I really knew that I loved immunology<br>that I really had a passion for it and<br>Buck was a fantastic mentor great guy<br>you know really had a passion for the<br>subject and still de passion in each of<br>his students for the subject we had a<br>great camaraderie to give her a great<br>lab and it was just a really amazing<br>environment and I also at the same time<br>met Margaret beard who many of you all<br>know I'm just going to rearrange some<br>things here so I met Margaret beard at<br>the same time because although buck was<br>my supervisor of my honours project that<br>I went on to do I actually had to go to<br>Margaret's led to do another experiment<br>this great thing called a cytokine Eliza<br>which nowadays even oh he's doing that<br>so this was the title of my in the cover<br>of my honors dissertation and I was<br>reading it a couple of weeks ago and I<br>felt sorry for the honors students that<br>I've supervised because it was 22 pages<br>long with about five or six results<br>graphs in and now we expect them you<br>know much more you know sort of 6070<br>pages worth of research out of it so I<br>enjoyed my experience so much and I<br>obviously did reasonably well<br>academically that I was able to get a<br>university PhD scholarship and go<br>straight in to study a PhD and of course<br>it was about the immune system so I'm<br>going to start<br>introducing the immune system a little<br>bit more now so I'm using this slide for<br>two reasons one because it's a really<br>nice way of describing how the immune<br>system works but also it was a slide<br>that Glenn buckin used to use all the<br>time as lectures so this is if you think<br>about the immune system think about the<br>immune system sort of being a car so<br>it's designed to keep us bodies safe to<br>protect us from invaders to protect us<br>from those things that could cause more<br>better to your mortality and us okay so<br>it's really designed to recognize<br>foreign bodies and in particular those<br>infectious agents such as viruses<br>bacteria parasites like worms and<br>protect us from it so make an immune<br>response against those things and allow<br>us to continue to be healthy but it's<br>also can be designed against some other<br>some other things that occur inside our<br>bodies such as cancer and then if it<br>goes but hey why it can cause autoimmune<br>disease and I'll get onto that a bit<br>later in the talk so my PhD was really<br>focused around manipulating the immune<br>response for infectious disease and in<br>fact my whole career I've focused on how<br>we can manipulate the immune response to<br>take treat disease so for my PhD it was<br>all about vaccines and vaccines of<br>course again another slide that Glenn<br>liked to use and weapons of mass<br>protection you know these are and I<br>could show you this graph for pretty<br>much any vaccine for infectious disease<br>you know when vaccines were introduced<br>the incidence of disease and the<br>population went down when vaccines<br>aren't used so well weren't used in<br>potentially the right way or people<br>decide that they don't believe in<br>vaccines or they don't work so well then<br>we can start to see epidemics arising in<br>the population again so the vaccine that<br>I worked on was actually the vaccine a<br>vaccine for tuberculosis in tuberculosis<br>as a disease that causes well about a<br>third of the population is infected<br>in the world causes a couple of million<br>deaths a year in New Zealand it's not<br>such a problem we have about four or<br>five hundred cases a year<br>and that's we used to have a lot more<br>when we didn't pasteurized milk of<br>course but it is a problem in<br>agriculture so one of the areas that<br>we're working and was trying to see if<br>we could enhance the vaccine for TB to<br>use not just for potentially for humans<br>but also in an agricultural sector where<br>we had a deer industry in a cattle<br>industry where they were very<br>susceptible to disease and obviously<br>that's one of our major export<br>industries so the things that we did<br>were to manipulate this vaccine so this<br>vaccine is just in a what we called an<br>attenuated bacteria so it's a bacteria<br>that's had some of its virulence factors<br>removed so it's just slowly grows inside<br>and we added an immune hormone to it and<br>we did this in collaboration with a<br>group at have it Harvard Medical School<br>and I was fortunate enough to spend some<br>of my PhD over the year working with<br>that group and I remember going to visit<br>them and here we had just managed to get<br>a flow cytometer so it's a piece of<br>equipment to measure some immune cells<br>and we'd also just recently purchased a<br>sequencer DNA sequencer for a million<br>dollars and then I went to Harvard and I<br>walked into a room and they had ten<br>sequences and then I walked into another<br>room and they had about 15 flights<br>automatize and I was just<br>mind blown like it was it was agile I'll<br>never forget that the scale of what they<br>could do over there so one of the things<br>that we showed in this particular part<br>of research was not just that this<br>recombinant all this enhanced vaccine<br>could could activate the immune system<br>but it could also could work in<br>conditions where your normal immune<br>system could be suppressed so this was<br>an example where we've given some<br>treatment and this is an animal model so<br>we've given some treatment to actually<br>suppress the normal immune response and<br>the the current vaccine BCG couldn't<br>become that couldn't make a protective<br>response but our vaccine could so that<br>was sort of one of the key findings from<br>my PhD I was really fortunate to<br>undertake this PhD not just with green<br>Birkin and Margaret but also in the<br>Department of Microbiology and<br>immunology and we had this fantastic<br>camaraderie and theater in that time we<br>had some amazing postgraduate students<br>we had a really good social time as well<br>as doing a lot of research and it really<br>you wanted to be at work all the time<br>you wanted because it was so funny<br>you're learning new things you are<br>having a good time and we also every day<br>I had morning tea it was kind of a<br>tradition at the time 10:30 you down<br>tools and you went upstairs and you had<br>morning tea all together on the tea and<br>the tea room and the people that I used<br>to sit with it was a little group a<br>little cohort and in particular sandy<br>Smith here who was our head of<br>department or became our head of<br>department and her a knee Buchanan who<br>worked in the and Cass prep and and they<br>taught me a lot of things not<br>necessarily about immunology but they<br>imparted a lot of information about<br>everything else their opinions about<br>life about what was going on at the<br>University about what was going on in<br>the wider context what was important<br>medically you name it we had a great<br>time and I and and I'm putting these I'm<br>putting a picture of her Amy and Sandy<br>up here because of course again they're<br>no longer with us and I just want them<br>to be remembered because they were<br>fantastic members of that department at<br>the time and there's not as not just me<br>there'll be hundreds of people that will<br>remember them very fondly for the come<br>but not for the contribution they made<br>not just to work but also socially so<br>eventually as I graduated and here's me<br>walking across the stage shaking and he<br>gives hand<br>and this is what we talk about these<br>graduate attributes at the University of<br>Otago<br>and these are the sorts of graduate<br>attributes we expect our graduates to<br>have and and and when I was thinking<br>about what did a PhD what doing an<br>honours degree and then a PhD teach me<br>what did it really enhance and my skill<br>set and I know that I'm a lifelong<br>learner I love information I love<br>learning about things I love learning<br>about things not just about immunology<br>about lots of different things you have<br>to be able to persevere when you're<br>doing research because it's always you<br>know four steps forward three steps back<br>two steps back three steps forward so<br>you've got to have tenacity you've got<br>to be resourceful you've got to know<br>where to find information where to find<br>information with different people<br>flexible you know know that if<br>something's not working you've got to<br>change tack you've got to do a different<br>things and of course be organized Exeter<br>working teams we have good communication<br>and as supper day or they are a motto of<br>the University we've got a dear to be<br>wise you've got to be bold you've got to<br>take steps to try and push through so I<br>know that I had the most amazing<br>opportunity here to set me up for a<br>career in research all of these things<br>are required to be a good researcher so<br>as I said before the immune system is<br>really primarily designed to protect us<br>against foreign invaders but what<br>happens if something unusual arises<br>within our body such as cancer so when I<br>finished my PhD I went to the UK and I<br>worked at Imperial Cancer Research Fund<br>looking at how we could use vaccines<br>against cancer and some of you will be<br>aware of the current treatments for<br>cancer cancer unfortunately is now the<br>number one killer in New Zealand and so<br>most of you will have experienced<br>someone I love the person that you know<br>that has had cancer and we've we've<br>historically used these sorts of<br>treatments for cancer so surgery and<br>chemotherapy may be radiation therapy<br>they work really well there's still<br>really good treatments for most cancers<br>but there are some other new types of<br>therapies on the horizon that have<br>become more prevalent recently and one<br>of them<br>one strategy is to manipulate your<br>immune system to protect it and protect<br>against cancers so there's different<br>ways you can manipulate your immune<br>system to target cancers you can<br>nonspecifically activate some<br>inflammation and that sort of kills off<br>some cancer cells without sort of<br>meaning to you can use vaccination<br>strategies you can take some immune<br>cells activate them and put them back in<br>to a patient or you would have heard<br>some of you about the more recent drugs<br>that are available these antibody based<br>therapies so I'm going to talk you<br>through some of the research that we've<br>been doing you probably think that this<br>whole immune therapy with cancers is a<br>new thing it's not it's been around for<br>over a hundred years and I always like<br>to put this picture up because this is<br>poorly Alec who's a German<br>microbiologist<br>sort of cell biologist at the time and<br>you know more than a hundred years ago<br>he proposed that the immune system could<br>protect against tumors and that was made<br>for from a variety of different<br>observations he saw for example that<br>patients that had TB had had a less<br>incidence of cancer so there was all<br>sorts of things that lead to that I also<br>like the picture of his office because<br>it always makes me feel better because I<br>think mine's not quite as messy as<br>they're obviously no internet or<br>electronic research resources so in my<br>first postdoc I used the same strategy<br>that we had used for that vaccine for<br>tuberculosis but in this case used it to<br>treat bladder cancer so in the seventies<br>PM clinicians started using BCG is a<br>therapy for bladder cancer so basically<br>they inserted of bacteria into the end<br>of the bladder they leave that bacteria<br>for a few hours and it induces a lot of<br>inflammation at the site and helps kill<br>off tumor cells so it's still being used<br>today and I<br>working and leads and leads as an area<br>fantastic city but as an area where<br>there was a high incidence of bladder<br>cancer because of all the mill workers<br>so people using dyes you know they you<br>know when that's in one of the<br>predisposing factors for environmental<br>factors that influence the development<br>of bladder cancer so we were using a<br>related SPECT Iria but bacteria related<br>to the BCG the TB vaccine and we showed<br>that if we added some immune stimulants<br>we could protect a hundred percent of<br>the animals against developing this<br>tumor it was really nonspecific it<br>induced a big inflammation but it also<br>subsequently induced some specific<br>immunity so that was one of our key<br>publications our key findings at the<br>time aisle 15 was quite a new cytokine<br>and<br>2000 so one knows about it now so<br>remember I said earlier I showed this<br>picture about how your immune system is<br>designed to protect us against foreign<br>invaders so for cancer we have to look<br>at how we can harness that immune system<br>to specifically treat cancer to provide<br>a very specific response because we want<br>to have a good memory we want to harness<br>the immune system against cancer in a<br>way that it will remember and if the<br>cancer comes back the immune system will<br>just kick into gear again and remove the<br>tumor before it becomes an issue and we<br>want it to be a universal therapy so it<br>can be used in a wide population so what<br>is it about cancer thing that we can<br>manipulate in order to trick our immune<br>system to thinking it's a foreign<br>invader so some of you will be aware<br>that there's some mutational changes<br>that happen when you develop cancer we<br>get DNA damage and other things that<br>allow these cells to grow uncontrollably<br>there's some changes that happen inside<br>these cells a whole variety of different<br>changes including the way that we the<br>in system targets these cells so<br>normally the immune system would come<br>along the cells would ignore these cells<br>but these cells these tumor cells look<br>different and that's what we can try and<br>harness the immune system to recognize<br>so they're like sort of red flags to the<br>immune system or to put it another way<br>if this is a normal cell we have these<br>peptides these small targets on the<br>surface that basically on a on a healthy<br>cell say tell the own mean system to<br>ignore them as you start to get some<br>mutations in that cell and they start to<br>become precancerous you might see some<br>changes until finally they become a<br>cancerous cell and they change enough<br>that it's like a red flag like a real<br>target a foreign signal to the immune<br>system okay so one of the other projects<br>I did at cancer research UK was looking<br>at how we could try and find these<br>specific signals and tumors that could<br>activate specifically the immune<br>response so was this something about the<br>tumor that we could identify that could<br>specifically target those immune cells<br>and so of course this was sort of in the<br>early 2000s we don't have that didn't<br>have the technology like we do today but<br>our strategy was to make cells die so we<br>got some patient samples and would kill<br>them in the laboratory and would get<br>little parts of the tumor and feed those<br>to immune cells to try and train the<br>immune system to recognize those<br>particular unique parts of the tumor and<br>I worked with a great professor called<br>Alan Meltzer he's now in London hitting<br>up a big lab at the Royal Marsden<br>Hospital one of the main cancer<br>hospitals and he was also one of my<br>referees I think for when I applied for<br>a promotion so<br>that's been good yeah so while we're<br>over there you know it's a great time we<br>had a great experience great lot of<br>funding to do all sorts of things but we<br>had a few and you know influences that<br>made us a bit homesick right so we had<br>clean buckin and his family visited us<br>and ended a sabbatical and leads with us<br>for a few months and we had a great time<br>there and we really must you know our<br>friends and fort of brought home to us<br>how we miss our friends and family we<br>also came home for a holiday in the<br>middle of that tune back to New Zealand<br>and we looked at all the beautiful<br>scenery and we thought oh why aren't we<br>living here and Chris of course missed<br>the farm and being able to get out and<br>about in the wilderness and so we were<br>really lucky enough to get a fellowship<br>to come back to New Zealand and work<br>again in microbiology again with BCG so<br>so back to the infectious disease and<br>trying to look at ways we could overcome<br>environmental bacteria so some of those<br>bacteria that are very similar to TB in<br>this case but can really influence the<br>way the vaccine works because we know<br>that if you get vaccinated as a child<br>with BCG you develop lifelong protection<br>if you get a vaccinated as an adult you<br>don't and it's and part of that is<br>because of all the related bacteria you<br>drink in the water and things that that<br>can influence that so we did some work<br>to show how we could potentially<br>overcome this with looking at different<br>strains of bacteria and also using the<br>vaccinia anchor virus and the vaccine to<br>try and overcome that we also started to<br>look at some contract work that we did<br>with companies so Fonterra for example<br>at the time electro farmer your big<br>dairy company here in New Zealand were<br>really interested in value-added<br>products and foods and could they<br>stimulate the immune system and so you<br>know a little bit like I was saying<br>earlier in my career when I was at high<br>school you know I just do things<br>trust me you know it's not necessarily a<br>linear path from this point to that<br>point in your career and but we got into<br>looking at milk products and shellfish<br>products and in setup so this is<br>initially with Glen buckin and and<br>Michelle McConnell set up how we could<br>you know some systems to be able to<br>analyze some different milk products<br>from that have been processed in<br>different rays to see if they could<br>enhance the immune response or modify<br>the immune response so if you've got<br>someone who's having an inflammatory<br>response you might want to give them a<br>drink that can dampen that down or in<br>the case of allergy we did some some<br>work showing that if we if you give<br>infants milk solids early you actually<br>reduce the chances of developing allergy<br>to those two milk and of course now this<br>has becoming the norm that you know you<br>actually want to give those peanuts and<br>milk products and that very early in<br>life rather than ignore them you know<br>leave them out for a year first we also<br>being in a vector and a microbiology<br>department started to look at the role<br>of bacteria and how that could you know<br>gut bacteria could influence<br>microbiology and we work with Gerald<br>tannic and Michelle as well to look into<br>this and we're I'm still looking at this<br>today because and of course it's become<br>very trendy now to look at gut bacteria<br>and how they influence the immune system<br>but we know that we have a really high<br>incidence of autoimmune disease and new<br>zealand effect the further you get away<br>from their equator<br>the higher the incidence of autoimmune<br>disease and we know that bacterial<br>components play a role in initiating<br>that response so in the case of<br>autoimmune disease it's your immune<br>cells are sitting around they start to<br>recognize your own healthy cells as<br>being abnormal and start reacting<br>against it and making a memory response<br>against it so it gets potentially<br>progressively worse over time<br>we know and we've done some research<br>recently showing that patients that have<br>a propensity to develop autoimmune<br>disease actually respond abnormally to<br>some of these get gut bacteria and we<br>think can't clear the bacteria and<br>result in sort of a chronic inflammation<br>so that's we're currently doing all also<br>around this time I started working with<br>Vernon ward in Vernon's of our ala gist<br>I'm sure he's probably here and Vernon<br>was started it was working with Margaret<br>looking at these spiral shells so these<br>virus-like particles so virus-like<br>particles are used for different<br>vaccines for things like hepatitis virus<br>and human papilloma virus and they were<br>researching on whether it could be used<br>for things like influenza virus as a<br>friend platform for infectious disease<br>and these are really useful tools the<br>virus-like particles because we can<br>manipulate them in a way to add extra<br>immune stimulating agents to them so we<br>can add antibodies to target these<br>virus-like particles into certain cells<br>we can put proteins on them or peptides<br>from cancers or other infectious agents<br>we can deliver carbohydrates and<br>different drugs with them so they're a<br>really great way to manipulate the<br>immune response and in trip the immune<br>response into thinking it's being<br>infected with a virus without it being<br>infected but with a virus and so around<br>about this time I moved over to the<br>Department of Pathology I got a<br>permanent job over the year that was<br>really lucky to get a senior lecturer<br>ship and ian had just taken over as head<br>of department and i'd had you know i've<br>been aided over to the pathology<br>department a lot when margaret used to<br>work the end that's where I first went<br>to do my eliza's and I also was the<br>lucky recipient recipient of a child who<br>kissed fellowship from the Health<br>Research Council so that around about<br>the same time funded a large chunk of<br>research I also<br>two pathologists at the time that were<br>quite influential on me<br>Barbara hislop so people were a member<br>Barbara she was a fantastic supporter of<br>women and science and fantastic to catch<br>up I'm in fact I still caught up with<br>her right up until she passed away a<br>couple of years ago and Linda Holloway<br>and Linda became a real mentor for me<br>around this time and still is to this<br>day and great person for advice and and<br>sounding board very sensible person and<br>every day in pathology we've got a<br>beautiful building if you want to come<br>in and have a look it's a nice amazing<br>building once you get inside and we walk<br>I don't mean that it's beautiful from<br>the outside as well but inside people<br>don't realize how lovely it is with the<br>stairwell and there and and every day as<br>we go up the stairs we see this observe<br>remember Campea and this is a nice thing<br>to think about when you're doing<br>research because it's exactly what<br>you've got to do you've got to observe<br>changes<br>remember those changes can pair them<br>with other and also around about that<br>time I met some Chris Jackson so I own<br>collar just here you know in a sad way<br>because their family member had<br>developed cancer but great from a<br>research point of view because he was<br>really passionate about colorectal<br>cancer in particular and we've got the<br>highest incidence unfortunately in the<br>world of colorectal cancer in New<br>Zealand and Targo Southland has the<br>highest incidence in New Zealand it's a<br>really important disease for us in New<br>Zealand we have it's one of the number<br>one killers from cancer and New Zealand<br>more than a hundred New Zealanders die<br>every month from this disease so we<br>started developing cancer vaccines and<br>therapies for colorectal cancer and<br>we're still doing this and so this is<br>where we're using the<br>virus-like particle that i talked about<br>before so the shell of a virus<br>this time tagging on those peptides and<br>proteins that are specific to colorectal<br>cancer and testing them and a model to<br>see whether they can protect against<br>development of cancer and here you can<br>see that if we this is an animal model<br>if we if we give no treatment they<br>succumbed to cancer fairly quickly if we<br>give our treatment with just a single<br>peptide a single target from the<br>colorectal cancer we get a level of<br>protection if we give multiple targets<br>we can protect all of those animals and<br>importantly if we re challenged those<br>animals and an opposites in another site<br>we they're all protected so this is a<br>really important finding it's great for<br>when you've got a small tumor burden we<br>we're testing it now with current<br>therapies and how they work one of the<br>other things we know is about<br>formulation of these vaccines and so<br>Greg Walker who is actually a university<br>friend of mine came back to the<br>University I don't know 67 years ago and<br>he was working in formulation and<br>pharmaceutical sciences and looking at<br>ways we can allow those vaccines to last<br>for longer and the host so put them into<br>a person and an implant and allow them<br>to slowly be released and stimulate um<br>the immune response for a longer time<br>and so we can put the virus-like<br>particle into these little nano fibers<br>and make an implant and potentially add<br>other drugs in order to enhance that<br>response that we get against cancers so<br>when you have a higher tune of burden<br>something like a vaccine doesn't work so<br>well and in different locations in the<br>body you might want a different type of<br>immune response so what you might want<br>in the gut might be quite different to<br>what you need if a cancers metastasized<br>to the lung or the liver so one of the<br>areas<br>that has been very popular for<br>hematological cancers as adoptive cell<br>therapy and so this is where we take<br>immune cells out of either the tumor<br>from a patient or out of the peripheral<br>blood of the patient we activate them<br>ex-vivo in hematological cancers we<br>sometimes genetically modify them to<br>express specific targets so they can<br>target cancers and then we put them back<br>into the patient in order to protect<br>against disease or activate the immune<br>system against that cancer I was<br>fortunate enough for a few years ago to<br>get a Fulbright fellowship to go to the<br>States and one of the areas that I<br>wanted to learn more about that I'd<br>start with started to do some work on<br>here at Otago<br>and was cell therapy and this is Helen<br>his lap so the daughter of Barbara that<br>I mentioned before Helen went to Keiko<br>Valley College she was the Ducks<br>and she runs this massive facility in<br>the States the cell and gene therapy at<br>Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor<br>College so this is in Houston it's the<br>biggest medical center in the world<br>there's 21 hospitals all on the one site<br>and each hospital is about three times<br>the size of Dunedin Hospital and so they<br>are really world leaders in this cell<br>therapy they have a whole floor two<br>floors of a building like this where<br>they have 27 laboratories so GMP the top<br>craftsmen and laboratories making<br>products for use in patients and they've<br>got about a hundred and sixty clinical<br>trials going at the moment so this is<br>for hematological cancers so an amazing<br>opportunity to learn about how to<br>manipulate those cells find out all of<br>their information that you don't<br>necessarily read and research papers and<br>so they were doing that in hematological<br>cancers of course we want to try and do<br>this for solid tumors as much what<br>difficult but<br>that's harder to often get theirselves<br>to traffic into the site of whether they<br>come from when it's a hematological<br>Chima like a leukemia you can just go<br>straight into the blood so what we're<br>doing here is that we are I'm getting<br>patient samples we're isolating those<br>immune cells from the patients and<br>trying to work out strategies is to get<br>those cells to a state of fitness where<br>they're going to proliferate and work<br>really well when we put them back into<br>the patient so that's what we're working<br>on currently and it's not as easy as<br>what you think it might be lots of<br>things that we have to work through so<br>this needle in a haystack one of the<br>issues for us is what are those little<br>antigens that tumors Express so you know<br>at the start I said you know these cells<br>mutate and they go from ignore me to<br>target me every individual person has<br>different tumor antigens so we can't<br>really make a standardized one that will<br>you know so one size fits all so that's<br>one of the issues for us but we've got<br>lots of new technology coming on board<br>that's making it easier and easier to<br>find that we also have new technologies<br>and some of these have been funded by<br>those of you in the community those such<br>as the Freemasons to to purchase<br>equipment to an order to for us to<br>target and analyze how those t-cells<br>recognize those different antigens so<br>finally just sort of been wrapping up<br>the last sort of area of immune<br>stimulation I want to talk about is back<br>to this nonspecific stimulation this<br>time using viruses but viruses it can<br>really exclusive liyan cancers so part<br>of my sabbatical as well as going to<br>Houston we went to the Mayo Clinic and I<br>worked with Richard vile a professor<br>that I'd meet at Cancer Research UK and<br>he had set up a lab at the Mayo Clinic<br>quite a number of years ago and he is a<br>virologist that well he sort of spans<br>biology and immunology and has developed<br>some some viral specific<br>therapy is where we have a viruses such<br>as Rio virus that will that will<br>replicate in tumor cells and release<br>lots of inflammatory molecules to<br>activate the immune system so these<br>uncle attack viruses they're called so<br>specific to tumors and then they sort of<br>subsequently activate inflammation so<br>we're working on some of that at the<br>moment and I've been involved right I<br>think Harleen alluded to some of the<br>committees that I've been on and I've<br>I've been involved in some of the some<br>of the many committees that are involved<br>with the new Hospital rebuild and I<br>thought I'd put this up because this is<br>the Mayo Clinic it's like a five-star<br>hotel so you go when they have a valet<br>service you pull up and they take your<br>car away to the car park and then you<br>come in and they have you know you go up<br>to the information area they have<br>concerts every lunchtime with different<br>you know so it's it's a really unique<br>experience interesting to see so all of<br>the research that I've talked about and<br>that I still continue to do and will<br>continue to do for the rest of my career<br>because I'm really only probably halfway<br>through my career is around that<br>manipulation of the immune response<br>we're targeting at the moment metastasis<br>rather than necessarily just the primary<br>tumor because it's of course it's the<br>metastasis that kill you not the primary<br>tumor usually we're targeting obviously<br>looking at patients you know what's<br>unique about patients and Natur go south<br>on that might be different and in other<br>parts of the world are there areas that<br>we can specifically be able to Lincoln<br>from our patient group internationally<br>obviously the formulation and the<br>delivery of those therapies are really<br>important and and the way that we do<br>that is important and there's lots of to<br>learn around that and we're targeting<br>at-risk groups so so what are some areas<br>that we can look at that maybe we can<br>add value to so one of the areas that<br>we're looking at at the moment has<br>normal weight versus obesity because we<br>know that the immune system works<br>different if you are overweight or obese<br>and when you're an or<br>wait and how does that influence the<br>types of therapies you get and how the<br>immune system works is there's lots of<br>scope for that so I've taken you on a<br>bit of a trip of my and you probably<br>think why a career and biomedical<br>research why would I want to do this<br>you know there's high costs you know<br>it's millions of dollars worth of costs<br>there's inherent risks you know there's<br>things usually don't go right rather<br>than go right and there's really limited<br>and competitive funding but it's always<br>interesting you're always finding out<br>new knowledge that no day is the same<br>and that's one of the key things that<br>keeps us all interested in this type of<br>there's also lots of social benefits<br>from doing biomedical research and<br>there's a lot of data on this but we<br>know that biomedical research cancer<br>research for example in the u.s. it's an<br>extra you know when they when they<br>looked at the benefit of that research<br>over a number of years and extra twenty<br>three million life years from new cancer<br>treatments for example so they work that<br>out to be one point nine trillion and<br>social value and people at work longer<br>there's a whole lot of extra benefits<br>you know the social gains that you get<br>the economic gains from finding new<br>therapies using therapies in a different<br>way discovering ways to keep people<br>healthier for longer so it's very<br>rewarding now people will know this<br>proverb there's Mari proverb and hay are<br>Tamayo new he ate OTL hate on guitar<br>hate on guitar hate on guitar so what is<br>the most important thing in the world it<br>is the people it is the people it is the<br>people and and John sees this don't you<br>John every graduation Sierra me but it's<br>true there are so many people that have<br>helped me in my career that I cannot<br>list every single person so please take<br>this as a personal acknowledgment of of<br>thanks and of course a lot of you are<br>here today I specifically want to think<br>the pathology department I have the<br>great privilege of leading this<br>department and have done<br>for the last five years when it's very<br>dark they edit a fantastic work<br>environment it's very collegial we do<br>amazing research we've got you know this<br>is world-class research going on in our<br>department that would compete with any<br>place in the world and the people that I<br>work with are just amazing they're great<br>great colleagues I also want to think<br>the postgraduate supervisor students<br>that I've supervised now here is the<br>list of all the different postgraduate<br>students that I've supervised over the<br>years some of them have done more than<br>one degree with me they might have done<br>an honours degree and then a PhD and you<br>know these have been the driving force<br>of my lab every paper every bit of<br>research that I submitted for when I<br>went for promotion to Professor was<br>undertaken by postgraduate students so I<br>haven't had a postdoc work for me until<br>after I got promoted so I'm really proud<br>about that and I was really wanting to<br>try and get my promotion before I had<br>other staff I also have a large group<br>and a group of closer colleagues and<br>collaborators and I've mentioned a<br>number of these tonight and others in<br>the Sharon Patterson I mentioned Chris<br>Marilyn as well so so lots of work going<br>on this sort of research has not ever<br>done by one person it's always done by<br>multiple people and finally these people<br>Chris Emily and James so Emily said to<br>me before this talk she goes you know<br>mum I don't think I've done anything to<br>help you become professor<br>in fact I've probably made it worse for<br>you because I've taken you away from<br>work and then James said do I really<br>have to come to your lecture because<br>it's gonna be it's gonna be pretty<br>boring and I think I'm gonna have to<br>bring two books just in case it goes on<br>so and so I know that that's you know<br>funny but one of the things that they<br>have contributed though really well is<br>that they make me completely forget<br>about work so I come home and I'm busy<br>being a mum and busy being a wife and so<br>that's actually you know really<br>important though you've got to<br>accurate tenets are takeout or my name<br>is Paul Brunton and I'm the pro<br>vice-chancellor for health sciences and<br>I'm delighted to be here<br>I think they DS and gentlemen you'll all<br>agree that we have had a wonderful<br>lecture from Professor young tonight<br>absolutely fabulous<br>my role is to summarize what we've<br>learned well we've learned a lot about<br>Sarah I think a little bit more than<br>what we probably knew before we learn to<br>think for an amazing journey of<br>discovery in research somebody growing<br>and being mentored and been very<br>successful in producing research that<br>would have real impact for patients and<br>I think that's important<br>translational clinical research and we<br>learned a great deal about mentorship<br>and the people who'd supported you on<br>your journey and I know that Sarah is<br>now doing that too many future<br>researchers who are being educated and<br>trained within the university we learned<br>that she's greatest strategic leadership<br>and I can echo that thought because when<br>I have a problem in the division she's<br>very often the first person I phone to<br>help me lead leaders out of a situation<br>or a difficulty that we might have and<br>just the heads up Sarah I'll be voting<br>you in the morning so just be warned so<br>in summary a fantastic lecture very<br>personal fabulous journey in research<br>and on your behalf I'd like to present</p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding:
