2019</p><h2>Transcript</h2><p style="opacity: 0.9; font-size: 0.8em">Transcripts may be automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.</p><p>I think they might get on the way I just<br>want to start before we do anything else<br>it is a massive honor for me on behalf<br>of every one of the faculty over here to<br>say a huge congratulations to you all<br>for getting into part two law it is a<br>fantastic achievement one that you<br>should not underestimate and I hope<br>before we get into anything else I hope<br>that you have all taken the time to<br>celebrate and hopefully with people that<br>have helped you to get where you are<br>because it is a massive deal but as I<br>was told in my part two orientation a<br>few years ago it's really difficult to<br>get into law school it's way more<br>difficult to get out of it so so I hope<br>you celebrate now while you still feel<br>like you can so welcome my name is kaya<br>Patel I actually don't work here at all<br>I've got nothing to do with the law<br>school so hopefully that means I can say<br>stuff that they can't I graduated from<br>Auckland law school three years ago I<br>did a Beacom LLB and I loved my time<br>here both because I had a lot of fun but<br>also it set me up for what I'm doing now<br>which is quite cool so since I finished<br>I've got a mittens bar and became a<br>barrister and solicitor of the High<br>Court which is probably still the most<br>proudest achievement I've done and I<br>wouldn't got my CA and I'm now working<br>at PricewaterhouseCoopers and they have<br>allowed me to come and spend the day<br>here with you guys which is cool so<br>congratulations what I'm going to go<br>through firstly is just a quick program<br>to show you what we're going to get up<br>to today but essentially what we're<br>going to teach you today or at least<br>tell you today there's just stuff to<br>help you navigate through especially the<br>first two years of law school because<br>there are a lot of things that are<br>different to an University the rest of<br>university or the outside world as you<br>might call it so hopefully we can help<br>you navigate through some of these<br>things that you're going to see and and<br>before I get into that just a massive<br>thank you as well for choosing us<br>choosing Auckland law school look we're<br>really proud of our status and the<br>rankings and all that kind of stuff we<br>work hard for them but at the end of the<br>day we realize that if you wanted to you<br>could have chosen to go to aut your<br>didn't probably a good thing<br>hey hey thank you very much for choosing<br>us there are a lot of good outfits out<br>there so hopefully you'll end at some<br>point at this Law School and you'll<br>think that you get a fantastic journey<br>with us<br>so I'm program today we're going to<br>start off with a welcome from our acting<br>dean professor Warren Swain will then<br>get into the part 2 structure so just a<br>bit of a look at the for law part 2<br>courses that you'll be doing this year<br>or over the next two years if you're<br>doing Condren and then we'll get the<br>course directors for each of those part<br>2 courses to give you a bit of an<br>overview of those those specific courses<br>as well especially as a lot of them are<br>things that you might not have come<br>across before it's a really good idea to<br>keep an open mind at this point and most<br>of you probably decided to law because<br>of Harvey Specter but once you get into<br>law school you kind of realize it<br>there's a whole range of diverse things<br>you can do so keep an open mind at some<br>of these courses because they really do<br>open up avenues and then after that<br>we'll get through some a couple of<br>courses on study techniques and how we<br>run tutorials we'll do law 2 9 8 which<br>is a compulsory course that you're going<br>to take this year and then we'll start<br>talking about some career opportunities<br>and the kind of things you can do now to<br>make sure that when you're ready to<br>graduate you're coming out of law school<br>with what options would offers when you<br>walk out the door so Chloe will take<br>that then we'll get one of our students<br>Gary to come in and talk to you about<br>the student experience will then talk<br>about how we like to provide a safe<br>inclusive environment here at law school<br>and some of the things we are doing what<br>you can get involved with to help us do<br>that and then we'll give you a bit of a<br>look at some student societies kind of<br>things on offer we get that AUSA runs a<br>whole bunch of things you can join the<br>meat club if you want that's great but<br>we've got some more specific student<br>societies as well which will help you in<br>your endeavors here at law school as<br>well so we'll do that and I think we've<br>got a barbecue after that as well so<br>feel free to come down to law school for<br>that but we'll kick off with Professor<br>Warren Swain thank you guys<br>tena koe tokoto welcome my name is<br>Professor Warren Swain I'm the acting<br>dean when the talk we just had mentioned<br>somebody called Harvey Specter I was<br>rather in the position of a judge of the<br>1960s who said who are the Beatles I<br>understand it's a television show I am<br>Dean in the interim between the<br>departure professor Stockley in the<br>arrival of the new dean penny Matthew<br>next month few days ago I welcome the<br>part one students to you I simply say<br>welcome back you'll face new challenges<br>and hopefully find new things to inspire<br>you in part two but first of all I'd<br>like to re-emphasize and say well done<br>for reaching part two I know the<br>sacrifices that be made by you and your<br>families and you've worked very hard so<br>congratulations I'm now going to give<br>you a quote which is taken from the<br>British Prime Minister Winston Churchill<br>when describing the Battle of El Alamein<br>in the North African campaign one of my<br>sidelines is an interest in military<br>history Churchill said this after the<br>British beat forced the German general<br>general Montgomery back now this is not<br>the end it is not even the beginning of<br>the end but it is proud<br>that's the end of the beginning the<br>campaign was a turning point a rumble<br>was pushed back and of course after<br>several years later the allies had their<br>victory I'm not saying that doing a law<br>degree is like fighting a wall such an<br>analogy would be patently ridiculous<br>however it does have some things in<br>common<br>it's attritional you may suffer some<br>defeats or setbacks the key is to keep<br>going studying law is like the army in<br>one sense in another way it's a<br>collaborative process in this process it<br>doesn't just it doesn't mean at all<br>following orders but it means something<br>more positive transformational even and<br>that isn't talked about enough it's<br>about learning not just from the<br>teaching staff and I will be taking the<br>first four weeks of contract it means<br>learning from your friends and your<br>fellow students this can be the form of<br>study groups or something less formal<br>but it's really important to talk about<br>the work that you're doing you also need<br>to think about where you are and hence<br>the quote you are now in part two which<br>is perhaps the end of the beginning but<br>more than that it's an opportunity to<br>think carefully about what is the law<br>and what does the law do these of course<br>are big questions and perhaps ones that<br>didn't bother Harvey Specter whoever<br>Batty's the great English poet WH Auden<br>wrote a poem law is like love in the<br>poem he contrasted the different senses<br>of law the law of nature<br>with religion etc he devoted a verse to<br>the law of the sort that you will study<br>law says the judge as he looks down his<br>nose speaking clearly a more severely<br>law is I've told you before law is as<br>you know I suppose lawyers but let me<br>explain it once more law is the law I<br>know little about love and so cannot<br>comment on whether that comparison is a<br>valid one but it's worth reflecting on<br>the way that the judging audience poem<br>presents the law as something certain<br>and something definite this may be how<br>laypeople or for these purposes<br>non-lawyers think about the law in<br>commonly the truth of course is more<br>complicated than that as it often is the<br>law is often contradictory judges in<br>different cases or even the same case<br>may say different things they may reach<br>the same result for different reasons<br>part two as I see it it's about gaining<br>a deeper understanding of that process<br>the process of legal reasoning this<br>isn't just a matter of analyzing legal<br>doctrine it's also about where law sit<br>or what might be termed or was turned by<br>some trendy academic hippies in the<br>1970s<br>it's a contextual or critical analysis<br>of the law it's important though to note<br>that we are in New Zealand in the early<br>21st century and that really matters in<br>terms of the sense of the law and the<br>way that the law is applied it's not<br>just a law of anywhere it's a law in a<br>particular<br>context as far as the teaching is<br>concerned will have introductions from<br>the coast directors as I say your<br>unfortunate as you may see it to have me<br>for the first four weeks of contract for<br>those of you who are studying contract<br>it's actually one of the highlights of<br>my year between not University<br>committees and other management<br>functions and writing books to lecture<br>the first four weeks of contract it's a<br>real privilege and I hope that some of<br>you will gain some enjoyment in law and<br>of course in the law of contract and how<br>could you not but as well as study it's<br>important to say something final<br>remember to take care of yourselves as<br>well be kind to yourself<br>um what I mean by that is by taking time<br>off but also what I mean by that is be<br>understanding that learning law is<br>difficult that this is normal to find it<br>difficult it's not anything wrong with<br>you it's actually just very usual so be<br>kind to yourself and be in your<br>when I say don't spend all your time<br>working it perhaps it's always amusing<br>to the academic and professional staff<br>here given that people say that I'm a<br>workaholic so perhaps it doesn't come<br>particularly easy for me but don't<br>forget that university is more about<br>work an academic sense in a conventional<br>sense one of my great regrets in life is<br>that I spent all my undergraduate time<br>food and in the decades since working<br>it's too late for me but it isn't too<br>late for you I say it slightly<br>flippantly but actually that's really<br>important if you take anything out of<br>anything I say it that so please take<br>advantage of the range of opportunities<br>on offer to students societies and don't<br>forget too that university is an<br>important time to forge friendships when<br>your dean you can get by with having no<br>friends and plenty of enemies but for<br>you it's really important and it makes<br>the whole experience richer because it's<br>really as I say important to engage with<br>your cohort don't forget to and I'll<br>finish on this to have some enjoyment in<br>work and outside it I hope there'll be<br>stuff that you study that you find<br>interesting and not just the law of<br>contract but don't forget that that too<br>is important<br>I'll now pass on to my colleagues and<br>I'd wish you all a very good luck as you<br>move into part two and I hope that you<br>all have a very good year thank you very<br>much<br>excellent before we move on to points I<br>really want to touch on with that the<br>first is that it is difficult it is an<br>attrition a battle of sorts and some of<br>you will have had better was getting<br>here even into part two but at the<br>moment you're on clean slate and<br>whatever it has happened in the past<br>couple of years it doesn't matter I took<br>me two attempts to get into law school I<br>didn't make it on the first time and in<br>my head that was a massive deal but<br>you'll quickly find there actually<br>everyone's on the same boat you will all<br>struggle with things and you will all<br>succeed very well at other things but it<br>definitely doesn't impact the outcome at<br>the end in the city and part of that is<br>to make sure you have some fun while<br>you're here because every single person<br>that leaves University I guarantee will<br>tell you that they wish they had taken<br>more time to enjoy themselves while they<br>were here it's not something you're<br>likely to do again at this time in your<br>life so make sure you enjoy it next up<br>we'll have introduction into the parts<br>two courses so this is really important<br>you the entire year or if you're doing<br>conjoint in next two years there's some<br>information on how that is going to run<br>so I'd like to please welcome<br>Professional Teaching Fellow Bronwyn<br>Davies<br>thank you very much it organized up here<br>good morning and the warmest of welcomes<br>to all my name is Bronwyn Davies and I<br>wear two hats today well none at all<br>actually but two hats first and foremost<br>I am the director of legal research<br>writing and communication program so<br>that's law two nine eight to you but my<br>second hat is of course as the associate<br>dean academic wear bottom line I'm<br>responsible for making sure that you<br>check all the boxes going through your<br>LLB program so I guess that means my<br>middle name is probably miss compliance<br>as well so let me add my warmest<br>congratulations to you all as well as<br>professor Swain I certainly don't<br>underestimate what it's taken to get you<br>here<br>family friends not to mention late<br>nights slaving over a hot computer<br>I hope hard work of course got you here<br>and indeed hard work is what's going to<br>carry you through hard work plus smart<br>work so as Warren has said there's going<br>to be plenty of opportunities for you<br>along the way to enjoy yourself whilst<br>at law school what we are going to be<br>doing eventually of course is<br>celebrating your success at law school<br>at graduation and it's with that end<br>point in mind that I want to now spend<br>the next 15 minutes or so walking you<br>through the program structure and<br>hopefully give you a bit of a taste of<br>what the journey might look like at<br>least from a pragmatic perspective of<br>what you must do but I think in life<br>it's often good to have a goal in sight<br>and so with the end goal of graduation I<br>want you to have that fixed in your mind<br>what it is you're going to do when you<br>do wear that pale blue hood I'd like you<br>to start today with me now thinking<br>about one step at a time<br>one step at a time this is an endurance<br>not a sprint race and if you keep up the<br>pace if you treat yourself along the way<br>if you reward yourself as you go you<br>will enjoy your time here I promise what<br>you don't have in your orientation packs<br>is a student handbook but what you will<br>have by the end of the day is a document<br>that looks something like this and this<br>should become your Bible this should<br>become your bedside reading in fact it's<br>clearly mine perhaps more to put me to<br>sleep then to keep me awake but in that<br>booklet you will find all of the rules<br>and regs that relate to your succeeding<br>on this journey and what I'd like to do<br>is ask you to write on your hand because<br>in your pack there is actually a pen<br>right on your hand the important number<br>page 12<br>because page 12 is where you will find<br>all right so by the end of the day you<br>will have this Student Handbook and in<br>it you will find lots of information and<br>as I say page 12 is where we will start<br>today and we'll just be looking at the<br>typical LLB degree structure to start<br>off with my apologies to you I've just<br>realized it's blue green and red so<br>those of you who are colorblind will be<br>challenged by this slide so with the<br>endpoint and size I want you to think<br>about what it is that you are going to<br>be studying not next year not the year<br>after but how you're going to progress<br>your studies and so the starting point<br>is to focus around these blue tiles and<br>for you also to think about what do I<br>want to do with my law degree what am I<br>going to use it for so some of you are<br>going to be answering that question<br>right now saying I'm going to practice<br>law some of you are going to say I want<br>to be an academic<br>some of you say I have not the first<br>idea which of course was my approach for<br>that latter category you'll want to keep<br>your options open that's probably the<br>best goal for you to have right now is<br>to plan a course that keeps your options<br>open for those of you who are very very<br>specific in your intent and your goal is<br>to become a practitioner then your<br>pathway is relatively clear certainly<br>you will have to do all of the blue<br>tiles but for those of you who are doing<br>law for a variety of other reasons you<br>may not want to practice or you may not<br>need to keep your options open you have<br>other things other plans in mind I have<br>one student for example who wants to be<br>a pilot<br>then your degree will look something<br>just not so similar to this now why is<br>that it's because the law degree is a<br>professional degree as well as an<br>academic degree<br>as a professional degree at therefore<br>means that there's some other body<br>outside the university that dictates<br>what must be in it who is that body it's<br>the New Zealand Council of legal<br>education and it says that if you want<br>to be a lawyer you need to have three<br>stages in your academic sorry in your<br>professional training the first of<br>course being pre-law the next being the<br>degree proper and finally continuing<br>legal education after admission the<br>professional stage of training so the<br>council of legal education is dictated<br>to ask of the University of Auckland<br>that you must include in your degree<br>seven subjects and we as a law school<br>have said and we think this department<br>believes you must include in your law<br>degree six subjects so you do the math<br>that makes a total of 13 compulsory<br>subjects and they appear in blue now the<br>good news is you've already done three<br>of those so that's the pre-law phase so<br>you've already got a head start but now<br>we're going to focus around this year<br>and what it takes to carry on in your<br>law degree and remember keep the end<br>point in sight what is it I want to use<br>my degree for is absolutely significant<br>and central to the decisions you're<br>going to make relative to how you will<br>structure your degree so you must study<br>13 subjects the ones in blue if you want<br>to practice as a lawyer or if you want<br>to keep your options open but if you<br>don't want to practice law then there is<br>a tiny subject here with an asterisk<br>although an elliptic course the Council<br>of legal education requires study<br>students intending to be admitted to the<br>bar to take this course so we have had<br>that imposed on us by the losses Council<br>of legal education and we as a faculty<br>have decided you must also take<br>jurisprudence all right so the structure<br>of your course for part two I want you<br>to think very carefully<br>how you need to progress your studies<br>this year what order am I going to study<br>and just like part one you have choices<br>you have some options there are however<br>a couple of absolute mandatory musts and<br>so we start with law - 9 8 - 9 8 is your<br>starting point for part 2 of your degree<br>and it must be teamed up with at least<br>one of these other three subjects<br>doesn't have to however big criminal war<br>doesn't even have to be public law torts<br>or contract it can be any one of those<br>or all four of them if you choose like<br>me I did the entire diet of part two<br>subjects in my first year and my grades<br>show it there is another mandatory<br>element to all of this you can't pass go<br>until you've collected all five of those<br>subjects in other words we will not let<br>you progress on to part three blue tiles<br>until you have all of the part two blue<br>tiles firmly in your back pocket so it's<br>very important for you to collect each<br>subject get a check in the box move<br>forward before you aspire to taking land<br>law equity jurisprudence or ethics I<br>will not permit it when I say my middle<br>name is compliance however I will let<br>you take an elective provided that<br>elective has no prerequisites of any of<br>these part two subjects here so I repeat<br>in order to take any of the blue<br>subjects in line three you must have all<br>five of the blue subjects in line two<br>but if you are one of the 10% who last<br>year dropped exams in and failed one of<br>these courses I will not permit you to<br>carry<br>into these subjects but I might permit<br>you to move into an elective now there<br>are rules around that as well and I<br>won't bore you with them but provided<br>those subjects that you choose as an<br>elective don't require say the law of<br>contract as a prerequisite pass you can<br>continue with your legal studies so it<br>seems pretty simple the example of that<br>would be student I'm dealing with right<br>now he failed his contract law or exam<br>he wants to continue into some part 3<br>part 4 subjects I won't permit him to<br>take tax or international law because<br>both of those require law of contract<br>you can however take a lot of other<br>different courses including an<br>independent research paper where he<br>might want to explore some of those<br>topics that he has indicated interests<br>in but can't enroll and so what I'm<br>saying to you is there is flexibility<br>even though it seems quite rigid there<br>is some flexibility built in speaking of<br>flexibility you'll have possibly noticed<br>although you'd need to have Bionic<br>eyesight to be able to see that some of<br>these courses are have 10 points some of<br>them have 15 and some of them have 30<br>some even have 20 so basically the rule<br>here is that law courses come in five<br>different sizes from extra small to<br>small to medium large and even<br>extra-large and unlike the rest of the<br>university we do this on purpose to<br>confuse you<br>no we do this on purpose because not all<br>law is equal so some subjects have a<br>much greater complexity or a much wider<br>focus or a much deeper understanding and<br>therefore require greater credit point<br>allocation it also keeps our staff our<br>Student Advisory Center very busy and<br>keeping them in work is always a good<br>thing because they're party a lot in<br>advising you on how to put together<br>these bricks to ensure that you come out<br>with the episode<br>and game total credit points that you<br>need to succeed now I've shown you the<br>simple version but of course 80% of you<br>aren't doing just a law degree you are<br>actually doing a conjoint in the<br>handbook that you will be getting we<br>actually also have a sample or a<br>structure around the conjoint program<br>around as well now bearing in mind the<br>starting point is the collecting of five<br>part two subjects and bearing in mind<br>that law two nine eight is the first one<br>of those subjects and must be paired<br>with one other you actually have<br>complete freedom about how you sequence<br>your law studies if you want to just dip<br>your tap toe take law to nine eight and<br>one other subject if you want to<br>maximize your grades perhaps take two<br>nine eight and one other subject and<br>then sequence your degree in such a way<br>as it suits you and part of the success<br>of being at university is to have<br>diversity in all elements of your life<br>both in terms of your academic studies<br>your engagement with your colleagues and<br>this is a way in which you can be<br>particularly creative and structuring<br>your degree but with creativity there<br>also comes some casualties and that's<br>why we need you to use your student<br>advice center they will be able to help<br>you structure the optimal course for you<br>so that your interest is sustained so<br>that your graduation goal is achieved<br>always have your end point in sight I<br>sequencing your degree might involve<br>some setbacks that means you may stumble<br>on some courses you may need to repeat<br>courses if they are all compulsory<br>courses you will have to have them in<br>order to progress this is something that<br>a large proportion of students will face<br>at some point in their degree remember<br>you are the best students in<br>University so therefore this doesn't<br>make you anything other than somebody<br>who has stumbled and we are there to<br>help and it is never going to be<br>ultimately a problem provided you seek<br>help so please come to us we will be<br>able to help you use the rules to your<br>advantage and we will be able to<br>progress you through your degree what I<br>want also to highlight two other key and<br>important elements to your degree one of<br>which is your opportunities to exchange<br>this university encourages you as I say<br>to expand your horizons and enjoy your<br>time at university so that means it<br>often gives you the opportunity to leave<br>it and go to another one and compare and<br>see how they do things over there so<br>might I suggest that you think in either<br>your part 3 or part 4 of your studies<br>taking the opportunity to exchange<br>either through one of the arrangements<br>that the wall school has or one of the<br>arrangements that the university has for<br>either a semester or for a full year I<br>would really encourage you look at those<br>opportunities and see where they might<br>lie for you I will have a I guess a<br>positive disposition towards somebody<br>who has exchanged in terms of crediting<br>you with the studies that you have taken<br>overseas as I say there are around a<br>hundred possibilities so there will be<br>an opportunity for you like to finish up<br>also by talking about another end goal<br>that many of you come into the program<br>with and that's the LLB honours the LLB<br>honors program is different from the<br>rest of the university in that it's<br>shorter it isn't necessarily a full<br>year's commitment and it's 60 points it<br>can be tacked on to the end of your<br>degree it can be coordinated within<br>parts 3 or 4 but the most important<br>thing that you need to think of at this<br>stage is that<br>once you've completed your part to<br>subjects your grades will then be<br>assessed and we will then ascertain<br>whether or not you've met the B+<br>threshold to be invited to take honors<br>the Honors Program is therefore an<br>element that's grafted on to and added<br>to the LLB degree for which you must<br>have a B+ average and importantly you<br>must then maintain that B+ average<br>throughout the rest of your degree okay<br>so have that end goal in mind as well<br>after your part two results are in will<br>then make that assessment and we will<br>automatically bring you into the program<br>or invite you into the program elective<br>courses as the last part of my<br>presentation today I want to encourage<br>you to think widely we offer around 50<br>elective programs every year but not all<br>of them are offered each year so think<br>carefully sometimes we offer them on a<br>rotation maybe a tulitt two yearly basis<br>but sometimes we also offer them as a<br>summer school option usually four or<br>five courses over summer so maximize<br>your opportunities mix and match your<br>courses take study for interest not<br>because you think the employers will be<br>impressed by it those subjects that<br>you're interested in of course are those<br>are the subjects that won't be such hard<br>work they'll be the ones that you do so<br>very well in and also think about the<br>prospect of doing papers that allow you<br>to do independent research so papers in<br>lieu of exams if you are not a good exam<br>taker maybe you prefer independent<br>research find courses that allow you to<br>do a paper in lieu of the exam that<br>means writing a four or five thousand<br>word a research essay exempts you from<br>taking the final exam a good strategy<br>for many of you and also a good way of<br>getting off early to go on holiday at<br>the end of the year before the rest of<br>the crowds<br>in terms of assessment my final words<br>will be around assessment and that is<br>again referring to the student handbook<br>be please take care to look at page 30<br>and that is the handing in of<br>assessments the seeking of extensions<br>and the awarding I'm afraid of penalties<br>be very clear there will be occasions<br>through this year where you are not able<br>to meet the deadlines on your assessment<br>it happens to us all for a wide variety<br>of very valid reasons there is no shame<br>in that but there is harm if you don't<br>seek help so please again student<br>advisers these are the only people who<br>can support you through this process of<br>seeking and extension if you don't seek<br>an extension what are the consequences<br>penalties attached and these will be<br>awarded for either not meeting the<br>deadline or exceeding the word limit<br>again always ask for help if you are<br>struggling with an assessment do not<br>however ask your instructors tutors<br>professors or course directors for an<br>extension that's simply not fair their<br>role is to support you in learning our<br>role is to support you in the logistics<br>so please use your course directors for<br>the best of purposes that is to help you<br>understand the subject and allow us and<br>the student advice team and in my office<br>to support you in the mire that is the<br>regulations and rules that run this<br>degree program alright so on that note<br>it's my pleasure to hand over to the<br>next part but my final words I guess<br>would be to say to you make friends make<br>progress and make this the very best<br>start to the rest of your life thank you<br>awesome thank you very much hi boy I've<br>always find it interesting that the only<br>difference between being able to get<br>your practicing certificate or get to<br>the next stage and not is choosing not<br>to take ethics and I've always been<br>quite dubious of a person that will<br>decide to close off their entire chance<br>of ever getting a practice into it just<br>because they don't want to study ethics<br>anyway we're going to get carry on with<br>part 2 courses now these will give you a<br>base which is a fantastic grounding but<br>also help you in one really good area of<br>your personal life I'm not sure if this<br>happen to you yet I guarantee it'll<br>happen to you by the end of your first<br>year people will learn that you're<br>studying law and you'll get a call and<br>they'll say hey I need to do a will<br>how'd I do this and you have no idea in<br>my case it was a friend from high school<br>that called me up and said hey I met the<br>police station I fell asleep behind the<br>wheel what do I do<br>you're part two courses will give you<br>enough information to be able to say I<br>understand this is a legal problem now<br>hang up the phone and call the real<br>where so we've got half an hour I'll get<br>them to go straight after the yeah there<br>and we'll start with proficient<br>cure DeCoteau couture<br>talofa lava welcome to the law school<br>proper it's really nice to sit here and<br>look around at all your beautiful and<br>interesting faces I'm here to make a<br>case for the relevance of criminal law<br>and to tell you a little bit more about<br>the subject so basically we know that<br>about one-fifth of you will in who end<br>up in legal practice will practice<br>criminal law so that's not all of you<br>however whatever area of law you go into<br>increasingly the criminal law is used as<br>an enforcement mechanism to back up that<br>regulatory regime so even if you go into<br>financial law tax company law things<br>that couldn't be further away from<br>criminal law you will have criminal law<br>come up in your<br>now I'm actually going to ask you to be<br>a little bit brave and give me some<br>information about you I want you if<br>you've got the courage to put up your<br>hand if you've ever committed a criminal<br>offense thank you very much now<br>basically what that means is I have a<br>room full of really weird people because<br>according to that survey only a small<br>minority of actually committed criminal<br>offences so that means the majority of<br>you have never smoked marijuana have you<br>ever taken ecstasy or some illegal drug<br>to go to a dance party have never<br>committed theft that is you've never<br>taken something without someones<br>permission<br>knowing you plan to use it might damage<br>it even if you hope you don't intend to<br>return it means you've never assaulted<br>someone that means contacted their body<br>on purpose without their consent or<br>threatened to do so you have never used<br>indecent or offensive words in a public<br>place in other words more than public<br>knowing someone could hear you you have<br>never purposefully damaged someone's<br>property you have never attempted to<br>bring into hatred or contempt or excite<br>disaffection against your majesty<br>or the government of New Zealand or the<br>administration of justice<br>you've never urinated in a public place<br>other than a public toilet knowing that<br>someone could possibly observe you and<br>you've never tried but failed to do any<br>of these things that's an attempt<br>furthermore you've never even had a<br>friend that you've encouraged to do one<br>of those things which has been a party<br>to somebody else's offense so just ask<br>you again how many people have committed<br>basically a more honest response now<br>that exercise is interesting that<br>because it tells us something that<br>criminologist started discovering about<br>the seventies which is that criminal<br>offending is normal in the population<br>and there's a huge mass of what we call<br>the dark figure of crime which is<br>criminal Athenian that takes place which<br>is never prosecuted and taken through<br>the criminal justice system so basically<br>we are the lucky ones we have had lives<br>that have insulated us from being<br>charged or convicted or ever having the<br>label criminal attached to us despite<br>the fact that we've breached the<br>criminal law often multiple times now I<br>just want to pause a bit and read for<br>Malaysia from one of our alumni this is<br>one of your predecessors so I used to<br>edit our alumni magazine and every time<br>an edition came out I'd get letters from<br>people either complimenting or<br>criticizing the magazine and this was<br>one of my favorites it's a very<br>complimentary letter dear Julia I write<br>to compliment you on the 212 2012<br>edition of eat increase and given the<br>sparsity of my current discombobulation<br>I found the annual a ripping read and<br>then he goes on to compliment me about<br>different different articles in that<br>magazine Thank You Julia and editorial<br>support team much appreciated<br>unfortunately for me I am currently in<br>custody at Mount Eden awaiting trial on<br>a raft of charges involving alleged<br>financial Mis practices and then he goes<br>on to share his legal woes and to ask<br>for bet copies of the of Eden Crescent<br>now my point of course here is that the<br>study of criminal law is relevant<br>all of us and may become even more<br>immediately and personally relevant to<br>some of you in this room at some point<br>in the future so I know that my<br>colleagues going to do plugs for their<br>subject that's my plug for the real life<br>relevance of criminal law now I'm here<br>as course director of criminal law it's<br>going to be taught in three streams this<br>year we have a fantastic team of<br>teachers so the first semester the<br>course is going to be taught by myself<br>and dr. flirty ah who she is from Ngati<br>Mutunga Key Taranaki her background is<br>an indigenous rights and international<br>law and she has a particular interest in<br>moldy moldy approaches to justice and<br>alternatives to incarceration she was<br>involved with dr. Kate Doolin just<br>recently in organizing our incredibly<br>successful drug and alcohol courts<br>conference so in the second semester<br>we'll be taken over by dr. Kate Doolin<br>who we has just recently come to us from<br>the University of Birmingham and has an<br>interest in restorative justice and<br>associate professor Kerry Leonetti who<br>just joined us from the University of<br>Oregon and she has an interest in<br>comparative Criminal Procedure and<br>miscarriages of justice and has been<br>involved in the Innocence Project in the<br>States she also has research and theresa<br>and high tech surveillance and data<br>privacy so a very very interesting suite<br>of interests and backgrounds in this<br>course we will teach you basic criminal<br>law principles so how to analyze the<br>components of a criminal offense we'll<br>cover a selection of the more serious<br>criminal offenses and some of our<br>general defenses and different pathways<br>to criminal liability so you'll have to<br>attend three lectures a week plus do the<br>tutorial program our assessment regime<br>consists of four things all of which are<br>compulsory so we have a court<br>observation exercise that's marked on a<br>pass/fail basis but you have to do it to<br>pass<br>course then we have a first semester<br>test which is worth 20% of your final<br>grade a tutorial essay which is worth<br>10% that takes place in the second<br>semester and our final examination which<br>is worth 10% so thank you very much<br>I look forward to seeing you next week<br>in our Cotto Couture call Janet mcclain<br>10a and I'm the course director of<br>public law and I'm gonna ask you the<br>question that I was asked when I was<br>sitting where you're sitting too many<br>years ago to disclose look to the right<br>of you and look to the left of you now<br>when I was asked that question I was at<br>the literacy ed and only one of you will<br>still be standing at the end of your law<br>degree but actually they asked the wrong<br>question what they should have asked me<br>was look to the right of you and look to<br>the left of you one of those people will<br>be the Minister of Justice and the other<br>will be a judge of the Court of Appeal<br>because in fact among my classmates one<br>of my classmates was Andrew little who's<br>no other Minister of Justice and one of<br>my classmates was Joe Williams who's now<br>a judge of the Court of Appeal politics<br>war both very good public lawyers I<br>won't disclose the rest of their exam<br>results now professor Tommy's been<br>talking to you about crime but what<br>gives the courts the power to even<br>punish crime can criminal penalties be<br>passed passed by Parliament be<br>challenged in the courts can a police<br>prosecution for public disordered<br>offense be challenged on the basis that<br>the accused was exercising her right of<br>free speech her right to protest<br>what about if the accused has followed<br>the police officer home and sung songs<br>outside her house while she was asleep<br>is that protected by freedom of speech<br>these are real cases these are cases<br>that we discuss in public law or what if<br>you've been charged with committing an<br>offense against the fishing regulations<br>and you claim that t Connor or Mari<br>customary law has authorized the taking<br>of that shellfish is there a defense in<br>that sort of case or what heaven forbid<br>we which are quickly you come along to<br>law school for a week and we expel you<br>we don't tell you that we're expelling<br>you we don't tell you the grounds on<br>which we're expelling you and we don't<br>give you a hearing about whether we were<br>expected this is public law or worse<br>what if we and this is a real case that<br>we'll discuss in class what if we give<br>you a hearing about whether we should<br>expel you but we don't actually disclose<br>to you this report that we've had that<br>is really damning of your character and<br>of what you've been doing this is public<br>law very useful I find a lot of students<br>not free engaged in public law but then<br>are really good at it when they're<br>challenging their assessment or whether<br>they should be applied right so it's<br>really useful and your law degree to do<br>well in public law so public law is<br>about the background institutions<br>against which law operates and be quite<br>honest the institutional bed is the<br>boring bit and that's a bit that I have<br>the privilege of teaching you at the<br>beginning of the year but it all gets a<br>lot better when all my colleagues come<br>in and we also are about teaching Yerba<br>the norms values and principles which<br>operate to give our constitutional our<br>Constitution life principles of natural<br>justice<br>Wright's tea color and so on so our<br>mission if we choose to accept it is to<br>persuade you that there is a<br>constitution and New Zealand and the<br>public law team will bring it to life to<br>you for you and I start off the year<br>first seven weeks of the course and then<br>we'll have associate professor annaroo<br>era Witte who would talk to you about<br>the executive he's currently involved in<br>the government and query into State care<br>so he'll be coming from that really big<br>government commitment to teach you then<br>doctors Jane Norton and Jessie wall well<br>who are over much more philosophical<br>bent I think will be leading you through<br>rights those of rights freedom from a<br>discrimination and then we in the year<br>with dr. Edward Willis who will be<br>teaching administrative law and the<br>sources of Maori law so expect politics<br>look to your left and look to your right<br>one's a politician and one's a lawyer<br>right expect politics and disagreement<br>in this course but it's not going to be<br>enough to just get the constitutional<br>vibe I want you to get the<br>constitutional vibe but we're also going<br>to have to I'm afraid read statutes very<br>closely indeed and weave into the<br>readings of statutes some of these<br>broader constitutional principles<br>there'll be three themes this year one<br>is the powerful position of executive<br>government that is the government of the<br>day and at the present time dissent<br>Rodin's coalition government the<br>relationship between politics and law as<br>a theme throughout the course and we're<br>also going to be looking at different<br>sources of constitutional authority not<br>just Parliament but international law<br>and tikanga Maori so those are the<br>things that we are considering a public<br>law and I hope you enjoy the ride and<br>I'll see you next week<br>right the first thing is to get my<br>portrait up there<br>I think they did a very good job hello<br>everyone welcome to part 2 my name is<br>Marcus Roberts as you can see up there<br>I'm the course director in 2019 for the<br>law of torts I'm going to tell you two<br>things today first I'm going to try and<br>answer what a tort is and why you should<br>study it and then to finish off I'll go<br>through three administrative points that<br>you will get more details on next week<br>so firstly let's start off with an easy<br>one it's easy you in to the to the<br>course<br>why study torts it's a very easy<br>question because you have to because<br>Bronwyn said that you can't go into part<br>three without it right okay let's move<br>on No why is it compulsory<br>well it's compulsory because torts<br>covers a wide variety of legal actions<br>in the private law sphere so we've heard<br>about criminal law from Professor Julia<br>Tommy we've heard about public law from<br>professor Janet McLane those are both<br>public law areas something to do with<br>the state care remember it was a long<br>time ago private law is about the law<br>between individuals two individuals<br>suing each other in court and in torts<br>we're looking at actions private law<br>actions individuals suing each other for<br>wrongs or if you look at the basis of<br>the word torts for crooked or twisted<br>actions into the word torsion torts it's<br>the same legal route so these are<br>actions<br>or events or things that people have<br>done to you or to the plaintiff that are<br>crooked or twisted or wrong we're not<br>looking at crimes<br>now the action complained of may very<br>well be a crime as well but we are<br>coming at it from a very different point<br>of view if someone punches you when<br>you're out of nice on Queen Street on<br>Saturday night that is the crime of<br>assault and the state via the police<br>might have a interest in taking you to<br>court and punishing you but you the<br>victim<br>that might not be what necessarily you<br>want to all of what you want and so<br>there is also taught the tort of Bathory<br>where you can sue individually the<br>person who punched you not to punish<br>them but to get money to get<br>compensation from them to put you in the<br>position you were in before you were<br>punched in so far as money can do that<br>so that's what torts are all about<br>private wrongs committed by one person<br>that the plaintiff is suing for and it<br>covers a huge variety of different<br>things so we start off and we look at<br>Bathory what I just talked about the<br>punch to the head assault if you come a<br>step closer I will pull this knife on<br>you run it through your guts that is<br>actually a case assault of course<br>confusingly does not mean the same thing<br>in in torts as crimes but we'll find out<br>about that throughout the year<br>and then you look at false imprisonment<br>if you go and doing it too if you go and<br>do an escape room does that constitute<br>and false imprisonment when you locked<br>in for an hour and you can't solve the<br>ridiculously hard puzzles that they have<br>not speaking from personal experience<br>but<br>what about defamation someone has<br>wrongfully defamed you lowered your<br>standing in the eyes of a right thinking<br>person what about if you've trespassed<br>on someone's leg well that's also a<br>torch what happens if you have failed to<br>secure the hill that's down the bottom<br>of your property and there's a lot of<br>rain and it slides and takes out your<br>neighbor's house that's also a tort and<br>that's the top story and what happens if<br>you then take someone's car for a<br>joyride well that's also a tort and<br>those are the sorts of things that would<br>be looking at in the first semester and<br>the second semester we will then go on<br>to the brilliant sunlit uplands that our<br>debtors negligence and negligence is<br>such a large and expanding field that in<br>50 years time there won't be four course<br>directors for part two standing here<br>telling people what's going to happen in<br>part two they'll only be one and don't<br>be the course director of negligence<br>every negligence is vastly expanding and<br>it is very very important what happens<br>when you were careless and caused harm<br>to someone else you don't intend to<br>cause that harm you don't intend to to<br>burn down their property when you're<br>playing with matches but it just<br>happened you were negligent we will look<br>at that all throughout semester two that<br>is also a taught we're not about breach<br>of promise that's another private law<br>that you might learn about and the law<br>of contract soon but we are looking at<br>private wrongs between individuals<br>okay so the administrative stuff there<br>are four lecturers this year myself<br>Nicky Chamberlin professor joy Manning<br>an Associate Professor Tim Cunha you<br>will learn more about them as they<br>throughout the year they're all<br>approachable lovely people and we all<br>have very different expertise and<br>background so hopefully we will bring<br>something different and valuable each to<br>the course<br>the first time the second administrative<br>point I want to make is that get online<br>get on to canvas that is your first stop<br>for information about the course if you<br>haven't done so for torts and you're in<br>torts as here go have a look the case<br>book is there the case book will also<br>shortly be available for sale and<br>hardcopy if you would like to but you<br>don't have to buy it and hardcopy if you<br>want to look at the cases online it's<br>available online now more than happy to<br>do so but whatever media the case book<br>comes through either hard copy or soft<br>copy you must read the case book torts<br>this very case heavy it is not statute<br>heavy you need to read them we don't<br>quite go back to the 14th century like<br>you do in contract but we do have cases<br>that are a little bit old not 14th<br>century but adult canvas is very<br>important secondly very importantly and<br>I understand differently from the other<br>two part two courses your tutorials that<br>you sign up for and semester one are the<br>tutorials that he was signing up for for<br>the entire year you stay in the same<br>time the same tutorial group with the<br>same tutor in torts for semester one and<br>semester two please please please please<br>please be aware of that when you sign up<br>for tutorials it carry through<br>throughout the year the reason we do<br>that is because there's a motion program<br>that takes place within that same<br>tutorial group throughout the year so be<br>aware of that when you're thinking about<br>signing up just be aware that you'll<br>have to fit your other part to your<br>other second semester courses around<br>them finally note there was a canvas<br>case book tutorials excellent ok you<br>will hear more about those<br>administrative things on Monday I will<br>be there to introduce you to the course<br>more fully thank you for listening<br>please enjoy torts enjoy the rest of<br>your parts who have a good time go well<br>and congratulations thank you<br>okay good morning everyone I'm Karen<br>Fairweather as you can see from the<br>slide and I am the course director for<br>contract law I'd like to begin by giving<br>you a very very warm welcome to add to<br>the welcome you've already had and many<br>congratulations on getting this far<br>contract law or maybe last on the agenda<br>today but it's certainly a case of last<br>but not least in terms of the relevance<br>and importance of this subject I'd like<br>to begin with a piece of good news and<br>that is that while a minority of you<br>will so far have had direct experience<br>of criminal law or the law of tort I can<br>safely assure you all that everyone in<br>this room today is already at a<br>practical level an expert in contract<br>law you all have engaged in a myriad of<br>day-to-day activities that are based on<br>the law of contract you may not realize<br>it as yet but you have so for example<br>every time you get on a bus or a train<br>you buy a cup of coffee in the morning<br>you order a meal in a restaurant you do<br>your supermarket shop you have entered<br>into a contract and every time you<br>access the internet at home if you think<br>about it you're actually doing that on a<br>contractual basis contract also<br>underlies those big happy moments of our<br>lives that we remember so things like<br>buy your first house getting your first<br>job that's all based on the law of<br>contract and crucially the law of<br>contract really is the backbone and the<br>facilitator of the business and<br>commercial world so for those of you who<br>may have your heart set on earning the<br>really big bucks as commercial lawyers<br>and I can see dollar signs shining from<br>a few eyes out there take heed contract<br>law is very very important indeed it's<br>important in its own right as a<br>checked and I hope you'll see that this<br>year but it's also important because the<br>general basic principles of the law of<br>contract you're going to get this year<br>underlie so many other areas of law that<br>you may be interested in in practicing<br>in the future so take for example<br>employment law or banking law or the law<br>of insurance those are specialist areas<br>of law they have their own special rules<br>whether those rules have been created by<br>the legislature or by the courts but<br>those special rules sit on top of this<br>foundation of these general basic<br>principles of contract law which we're<br>going to study this year so when I say<br>contract law is absolutely foundational<br>I mean it in quite a literal sense and<br>we'll do our very very best by the end<br>of this year to ensure that you have a<br>theoretical and academic knowledge of<br>contracting that matches the practical<br>experience you've actually already got<br>of this subject to put it another way we<br>hope that by the end of this year when<br>you tag on on the bus in the morning or<br>you buy your morning cup of coffee<br>you've become thoroughly self-conscious<br>about it all and I mean that in a<br>positive way of course so in a nutshell<br>what is the law of contract all about I<br>think at the heart of it is this idea of<br>a contract as a consensual agreement<br>between the parties whereby the parties<br>voluntarily undertake obligations that's<br>the core idea agreements or promise but<br>what we see is that actually it's a<br>little bit more complicated than that<br>because sometimes not often but<br>sometimes the law actually imposes<br>contractual obligations on the parties<br>and sometimes you have what to a lay<br>person may look like a consensual<br>but for some technical reason the law<br>says we will not enforce that as a legal<br>contract so that's the heart of contract<br>law um<br>I think it's best thought about as a<br>story with a beginning a middle and an<br>end and that's certainly the structure<br>that we follow in this course so three<br>parts and as quite conveniently there<br>are three of us teaching into this<br>course we will broadly cover with a<br>couple of overlaps or things that don't<br>fit quite neatly we broadly cover one<br>part each now you've already met Warren<br>this morning and Warren will be kicking<br>off with the first part of the story the<br>beginning of the story and in line with<br>Warren's sunny optimistic temperament<br>Warren is going to deal with this happy<br>beginning of the story where the parties<br>are establishing their contractual<br>relationship<br>everything's optimistic it's all going<br>to go well so Warren will be looking in<br>the force first for weeks with you at<br>contract formation and the requirements<br>that the law says have to be there for<br>an agreement to have the status of a<br>contract then it's over to me and I'll<br>spend the first two weeks finishing off<br>that but I'm afraid when we get into the<br>middle of the story we get beset by<br>paranoia neurosis and soul-searching<br>perhaps that says something about me as<br>well but this is where we start asking<br>questions like well we've got a contract<br>but what are the terms of the contract<br>are those the complete terms of the<br>contract have we miss something is there<br>something that the court needs to imply<br>into this contract that we haven't said<br>what on earth is it that we've we meant<br>when we use the words that we did in our<br>contract so that's the middle of the<br>story and I'll be dealing with that<br>aspect<br>and then finally we move into a stage of<br>really doom and gloom because the end of<br>the story this obviously doesn't happen<br>in real life normally contracts all end<br>happily everyone does what they're<br>supposed to do but we're academics so we<br>don't think like that<br>and in stage three you're going to look<br>at what happens when it all goes wrong<br>what happens when one party refuses to<br>perform or performs their side of the<br>deal defectively what remedies does the<br>other party have in that sort of<br>situation what happens if one party<br>turns to the other and said well okay we<br>had a contract but actually I entered<br>into that contract under a mistake or I<br>entered into the contract because you<br>misled me that's the doom and gloom<br>stage and that will be dealt with by<br>Professor Dawson in semester two so I<br>hope that gives you just some flavor of<br>the structure of the course finally just<br>a couple of practical matters I know<br>that Warren emailed you last week and<br>told you all about the case book and<br>readings etc I just wanted to briefly<br>mention assessment all this is set out<br>in canvas so please have a careful look<br>at this but there are three items of<br>assessment you'll have a test in late<br>May which I think is 20% a tutorial<br>essay due at the beginning of semester<br>two which is worth 10% and that final<br>exam at the end of semester two I'd like<br>to finish with just a word of advice to<br>you and this is about tutorials<br>tutorials are not actually compulsory in<br>this course nonetheless there's really<br>no substitute for that practice of<br>taking problem questions identifying<br>issues and applying the law to those<br>facts you may feel that you have a good<br>grasp of the principles we teach you in<br>the lectures in abstract but it's not<br>until you really come to apply those<br>principles to factual situations that<br>you really start to test<br>knowledge and understanding so I think<br>really key to success in this course is<br>really engaging in the tutorials really<br>participate fully and prepare thoroughly<br>your tutorials really are your friend in<br>this school so please make the best of<br>them that's it from me I really look<br>forward to getting to know you all a bit<br>better when I take her from over from<br>Warren in week 5 and in the meantime I<br>wish you a great start to the semester<br>all right so we've heard that it's hard<br>to get into law school harder to get out<br>this is Maya in my opinion a really good<br>test to see your intelligence whether<br>you're going to survive or you might not<br>so it's better physical exercise I want<br>you to put your hand out in front of you<br>and then turn your palms away so they're<br>facing away and then put one palm over<br>the other clasp your hands together so<br>that your thumbs are at the bottom cool<br>well let's make sure your thumbs are at<br>one all right if you're gonna make it<br>through school you better do this we<br>count of three I want you just twist<br>next up we have a seminar on study<br>techniques and tutorials from senior<br>lecturer Rob Betty so please give him a<br>welcome thank you hello everyone<br>really really really good to see some<br>familiar faces some of you probably<br>thought that was the last you'll ever<br>see of me but now I'm back and yes I've<br>even put on a suit today in a tie much<br>to my family's amusement when I walked<br>out the door but today I'm actually<br>wearing my associate dean teaching and<br>learning hat and I've been asked to talk<br>to you about study techniques and<br>tutorials so in preparation for this<br>little talk I emailed and chat it to all<br>of our wonderful course directors that<br>we've just met and they asked them to<br>think about what would you advise your<br>incoming classes to do what kind of<br>behaviour what kind of techniques would<br>you suggest would help them maximize<br>their chances of success and luckily<br>they see a whole lot of common things<br>now some of these kind of obvious but<br>hopefully within this list you might<br>pick up something of use the first one<br>is to attend your lectures which is kind<br>of an obvious thing for home course<br>directors and lecturers to say but<br>everyone thought it was really important<br>that you turn up to lectures because<br>listening to the recordings is just not<br>the same the actual experience of<br>turning up to a lecture has really<br>beneficial the second thing is to<br>actively listen and the key word there<br>is actively listen and take notes now<br>I'm going to say something controversial<br>about that a little bit later<br>but sometimes I understand there's a bit<br>of a black market of previous years<br>notes that sounds wonderful but I don't<br>think it really helps you it's the<br>actual process of taking notes that's<br>really important<br>the third thing they see is to ask<br>questions now some of you may be shy<br>like me and I didn't ask a question or<br>talk to a lecturer the whole time I was<br>at Law School but even though I didn't<br>do that<br>actively paying attention to the<br>questions that are asked are really<br>important you can also as you're<br>learning note your own questions talk to<br>them with your peers and perhaps even<br>use your lecturers office hours to go<br>through those questions but again<br>noticing the questions and noticing the<br>answers is really important related to<br>that the course directors suggested you<br>think about utilizing their office hours<br>now even for law one for one for some of<br>my office hours are sitting there by<br>myself I had allocated that time I had<br>put those two hours of three hours of<br>side and it's often the case that people<br>don't utilize those office hours but<br>think about doing that that's a good way<br>to clarify concepts to ask the questions<br>you're perhaps too shy to ask during<br>class the fifth one is about preparation<br>nearly everyone said the preparation is<br>important as Marcus talked about for<br>Kate for a subject like torts there's<br>going to be a lot of cases same to for<br>contract now I remember when I was at<br>law school that I was mostly one of my<br>strongest memories is highlighters sort<br>of dimly Europe let rooms and case books<br>it really does help sometimes just<br>reading the cases over and over again<br>well not necessarily over and over again<br>just reading one case and then another<br>case it really builds your ability to<br>think about legal argument and think<br>about the area of law<br>so they said preparation number six was<br>a suggestion by Janet which is really<br>important for a subject like public law<br>don't expect things to be settled and<br>for there to necessarily be a clear<br>answer all the time and she talked about<br>thinking about cases and issues from<br>both sides of the coin<br>think about counter arguments think<br>about the main arguments being put<br>forward the seventh suggestion I had was<br>to be smart in terms of your exam<br>preparation and to use previous exams<br>which are all available to practice one<br>of the things I found and I talked about<br>last year is that there is such thing as<br>a exam technique and some people have<br>wonderful exam technique and they do<br>very well because of it the good thing<br>is we can all improve through practice<br>and the last thing picks up on something<br>that Karen said treat tutorials<br>seriously now because I was going to<br>talk to you as associate dean teaching<br>and learning I thought I'd better put in<br>collection of data<br>and what I want you to look at is<br>perhaps those bottom four particularly<br>the bottom three so the evidence seems<br>to be pretty strong that the one of the<br>best ways to learn is to teach someone<br>else and tutorials give you that<br>opportunity they give you an opportunity<br>to learn together to talk things over<br>with your peers and it's really<br>important for a subject like law so I<br>make the most of your tutorials and<br>sometimes it'll be hard to have the time<br>to do the preparation but again that<br>preparation is going to be important for<br>tutorials the more you put in the more<br>you will take out as Karen alluded to as<br>well often the tutorials are another way<br>to practice but practice in a safe<br>environment often the tutorials are<br>framed around previous exam questions or<br>test questions so coming along to<br>tutorial having the opportunity to talk<br>really it's invaluable and I strongly<br>encourage you to do it so for all of<br>those double semester courses you have<br>to look forward to criminal public torts<br>in contract there's eight tutorial<br>arounds for in each semester now the<br>last thing I one of the things I see at<br>the beginning was I was gonna say<br>something provocative this is what I'm<br>gonna say I was listening to a blog the<br>other day you know as you don't<br>listening to a law blog by law professor<br>and they started talking about the<br>evidence around laptops now even when I<br>teach you guys will have taught you guys<br>in part one theirs off<br>the notion of laptops looking back at me<br>there's now pretty strong evidence that<br>there's something about handwriting<br>there's something about making notes<br>that's different from laptop note-taking<br>now I've got a reference there to a<br>study it's very scientific has graphs<br>has formulas I read the abstract took<br>the abstract way but the main point is<br>if you were typing on a laptop you tend<br>to just copy down everything the<br>lecturer says but if you're taking notes<br>is more of an opportunity to synthesize<br>what's being said reflect on what's<br>being said and in doing so kind of<br>encode that in your memory now this is<br>just me being provocative this is no<br>compulsion whatsoever just something to<br>think about<br>a number of us professors at law schools<br>have banned laptops in their classrooms<br>I would ever go that far but just<br>something to think about in terms of<br>your learning and study techniques so<br>that's all I wanted to say today but I<br>also wanted to reiterate how wonderful<br>it is to see some familiar faces and to<br>say to you as has been said before<br>sincere and heartfelt congratulations<br>for making it into part 2 I hope you do<br>very well and enjoy the journey in part<br>2 and if you see me around<br>lis please do not hesitate to say hello<br>alright guys we're gonna have a bit of a<br>break 15 minutes if you can all come<br>back at 10:45 on dot they'll be great<br>all right Curie everyone we will make<br>such<br>welcome back we're in our second half<br>we're getting there our first session is<br>on law to 9x now as Julia and Bronwyn<br>would have said earlier on in the day<br>one of the compulsory courses that you<br>have to do is to nine eight I want to<br>say this it may not be about a specific<br>area of the law like some of these other<br>courses that you had introduction to but<br>from experience is somebody now working<br>in the law this is the most I'm not even<br>kidding like the most important of<br>course you'll ever dude if you go out<br>and practice law this is the kind of<br>stuff you'll need to know in order to do<br>your job day and day out so it's a very<br>useful one to wake up for if you're not<br>already so please introduce Nicola runs<br>the NGO waiting hello everyone I hope<br>you're enjoying your morning's so far<br>today so that was a great introduction<br>good promotion for the course and we<br>show and I really hope you enjoy it so<br>I'm Nikki ruins Lee my colleagues are we<br>doing over there she'll take over in a<br>few minutes we are learning and teaching<br>development advisers and we work for<br>libraries and learning services so part<br>of what we do is help the law faculty<br>with academic and information literacy<br>in their courses so we are the team that<br>look after the legal research component<br>of law two nine eight and asrama would<br>have said this morning is also the<br>writing and communication component so<br>what I'll talk about now is just the<br>legal research component of the course<br>so we'll go over the content and<br>structure of this component and just to<br>make sure everyone's clear on exactly<br>what's required it just to remember that<br>20% of your mark for law two nine eight<br>will come from this legal research<br>component so it's good probably a good<br>time to get familiar with what you will<br>be asked to do so what do we mean when<br>we say our research or legal research<br>and there's really no one definition but<br>we pretty much mean the process of<br>seeking out material for the purpose of<br>extending existing knowledge so we all<br>do this all the time every day<br>so when we talk about legal research<br>we're talking about<br>to research that process of seeking out<br>information within the legal field to<br>hopefully extend your knowledge and<br>assist you with your assignments the the<br>basic point is that if you do not<br>research you cannot write so whenever<br>you're asked to do a piece of legal<br>writing in any of your papers it will<br>always involve a first step of that<br>legal research process so the legal<br>research component of law to know we'll<br>start building those essential legal<br>research skills so we will look at our<br>legal research process and this is the<br>basic diagram that we follow and so for<br>law 298 we mostly focus on the second<br>step which is the part where you will go<br>out and consult primary and secondary<br>sources for information and then that<br>information you will then use to produce<br>a piece of writing so for your research<br>to be successful it's really important<br>to follow a logical progression and do<br>some planning before you jump into the<br>databases and that's a little bit of<br>what will help you do to be prepared<br>before you sort of jump in to find all<br>this really useful information and we<br>will go through this diagram in more<br>detail in the first lecture in the first<br>two weeks so just to go through the<br>structure of the legal research<br>component there's two parts basically so<br>weeks one and two you will all come to a<br>face-to-face lecture and Joey and I will<br>take you through a few basics and<br>reiterate what's required to pass the<br>course the legal research component at<br>least and there'll be five online<br>modules and these you'll work through<br>independently in terms of the assessment<br>you will have two online tests with 10%<br>each as I see it week one and two you<br>will have a face-to-face lecture five<br>online modules for independent study two<br>online tests with 10% each so the way<br>the first two weeks will work is that<br>you will have enrolled into a lecture<br>time in both those weeks but you do not<br>need to come to two lectures so you just<br>need to come to one and one week one in<br>the other week so the way it will work<br>is if your surname begins with a to K<br>you need to come to your lit time and<br>week<br>if your surname begins with l2 Zed you<br>need to come to your lecture time and<br>week 2 okay so it's it's 8 versions of<br>the same lecture so you do only need to<br>come to one so come to your enrolled<br>time in the week that matches your<br>surname and just note your booking in<br>your online timetable we'll say two<br>hours it should probably only take one<br>hour ok so a bit a bit a bit of time<br>back in your lives yeah so that's the<br>main thing to remember so that's weeks<br>weeks one and two four weeks three to<br>six there will be no classes but you<br>will be expected to be working through<br>module one and module two of the online<br>content as end of an independent study<br>okay so that's what you'll be doing<br>weeks three to six you have a wee break<br>then and from week seven and eight<br>onwards you'll start your regular<br>fortnightly law - nine eight classes<br>which you all will be enrolled with and<br>that will be the writing and<br>communication part of the content and<br>then you'll also have modules three to<br>five of the legal research online<br>component released during that time as<br>well for independent study okay<br>we'll go over this again next week and<br>the week after and weeks one and two<br>just to make sure everyone's clear so in<br>terms of the online modules there'll be<br>five and they will be released at<br>different times during semester one<br>these are the basic dates if there's any<br>changes to these release dates we will<br>let you know we will also put an<br>announcement on canvas once modulars<br>published and you'll be able to see it<br>from that day onwards so we'll remind<br>you that way as well and so canvas the<br>law - not at canvas page is the place to<br>go to access the online modules each of<br>the modules will contain videos and PDF<br>documents and it's recommended that you<br>work through all the material that's<br>provided to you and you do this<br>independently just to make sure that you<br>are all ready for the online tests which<br>will assess these online modules you'll<br>need to schedule time to work on these<br>outside of your other classes<br>and from week seven and eight onwards<br>obviously you'll need to schedule time<br>outside of your law to night classes as<br>well so we recommend about two hours per<br>module that'll probably be about how<br>long it takes you to work through the<br>material and then practice the skills<br>that those videos take you through in<br>terms of the assessments as I see a two<br>online tests with 10% H online test one<br>will be released to you on the first of<br>April<br>8:00 a.m. and you can complete it any<br>time after that it's due on the 7th of<br>May 12 known it's accessible via canvas<br>so that's where you will find the online<br>tests now online test one will assess<br>the skills learnt in modules one and two<br>so don't start online test one until<br>you've done all the material in both<br>module 1 and module 2 because you'll get<br>questions relating to content from both<br>the modules and that one test and now it<br>says online test 1 again it should say<br>online test two<br>that's released on the 27th of May 8<br>a.m. and that is due the 2nd of August<br>12 noon so you've got quite a long time<br>at work on online test 2 and practice<br>the skills that you'll need to pass that<br>one and that will assess skills learnt<br>in modules 3 &amp; 4 and as I said those<br>tests once they are released will be via<br>access via canvas and we will put a<br>announcement out to let you know that<br>the tests are now ready to start if you<br>wish to just note that module 5 which<br>will be released quite late in semester<br>1 or the beginning of semester 2 is not<br>assessed ok so it's still really useful<br>content and will still be really useful<br>to you but it will not form part of the<br>assessment so its modules 1 2 3 &amp; 4 that<br>will be assessed a little bit more<br>information about those tests each test<br>will have 10 questions they're<br>Christians are shuffled so you will not<br>get the same test as your friends so<br>there's no point sitting together with<br>your computers and trying to do it<br>together you all will have different<br>questions we work very hard to create<br>lots of Christians so that it won't<br>happen the two tests will be the same<br>you get two hours to complete<br>the test that's quite a long time I<br>would expect 20 to 40 minutes depending<br>on how quick he work through but you do<br>have up to two hours and you have two<br>attempts at each test so if the first<br>attempt doesn't go quite so well and you<br>want another go you can have another go<br>and whatever mark is the highest will be<br>the one that goes towards your grade and<br>so do have another go if the first one<br>isn't so good there are no exceptions<br>available for the online test so it is<br>important that you work through the<br>modules you do your practice and then<br>you complete the test by the due date<br>because we don't give extensions for<br>those now at the end of each module<br>there will be sort of practice questions<br>that you can do once you've gone through<br>the content and we highly recommend that<br>you take that opportunity to practice<br>before doing the online test<br>so what you'll get in those practice<br>tests will be very similar to what you<br>see in the actual test so a really good<br>chance to make sure you've got all the<br>skills down on our pass over to Yahweh<br>who's going to take you through to the<br>canvas page to give you a look at how<br>this all looks there okay good morning<br>everyone first of all congratulations on<br>making it into part 2 I have to make it<br>clear that you won't see the your course<br>now because course has not been<br>published I'm going to show you a live<br>demo and we'll just in my login so you<br>will see that just unpublished all mode<br>sorry<br>this is 2 not 8 so

got a navigations you<br>got modules here so it's not visible yet<br>and if you click on modules here are the<br>modules we were talking about and you<br>need this is only module 1 under each<br>modules we<br>something I'm just take one example here<br>loss of New Zealand and we have learning<br>objectives so after you watch the videos<br>you will achieve these learning<br>objectives you will see what you're<br>going to achieve and also if you up to<br>here if you click on the picture you<br>it's quite quite low and also we have<br>some demo help teach you how to search<br>in the

advances so you can<br>click on that and get into the database<br>and practice straightway from this<br>module from this section of the module<br>you can you can go back to the module<br>itself or you can click on this previous<br>you got into dictionary floor and you<br>can click on next to navigate between<br>the different sections of the module<br>alright if I click on back to the<br>modules and you have a multiple sections<br>within the module and as Nikki said<br>remember to click on this test yourself<br>we haven't put anything yet but this<br>test yourself will contain questions<br>similar to the one in your real test so<br>this is a very good opportunity of<br>practice the similar question not the<br>same question but a similar type of<br>questions so you will see that<br>and as soon as we put up the Chris and<br>you should be able to access your<br>requests here under assignment so here<br>you'll have online test one or you can<br>access your request from quizzes here<br>it's kind of great and after it<br>published it will become you can click<br>on here there will be online tests one<br>right any questions about how to find<br>the modules and reduce and everything<br>good so you're not studying in isolation<br>so we also provide we will provide some<br>dropping sessions and we will advertise<br>these sessions on canvas so please keep<br>an eye on your announcement and the<br>sessions will happen in balcony computer<br>lab at the Davis law library I think<br>some of you might be familiar with the<br>lab you go into the library and just on<br>your right hand side so pay attention to<br>your announcement so here get some tips<br>for completing the course successfully<br>so make sure you work through all the<br>modules and independently outside your<br>class time you have to use your this is<br>a self-paced learning so you can use<br>your own time and at your own pace and<br>make sure you watch all the videos and<br>make sure you schedule some time to<br>practice using databases you wire using<br>the test test yourself questions and you<br>will see what type of questions in your<br>real test and if you have any question<br>you can just come along<br>okay that's pretty much about us any<br>questions<br>well good all right guys so if there's<br>one person you should know while you're<br>here and also it's quota I kid you not<br>so this is a fantastic place we've<br>talked all about the stuff that you<br>learn in class but at the end of the day<br>most of you are here to get a kick-ass<br>job and have some success in their job<br>whatever that success might look like<br>and it doesn't matter how good your<br>grades are you will not give their<br>success unless you prepare outside of<br>the classroom as well<br>and clutter is your key to doing that so<br>we've got a session from quota and how<br>I have known care for quite a while and<br>I'm very proud to see what care is<br>achieving in his professional life it's<br>always amazing to see so I am Kody<br>Higgins and I am the employer engagement<br>manager I've actually had a job title<br>since you saw me last year I'm now<br>career development an employer<br>engagement manager and so Who am I and<br>so great about mantra you're very lucky<br>I am still the only me in New Zealand we<br>are the only law school that has a<br>dedicated career service within the<br>faculty so my advice to you is usage the<br>amount of students that go through their<br>degree and only start thinking about<br>their career towards the end it's almost<br>too late you'll be stressed you'll<br>struggle<br>come see me early I'm really helpful and<br>I'm quite nice okay we did this last<br>year so you're probably looking at me<br>going where are you that lazy that you<br>didn't update your slides no and I just<br>want to do another check-in so I'm gonna<br>read eight three career statements or<br>we're gonna do the standing up B City<br>day anything so I'm gonna read the three<br>H and then we're gonna ask you back and<br>you're gonna stand up with the one you<br>most agree with I want to be a lawyer<br>and the LLB program is how I get to do<br>that I'm thinking about being a lawyer<br>but willing to keep my options open I<br>have absolutely no intention of being a<br>lawyer but I know that the LLB degree is<br>a great degree to have and my parents<br>may have made me do it<br>okay statement 1 stand up if you<br>definitely 100% want to be a lawyer and<br>you know this is the way to do it well I<br>think that's gone down from last year ok<br>today I'm thinking about being a lawyer<br>yep okay you go to sit down I had<br>absolutely no intention of being a<br>lawyer<br>Gary sit dad but I know that the LLB<br>degree is a great degree to have slash<br>anything else okay I accept and<br>acknowledge all your stances on life so<br>far but stay open and keep your blinkers<br>off while you're at law school take<br>every opportunity to find out about<br>being a lawyer or being one of the<br>million other things you can do with a<br>law degree but it's your job to educate<br>yourself no one else can take<br>responsibility for you okay quiz time so<br>once again you'll be sitting for a while<br>there's only so much wisdom I could<br>depart to you in ten minutes so we might<br>as well make it a bit of fun and get the<br>blood going again okay this is one of<br>those ones so you stand up if you agree<br>with the statement everyone got that<br>it's not what you know it's who you know<br>okay today okay false but there is a<br>bunch sure it's not that there is some<br>marriage across becoming a ship here but<br>use the time you have at Law School to<br>meet as many people from the industry<br>you're choosing to go into the law<br>school bends itself backwards bringing<br>you practitioners to lecture I bring in<br>so many practitioners I'm sick of the<br>sight of them by the end of the year it<br>is your responsibility to get out of<br>your comfort zone make time in your<br>timetable to come meet these people when<br>people come to the law school they<br>really want to talk to you they want to<br>help and they want to depart their<br>knowledge so you guys every opportunity<br>you can to grow your networks and when I<br>say the word networking law students go<br>it's not that scary it's having a<br>genuine conversation with someone it's<br>not a you have job I want job give me<br>the job okay question number two a law<br>degree has a limited number of career<br>paths stand up if you agree oh you guys<br>are good<br>whoever's at fault so you can do<br>whatever you want essentially and while<br>you're at law school there are some<br>conversations that happen that you have<br>to get into certain types of law or you<br>have to do this or you have to that do<br>whatever you want is my life advice but<br>think about how you're gonna get there<br>and also remember if you're a school<br>leaver you probably have at least 45<br>years of working in front of you four<br>and a half decades to put that you have<br>plenty of time to achieve as many career<br>objectives as you want so keep your mind<br>open and also this whole thing that<br>we've been talking about but no one<br>really knows what it means we don't know<br>what the future is gonna hold<br>if you told my parents when they're in<br>first year that we'd have the internet<br>they would have been very confused one<br>so we just send these messages on a<br>computer and that's a formal way of<br>communicating what so we don't know what<br>the future is going to hold so what we<br>need from you guys is gonna change okay<br>I am guaranteed a job straight out of<br>sorry but false yeah look you guys have<br>to work hard but you will get there you<br>are smart you have a law degree from<br>Auckland law school but you have to work<br>while you're here as well as working on<br>your degree okay why do you think<br>employers look for from Lowell graduates<br>anyone want to hazard a guess yep<br>yes that's a good one okay are you in a<br>pipe in you hire what do you want from<br>these guys tell us I put him on the spot<br>I did not warn him I was going to do<br>this so yes I would agree yep people<br>skills yes absolutely lawyers deal with<br>people anything else okay here's a list<br>just write them down analytical thinking<br>problem-solving initiative communication<br>a passion for what they do that's the<br>big one if you can showcase event they<br>know you know nothing when you work<br>start working with them they want you to<br>be passionate about what they do they'll<br>teach you that they'll train you but<br>they want to make sure you have the<br>right mindset you have the right passion<br>and everything else will fall into place<br>okay what to do while you're sitting<br>maintain your grade so make sure you do<br>other stuff now you're probably thinking<br>I've been sitting here for less than two<br>hours and they're already going on about<br>grades that doesn't mean it has to be<br>this magical number that seems to<br>circulate around the law school just do<br>the best that you can do be proud of the<br>grades you get not everyone is an A+<br>student that's absolutely fine but make<br>sure you're doing the very best you can<br>do the other stuff is what we call the<br>co-curricular SH the stuff that happens<br>inside the classroom whether it be your<br>church whether it be your football club<br>whether it be a club of society you got<br>to get involved educate yourself on your<br>career you're not semester is too late<br>I'm actually not that helpful it's<br>usually a panicked crying conversation<br>you need to start thinking about a night<br>you don't need to make a decision now<br>but you need to start thinking about it<br>get involved there's a reason why<br>everyone says this you've probably heard<br>this a few times already this morning<br>hey it's fun B you make friends see it's<br>good for your mental well-being but also<br>it gives you great transferrable soft<br>skills get some work experience<br>volunteer an internship a summer<br>clerkship these words probably all sound<br>quite technical of foreign but get<br>involved and make sure you got some<br>experience while you're here grow your<br>networks okay that's me at 1:00 shadow<br>Sh<br>and we're doing the pop-up move to vent<br>again this year so we partner with the<br>pop-up globe and we do this incredibly<br>fun event where the pop-up globe actors<br>run around and create a scene and then<br>students moot the linker problem it's a<br>really fun event but you also get to<br>meet practitioners last year we brought<br>in a bunch of Q C's brought a load of<br>lawyers from Anthony Harper and they<br>were dying to talk to students so not<br>only is it a really fun event you get to<br>see a moot you get to meet lots of<br>practitioners so make sure you go and it<br>you can come whenever you want and I am<br>very busy in March so if you're a state<br>trooper I'd rather you waited until<br>after March because a lot of our panels<br>but your students are getting ready for<br>summer Clark application and but the<br>sooner you see me the better I'm rather<br>fearsome mean when you first meet me and<br>I will say what have you been doing your<br>entire life that's okay it's because I<br>see so many students and we can go<br>through your CV and I could point out<br>fit stuff maybe need to develop a bit<br>more yep any other questions no yeah oh<br>yes please take it all down and so how<br>you RSVPs by emailing law student<br>engagement at both ends edge you can<br>bring as many people as you want<br>essentially if you want to bring a<br>friend or a partner or a family member<br>and there's parent pizza at the end any<br>all right speaking of co-curricular<br>stuff who's heard of Auckland law review<br>you guys I was trying to figure out<br>where I saw this nickname from and I<br>think the last time I finally register<br>the last time I saw Gary I think I was<br>singing a Kendrick Lamar song is Sky<br>City and you might not have had all your<br>clothes on Gary Hoffman everybody hi<br>everyone as you can see by the screen<br>behind me my name is Gary Hoffman and I<br>am a law student um well done for<br>getting into part two huge achievement I<br>remember when I received notice that I<br>got into part two hours in the middle of<br>the bush in South Africa and I was like<br>whooping on my dad was like shut up look<br>above you and there was a born slung in<br>the tree above our sleeping so like fun<br>story but anyway um with with a little<br>bit about me I'm in the final semester<br>of my degree and I'm thank you I am so<br>excited to finish I also do knots degree<br>majoring in drama and history besides<br>uni I'm involved with my community I'm<br>involved with other co-curricular stuff<br>I'm involved in the organ theater scene<br>and when I was asked to talk to you<br>today I thought to myself what do I wish<br>I learned from this here had I turned up<br>because I didn't come to this when I was<br>two so I've got nine handy tips for you<br>I couldn't think of a tenth I was also<br>convinced tin is like has a hegemony<br>over numbers so nine handy tips<br>and I'm sure you've actually heard a lot<br>of these I wasn't listening to most of<br>what you've been hearing so I'm so sorry<br>if I'm just giving you the same spiel<br>again um number one complacency is your<br>worst enemy too many times people come<br>into part two and they'll sort of like<br>oh I'm in now so they can't really kick<br>me out um false but also the hard work<br>doesn't stop here it is it is not time<br>now to to stop working just because<br>you're in and in fact now that you're in<br>you want to start to do even better this<br>is this is when employers will start to<br>look at these subjects your core<br>subjects your part two subjects there<br>are extremely important for laying the<br>foundations for your electives so make<br>sure that you continue working really<br>hard second tip don't disregard your<br>other degree I'm sure a lot of you guys<br>are doing Khan joins right yeah I'd see<br>a few vacant nods which is like yes your<br>other degree can be a huge point of<br>difference for you up until a few years<br>ago I was the only person in New Zealand<br>doing a drama conjoint with law it's<br>pretty cool but on top of that it can be<br>really really helpful with what you're<br>studying it can lay other foundations<br>for what you're learning if you're doing<br>history a lot of what we cover is the<br>history of the law in our subjects and<br>on top of that there are other amazing<br>networks and facilities in the other<br>schools that can help you out on top of<br>that it also somewhat becomes<br>recreational at a point it did for me I<br>told us the other day as well I used to<br>read my law readings no no I still do<br>read by law reading so I'm sorry I am<br>when I was reading my law readings I<br>would sort of read five pages of my law<br>readings and as a<br>ward I'd let myself read a history<br>reading which sounds awfully nerdy<br>because it is but um it was it was<br>really nice to have something else to go<br>back to because sometimes law school can<br>become a bit monotonous word and um<br>so don't disregard it that's what I'm<br>trying to say um number three which I<br>know you've probably heard a lot get<br>involved with things um<br>apply for everything I mean everything<br>it's really fun um I could tell you what<br>you would expect to hear you'll make<br>great friends for life and will look<br>great on your CV but there are things on<br>top of that that applying to everything<br>and doing co-curricular as the benefits<br>of them become quite obvious when you do<br>them um so yes it's true you'll make<br>great friends and and it'll look great<br>on your CV but you will also have a sort<br>of well-being Network set up for you if<br>you join these co-curricular because<br>when when shite hits the fan it's nice<br>to have a group of people that you can<br>be with who are also going through the<br>same experiences as you and I want to<br>cave yet something rejection is fine<br>rejection is human it's normal life goes<br>on and and it doesn't mean that you<br>shouldn't apply for things again a lot<br>of the times when people get and know<br>they think oh that's it my life's over I<br>can't do anything else but um that's not<br>true if you if you get a rejection<br>letter if you if you receive a no what<br>you do after that is really what matters<br>if you continue to apply and then you<br>get in after being rejected it's it's a<br>huge show of resilience and it's a huge<br>show of really wanting to be involved um<br>I can give you an example for me um when<br>I was in my third year I third year I<br>applied to be elected onto a ul SS which<br>you'll hear about more about later<br>I wanted to myself and a friend we<br>wanted to be<br>the educational vice presidents of a ul<br>SS so we put ourselves up for elections<br>we lost terribly we like like they were<br>like 300 votes to like 18 like like I'm<br>saying like we got smashed it was it was<br>it was embarrassing um but you know what<br>the next year myself and another friend<br>um another friend because the friend<br>that I applied with the first time was<br>on exchange throw it out there but um we<br>applied to be a VP's the next year and<br>and this time we smashed everyone else<br>and so I think some key points to take<br>from there is we were showing a real<br>commitment to the role people definitely<br>saw that they saw that there was<br>reallocation they saw that we we<br>genuinely wanted we didn't want it for<br>the wrong reasons and that makes a huge<br>difference in a lot of people's eyes<br>number four don't struggle in silence<br>this is a really really important one<br>our mental well-being is extremely<br>important to us personally um there's a<br>lot of omens happening something to<br>point out to you guys everybody is<br>entitled to six free sessions with the<br>University counselors oh yeah it's like<br>it's like a coffee card you get six and<br>they're like kind of stamp it um use<br>that resource it is super super super<br>important that you use that resource if<br>you need it don't bottle it up um the<br>the counselors are amazing they they can<br>help you with literally anything well<br>with a lot of things they can do the<br>simplest practical things they can help<br>you make a study calendar or a guide or<br>they can just be people to talk to if<br>you're feeling really down use the<br>service don't struggle in silence make<br>sure you tell someone number five this<br>wasn't around when I was in part two<br>there's a note bank if you are on the a<br>ul SS page go into the details section<br>there's a link it takes you to a Google<br>Drive the note Bank is incredible it is<br>a resource that has past people's notes<br>something that you might have heard is<br>is at law school that's kind of about<br>who you know this this resource was<br>created to mitigate that you no longer<br>need to know an older student to get<br>past notes the note Bank is there so<br>that everybody can access things and<br>everyone can be on a level playing field<br>it is an amazing resource do not think<br>that just because you have passed notes<br>that you don't need to make your own<br>notes so you don't need to go to class<br>that's not true<br>made that mistake seriously<br>it's it's very it's a very great<br>resource but it's a resource to be used<br>number six open book<br>exams are not as easy as they seem I<br>will showing you this one as well<br>you guys all in part one would have only<br>had closed book exams right you had an<br>open book exam oh I didn't do that one<br>Wow what do they do<br>it's okay there it is don't worry in any<br>case open book exams are not as easy as<br>they seem um you are no longer expected<br>to know knowledge you should have the<br>knowledge in front of you you you won't<br>get applauded for knowing the knowledge<br>rather what they are testing you on is<br>the hardest stuff which is analysis do<br>not be fooled by open book exams don't<br>think that you can just go in with an<br>open book and not had actually use the<br>notes you want to study with those notes<br>you want to know how to use those notes<br>how to navigate those notes if you make<br>the notes yourself you probably won't<br>even need the open book I've done that<br>before you know I made a full set of<br>notes it's been like hundreds of pages<br>printed them all out and I haven't<br>opened it in an exam and like I mean<br>waste of paper but also like great<br>knowledge<br>number seven utilize all your other<br>resources I keep on coming back to this<br>utilize your resources so this is kind<br>of like a general utilize your resources<br>um I spent so much time and quotas<br>office it's not funny<br>like like I'm kind of like that stain<br>that you just can't get rid of<br>no that wasn't funny but in all<br>seriousness if you're planning to do<br>something like Koreas and exchange if<br>you need an extension if you're just<br>feeling down go to the Student Center<br>it's it's incredible um if you just need<br>a yarn go to the Student Center I do<br>that all the time use those resources on<br>top of that the Dave is there to be used<br>the Davis is sort of like that scary<br>building with all the books in it I<br>didn't go into it for like a year which<br>was probably not great but um books are<br>in there if you guys have like<br>prescribed textbooks you could buy them<br>but that's expensive be in the day so<br>make sure that you you use the data and<br>with law to donate you'll you'll be<br>taught how to navigate through the wild<br>world that is the Dave number eight be<br>friendly not competitive really really<br>really important it's it's it's actually<br>quite fundamental I mean talk close I<br>was talking before about making networks<br>in law school you're not gonna do that<br>if you aren't friendly it's just a fact<br>my first day of of university I came to<br>my first lecturer and I was wearing this<br>shirt and it said I'm in shape round as<br>a shape great shirt I gave it to my dad<br>after the story though um and and I went<br>up to this guy and I was like hi my<br>name's Gary it's lovely to me you and<br>you no-one else and I didn't even know<br>this guy in the class and the guy looked<br>me up and down and was like hmm and just<br>walked away and move seats<br>haven't seen him again so who's the<br>winner but like that is a really really<br>good example of how to not make friends<br>and I made friends since then I think um<br>yeah great story it's always everyone's<br>always like what a great story<br>it's really important that you find your<br>people as well your people could be your<br>closest friends at law school but also<br>your people might be different people in<br>different contexts my closest friends<br>are all fool to study with I always get<br>the side eye when they takes me like<br>we're gonna study and I'm like I'm not<br>gonna come and I'll like catch me with<br>another group studying is like jacooz<br>yes no I'm so sometimes sometimes your<br>closest friends are really not<br>productive make sure that you find a<br>group of people to study with that are<br>are gonna be the right people to study<br>with kind of and then finally number 9<br>which is a very important one to me<br>don't get caught up in the commercial<br>web very few people actually well I<br>think very few people come into law<br>school with the intention of being a<br>commercial lawyer I think that most<br>people come in with like absolutely<br>amazing intentions they want to do<br>really really good work for people and<br>I'm not saying commercial law is not<br>good work for good people I'm just<br>saying a lot of people come in with this<br>common narrative of I want to do things<br>to the environment or I want to do human<br>rights or international law but after a<br>few years you think that calm law is the<br>only option that's available for you<br>that's not true it's absolutely false<br>there are other opportunities if you<br>want to do Krim or you want to do human<br>rights or environmental law or<br>international law or any of the other<br>any of the other vocations that are on<br>this list five miles long do them if you<br>don't want to be a lawyer don't be a<br>lawyer it's as simple as that you know<br>it might be it might be a bit more work<br>if you want to do a vocation that's<br>outside of those conventional areas of<br>work but that doesn't mean that the<br>opportunity isn't there and and you<br>should really seize that opportunity<br>it's another awesome point of difference<br>everybody's unique and I really highly<br>doubt that everybody in this room wants<br>to be a commercial lawyer<br>am I wrong anyway there is nine pieces<br>of advice from Gary Hoffman the a LLB<br>does anyone have any questions I know<br>that it's a lot easier to ask someone<br>who is currently a student a question<br>about law school than it is to ask<br>my favorite course uh it was this summer<br>I did summer school and I did a course<br>called contemporary issues of<br>disarmament law taken by Trista done<br>with breathable cause such a good course<br>looking at international war around<br>bombs and weapons and real cool stuff<br>yeah great question no no no I I'm<br>actually doing my honours in theater<br>next year this year so after I finished<br>my honours in theater I have done an<br>internship at an organization called<br>equity New Zealand which is a trade<br>union factors they are a subsidiary of<br>another organization called the media<br>entertainment arts allure Alliance which<br>is in Australia and I'm in talks with a<br>person from equity about trying to gain<br>some sort of employment opportunity<br>within the entertainment industry<br>somehow utilizing my degree any other<br>I guarantee none of your lecturers will<br>be very exciting so it's all downhill<br>now I'm doing a bit of a suit so the<br>next position is titled Oh before we do<br>that<br>cool so um a lot of people have told you<br>during various parts of the day that you<br>should go and talk to the lovely ladies<br>at the Student Center so please be<br>honest on the spot can you say that I'm<br>so surround Rika managers team you will<br>have a very tough time at law school if<br>you don't see them and I mean that in<br>all seriousness if you are having issues<br>with getting assignments done where<br>there as gary said you just need a chat<br>we need help in whatever form talk to<br>the guys over here the students who do<br>they have specific roles as well okay<br>and they're all up there on the board<br>for you to have a look at for their<br>specific people you can go see and<br>depending on the type of help you need<br>well guys<br>thank you good around vote so our next<br>session a safe inclusive and supportive<br>law school for all I don't work here so<br>I can say some stuff you may have all<br>heard of stuff going on in the industry<br>right over the last maybe two to three<br>years ago and I am absolutely so proud<br>to be in an organization that has some<br>pretty strong views of what is happening<br>and what we can do to make sure that our<br>graduates are armed with the right<br>information the right experiences to<br>make sure that when they get into<br>industry that they are the type of<br>people that should be in the industry as<br>well so professor Julia told me you've<br>seen it before but she's going to come<br>and talk a little bit about what we're<br>doing at this law school to make sure<br>Curro again I'm speaking to you of<br>course now in my capacity as well-being<br>convener at the law school and you're<br>also going to hear from the associate<br>dean equity Kari Leonetti so one of the<br>things that we've done in the well-being<br>spaces we've done some big surveys of<br>people's experiences at the law school<br>so there was the gender report which dr.<br>Anna hood and myself wrote and there was<br>the well-being surveys done by dr.<br>Claire charters and they revealed<br>surprise surprise<br>that the law school experience can be a<br>very stressful and lonely one for a lot<br>of people so I'm here with a couple of<br>key messages about that the first is<br>that you're not alone if you're having<br>issues and I think this is probably a<br>theme right throughout the talks this<br>morning don't keep it to yourself<br>reach out there's a list of people to<br>contact depending on what it is you're<br>dealing with whether they're academic<br>concerns financial concerns careers<br>concerns well-being issues or equity<br>concerns and you'll see the appropriate<br>people in the front page of every case<br>book there'll be a list of people that<br>you can contact so you've met our<br>fabulous student services team our<br>career support person I hope you've had<br>information on our financial hardships<br>grants we have a very good health and<br>counseling service at the University one<br>thing to be aware of sometimes it can be<br>hard to get in particularly it's<br>stressful times in the year if you're<br>having a crisis syringe against a<br>fast-track process into that counselling<br>service so she should be your first port<br>of call we also have a process for<br>bullying harassment and discrimination<br>and there's a link to those policies and<br>also an overview of the complaints<br>process again at the front of every case<br>book that you have in addition to our<br>associate dean equity and our associate<br>dean for marty students dr. fleur to our<br>hall and our associate dean Pacifica<br>associate professor trusts are done<br>worth we have a range of other faculty<br>members who are targeted for particular<br>student groups so a faculty advisor for<br>students with disabilities Karen<br>Fairweather the faculty advisor for<br>LGBTI students jane kelsey and ron<br>patterson the faculty advisor to<br>students from refugee backgrounds dr.<br>anna hood the faculty advisor to<br>students from lower socioeconomic<br>backgrounds kate duelin the faculty<br>advisor to students who appearance<br>myself and to women students again anna<br>hood if it's too hard to reach out to<br>someone on the list reach out to someone<br>you actually know and trust someone on<br>the professional staff an academic staff<br>member that you have a particular<br>rapport with or another student who can<br>seek where you enter the appropriate<br>channel one of the things as new<br>zealanders we struggle with is admitting<br>that we're not coping there's a real<br>sense of shame attached to it but I'm<br>here to tell you there's no shame<br>attached the profession actually needs<br>sensitive people it needs people who are<br>real and who understands the struggle of<br>being a human being my second message is<br>that there are many different ways of<br>being successful I really liked what<br>Gary was saying about this one of the<br>most personally discouraging things for<br>me about reading writing the gender<br>report was realizing that we talked an<br>incredibly brilliant bunch of young<br>people you and how many were actually<br>feeling really stupid or second-rate<br>because they weren't getting a grades<br>and they didn't think they were going to<br>get an offer from a large commercial<br>downtown law firm I think that's an<br>incredibly impoverished vision of<br>success something that's tied up with<br>grades or an office or these commercial<br>firms I'm here to tell you I did get an<br>offer from a commercial firm worst<br>professional experience I personally<br>ever had I discovered about myself that<br>I'm not good at the combination of being<br>bored and stressed water and relaxed<br>Stern challenged I can cope with I also<br>discovered I have a strong sense of<br>social justice I thought it was going to<br>be enough for me to have sharp pen<br>stripe suits a convertible mg a fabulous<br>downtown pad I thought that I cared<br>about these things that I discovered I<br>didn't I'm not particularly<br>materialistic so I think you really need<br>to sort of get to know yourself and it's<br>okay to have false starts in that<br>process think about what you stand for<br>and what kind of contribution you want<br>to make and now yourself a journey of<br>discovery around that a few years back I<br>had Sandra aloof Evie and Laverne King<br>come and talk about to my woman in the<br>law course and they talked about the<br>firm that they set up as young mouldy<br>and Pacific a woman so they struggled to<br>get employment they scraped into<br>employment<br>I think Sandra talks about having a job<br>that just paid her bus fare to and from<br>her employment and then they lost their<br>jobs after a couple of years for reasons<br>that were no fault of their own and one<br>of their employers who was going<br>overseas for several years provided them<br>with the capital and security to start<br>their own firm he's now judge Phillip<br>recordin a pretty extraordinary man and<br>they set up a firm and their mission was<br>to employ other Moldy young Morty and<br>Pacifica woman graduates and give them a<br>couple of years experience so they could<br>then go on and set up their own firms<br>and photons of little law firms have<br>come out of this particular firm that<br>was what they stood for not only that<br>they decided they wanted a tall<br>professional success in motherhood so<br>they set up a crash in their own law<br>firm they were one of the first firms to<br>actually do that so they has<br>extraordinary success for me and it's<br>not measured by the fact that they got<br>well they didn't get downtown office<br>from large law firms or a grades<br>necessarily humans at the law school is<br>a project that we are doing in the<br>well-being space at the moment which is<br>trying to give people a sense of<br>connection insight to others at the law<br>school inspiration a sense that people<br>were successful careers have failures<br>failures are part of success<br>the most successful people have the most<br>failures they're just people that focus<br>on those try and learn from those<br>failures they're not scared to take<br>risks so our aim as part of this project<br>is to introduce people as human beings<br>and give you insight into them what<br>makes them tick what their passion and<br>vision is the hardships they've overcome<br>so we do Instagram postings we do<br>posters around the law school there are<br>some fantastic videos Sandra Luffy Vai<br>is on one of our videos now I mean if<br>Tafari has just been had a video loaded<br>on an incredibly inspiring story if you<br>need some inspiration to go and have a<br>look at so we want stories about you if<br>you have an interesting story not your<br>CV not your achievements who you are as<br>a person please contact Martina latina<br>she here well she's just popped out<br>unfortunately<br>contact Martina here's her email if you<br>if you're interested in that we have<br>lots of well-being initiatives going on<br>around the doll school including a<br>fantastic student well-being group who<br>champion well-being at the school they<br>organised mentoring programs events and<br>study groups and I just got contacted by<br>one who was telling me that there are<br>going to be a series of open discussion<br>forums in the cafe on different aspects<br>of a law students year beginning in week<br>3 where part 2 students get to ask Pat<br>past part 2 students questions about<br>study habits and law school cultural<br>life and all the things you might want<br>to know to have a balanced life he's<br>martina here to assist you in having an<br>easier and less stressful transition<br>into the law school by giving you<br>connection and a real life forum in<br>which to be able to ask the questions<br>that actually matter<br>ok without much ado I'm going to hand<br>over now to Carrie who is our associate<br>dean equity<br>Buon Giorno<br>kyouda talofa and warm Pacific greetings<br>I feel the need to add an extra one on I<br>am sure by now you have been both<br>welcomed and congratulated all morning<br>long but I'm still going to welcome you<br>to part two and congratulate you on the<br>extraordinary achievement of getting<br>into law school I am the associate dean<br>of equity for the law school that means<br>that my job is along with everyone else<br>on the slide that Julia showed you and<br>is to promote the law schools equity<br>goals to develop programs to enhance<br>equity at the law school and to sort of<br>enforce and design metrics for making<br>sure that we are achieving those equity<br>goals and this of course I think leads<br>to an obvious question which is what is<br>equity I really actually had to think<br>about that because that's not a word<br>that we use in this space in America and<br>so what what does it mean to promote<br>equity at the law school and and really<br>what it means is that my mission the<br>mission of all the other colleagues I<br>have that work at equity and the mission<br>of everyone in this room because you are<br>now a member of this community and is to<br>really try to make the Law School a safe<br>inclusive and supportive space for<br>everybody that's really what we mean<br>when we talk about equity sometimes I<br>conceive of my job in terms of nose and<br>yesses that's probably the lawyer and me<br>and so this means no discrimination no<br>hate speech no bullying and that goes<br>for students and staff of the law school<br>with one another and it means yes to<br>creating safe spaces and equal<br>opportunities from people who come to<br>this law school with all kinds of<br>backgrounds and needs and prior<br>experiences and the university<br>identifies sort of official specific<br>equity groups which really are just<br>groups of people who have historically<br>been underrepresented in institutions of<br>power including universities and of<br>course the practice of law and<br>government so at the top of the list<br>usually our Maori staff and students<br>although to be clear Mauri are not an<br>equity group right Mario the indigenous<br>and<br>evidence of this land and their partners<br>in the government under the Treaty of<br>Waitangi also students from Pacific<br>Islands students with disabilities<br>students who are LGBTQIA I'm not sure<br>that's the acronym you use in New<br>Zealand but you get the idea<br>students from refugee background<br>students from lower socioeconomic<br>backgrounds students who are<br>non-traditional because they are if not<br>mature at least a little bit older<br>because their parents because they're<br>carers and even women right women are a<br>majority of people in the world they are<br>traditionally quite a majority of<br>students at the law school and but are<br>nonetheless historically<br>underrepresented from the law and so I'm<br>really just here today in addition to<br>introducing myself and and the other<br>colleagues who work to promote equity at<br>the law school and to sort of ask all of<br>you to join in the equity goals and your<br>consumers of equity at this law school<br>but you're also producers of equity at<br>this law school hopefully and so one of<br>the things to think about is to be aware<br>of your privilege I really don't care<br>how underprivileged your background was<br>welcome to part 2 you're on your way to<br>becoming a lawyer which gives you access<br>to incredible power and privilege what<br>we do with this law school is teach you<br>to speak a language it is the language<br>of power in society so you are now the<br>person who can understand the language<br>that is often a barrier to access to<br>everyone who can't and there are<br>obligations that will come with that I<br>guess if you fail out I'll let you off<br>the priviledge lecture but otherwise if<br>you successfully proceed through law<br>school you have become a member of a<br>really privileged minority in society<br>and so just be aware of that be aware<br>that people come here with really<br>different backgrounds really different<br>experiences with privilege and power and<br>use sort of the power that you gain<br>access to here wisely and fairly and<br>inclusively and the other thing is if<br>you feel like you need better access you<br>need better integration like you're not<br>having the same opportunity as other<br>students at the law school and please<br>reach out we actually have lots of<br>support but it does rely on students to<br>speak up when their needs aren't being<br>met<br>so there are official support programs<br>mentoring and tutorials for students<br>from certain equity groups there are<br>student advisors you're going to meet in<br>a minute the student equity officers who<br>I'm going to introduce to you and there<br>are student groups and those student<br>groups can provide all kinds of peer<br>support for people who maybe are having<br>trouble feeling like they have full<br>access to the experience at the law<br>school and student other service<br>students and student groups are a great<br>source of social support pastoral<br>support but also career networking it's<br>not who you know in a sort of backroom<br>nepotistic way but it absolutely is the<br>network's you build for yourself so I'm<br>almost twenty years out of law school<br>now and I have definitely at least<br>gotten into the room for the interview<br>because of somebody that I networked<br>with in law school not again in some<br>backroom deal sense but because they<br>knew my background they knew my<br>commitment and my passion and employers<br>do care about that run when I said this<br>is what I want to do for a living they<br>could say yeah that is what Karen wants<br>to do for a living and it at least gets<br>you into the room so rely on each other<br>for those networks and this is a huge<br>law school you're not all going to stay<br>in touch never unions every year I don't<br>think when you leave here but you will<br>find a core piece of students here at<br>the law school with whom you share a lot<br>of various commonalities and and you<br>will actually be in touch with each<br>other for the rest of your life so start<br>building those networks of peer support<br>now and there are also sort of specific<br>student groups there's takatori which is<br>the mone student group and hilsa rainbow<br>law women in law and so reach out to<br>those groups if you are members of those<br>groups or if you're allies of members of<br>those groups and they're important peer<br>support networking programs and finally<br>ask if you need some kind of<br>accommodation and if you need resources<br>that haven't been provided to you or you<br>can't figure out how to find them ask<br>anyone on that page I didn't I was gonna<br>put my email on my office on a slide for<br>you I didn't because there's an equity<br>page at the law school and I thought oh<br>I want to make you all go to the equity<br>page so if you go to the X of the law<br>schools equity webpage there's contact<br>information for me for all of the<br>faculty advisors and conveners student<br>advisors that you're gonna meet today<br>and who work in this space and but reach<br>out to any of us and ask em<br>part of my job is not just sort of to<br>enforce equity goals it's to advocate<br>for students who are not finding<br>inclusion and access at the law school<br>so please avail yourself of all of us<br>because we really care about making this<br>a safe welcoming and inclusive place so<br>with that one last time congratulations<br>as of Monday morning good luck and have<br>a wonderful sort of first real great<br>year at Law School and with that I just<br>the student equity officers here I wear<br>bifocals I'm not very good at oh you're<br>right there<br>Diane's right there okay um is Aisha<br>here okay so I'm gonna introduce you to<br>Diana Q who is one of your student<br>equity officers kyouda everyone my name<br>is Diana and I am a fifth year law and<br>art student with majors and economics in<br>French and together with my fellow<br>colleague friend and also student Anusha<br>are your student equity officers at law<br>school for this year you've heard from<br>Carrie that she and Julia managed the<br>staff side of equity and equity at the<br>law school generally and the student<br>equity officers are the people who like<br>you our students and another resource<br>that you can reach out to if you are<br>looking for somebody to talk to or to<br>bring a equity concern that you have to<br>us so over the next couple of minutes<br>and I'll keep this very short I'm just<br>going to chat to you about what the<br>student equity officer position is and<br>what some of our general<br>responsibilities are so first what the<br>position is is that we're basically<br>students and we look after your equity<br>concerns at the law school as well as<br>advocate generally for some of the<br>systemic equity issues that underpin<br>your law school experience<br>so those equity concerns might look like<br>issues pertaining to your well-being<br>they may look like incidents you<br>encounter throughout your law school<br>experience in the form of discrimination<br>harassment assault and bullying and<br>those are incidents that happen to you<br>or somebody that you know you're welcome<br>to get into contact with either inertia<br>or I we will keep your accounts and<br>incidences anonymous and do the best we<br>can to help you with that if you feel<br>most comfortable chatting to a student<br>so some of our general responsibilities<br>can be seen up on the slide behind me<br>the first I've addressed this before is<br>hearing independent student concerns the<br>second is fostering relationships<br>between the different equity groups that<br>exist at law school after me you're<br>going to hear from some of the leaders<br>of those equity groups and our<br>responsibility as student equity<br>officers is to foster relationships<br>between them in order to address equity<br>concerns on a broader macro level third<br>we advocate generally for systemic<br>issues that we see addressing the law<br>school as a more general responsibility<br>and finally we also run events that help<br>to increase the knowledge of equity<br>concerns at the law school including for<br>example mental health Whois we have to<br>organize substantive equality month<br>which happens as semester two as well as<br>cultural month in semester one which is<br>coming up in May I think we are<br>contactable on the email that you see<br>there in law equity officer at gmail.com<br>it's also posted in the description of<br>the Ali ul if this Facebook group<br>Anusha cannot be here today at the<br>moment but for those of you who are<br>going to camp you will see her there I<br>am also a student I am in my final year<br>so I understand the law school journey<br>and how stressful it can be and I just<br>want to reassure you that there are<br>plenty of resources here including us<br>that can help you with that journey as<br>well so if you have any questions I'll<br>be lingering around the law school<br>during the barbecue coming up and so you<br>can approach me then and ask me any<br>questions then thank you very much<br>so in true law school fashion we're gone<br>over time that's all goods one session<br>left and we've got a bunch of students<br>we're gonna do a quick fire plug from a<br>number of different student<br>organizations just to talk to you about<br>who they are what they do and why you<br>should be interested foot fireplug and<br>then we'll close up Thank You kya to<br>everyone my name is Lina and I am<br>president of a ul it's

body with<br>an ALS s you want to avoid something<br>about the law - the law faculty we're<br>the first point of contact and so in<br>terms of events our first kind of<br>networking opportunity that you have is<br>on the 14th of March we have a<br>recruitment series day where firms<br>representatives will come and would like<br>to speak to the students about the<br>different cultures the values

yourself to others your law<br>school journey it's gonna be a very<br>full-on next three four years or so five<br>even but yet don't compare your notes<br>your great expectations with others<br>and find your wire as to why you're<br>studying this degree as to why you're<br>here in New Zealand's most prestigious<br>law school and also open be open in<br>terms of networking friendships try out<br>new opportunities new competitions and<br>moods that you've never done before<br>because every event you go to you'll<br>meet at least one new person and that<br>new person is what will make

who couldn't be<br>here today they are not your average law<br>students and not that there is an<br>average law student but they cater for<br>students who don't come to law school<br>from a slightly different life path so<br>maybe they've had other degrees other<br>careers maybe they're raising families<br>at the same time it can seem like<br>everyone is 19 and hitting up all the<br>Stynes but when you look around they're<br>actually more of you than you think so<br>if this is you come speak to me down at<br>law school after and I'll put you in<br>touch with tarika thank you<br>hey everyone so my name is Jane and this<br>is Sophie and we're from the equal<br>justice project for the people who don't<br>know the equal justice Project is a pro<br>bono charity which is based at the law<br>school we use law students to help grow<br>things like social equality and<br>inclusivity within our wider community<br>and we have 14 and so we've got four<br>teams like James said and those are<br>access community communications and pro<br>bono and and honestly one of the cool<br>things about our charity is that you<br>will be exposed to legal experience and<br>other forms of experience before you<br>actually hit out and try and get a clap<br>ship or whatever so a little bit about<br>what access does as they go into schools<br>and promote yeah social justice issues<br>to high school students or in other<br>education centers and community if<br>that's something that you're interested<br>in they will pop you in a community law<br>Center so that you'll get in contact<br>with an lawyers and you'll be working<br>with them and triaging all the cases<br>that they work with which is really<br>really cool experience yeah<br>and communications if you're really<br>interested in writing the right articles<br>and parliamentary submissions on our<br>topics which relate to our values and<br>pro bono which was attained the I so<br>often they do legal research for legal<br>practitioners within our community who<br>are working on pro bono projects and<br>like the work they've done is really<br>amazing like they've had work go the UN<br>and Supreme Court so yeah it's a really<br>great experience yeah so if you have any<br>Christians will be holding an<br>information session on Friday the 8th of<br>March so that's next Friday and at 1:00<br>to 2:00 p.m. and their location is to be<br>determined and and applications are<br>opening on Monday the 11th of March so<br>we do have limited places so we do<br>encourage that you think about which<br>team you'd like to apply for and if you<br>have any questions about those teams<br>we'll be hanging around down at the BBQ<br>so come give us a chat and warmth it you<br>know yeah and saying that like in the<br>past we've had this kind of image that<br>you have to be like the perfect a plus<br>student to be involved you really don't<br>we're looking for people who are like<br>genuinely passionate<br>about helping the community and really<br>passionate about increasing these values<br>like whether you want to be a corporate<br>lawyer or you want to be like the next<br>Helen Clarke like we want all types of<br>law students and we want to bring this<br>experience to as many people as possible<br>yeah come talk to us we'll be down at<br>the barbecue and I think you're out of<br>here soon hey everyone I'm Mike from<br>Barrett s Barrett has a Christian group<br>for law students we get together because<br>like if you're a Christian and you're a<br>law student we have a lot in common we<br>meet weekly in the law school and we've<br>stellar Bible studies and I think law<br>school is one of the best places to<br>learn about the Bible and the Christian<br>faith because you get quite good at<br>deriving the meaning of a text and the<br>light of its purpose sound familiar<br>you don't have to be a Christian to come<br>along because the opportunities to talk<br>openly and honestly about matters of<br>faith is something that's quite rare at<br>law school and it's something really<br>important to do we also host bigger<br>events in the past we've had talks from<br>prominent lawyers and judges so if you<br>are interested you can like our Facebook<br>page but also those Saul Stoll set up at<br>the barbecue down in law school thanks<br>guys<br>good afternoon everyone my name is<br>Charlie and this is Pierre we're here to<br>talk to you guys about moussing so we're<br>on the moussing site exec I am a co<br>present for this year alongside Rachel<br>who can't be here today she's preparing<br>for an international news so she's quite<br>busy and then piers our engagement<br>officer<br>so mooting some of you guys might have<br>heard about it in your first year<br>basically moussing is like mock cause so<br>there's only really one club at the law<br>school where you can show up in a suit<br>and pretend to be a lawyer and that's<br>moussing you're given a legal problem<br>you have to research it and develop<br>arguments and then present in front of a<br>judge so obviously it's good from just<br>straight-up law point of view it really<br>helps with your study thinking on your<br>feet it's also very good for the CV law<br>firms like to see you've actually taken<br>the initiative to moot and often you'll<br>be judged by either practicing lawyers<br>or older students so it's a really good<br>way to get contacts and talk to them<br>after the competition and get their view<br>on things<br>select charlie since you know you get to<br>come up and pretend to be Harvey Specter<br>for a couple hours but we do have<br>different kinds of competitions because<br>we are trying to get as many of you guys<br>involved as possible so if you're not<br>interested in joining a competition<br>where you can win money at the end we do<br>have ones where you can just show up on<br>the night meet some new people practice<br>your speaking skills practice your<br>thinking on your feet and a totally non<br>competitive environment so we are trying<br>to cater to that whole range and we'll<br>hopefully see you guys there because we<br>do also feed you when you come to our<br>competitions free food as always guys so<br>in a moment you'll head down to the law<br>school and all the clubs will be doing<br>sign ups when you sign up for a yo SS at<br>that moment they'll also ask do you want<br>to join the moussing society so you say<br>yes what that will do is it will put you<br>on our emailing list<br>so we'll mail out updates the next time<br>we have a competition also we've made an<br>Instagram so for everyone who has<br>Instagram please Like us or whatever you<br>do on Instagram I don't have it
