the University of what<br>a point it's my pleasure to be<br>introducing martial artists tougher<br>picture tonight his purpose promotion to<br>professor and the School of the Arts<br>firstly I want to begin by saying a<br>special thanks to all of you for coming<br>out this evening and supporting<br>mountains in what is an extraordinarily<br>difficult time the emotions we kept<br>following the horrific events on Friday<br>are still sold in many of us are still<br>pricing the feelings of hurt of pain and<br>in there right now it seems impossible<br>to talk about rolling by when it is<br>anything that it's big volumes about the<br>audience we have here tonight<br>the strength we have and coming together<br>as a university community and hard times<br>and supporting one another it's been<br>incredibly touching to see in recent<br>days the outpouring of love and support<br>from our students and staff for those<br>affected in question these been from in<br>funkiness to Avast pay our respects and<br>breathe and there are more opportunities<br>to do so with a vigil to be helped<br>here tomorrow night collect 30 p.m.<br>outside the Student Center and you were<br>all very welcome to join us tonight as I<br>said earlier tonight is about<br>celebrating Martin's achievements before<br>he takes us into a wonderful world of<br>music I have some details to share with<br>you about his career he is received<br>commissions from relative performance<br>ensembles in New Zealand<br>including the New Zealand Symphony<br>Orchestra the Auckland Philharmonic the<br>organ trio in the New Zealand to change<br>the soloist as well as from leading<br>performers in other parts of the world<br>such as William Darla and Ireland<br>Timothy - in the USA in Wolfgang Emanuel<br>Steward in Germany after completing<br>university studies and music and English<br>literature professor Lodge spent 13<br>years as a freelance composer and<br>musician working lately in 1995 he was<br>appointed to the staff of the<br>Conservatorium of music at the<br>University of Waikato in 1990 in 1991 he<br>had the work that fellowship at the<br>University of Otago<br>newsela was almost

course<br>Oh New Zealand music covering<br>traditional violin music in popular<br>music as well as New Zealand composition<br>in the place of more Eastern tradition<br>he followed up this initiative by<br>planning and Lee in the introduction and<br>a complete stream of modern music<br>settings in the work at home he must<br>bring you say the artistic design<br>specifications of this very core in the<br>university what can our Academy of<br>Performing Arts the wallace now widely<br>regarded as the preeminent in you the<br>China user in New Zealand in 2016 the<br>University received<br>50 piece

new<br>works that bring together Western<br>classical and my request for instruments<br>into in April 2017 Martin who was Barca<br>featured composer and executive producer<br>of a recording of newly commissioned<br>strength tears the recordings were made<br>by the highest quality in the group's<br>hometown Shanghai so please join with me<br>thank you very much deputy<br>vice-chancellor pro vice-chancellor<br>esteemed colleagues students wonderful<br>to see especially music students here<br>ladies and gentlemen tentative guitar<br>and really is a privilege to be speaking<br>I say the position to be not just an<br>individual post but as a role that<br>represents the whole academic body of<br>music staff and students and it's<br>happening that the university is showing<br>its support in this way more than<br>creating and performing us as an<br>important part of the university's such<br>properties now the housekeeping you're<br>welcome to take 5 register even if you<br>wish without flash please but also be<br>aware that the whole event is being<br>streamed live to the Internet and will<br>be available as a video that you can<br>view and download from the University<br>website and the days are here well I<br>keeping with tradition I need to begin<br>by acknowledging those who've gone<br>before there's professional ancestors<br>apologies were a music style continue to<br>build today we especially remember the<br>founding staff member music died of<br>Wells and it's wonderful that sundar<br>Wells is here with us tonight others who<br>contributed significantly to the breadth<br>of music include mark across all four<br>established piano studies moment Ross<br>our first vocal teacher and her<br>successor David Griffiths and did the<br>academic field Krista heads world<br>William Taft and the awarded I would<br>also like to thank you our many<br>supporters and the benefactors whose<br>financial contributions have given teas<br>it's such a food stone for decades we're<br>particularly grateful to the Laura Hart<br>trust he's in put an end to teaching of<br>performance to begin in the first place<br>so<br>that trust still gives to support<br>performance teaching also that very<br>generous tip is such as emeritus<br>professor he had grabbed an eggy lei<br>hybrid and more recently the late<br>Richard Lane Melissa could see the<br>pillar is out the tennis that's rough<br>that would indeed be a performance there<br>are my talk to the entire music as a<br>composer and the teacher as well as a<br>writer and a commentator on listen I get<br>to look at music from a number of<br>different angles ranging from the<br>Creator the reflected the received<br>acknowledgement and the critical and in<br>recent years it's becoming increasingly<br>clear to me but just as the world is<br>changing at a tremendous rate especially<br>with the virtually of technology and the<br>ubiquity of the internet so the nature<br>music is changing to or at least the way<br>we need to think about it as changing<br>focus on this issue has been sharpened<br>directly by the dramatic effects of the<br>internet for music not only its music<br>now most public disseminated<br>today and costly as we say in the trade<br>topic the media is it but the economic<br>model the Internet and the way people<br>have come to accept it is both welcoming<br>power essentially it people like us uses<br>on the Internet<br>trade is shopping the professional<br>connections<br>the public the service the personal data<br>the texts in exchange for professional<br>also available such as Google's Gmail<br>services such as these appear to be free<br>but of course they're not really this<br>challenge an economic model where in<br>return for services<br>privacy is bugged under this bit of<br>money it's not only changed but here's<br>about public versus private life and<br>what constitutes a community or a<br>society but it's also changed the way<br>that music exists one major change has<br>been deep commodification of music so<br>that today it's difficult to sell<br>recordings of music and make money<br>purely on the basis of unit sales in<br>fact outside a handful of international<br>celebrity figures of supergroups few<br>composers or performers are able to make<br>significant money from selling<br>recordings in instead music has become a<br>flux of activity mediated through<br>electronics and supported to some extent<br>by live shows and the question of who is<br>doing what in terms of create<br>performing disseminating and listening<br>and how the musical actions and<br>interactions relate to each other has<br>become really fascinating<br>this year thinking about these changes<br>let me back to the writings of composer<br>these colleges and educator Chris a<br>small originally from Pastor north<br>he's a classic case of a prophet without<br>are Lebanese are glad but read respected<br>greatly overseas after leaving New<br>Zealand as a young man small was<br>basically a slice of London expect the<br>last twenty seven or so years of his<br>life in Spain small erect series of<br>books have proved hugely influential<br>despite that controversial either rather<br>than the way it ended he proposed<br>reevaluated function at place using the<br>society his last and most of what was<br>music which didn't see it has her a<br>really subtitle the meanings the<br>meanings of performing in the music a<br>small data that there are three<br>questions that seem to keep recurring<br>firstly what is this thing called that's<br>privilege of every society and then what<br>humans consider to invest<br>volatile attention emotional commitment<br>creativity and money and took more said<br>favorite artists not what is the meaning<br>of music and thirdly what is the<br>function of music formidable species<br>Chris small positive that they can never<br>be convincing answers to any of these<br>questions because the questions<br>themselves are wrong there is he wrote<br>no such thing as music music is not<br>thinking at all but an activity<br>something<br>I thought strongly further when I read<br>those words a few years ago they<br>confirmed an idea that had slowly<br>absolutely groping my way towards which<br>was we often tried to think about music<br>with ways that are really not very<br>helpful<br>well that's been happening with these<br>sorts of evolving ideas once the first<br>step of illumination has been laid<br>that's they're easier to see other<br>connections<br>one such connection turned out with what<br>first seed at unlike the quarter named<br>in the computer analysis of big data and<br>popular music<br>that's disseminated on the Internet the<br>American electronics research engineer<br>George Johnson has a very interesting<br>video clip on YouTube<br>explaining by the self titled warrior<br>congri that's part of the Massachusetts<br>Institute of Technology the services and<br>using computers to apply texture<br>analysis and a few back to the reception<br>of the cause of music borrowing a term<br>like drama<br>what do you common name respect to<br>remove the form of all that seems to<br>have come to exist between performance<br>and listeners recorded music is the only<br>so a lot of you are probably wondering<br>why did I join a music technology<br>startup after doing all that work to get<br>a PhD a big part of that is exciting<br>transition I'm going to talk about today<br>which as you've mentioned is a<br>transition to interact or music<br>consumption and data so when we used to<br>listen to music it's hot right we had to<br>break out clunky heavy equipment we have<br>to you know use some unconventional<br>accessories I hope you people remember<br>the tennis on the cassette tapes right<br>well we wanted to the next song go<br>record keep the needle at just the right<br>point and groove yes sir push buttons we<br>have to turn the knobs and what we<br>wanted to learn more we even have to get<br>through our notes and that time time<br>Friday<br>it goes out a book like to think about<br>remembers that so years in scientific<br>amuse issues we set out to fix this and<br>we did it we made a brighter more data<br>rich faster easy and in some cases free<br>so how things get any better well at<br>some point if it's frenzy to create a<br>more virtuous music experience we lost<br>something we don't a wall between our<br>music creators and consumers between the<br>it's very fun to do well traditionally<br>over the past hundred years or so they<br>recorded music has arrived on vinyl tape<br>CD or now the internet completely<br>finished by a music producer so the<br>listener cannot be directed at very much<br>when playing back recorded was if we can<br>control button and maybe lift right<br>speaker balance but not much else<br>overall very limited interaction as<br>possible and the performance who made<br>the recording are certainly not aware of<br>many choices that individual listeners<br>are made using the recording now in the<br>recording process particularly studio as<br>populism the component parts stairs a<br>stem might be something like the drum<br>track or the lead guitar or vocalist and<br>solar combined these stages is called<br>mixing and today it's possible to offer<br>music as a package of stairs which could<br>be our driver pre-mixed by the producer<br>or available to be mixed according to<br>the listeners of a preference his stuff<br>from safe to do show very pretty how<br>this technology to work and practice<br>than this test demonstration shows of<br>the sneezes how listen to using a<br>smartphone can't use to us<br>piece of music in this case it's a rock<br>song but more than that the listen<br>intention is to listen to any single<br>part of music music has always been<br>ingested the same way you stand in front<br>of some speaker system anyone and how<br>much innovation had come in that respect<br>the market has told us in this<br>experiencing scale people want more it's<br>a very black experience with music with<br>all the innovation around us and<br>software hardware and data and even with<br>all beliefs and our being done we found<br>like move derivation call what we call<br>completion rate that 50% of users or the<br>consumers skip us off within 30 seconds<br>meaning that their fault is likely to<br>skip a song everybody even listen to it<br>so we know that we still have this black<br>using problem so what are we going to do<br>this mix we believe that the answer is<br>interactive music experiences with<br>multitrack students<br>but it could be the traditional Golden<br>Triangle of musical activity is create<br>before this proposal form of the<br>audience but as we saw in that video the<br>computer technology now is allowing<br>increased interactivity music to the<br>forward and listen up the methods are on<br>a spectrum take on the part of the<br>producers well but there's no reason<br>a choice might also take on part of the<br>composer's role so I think we need to<br>turn the triangle relationships into the<br>rectangle if you think about it we can<br>basic abilities for electronic mediation<br>when listening to recordings for quite a<br>long time for example we can choose to<br>listen to the movements of a Beethoven<br>symphony and the different order to what<br>the composer prescribed it's as easy as<br>instructed and CD player or the website<br>to play the order the murders in the<br>morning we want now that act of low<br>creative - priscila physical<br>relationships between the large-scale<br>parts listen to me so as listeners we<br>are beginning to move into the<br>composer's opportunity visible spectrum<br>but I think wondering as the underlying<br>principles he replied the armed computer<br>mediated music - five mysteries is it<br>feasible to rethink the way proposal<br>before we had listener relate to each<br>other and this played might there be a<br>way to provide the means of mediation<br>that allows more interactivity perhaps<br>of I understand the concept - the role<br>of the computer<br>well I think there may be and the piece<br>you're about to hear to that was created<br>partly with these ideas in mind in our<br>mouth or topic or additional our experts<br>and territory which we'll hear playing<br>shortly<br>one of the key compositional ideas ahead<br>was to find a way to mediate between the<br>worlds of traditional Maori music and<br>traditional wisdom classical music the<br>aim was to allow each part of the deeds<br>to be true to its respective cultural<br>works to avoid so-called fusion music<br>but before getting to the think this<br>time to touch very briefly on some<br>technical issues not to take and the<br>dates they actively using the prison I<br>see all elements as being important and<br>we've discussed some of this already but<br>let's look at notation the protection<br>system that wisdom music uses today<br>evolved simple centuries in fact nearly<br>a thousand years in response to the<br>requirement of practical musicians<br>especially those employed by the<br>distribution<br>no tension began by as a means of<br>strengthening community community as a<br>mendicant wars of complications in<br>different places and over the priestly<br>long time spans but all celebrate their<br>faith using the same a community that<br>literally sailors will say is likely to<br>be unified community and then at the<br>time a musical lingua franca was the<br>since solves their work for the 13th<br>century and one for me they did the<br>ability to visually represent the<br>musical elements time proved to be<br>extraordinarily powerful and its effects<br>shot well beyond original<br>straightforward intentions of its early<br>innovators as the system became more<br>violent elaborate those are the<br>primitives for performance and as<br>composers realized that attention could<br>be used to write more than<br>intellectually the context previously as<br>possible it could also be says a virtual<br>laboratory in which experiments were<br>possible accountant Harvey Specter it<br>was no longer necessary to work where<br>the real Tigers would say today but when<br>put at risk time and pour for as long as<br>you like never the construction the<br>court saying for the architect of shape<br>of a piece of music and turned out<br>eventually the musical attention it<br>wasn't a sense the functional<br>predecessor of computer program which<br>initially specifies the installation was<br>a time in relation to race<br>well first off of discussion about the<br>real nature of the function using the<br>notation continues to about complicated<br>of course by the digital audio recording<br>in the late 19th century recording has<br>not made a notation redundant as some<br>predicted apart but instead recording<br>his developer notation systems on its<br>own particularly as<br>processes here's a shot from the<br>computer screen effect provides a we're<br>on a film school the word logic refers<br>to the software theory is not to the<br>crisis composition editing and mixing of<br>recordings as well that ended up using a<br>combination of the aural that's<br>listening and the digital which is what<br>we can wave forms of tracks on the<br>computer screen like that so in a sense<br>we've actually moved back close to the<br>original original use of notation which<br>by use of digital editing programs and<br>also as a net for recording produce as<br>well become a part of the performance<br>process and that's what sort of end<br>video clip today listeners can also take<br>on the role of juicers and the<br>proletariat mixing but potentially is a<br>change elements of the composition<br>itself the whole musical equations<br>become much more of a flex and activity<br>now this relation<br>this is a Pfizer technical suck without<br>size of the ultimate front in 2016<br>tried one of the four interactive<br>installations by created by the small<br>group of musicians and technicians these<br>installations were devised that<br>invitation of the bio engineering<br>Institute at the University of Auckland<br>to contribute interactive music<br>installations as path lights public<br>demonstration of new medical technology<br>and these includes about music<br>installations newly invented music<br>medical senses could be worn by members<br>of the public thus allow expected their<br>physiology in this case is breathing<br>because the station refers to the<br>function of the lungs to interact<br>directly with these the video on the<br>screens turning back to musical<br>attention while especially for the issue<br>about it is the wrong attention has when<br>it's being used us transcribed by wonder<br>provides music and other words directed<br>out of time music which was completely<br>transitoriness tradition and religion<br>wakes future as a composer and recently<br>has not had to record with this question<br>and decide how to create music scores<br>for pieces that involve both wisdom<br>instruments and traditional maori<br>instruments not only does this really<br>visit of us hepatoma complete<br>different cultural traditions about how<br>to use every instrument and long history<br>of performance techniques but the issue<br>and attention itself was challenging<br>western notation s began as a talk to my<br>tailor religious films then began to be<br>a product of non-medical music as well<br>this notation became more more used by<br>instrumentalists the first miss and list<br>attached to words the issues of specific<br>things like pitch rhythm phrasing<br>dynamics timbersaw all became order to<br>challenge notation evolved to meet those<br>challenges as they were issued by<br>Western instruments which themselves by<br>the 18th century both instruments and<br>notation techniques were highly<br>symbiotic things like scales tuning<br>systems and government entities<br>determined how the tension was refined<br>but a different kind of music such as<br>traditional libraries have claimed no<br>cars and evolution of the West's<br>notation system and thus there is a gulf<br>separating what the Torah plural the<br>traditional knowledge refers to and how<br>they played over one hand with the<br>traditions and characteristics of<br>western notation on the other one of the<br>issues about this divide the dying the<br>most elaborate other musicians have had<br>to come up with practical solutions for<br>as how to create scores from both<br>wastefulness roots and arias was<br>whenever they played in the same process<br>of course each composer fights this war<br>or her answer to this question for my<br>part I prefer not to compromise than our<br>instruments by writing for them using<br>the list instead with specified dates CD<br>and Sharma song as wonders for list of<br>instruments because those situations<br>such as schedules and exactly determine<br>texture and rhythmic elements generally<br>are not part of the traditional culture<br>to my mind it's better to allow<br>tradition to be true to its roots and to<br>try to create a space of meeting point<br>where a musical interaction can take<br>place and practice assessment of<br>trusting the performance a topic order<br>with considerable freedom to create<br>their paths at the moment they're not<br>really<br>improvising freely but more it's<br>animated composing and performing on the<br>fly Lorna thought by deep knowledge of<br>the instruments account of history and<br>deciding in the moment how those<br>considerations miss Park musical<br>expression within the context of a<br>particular work and a particular<br>or parts as a single mother and with it<br>enters the category that that's too<br>small tell us the name of the instrument<br>required here I hope it's that it's free<br>that kind of story will also create a<br>mediation over to us and listeners can<br>choose how we think the two worlds of<br>music are attractive in this moment of<br>time and as performance we can't<br>determine what has been called post<br>genre age a time of the documents about<br>what classical music's popular music is<br>what jazz are almost impossible to<br>resolve by consensus most people today<br>are exposed to and interact with a wide<br>range of musical styles approaches and<br>cultures the gears for a man open-minded<br>and to get to internet focus another who<br>was one of my teachers of America<br>Pater familias initiative versus right<br>that the core about this community and<br>he reiterated<br>wbex his observation that the journey<br>towards a universal human statement<br>begins with discovering the truth about<br>one's own
