<p><strong>Student debt is a huge burden on New Zealanders.</strong></p>
<p>It will stay with graduates for years, taking 10% of their income once they earn $19,084, limiting their choices in important life decisions, and denying young New Zealanders the financial security past generations enjoyed. The government needs to address the drivers of debt – high fees and limited access to living allowances, and fix the unfair loan repayment rules to free a generation from the burden of student debt.</p>

<p><strong>Thousands are being locked out of education opportunities.</strong></p>
<p>The government is locking qualified potential students out of education opportunities by capping enrolments, cutting access to student loans and trying to ‘dampen demand’ for tertiary education. Don’t let the government put a cap on our nation’s potential - let’s keep the doors open to education and training.</p>

<p><strong>Your student voice came under threat from ACT&#39;s legislation to end universal membership of students&#39; associations.</strong></p>
<p>Students deserve a meaningful say in their education and their tertiary institution. Students have historically used their voice in university and polytechnic councils and students’ associations to fight for what&#39;s best for students, whether that&#39;s interest-free student loans or a high quality and student-focused education.Recently the student voice has come under attack from the loss of student reps on polytechnic councils and the voluntary student membership legislation that threatens to devastate student services and undermine student representation and advocacy. Students’ associations are run by students, for students, and they’re under threat. Show you value your voice, and speak out for your student voice on student affairs.</p>

<p><strong>The government should be investing in our future by investing in education.</strong></p>
<p>We need to invest in New Zealanders who will carry us into a socially and economically successful future, but consistent under-investment in education is forcing universities and polytechnics to stretch resources and threaten the quality of our education system. Demand for places is increasing, student : staff ratios are already high, universities and polytechnics are already being told to do more with less, and overall funding to tertiary education is forecast to fall a further $500 million from 2010 to 2015. </p>

<p><strong>Demand A Better Future</strong> <strong>is the New Zealand union of Students’ Association’s election year campaign.</strong></p>
<p>Together with students across New Zealand, NZUSA is arguing for all governments to properly invest in education, tackle student debt, ensure access for all, and value students’ voices. Access to education can change lives and open doors, and we get closer to the economy, society and culture we want by investing in quality education.  </p>

<li><h4>National&#39;s tertiary education policy visionless</h4>
<p>  Today’s release of the National Party’s tertiary education policy reveals no bold initiatives to improve education and largely consists of small tweaks that don’t address the real issues that matter for students. Painful funding cuts are not ruled out.</p>

<p>  8/11/2011 - In a bid to mobilize the youth vote this election, young leaders will cast this election&#39;s first votes when advanced voting opens on Wednesday, November 9.</p>
<p>  Young people historically vote in lower numbers than the general population and over 100,000 young people are still not enrolled to vote – the single largest section of the eligible voting population that is not enrolled.</p>
