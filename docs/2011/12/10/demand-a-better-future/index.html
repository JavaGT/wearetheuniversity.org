The government needs to address the drivers of debt – high fees and limited access to living allowances, and fix the unfair loan repayment rules to free a generation from the burden of student debt.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210071344/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/index.php/tackle-student-debt"><img src="/web/20111210071344im_/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/images/morebtn.png" alt="Read more"></a></p><p><strong>Thousands are being locked out of education opportunities.</strong></p><p>The government is locking qualified potential students out of education opportunities by capping enrolments, cutting access to student loans and trying to ‘dampen demand’ for tertiary education. Don’t let the government put a cap on our nation’s potential - let’s keep the doors open to education and training.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210071344/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/index.php/a-fair-go-for-all"><img src="/web/20111210071344im_/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/images/morebtn.png" alt="Read more"></a></p><p><strong>Your student voice came under threat from ACT&#39;s legislation to end universal membership of students&#39; associations.</strong></p><p>Students deserve a meaningful say in their education and their tertiary institution. Students have historically used their voice in university and polytechnic councils and students’ associations to fight for what&#39;s best for students, whether that&#39;s interest-free student loans or a high quality and student-focused education.Recently the student voice has come under attack from the loss of student reps on polytechnic councils and the voluntary student membership legislation that threatens to devastate student services and undermine student representation and advocacy. Students’ associations are run by students, for students, and they’re under threat. Show you value your voice, and speak out for your student voice on student affairs.</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210071344/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/index.php/value-our-voice"><img src="/web/20111210071344im_/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/images/morebtn.png" alt="Read more"></a></p><p><strong>The government should be investing in our future by investing in education.</strong></p><p>We need to invest in New Zealanders who will carry us into a socially and economically successful future, but consistent under-investment in education is forcing universities and polytechnics to stretch resources and threaten the quality of our education system. Demand for places is increasing, student : staff ratios are already high, universities and polytechnics are already being told to do more with less, and overall funding to tertiary education is forecast to fall a further $500 million from 2010 to 2015. </p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210071344/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/index.php/invest-in-education"><img src="/web/20111210071344im_/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/images/morebtn.png" alt="Read more"></a></p><p><strong>Check out The</strong> <strong>Students&#39; Guide to Voting!</strong></p><p> <strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210071344/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/students-guide-to-voting"><img src="/web/20111210071344im_/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/images/guide_to_voting_cover.jpg" alt="guide to_voting_cover"></a></strong> **<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210071344/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/girls-guide-to-voting"><img src="/web/20111210071344im_/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/images/ggtv.jpg" alt="ggtv"></a>**Get clued up on political parties tertiary education policy with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210071344/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/index.php/vote-2011">Vote 2011</a> and</p><p>    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111210071344/http://www.demandabetterfuture.org.nz/students-guide-to-voting">The Students&#39; Guide to  Voting</a>! We asked the parties about their policy on</p><p>    student income support, student debt, funding, fees, access, quality and</p><p>    student voice to help students make an informed choice this election.
