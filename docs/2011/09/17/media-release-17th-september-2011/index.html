<p>Hundreds of students marched on the University Council of Auckland University this afternoon.</p>
<p>Currently a hundred students and some faculty members are occupying the Council chambers in the Clocktower building.</p>
<p>The occupation occurred as students attempted, and were blocked from, attending a public meeting to raise students fees.</p>
<p>Occupy Auckland, which has occupied Aotea square, will be holding its General Assembly outside the Clocktower in solidarity.</p>
<p>A forum organised by the Teritary Education Union and ‘We are the University’ will be held outside the Clocktower at 7pm.</p>
<p>Students are expressing solidarity with international student movements, and the international occupy movement.</p>
<p>They are calling for students and people around the country and around the world to join in occupying their universities, city centers and workplaces.</p>
<p>In a university council meeting room, We are the University came to these conclusions in a democratic process:</p>
<p>(1) Free education, Zero Frees (Unconditional).</p>
<p>(2) Sack Stuart McCutcheon and Patrick Walsh as vice chancellors of the University of Auckland and Victoria University respectively. Restructure university in a public forum.</p>
<p>(3) Remove trespass orders on Marcus Coverdale and Wikatana Popata.</p>
<p>(4) Decisions on courses be based on scholarly and social benefits rather than financial.</p>
<p>(5) Security guards be employed for the safety of students, not survailliance. Cops not to be called in response to (non-violent) student activism.</p>
<p>(6) The University management be bound by the government facilitation with the Tertiary Education Union (TEU).</p>
<p>(7) University actively lobby to revoke the VSM bill</p>
<p>(8) Government unconditionally fund student unions, allowing them to be a critical voice and conscience of society, so that corporatisation such as advertising is not necessary on campus spaces.</p>
<p>We are the University</p>
