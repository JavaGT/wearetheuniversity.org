<p>Auckland University Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon says protestors who occupied the top level of the Business School building and stopped traffic in central Auckland are directing their anger at the wrong people.</p>
<p>The protest was against the Voluntary Student Membership Bill on Monday. About 200 students took part.</p>
<p>They want to stop the bill, which is due to pass its third reading in Parliament on Wednesday. More disruption is promised.</p>
<p>But Mr McCutcheon says the protest was misdirected because the university is not responsible for the legislation.</p>
<p>He says it was very disruptive and meant the university had to move students who were sitting an exam.</p>
