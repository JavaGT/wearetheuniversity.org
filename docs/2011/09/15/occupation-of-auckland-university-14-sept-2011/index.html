occupied the
University
he what&#39;s your
name stay
down uh this was just a collection of
students that came together to talk
about sustain ideological tax on
education in this country and uh things
sort of progress to the along the lines
there was a a little bit of um
intimidation from the security guards so
we decided we wanted a peaceful place to
talk through some of these ideas and uh
as the aggression from the status quo
grew we we uh barricaded the doors and
and continued the conversation you must
have been aware there was going to be a
confrontation though because we I mean
that was never an intention the idea was
to to have a conversation about the the
particular things that are going on
within the university and within
education in New Zealand and we have a
right to be here yeah and we have a
right to be here we this is our
University this is our University and
and you know a lot of us pay a lot of
money to be here it&#39;s supposedly an open
space for open ideas where we able to
share our creative ideas about what the
university should be the Democratic
process with within this this University
and other universities in this country
under sustained attack we take that up
onto the foot that great cheers thank
you well this was this this was part of
a nationwide day of action so there were
a few things
um one there&#39;s there&#39;s an ongoing
struggle within this particular
University with the the teachers
education Union um Stuart McCutchen is
trying to remove some of the um more
democratic process that go into uh the
sort of job construction essentially
he&#39;s trying to um change the the
conditions that they already have um so
moving things out of contract and into
policy so that he has some sort of
dictatorial control um you know it&#39;s
it&#39;s it&#39;s part of a long process of
watering down the the quality of
Education in this country and and we
think it&#39;s about time that someone some
people stops to talk about that so this
was a place to come together and talk
about that yeah yeah I heard talk about
student rights are on the tech yeah how
committed are you to to occupying the
university well we we&#39;re going to see

union rights um and also um for the
government to completely scrap the
voluntary student
unionship the police arrested um as far
as aware uh one girl harer outside and
two other dudes outside um the library
based who are supporting us they also
then when we were all coming out at the
very end they picked off some random guy
and they arrested him and now they think
that&#39;s all right they have no reason to
we were democratically
protesting so we out
here demanding freedom for the rest of
the people who are R now holler one of
the
risk has already been released but still
the others have to be released and
that&#39;s why we&#39;re out here demanding
their released

thought for you will be arrested for
your
thoughts we&#39;re prosecuted because we&#39;re
different you know because we weren&#39;t
bow to the status quo and because you
know we [ __ ] shouldn&#39;t have to we
live in a country with a democracy and
we can&#39;t even stay in a building past
9:00 p. because they tell us we can&#39;t we
