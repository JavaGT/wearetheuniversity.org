<hr>
<p>what does democracy look
likey in solidarity with the occupiers
of Wall Street we hereby declare all
forms of
anti-Semitism racism islamophobia and
sexism to be
unacceptable furthermore we declare that
we will no longer allow ourselves to be
incited to violence or manipulated by
the 1% who would use us for their own
[Applause]
profit with us here Omar hammed from
assoa and United Union can you give us a
word about what&#39;s going on here today
yeah this just having a general assembly
behind us to uh decide on how to go
forward with occupy Oakland um there&#39;s
going to be a discussion about what type
of actions are going to be
done the next week then there&#39;s going to
be a big student demonstration tomorrow
against Fe increases there&#39;s going to be
a demonstration against FL convenience
shipping on the shores of New
Zealand the use of third world
registered um ships registered semi
functioning Nations being shipping doing
the sh it&#39;s going to be antiw War
actions and it&#39;s going to be anti
corporate and
so what we hope to do is to kind of get
a have ongoing mobilization against the
one streets and use those actions to
draw more more support and more people
what we need to do is stop being [ __ ]
consumers stop being [ __ ] spos and
stop being
revolutionaries right we&#39;re not here to
have a good time we&#39;re not here to have
a canas we&#39;re not here to have a
Woodstock
we&#39;re here to change New Zealand
changing our tooa that means taking
tactics seriously now and when we have
General assemblies what we do first is
talk about how we want to change
things yeah if you don&#39;t know your
rights you don&#39;t have any now how many
people here know that I&#39;m the New
Zealand Bill of Rights Act you do have
the right to freedom of expression how
many of you know
that how many of you know that you have
the right to peaceful
assembly how many of you know you don&#39;t
have to get a council
permit before you exercise those
rights section5 of the Local Government
Act subsection three Council bylaws must
not be inconsistent with the Philip
Rights Act okay we&#39;ve won that but
that&#39;s a story that&#39;ll take more than 20
seconds anyway we have been manipulated
for hundreds of years to kill each other
mother our brothers our sisters cousins
of people villagers Village against
Village country against country and it&#39;s
all in the name of manipulation and
profit and we&#39;ve got to start seeing the
1% as being behind it all
yeah and that&#39;s basically what I want to
say so now I want to just add this one
last little bit before I hand the
microphone over if you see any attempt
to divide us into identities or groups
or factions or schisms or any of those
other things that we&#39;ve been typically
broken up into in the past I want you to
identify for what it is and attempt to
split us apart and kill us all conquer
us all shame yeah that is what we have
to be on the lookout for cuz if we get
divided over the trivial
issues then that&#39;s how they pick us
apart and finish us off so can you be on
the alert for that sort of thing for me
please for all of us yeah let&#39;s
hear we&#39;re here today with Hony Fowler
from kiar Gaza at the Oakland Square can
you tell us uh what you here for today
hey I&#39;m basically here to support this
um this action this movement um that&#39;s
in my view is basically saying things
aren&#39;t right in our society
today</p>
