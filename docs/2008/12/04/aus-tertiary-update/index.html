 &lt;p&gt;
     Lincoln progression case on appeal&lt;br&gt;The Association of
</code></pre>
<p>University Staff has appealed a decision from the Employment
Relations Authority (ERA) over the interpretation of the
meaning and effect of the promotion and advancement criteria
in the Lincoln University academic staff collective
employment agreement. The Employment Court will be asked to
decide whether sixteen senior lecturers were entitled to
advance from the bottom of senior-lecturer salary scale to
the bar in six years, as prescribed in the promotion and
advancement criteria, or whether the university can
arbitrarily hold them back.<br>The university’s criteria
stipulate that senior lecturers who achieve consistently
high standards over a sustained period in the key aspects of
their jobs can normally expect to reach the bar in the
senior-lecturers’ salary range within a six-year
timeframe. The criteria then go on to list seven elements
used to judge the rate at which employees will progress. The
crux of the dispute is that, not only does the university
use the seven elements to determine whether or not
applicants progress at all (rather than to judge the rate of
progress), but it has also refused advancement even where
staff have satisfied the required elements and been
recommended for progression.<br>The appeal follows a rather
vague decision in October by the ERA, one which appears to
agree with the university’s submission that the promotion
and advancement criteria set out the normal expectations for
advancement, but allow for deviation and do not place any
obligation upon the university to ensure that a senior
lecturer progresses to the bar within a six-year timeframe.
<br>AUS deputy secretary Marty Braithwaite said that the
decision concludes with a finding that, in order to be able
to progress through the senior-lecturer steps within a
six-year timeframe, senior lecturers must first meet the
criteria and the obligations of achieving consistently high
standards over a sustained period in the key tasks of the
job. “The puzzle is that most have achieved consistently
high standards, but have still not advanced at the expected
‘normal’ rate,” he said. “The decision seems to say
Lincoln can do pretty much as it pleases, which, in our
view, is plainly wrong.”</p>

against college job cuts<br>Members of the Association of
Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE), AUS, and the New Zealand
Educational Institute at the Karori campus of Victoria
University have begun legal and protest action against
planned redundancies and in support of a fair and objective
review of the work of the university’s college of
education. Union members face an uncertain lead-up to
Christmas, having learnt that eighteen more jobs are under
threat on top of seventeen voluntary redundancies earlier in
the year.<br>Staff learned of the proposal only through
rumour and innuendo and by discovering that they had not
been timetabled for any teaching for 2009. Despite the fact
that all of the unions have very clear procedures in their
collective agreements outlining the processes for
consultation that must be used in the event of possible
redundancies, management has failed to implement any of
these, deciding instead to make fait-accompli
decisions.<br>ASTE national secretary, Sharn Riggs, said
that the union has had no choice but to put this matter into
the hands of its lawyer to seek compliance with the
provisions of the collective agreement. “We wrote to
Dugald Scott, the pro vice-chancellor, on 18 November
outlining the breaches and asking that the consultation
process be put in place before any further discussions with
staff were had,” Ms Riggs said. “To date there has been
no reply.”<br>“All members at the college of education
are outraged by this blatant disregard for due process. The
college has already been the subject of massive redundancies
earlier this year and members were assured then that there
would be no more forced redundancies,” Ms Riggs added.
“Aside from the impact on individuals of losing their
jobs, many staff are becoming increasingly concerned about
the college’s ability to continue to deliver quality
programmes when the staffing is being cut to the
bone.”</p><p>Help in finding the “right” journal<br>In the
same way that businesses must pick the “right” keywords
to get their products and services at the top of the lists
generated by internet search engines like Google, university
academics must publish their research in the “right”
academic journals to win promotion and research funding. To
assist with decision-making, University of Waikato’s
management communication researcher Dr Nittaya Campbell has
co-authored a paper identifying and critiquing the criteria
used for judging the quality of academic journals.<br>Dr
Campbell and her co-researchers found that perceptions of
senior researchers were the most important factor in
assessing journal quality, followed closely by
“objective” rankings of journals by indicators such as
inclusion in major indexes, acceptance rates, and impact
factor based on the number of citations.<br>“This puts
researchers in the field of business and management
communication at a distinct disadvantage because we’re a
relatively new field and most of our major journals are
excluded from these rankings,” says Dr Campbell. “So
while our research shows we all read our major journals, in
today’s academic marketplace we feel pressured to publish
in more mainstream research publications if we want to
progress our careers,” she added.<br>Dr Campbell’s
co-authors are Priscilla S Rogers of the University of
Michigan, Leena Louhiala-Salminen of the Helsinki School of
Economics, Kathy Rentz of the University of Cincinnati, and
Jim Suchan of the Naval Postgraduate School. Their research
was published in the ABC’s Journal of Business
Communication.</p><p>Export-education success in Saudi
Arabia<br>A new export-education initiative will see the
Open Polytechnic of New Zealand’s distance-learning
programmes offered to students in Saudi Arabia. The project
initially involves six certificate programmes in management,
employment skills, and business administration and
computing, but the aim is to extend the offerings more
widely across the polytechnic’s portfolio as the
arrangement develops over time.<br>The Open Polytechnic’s
chief executive, Paul Grimwood, said there is increasing
growth potential in exporting New Zealand education to
complement the already large local industry. “Distance
learning, in particular, is able to travel anywhere in the
world with high quality education products,” he said.
“The key for us here is having partners who understand the
local environment and the education and training needs of
Saudi Arabia and its people.”<br>The collaborative
agreement involves the Open Polytechnic, Saudi-based private
education provider Management Training Centre (MTC), and a
New Zealand-registered company, Almualim Ltd. The Open
Polytechnic will deliver its learning materials to enrolled
students in Saudi Arabia with the help of MTC, which will
provide marketing and administrative support.<br>Saudi
students will have access to all of the polytechnic’s
normal distance-learning services, including learning
support, library, online campus, and email contact. On
completing their Open Polytechnic qualifications, students
will receive guidance on higher-study options in New
Zealand.<br>Dr Grimwood paid tribute to the tremendous
commitment to education by King Abdulla bin Abdul-Aziz, King
of Saudi Arabia, and his Royal Highness Crown Prince Sultan
bin Abdul-Aziz. “I acknowledge also his Royal Highness
Prince Salman bin Abdul-Aziz the Prince of Riyadh City, who
is very supportive and enthusiastic for establishing wide
ranging educational programmes in Riyadh.”</p><p>AUT,
Auckland, Waikato collaborate commercially<br>In another
move that sees New Zealand universities collaborating to
integrate their research into business and industry, a story
in the NZ Herald reports that three universities are now
linked to a Singapore-based technology network to help
commercialise local business-start-up ventures in Asian
markets. The business-development and commercial arms of
AUT, the University of Auckland, and University of Waikato
were named as new members of the Technology Transfer Network
(TTN), a group formed to boost the effectiveness of
technology transfer to industry.<br>TTN was initiated
earlier this year and has 22 members across Asia, America,
Canada, Europe, and New Zealand, including angel investors,
venture capitalists, and research institutes. It offers
members intellectual-property cluster mapping, training and
certification, joint-marketing, and technology-advisory
services.<br>Mark Stuart, the chief executive of Waikato
University’s business development unit, WaikatoLink, told
the NZ Herald that it is vital for burgeoning New Zealand
businesses to gain access to good networks in overseas
markets. He believed that WaikatoLink’s nine subsidiary
companies have the potential soon to earn more than $100
million.<br>AUT Innovation and Enterprise believes the
partnership is providing new opportunities for business.
Peter Lee, chief executive of the University of Auckland’s
UniServices said the TTN network and its growing global
presence is “a symbol of the increasingly flat and
friction-less world in which we do business”.</p><p>World
Watch<br>Melbourne staff strike for jobs and
dignity<br>Staff at Victoria University in Melbourne will be
taking industrial action next Monday following overwhelming
support in a secret ballot. Australia’s National Tertiary
Education Union (NTEU) has announced plans for a strike and
work bans unless the university negotiates on proposed
redundancies and demonstrates a new attitude to staff
demands.<br>“Strike action at Victoria University could be
averted if vice-chancellor Elizabeth Harman suspends the
planned mass-sackings over Christmas and comes to the
bargaining table in good faith,” said Matthew McGowan,
secretary of the NTEU Victorian Division.<br>NTEU members
voted overwhelmingly to authorise industrial action, with
the Australian Electoral Commission announcing the result
this week. And a mass meeting of NTEU members on Monday will
consider recommendations for subsequent rounds of industrial
action, including further strike action in
December.<br>“As we head into the holiday season, there
are over 270 staff at Victoria University who won’t be
celebrating. We have been trying to get the university to
bargain for a new collective agreement since May this year,
but their response has been to engage in delaying
tactics,” said Richard Gough, president of Victoria
University NTEU branch.<br>“University senior management
can end this dispute today by treating staff with the
dignity and respect they deserve. We are calling on
Professor Harman to end the forced redundancies and come to
the bargaining table ready to negotiate a new collective
agreement that would ensure that there would be no forced
redundancies for the life of any new agreement,” Mr Gough
said.<br>In a recent NTEU survey of higher-education staff
which asked whether staff had confidence in the
administration, vice-chancellor Harman and the senior
management at Victoria University rated worst in the state.
Some 94 percent of staff did not have confidence, compared
to a 72 percent state average.</p><p>Resignation forced at
KwaZulu-Natal<br>The national office of South Africa’s
National Tertiary Education Staff Union (NTESU) has learned
that Professor Nithaya Chetty of the University of
KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), resigned last week in the face of
demands to sign an “admission of guilt” statement by the
vice-chancellor, Malegapuru Makgoba. Professor Chetty’s
letter dates the resignation as effective at 31 December
2008, but Professor Makgoba has stated that the resignation
is of immediate effect.<br>The other lecturer charged at the
same time as Professor Chetty, Professor John van den Berg,
is reported as having signed the admission of guilt
statement under duress.<br>As previously reported in
Tertiary Update, the two professors were commissioned by
their faculty to develop a document on academic freedom for
presentation to senate. When they publically queried why the
document had not been tabled at senate, Professor Makgoba
responded by issuing disciplinary charges for making
statements to the press, violating the confidentiality of
senate, and dishonesty or gross negligence in questioning
their vice-chancellor’s refusal to table the
document.<br>In an email to the minister of education, the
national president of NTESU, Sylvia Nkanyuza, said, “There
is great concern about the bullying tactics, intimidation,
and victimisation faced by not only Chetty, but by any other
person who criticises, challenges, and/or advocates for
truth in a higher education institution.”<br>The NTESU
national office has called for an academic boycott of the
institution by unionists and institutions abroad and locally
until such time as the UKZN and its vice-chancellor commit
to upholding freedom of expression, academic freedom, and
other constitutional rights. <br>More information on the
case and a petition are available at
:<br>http://www.ntesu.org.za</p><p>Schwarzenegger fails to
terminate<br>The University of California’s president,
Mark Yudof, has stepped in and provided $US4 million
($NZ7.126 million) of funding for labour and employment
research programmes at the University of California at
Berkeley and Los Angeles that had previously been cut from
the state budget by Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger.<br>Political conservatives and Republicans
like Schwarzenegger have been seen as treating the labour
centres as political footballs when they object to portions
of their work, such as a training program for union leaders.
“Just as the business schools are training programs for
business executives, it is important to have a balanced
mix,” said Ken Jacobs, chair of the University of
California’s Center for Labor Research and Education.
“If you look at the programs we do, they are programs that
support labor-management partnerships.”<br>The programme,
which costs $US5.4 million ($NZ9.6 million) per annum, was
the only item over which Schwarzenegger used his
gubernatorial line-item veto powers in the University of
California’s $US3 billion ($NZ5.34 billion) budget. The
cut quickly became an issue of academic freedom. Hundreds of
staff subsequently wrote to the governor protesting.
“Given the tiny amount of savings, it is hard to
understand this action as other than politically
motivated,” they said.<br>Their joint letter continued,
“We see this as unwarranted political interference in the
academic activities of the University of California. It
violates the basic principle of the freedom to speak out and
conduct research even on controversial topics. This freedom
is a cornerstone of the vital, world-class university
California needs.”<br>President Yudof’s funding package
provides work for approximately 40 researchers and staff
members.<br>From George Raine in the San Francisco
Chronicle</p><p>“Clever crazies” quitting science<br>Modern
scientists are “dull and getting duller” because the
career path required to join the profession weeds out anyone
interesting, creative, or exceptionally intelligent,
according to Bruce Charlton, a newly appointed professor of
theoretical medicine at the University of Buckingham, whose
polemic against the problems of modern science is published
in the current issue of the Oxford
Magazine.<br>“Scientists are, as a group, dull and getting
duller: duller both in term of less intelligent and more
boring. And the science they produce is increasingly
dull,” writes Professor Charlton. When it comes to
interesting research, he argues that scientists are “not
even trying” to produce it, funders are “not prepared”
to fund it, and journals are “not keen” to publish it
because there is a higher risk of error than in more
traditional projects.<br>He pins the blame on the process of
becoming a modern scientist, including what he says is a
ten-to-fifteen-year slog before they are allowed to pursue
their own research, and a proliferation of “mindless and
damaging” bureaucracy. The career path, he argues, puts
off all but the mildest-mannered, agreeable, and
conscientious, leaving little room for the “wildly
creative” personality type possessed by the great
scientists of the past. He continued that, as intelligence
and conscientiousness do not necessarily correlate, those
with the highest IQs get filtered out.<br>“We can only
conclude that science is dull mainly because its
requirements for long-term plodding perseverance and social
inoffensiveness have the effect of ruthlessly weeding out
too many smart and interesting people,” Professor Charlton
writes.<br>He concludes that the situation, which is
“neither optimal for the individuals nor for society at
large”, needs to change. But he says ideas for wooing the
“clever crazies” back to science are not going to come
from within the discipline.<br>From Zoë Corbyn in Times
Higher Education</p><p>Battle of the Oxbridge podcasts<br>For
800 years, Oxford and Cambridge universities have competed
in everything from Nobel prizes to boat races. The academic
rivalry runs deep: Oxford has tutored 25 British prime
ministers, while Cambridge claims Darwin and Newton as its
own. But recently the venerable institutions launch into
battle on iTunes, taking their ancient competition into the
twenty-first century. <br>The universities simultaneously
published about 450 hours of free audio and video podcasts
of lectures, films, and admissions guides for people to
download to a computer or MP3 player. They are available
from iTunes U, the download provider’s university portal,
where US institutions have been broadcasting their academic
wares for some years.<br>Both universities are providing
podcasts advising students on applications, how to choose a
college, and how to prepare for an interview. They deny that
the simultaneous launch was designed to start an iTunes
race, instead claiming it is a sign they are opening up to a
wider audience. Both were happy to provide a roll call of
the great and the good who will be available for all under
their respective university brands. It will inevitably
invite accusations of a new battleground for the famous
foes.<br>Oxford’s podcast includes Michael Palin of Monty
Python fame in a documentary filmed to promote the
university’s £1.25 billion ($NZ3.31 billion) fundraising
drive. Lectures come from Professor Joseph Stiglitz, former
chief economist of the World Bank, Craig Venter, who led the
private effort to sequence the human genome, Sir Nicholas
Stern, the climate-change academic, and the philosopher
Julian Savulescu.<br>From Polly Curtis in the

<h4>Did you know Scoop has an Ethical Paywall?</h4>
<p>If you're using Scoop for work, your organisation needs to pay a small license fee with Scoop Pro. We think that's fair, because your organisation is benefiting from using our news resources. In return, we'll also give your team access to pro news tools and keep Scoop free for personal use, because public access to news is important!<br /><br />
