joined together this week to protest at job cuts proposed
for the University of Canterbury’s College of Arts. It is
expected that around twenty-three academic and general staff
jobs will be lost as the College moves to cut $1.6 million
from its operational expenditure in what Association of
University Staff Branch President, Dr David Small, describes
as a “manufactured” financial crisis.<br>The disciplines
targeted for cuts include Education, Art History, History,
English, American Studies, Modern European Languages and
Sociology.<br>More than one hundred staff and students
attended a forum on Tuesday, following which they marched to
the Registry where student representative Daria Wadsworth
presented a 2300-signature petition protesting at the cuts,
saying that they would affect the University’s reputation as
an academic institution. Ms Wadsworth said that the
Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Sharp, is answerable to each
and every student, and that the University should focus on
academic quality rather than short-term financial goals.
“The University is the critic and conscience of the
community and it shouldn’t be run as a business,” she
said.<br>Dr Small said that the disciplines at which the
redundancies are aimed comprise the core of the Humanities
programme which lies at the heart of any university. “These
are disciplines concerned with language, the analysis of
historical change, the nature of cultural and social
formation and development and how human beings interact with
their world,” he said. “Where they do not eliminate them
completely, the cuts planned by the Vice-Chancellor will
undermine the quality and integrity of these
offerings.”<br>Dr Small predicted that the staffing cuts
would lead to Canterbury becoming a less attractive
university destination for students.<br>As a result of
Tuesday’s protest, the College of Arts Pro Vice-Chancellor,
Professor Ken Strongman, agreed to ask the Vice-Chancellor,
who was absent from the University during the protest, to
address staff and students at a University forum.<br>It is
expected the final decisions on staff cuts will be made in
April, with affected staff to leave the University during
the course of the year.<p>

<p>National
Centre for Tertiary Teaching Excellence closer<br>The
establishment of a national centre to promote tertiary
teaching excellence, to be called Ako Aotearoa: Tertiary
Teaching For Learning Centre, has moved a further step
closer with the announcement this week that eligible
organisations are being invited to submit a proposal for its
establishment and operation. The new centre will be
established as a not-for-profit organisation with a distinct
identity, and will be hosted by an existing tertiary
education organisation rather than operating as an entirely
independent organisation.<br>Last year, the Government
announced that it would provide $4 million funding per year
following recommendations by the Teaching Matters Forum,
convened earlier in the year, to provide assistance and
advice on the setting up of a centre and to engage with the
tertiary-education sector on options for supporting
effective teaching and learning. The Forum is a
government-appointed group of individuals with interests and
expertise in tertiary education, including AUS
representative Andrea Haines. <br>The Government identified
the key goals for the Centre as helping to build the
teaching capability of tertiary education organisations and
educators, providing advice related to teaching excellence
to the sector and government agencies and leading research,
along with monitoring and evaluating activities related to
effective teaching and learning in tertiary
education.<br>The Tertiary Education Commission says that,
as well as undertaking research, the Centre will support
groups that work with teachers and learners, including
existing networks and professional bodies, while remaining
relevant and accessible to individual teachers. Importantly,
it will create incentives for improvement in quality, such
as running and further improving the Tertiary Teaching
Excellence Awards from 2007.<br>More information on the
establishment of Ako Aotearoa: Tertiary Teaching For
Learning Centre, including the Teaching Matters Working
Group report on the governance and management of the
proposed Centre, can be found at:
<br>http://www.tec.govt.nz/funding/teaching2/ncftte/about.htm</p>

<p>Workforce
review enters second stage<br>Phase two of the Government’s
strategic review of the tertiary-education workforce is well
underway with the announcement this week that the Review
Team is seeking feedback from the sector on major projects
to be undertaken in 2006. <br>The intention of the review is
to carry out a stocktake of the tertiary education workforce
and current issues, advise on major workforce supply and
demand trends over the next twenty years, and any mismatch,
and advise on a framework for describing and understanding
future workforce requirements. It is also designed to
analyse issues relating to the tertiary education workforce
so that a more comprehensive and strategic approach can be
taken to them.<br>A paper prepared by the Review Team and
based on initial research and analysis from six scoping
papers will form the basis of consultation which will occur
through meetings to be held around the country and through
direct submissions. Dave Guerin of Education Directions has
been engaged to manage this phase of the project, with Doug
Martin, Bryan Gould, Lisa Mutch, Stewart Milner, Lis Cowey
and David Choat comprising the rest of the Review Team. A
steering group of senior Tertiary Education Commission and
Ministry of Education officials will oversee the work.<br>It
is proposed that the main research project would be a
comprehensive survey of tertiary education staff and
stakeholders designed to provide information in a wide
number of areas, including key issues in recruitment and
retention (salaries, career structures and working
environments), workloads, the role of casual and part-time
staff, skill shortages, barriers to workforce diversity,
links with employers and the community and the effectiveness
and availability of professional development.<br>It also
proposed that other research could cover the aging of the
workforce, the collection of qualitative data, improving
annual staff-data collection and the sharing of best
practice.<br>Consultation closes on Friday 3 March, with
major projects to be carried out between March and July
2006. A final report will be presented to the Tertiary
Education Commission in August and then released to the
sector.<br>The consultation and scoping papers, along with
background information, can by found at:

<p>Another
polytech bailed out<br>The Palmerston North-based Universal
College of Learning (UCOL) is the latest polytechnic to be
given a financial lifeline from the Government, this time in
the form of a $3 million suspensory loan. National Party
Education spokesperson Bill English says that the deal will
do nothing to solve the financial problems that are becoming
endemic in the sector following similar “bail-outs” at the
Western (Taranaki) and Wellington Institutes of Technology
last year.<br>UCOL Chief Executive, Paul McElroy, is
reported by NZPA as saying that the Education Minister had
agreed to a request from the UCOL Council for financial
assistance with the running of its Whanganui campus, which
continued to operate at a financial loss. “This show of
support from the Government highlights the importance of
tertiary education in New Zealand and particularly that of
Whanganui UCOL,” he said. “The loan will convert to an
operating grant on meeting certain conditions in 2006, which
entails preparing a seven-year business plan for the
Whanganui campus.”<br>Mr English says, however, that this
amounts to little more than a financial subsidy for bad
management and will only make the situation worse. “The
problems in our polytechs cannot be swept under the carpet.
If Dr Cullen thinks the system will be fixed by throwing
more money at it he is very much mistaken,” he said. “The
polytech sector is sick but Dr Cullen is prescribing the
wrong medicine.”</p>

<p>Top researchers get funding boost
<br>High quality research undertaken by New Zealand’s
smartest scholars is getting a near $6m boost thanks to the
latest round of Bright Future Scheme scholarships.
Seventy-two graduate and postgraduate students have been
awarded Enterprise Scholarships and forty-seven PhD students
have been awarded Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships by the
Tertiary Education Commission.<br>The newly funded
Enterprise scholars will receive almost $600,000 over the
next three years, while newly funded Top Achiever Doctoral
scholars will receive more than $5 million over the next 36
months of their study. <br>The Minister for Tertiary
Education, Dr Michael Cullen, said that the Bright Future
Scheme helps young researchers turn good ideas into
innovative new products and services. “It is a good example
of government’s commitment towards building a knowledge
economy based on highly skilled people. The scheme supports
quality research and fosters strong relationships between
tertiary education institutions and businesses,” he
said.<br>Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships help PhD
students to undertake first-class research in all
disciplines in New Zealand or overseas. On the completion of
the scholarship, students doing the research overseas must
return to New Zealand for a period equal to that of the
scholarship.<br>The Enterprise Scholarships encourage
graduate and postgraduate students to study and research in
New Zealand in partnership with New Zealand-based private
companies or public organisations, such as crown research
institutes. As a result their annual stipend is funded
jointly by companies and the government.<p>

<p>Worldwatch<br>Strike action shuts registration at SA
University<br>Student enrolment at South Africa's University
of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) has been effectively shut down as
strike action by staff enters its second week. Thousands of
staff and students have marched under the banners of
education for all, decent working conditions and academic
freedom. One of the University’s five campuses is under
heavily armed police occupation and serious clashes between
police and strikers are reported by the daily media as
looking increasingly likely.<br>Staff are calling for
improved working conditions and the sacking of
Vice-Chancellor William Mokgoba over what has been described
as the "messy" merger of the Natal and Durban-Westville
Universities to form the UKZN.<br>Unions say the
redeployment of staff into positions in the new University
structure was carried out without proper union consultation,
and that they are prevented from participating in many
decision-making structures. When included, they say they are
subject to an increasingly authoritarian style of
management.  “It is of great concern to us that this
attitude of management has served to erode academic freedom
at UKZN. Many members of staff no longer feel free to
criticise members of the Executive or the manner in which
the University is run. Any criticism is viewed as opposition
to transformation at the University,” a Union spokesperson
said.<br>Compounding the problems, staff have been offered a
4 percent increase conditional on the reduction of
sabbatical, leave, retrenchment and fee remission conditions
in response to an 8 percent salary claim. By contrast,
University management, in addition to a 4% increase for
2006, have received bonuses of up to 12 percent of their
salary packages, understood already to be among the highest
in the country.<br>National Tertiary Education Staff Union
spokesman, Professor Kesh Govinder, said that a meeting with
University management this week failed to reach a
compromise, and so the strike action would continue at the
Howard College campus in Durban.<br>From NTSU and the
Independent Media Centre, South Africa</p>

<p>Staff sue
University over AWAs<br>Australian academics have launched a
multimillion-dollar class action against the University of
Ballarat for allegedly misleading staff by encouraging them
to sign individual employment contracts. Law firm Maurice
Blackburn Cashman is acting for up to 700 academics and
general staff at Ballarat who will be seeking $A7 million in
damages when they lodge the action in the Federal Court in
Victoria. <br>Staff accuse the University of breaching the
Workplace Relations Act by supplying false and misleading
information late last year to induce to staff to take up
Australian Workplace Agreements. <br>At issue is the
University’s insistence to staff that key employment
conditions would be safeguarded if they moved on to
individual contracts. According to the National Tertiary
Education Union (NTEU) and the legal team, however, staff
who sign AWAs will lose entitlements including the right of
access to the Industrial Relations Commission for
arbitration and protection against disciplinary action or
termination. They would also be subject to inferior
redundancy entitlements. <br>The legal action follows a
tussle between the NTEU and the University of Ballarat over
the Government's higher-education workplace relations
requirements. Ballarat’s NTEU branch president Jeremy Smith,
who is the legal action's primary applicant, described it as
being a long time coming. “We find ourselves in a situation
where the University will only offer AWAs to deliver pay
rises to staff, and in return for signing an AWA. It’s our
belief that they are giving away key employment conditions,”
Dr Smith said. <br>From The Australian</p>

<p>UK unions reject
new pay talks<br>Academic unions have rejected a move by
British university employers to reopen pay negotiations,
refusing to put on hold planned industrial action unless
vice-chancellors put a “substantive offer on the table”.
<br>The Universities and Colleges Employers’ Association
(UCEA) has written to the Association of University Teachers
(AUT) and lecturers’ union Natfhe, offering to resume pay
talks later this month, but on the proviso that the unions
“put on hold any industrial action authorised by the two
unions.”<br>Union members are voting on a recommendation for
industrial action over the breakdown of negotiations in a
ballot which will close later today.<br>The unions say that,
despite having submitted initial pay claims in October last
year, the employers have failed to make any “substantive
response”. Responding to UCEA’s request to reopen
negotiations, AUT Deputy General Secretary, Malcolm Keight,
said that, while the unions were committed to constructive
negotiations, their past dealings with UCEA indicated that
procrastination was a popular employer tactic. “We felt
driven to ensure that staff concerns were properly addressed
in a timely matter. To attempt to make a deferral of action
a condition of commencing meaningful negotiations would only
be interpreted by our members as further procrastination,”
he said. <br>Ruth Kelly, the Education Secretary, last week
confirmed that universities would receive £6.5 billion
excluding the additional income from top-up fees. This
includes a 6.7 percent increase in the teaching grant for
2006-07, and a 7.3 percent increase for research. <br>From
