Important discussions are happening at today’s Senate meeting, and your presence is crucial. We urge you to attend from <strong>1:30-4:30pm at the UoA ClockTower</strong>.</p><p>While the issues on the agenda may seem specific to certain schools or faculties, they are part of a broader pattern that affects us all. This document outlines key concerns regarding the university’s management strategies and calls for a recommitment to the principles of transparency, shared governance, and evidence-based decision-making.</p><p>Universities are built on the shared commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and truth for all. From these goals we derive commitment to the democratic principles of transparency and the recognition of diverse knowledge freely exchanged between peoples across academic traditions and disciplines. Such principles are not confined to any single discipline but are the bedrock of academic life. Ongoing failure of the university administration to realise these values in their decision making processes create serious concern about the direction of this university. Amongst academics, views on key issues regarding the short-term direction of the university differ – issues such as the Curriculum Framework Transformation and the rapid Law and Business School merger. Long-term, many more of us are in agreement; the values and processes which are guiding our institution at the highest level are not fit for purpose.</p><p>Students and staff have been gaining the courage to vocalise their lack of confidence in some of the poorly formed and fast-tracked plans of the administration, such as rapidly cutting significant numbers of small courses from the curriculum. It is apparent in the shift towards bad-faith tactics that the administration is aware of their lack of academic capital to lean/stand on in regards to proposed changes, such as the CFT transformation-adjacent course cuts. Such tactics mediate their engagement with students and staff, and the ability of students and staff to engage in return. These strategies manipulate narratives and obscure facts around what forecasted problems require addressing (if identified at all), what solutions are desired by students and staff, and if there is any reasoning at all informing their proposed solutions.</p><p>When the university administration bypasses the democratic participation of the senate, misrepresents submission data, or obscures information, they undermine the very foundations of intellectual integrity and reasoned decision-making that define a university. Such actions erode trust and compromise the university&#39;s ability to fulfill its missions in education and research. Along the way it dramatically lowers the standard of integrity below that which excellent research requires.</p><p>Below are just a handful examples from recent key issues where these bad-faith tactics are being used by management. Individually these examples are unacceptable mistakes, collectively they show a pattern of values <strong>undermining the academic integrity of our institution.</strong></p><p>Despite diverse views on any individual action (rightly so), there is common recognition of faulty values and mechanisms for decision making guiding this university, and that unites us despite any differences in opinion on individual issues. We expect reasoned and just processes managing our university, process informed by fact, research, and which represents the collective expertise of this incredible academe. Leading the university administration, Dawn’s predecessor, Stuart McCutcheon, was not universally agreed with either – that is an impossible achievement. But he was not dishonest about his intentions and would face the music of his decisions.</p><p>Just as academics recognise the importance of reasoned methods in science and research, we recognise the importance of reasoned and just process in leadership and governance. We call on the administration to recommit to the principles of shared governance, open dialogue, and evidence-based decision-making. A university thrives when it fosters collaboration, respects its community, and prioritizes truth over unjustified expediency. It is time to restore trust, ensure accountability, and safeguard the democratic processes that are the foundation of academic excellence and institutional integrity.</p><h4 id="what-you-can-do">What You Can Do</h4><p>While your participation, votes, and actions are up to you, we suggest seriously evaluating the governance of this institution and the expectations you have for New Zealand’s leading university. A strong presence and participation at senate is a stand for the values that define our university. Together, we can ensure that our institution remains a beacon of academic excellence, integrity, and inclusivity.It is important that despite any attempts to undermine representation, that staff are heard, at the very least by each other. <strong>Please attend the senate meeting today</strong> <strong>1:30-4:30pm @ UoA ClockTower.</strong></p><p>A copy of this letter will be available on <a href="http://wearetheuniversity.org/blog/2025/03/03/upholding-reason-in-leadership-at-the-university-of-auckland">our website</a>, this is where any updates, corrections, additions etc will be posted. Feel free to reply to this email. Feel free to share broadly and discuss with peers.</p><h3 id="examples-of-bad-faith-tactics-employed-by-university-management">Examples of bad-faith tactics employed by university management</h3><p>To illustrate these concerns, we highlight some instances where management&#39;s actions have undermined transparency, academic integrity, and the principles of shared governance.</p><ol><li>Misleading Use of Data:</li></ol><p>In an email to the Faculty of Law on February 27th, the Vice-Chancellor claimed that the proposed Law-Business merger reflects a &quot;common structure internationally.&quot; However, the Review Committee Report—on which this statement is based—selectively cites data from institutions that are not true peers of the University of Auckland in terms of ranking or national significance. This misrepresentation has misinformed students, staff, and the public, eroding trust in the decision-making process. Had the administration engaged in open dialogue earlier, the academic community could have identified and addressed these flaws.</p><ol start="2"><li>Undermining Participation:</li></ol><p>The timing and structure of recent Senate meetings appear designed to limit participation and stifle dissent:</p><ul><li><p>The meeting to discuss the Curriculum Framework Transformation was scheduled during mid-semester break, when many staff were unavailable, despite requests to hold it the prior week.</p></li><li><p>Similarly, the discussion on the Law-Business merger was moved to the first day of teaching, creating additional barriers to attendance.</p></li></ul><p>These decisions reflect a troubling pattern of minimizing input from the university community. Additionally, schools were given only 1-2 weeks to recommend courses for cuts, leaving little time for meaningful consultation. The lack of open mechanisms for direct student and staff feedback further exacerbates these issues.</p><ol><li>Misinforming students and refusing to engage with staff</li></ol><p>At a student-led open forum on August 22nd, 2024, the Provost claimed that the fast-tracked approach to course cuts was part of a &quot;normal&quot; review process. This statement was misleading, as the standard process involves a three-year review cycle, which was not yet due. This misrepresentation targeted students, who are less likely to be familiar with the university’s governance processes. The Provost’s refusal to answer questions from staff further highlighted the administration’s lack of engagement and transparency and the vulnerability her blatant misinformation created in her authority.</p><ol start="4"><li>Misrepresenting Feedback</li></ol><p>In an email to the Faculty of Law on February 27th, Vice-Chancellor Dawn Freshwater stated:</p><p>“The report acknowledges key concerns raised during consultation and proposes refinements to the original proposal. Based on this, and subject to University Council approval, I am inclined to accept the Committee’s recommendations.”</p><p>This language obscures the fact that the report does not recommend proceeding with the merger. Instead, it merely suggests ways to minimize harm if the merger is forced through. This misrepresentation of feedback undermines the credibility of the consultation process and disregards the widespread opposition from students and staff.</p><ol start="5"><li>Rationale-Last Decision-Making</li></ol><p>Management’s approach often involves making decisions first and developing justifications afterward. This is evident in the Law-Business merger report, which keenly suggests articulating a rationale and addressing student concerns—steps that should have preceded any proposal.</p><p>At the August 22nd student-led open forum, students noted the inconsistent rationales provided for rapid course cuts (e.g., financial constraints, logistical issues, and claims that students want less choice). When challenged, the administration abruptly shifted to claiming the process was &quot;normal,&quot; further highlighting the lack of a coherent, evidence-based rationale.</p><p>In the same vein, Vice-Chancellor Dawn Freshwater’s email vaguely attributes the need for change to “new technology, changing job markets, and evolving government priorities.” This disconnect between cause and effect suggests either a lack of strategic direction or an attempt to justify predetermined decisions. More critically, incorporating the context of significant resistance, it is a poorly veiled threat that opposition to the merger is fruitless and is intended to undermine their efforts to continue fighting this unnecessary and unjustified reform. Such an approach undermines the university’s commitment to reasoned, evidence-based governance.</p></section><section class="footer"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></section></body>
