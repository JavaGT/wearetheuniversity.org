Thank you for joining our conversation. We&#39;ll begin shortly. And we&#39;re live, kia ora everyone, and thank you for joining the conversation. Today we have your student representatives as well as some university representatives to talk about the proposal to combine the faculties of Law with Business and Economics. I&#39;m Gabriel Boyd, your AUSA president and here are your student representatives.</p><p>Kia ora everyone my name is Matthew and I&#39;m your undergraduate education vice-president.</p><p>Kia ora everyone my name is Apurva and I am your AULSS president representative.</p><p>Hi everyone, I’m Aurora, I’m one of your co-presidents for AUCSA and I’m also the media officer for AULSS.</p><p>Kia ora everyone my name is Brianna and I am your other co-president of AUCSA.</p><p>Amazing and now our university representatives</p><p>Kia ora koutou, Adrian Clement, I’m the deputy vice chancellor operations and registrar of the university</p><p>Kia ora koutou I’m joanna brown director of student and academic services.</p><p>So this is just a reminder that today is your chance to ask questions and hear directly from the University. Please have your say we have the link in our link tree and also the university&#39;s website has a feedback form for any concerns or complaints you don&#39;t wish to talk about today. So up first the university is going to give a brief overview of the proposal for a couple of minutes and then our representatives will have a chance to ask questions.</p><blockquote><p>Thank you, Gabriel. I&#39;ll just restate the proposal from the vice-chancellor. The vice-chancellor is seeking feedback on a proposal to merge the faculties of Business and Economics with the Faculty of Law. Within this combined faculty, the individual identities of the Business School and the Law School would be maintained, specifically within the Law School. It&#39;s proposed that the Law School will expand with the addition of Commercial Law from the Faculty of Business and Economics, increasing its academic staff to over 70. The proposal outlines that the Law School would then be divided into two departments. Furthermore, if this proposal moves forward, a transitional leadership would be established to oversee the creation of the Law School within the combined faculty. The proposal includes details on how this transition would occur. As for the rationale behind the proposal, the vice-chancellor has considered organisational effectiveness. The Faculty of Law is currently quite small compared to other faculties at the university, and this presents an opportunity to streamline academic leadership at the senior level. There are also potential organisational benefits related to academic leadership within both Law and Business and Economics. From the earlier consultation on the merger of the Faculties of Arts and Education, we learned that academic leadership in smaller faculties was disproportionately consumed by administrative duties. A broader faculty structure could help free up time for more strategic thinking, planning, and leadership activities. This merger could offer greater resilience and flexibility, especially given the significant external pressures and changes currently facing the university sector. It also holds the potential for broader research opportunities for both staff and students. Additionally, there is an equity opportunity here to build a critical mass of Māori and Pacific staff and students. I&#39;ll stop there.</p></blockquote><p>Cool thank you Adrian, quickly we were just informed that the mics weren’t working during the introduction so to clarify, I am AUSA president Gabriel Boyd alongside undergraduate education vice president Mathew Lee we also have your student representatives we have Apurva representing the law faculty and Aurora and Bree representing the commerce faculty. on the university side. We have adriann cleveland and Joanna Brown the director of student and academic services here. So again, the mics weren&#39;t working, but I encourage you to submit questions through our link, as well as give your feedback through the university&#39;s channel on their website.</p><p>So now we will give the student representatives some time to respond to that opening introduction by Adrian.</p><p>Thank you for your opening. I just had a question. So you said that the identities of both law school and business school will be maintained. Could you please elaborate on the specifics on exactly how the identities will be maintained? Thank you.</p><blockquote><p>Thanks, Aurora. So, you know, some of those details would be pursued by the new leadership of the combined faculty. But what is envisaged is that there would be a separation within the new faculty, between the law school and law school. In some ways, this is responding to requirements of our accreditation bodies. So we do need to be able to provide reporting and many other aspects of the activities of the business school and the law school to our accreditation bodies. So to our accreditation bodies, and that includes the Council of Legal Education as well, of course. So it would be organisationally, there would be some separation there. I think, too, it&#39;s likely that there would be separation in terms of branding, in terms of communications, and the way our website is organised, because the identities are important to the university and have stood us in very good stead, as both the law school and the business school are highly regarded nationally and internationally.</p></blockquote><p>So what about the structure of both schools? Because law school works very differently to every other faculty within the university, just because of how a law degree is structured. So could you elaborate a little more about how the structure could potentially change with the proposed amendment?</p><blockquote><p>So the proposal itself sets out one option there, which was to have two departments. And we are receiving feedback from a number of staff within both the Faculty of Law and Faculty of Business and Economics around whether that is the best arrangement. I&#39;m not really in a good position to say whether that&#39;s the best arrangement or not. So the review committee will consider all of those pieces of feedback that come through from the academic staff around what works best. Internationally, when you look at how other law schools have been organised, there are some examples of where a law school has been organised into departments. More often, I understand, they are organised into research subjects or topics or areas, topic areas. And academic staff can align with one or more of those. So it will be interesting to see the totality of the feedback that comes through and where the review committee might get to on recommending a future structure.</p></blockquote><p>Awesome. And sorry, just another follow up to that. So how can students have confidence in the university&#39;s promise that the separate identities of the faculties will be meaningfully maintained when none of the details have really been worked on yet?</p><blockquote><p>I think where you can have confidence is that the university is absolutely committed to triple accreditation for the business school and ongoing professional accreditation for the law school. So that requires us in many ways. To have a separate identity for both of those schools. And I think you can have confidence about that.</p></blockquote><p>Amazing. Thank you. I just had a quick question on the point you made on how law school is, the law faculty is becoming, is one of the smallest ones, is what you&#39;d say. Yes. What would you say, and you also mentioned that a large part of the faculty is taken up by the administrative staff. staff. How would the absence of such staff who play a vital part in the support of law students be filled or reasoned with if there are possible cuts to those areas?</p><blockquote><p>I need to clarify what I said first, just around my opening comment. So what I was trying to communicate there was around the time spent by academic leadership, not the professional staff. Okay. So what the feedback that we&#39;d had in the proposal to create the new faculty of arts and education was that in the small faculties, they still had the burden of all of that administration that a large faculty needed to undertake in terms of the associate dean academic, the regulations, that academic leadership. Okay. And they found that with the limited amount of time they had to devote to academic leadership, it was largely being spent on administrative activities. And they were identifying an opportunity there to have more time to think strategically and to spend time on value-add activities. So that was one of the benefits that they saw. In terms of professional staff, there would be a response to any decision that is made. So in the event a proposal goes ahead for a combined faculty. At that point, there would be work done on responding to that decision with respect to academic leadership or an academic leadership structure. I think for this proposed new faculty, it would be quite unique because we would need to maintain the law school and the business school as well as --</p></blockquote><p>I think we&#39;re going to have to move into our Q&amp;A now. I hope that gave everybody a little bit of an overview about the proposal. But we&#39;re going to jump straight into the questions that you guys sent us to ask.</p><p>So one of the first questions and one of the most commonly asked questions is that we all saw that the arts merger, there was a lot of contention surrounding that. How is this combination, how is this proposal different from the arts merger?</p><blockquote><p>with this new combination, there are two professional faculties with accreditation. And I think that&#39;s an inherent difference. So that will need to be considered and has been considered by the Vice Chancellor in the proposal itself in terms of maintaining those separate identities between the law school and the business and economic. . . . So less of a merger. Yes. Okay, fantastic. .</p></blockquote><p>Another question, which the answer should be relatively short, is students want to know will the names that they get on their degree, their particular accreditations, will that name differ at all? Will that change at all on their degree?</p><blockquote><p>That will not change at all.</p></blockquote><p>That&#39;s good to know. Thank you. Okay. Did you have a? Just agreeing.</p><p>Following up from that, with this merger, a lot of people are concerned about the reputation and qualifications taking a hit, as well as the global standing of the law or business schools. How do we know that this won&#39;t be the case and that it&#39;ll make the degree stronger and won&#39;t hurt the qualification?</p><blockquote><p>So the arrangement is not particularly unusual. So when we&#39;ve had a look at a benchmarking group that we often compare ourselves to, which includes the group of eight universities in Australia, so they&#39;re the highest ranked universities there, and the Russell Group universities in the UK, the majority, and the majority of those universities, it appears that the law school is not going to be the same. It appears that the law school is part of a broader faculty. That might not be very evident to external audiences or stakeholders. And it doesn&#39;t appear to have impacted the reputation for any of those law schools. The ranking for the law school is made up from the reputation and the excellence of the research output for the academic staff. . And that&#39;s the same as those universities in the group of eight and the Russell Group. So in and of itself, the proposal is not expected to have an impact on the rankings of the schools.</p></blockquote><p>Adrian, we&#39;ve gotten a lot of questions about sort of other universities having gone through similar proposals and actually, for example, the University of Canterbury previously merged their law and business faculties, but they had to undo their sort of that merge. . And we&#39;ve seen other universities in New Zealand consider similar proposals and ditch that proposal and even around the world as well. So I guess the question is, how is our proposal and our situation different?</p><blockquote><p>I don&#39;t know the details of why Canterbury may or may not have done all of that, Matthew, but I can make some kind of, I have some idea that it may have been around how things were organised to ensure that accreditations were ongoing and able to be pursued. . So the University of Auckland is absolutely determined to continue with triple accreditation for the business school and appropriate accreditation for the law school. And in any design decisions, that would be, that would take precedence really. So that&#39;s very important to us. And as I just said before, it&#39;s not an unusual organisation across the world. There are, of course, law schools that are completely independent and many well ranked universities, but there are also many law schools that are well ranked that are part of broader faculties.</p></blockquote><p>So just to follow up on that, this proposal that has come through from the Vice Chancellor, the question is around how long the Vice Chancellor had to consider this proposal and I guess do research on how other universities have arranged their law and business faculties. . What sort of research or even just asking around other universities has she done before submitting this proposal for consultation?</p><blockquote><p>It&#39;s probably not a question for me. Happy to pass that on to her at a reasonable time.</p></blockquote><p>Thank you. Fantastic. Thank you.</p><p>Moving on, another major concern students have was regarding the staff of both of the schools, not just the academic staff, but the pastoral care staff, staff, the academic support staff and the career advice staff. So the students wanted to know, will there be staffing cuts? Do we know for sure? How do we know that this won&#39;t reshape how those different support systems work?</p><blockquote><p>and so I might answer the question about academic staff and around cost more generally and then I&#39;ll say Joanna can respond around the professional staff. So in and of itself, this proposal would not have any impact on academic staffing in either of those faculties. So the resource allocation around academic staffing is made really around the student staff ratios across the different areas and that isn&#39;t impacted at all by this proposal. There would be a change in the academic governance structure. So that&#39;s around the associate dean positions. And that would be something that would be designed if it is decided to go ahead with the combined faculty. In terms of costs, and we have had queries elsewhere, and that is the real rationale for this proposal just around cost cutting. It is not around cost cutting. However, the University of Auckland, along with all universities in New Zealand, is facing significant financial challenge and you&#39;ll be aware that our subsidy from the government is not increased in line with inflation. And we are also not being funded for growth. So we are only being funded at the level of domestic enrolments in 2020. They are both quite challenging decisions from the government. And so we are taking a broad range of initiatives right across the university around our cost base. We absolutely need to look at our costs as well as other opportunities to improve our financial position because we are determined to remain financially sustainable in the longer term. If we could move on to Joanna to talk about that pastoral staff as well. Thanks, Gabriel. The university really recognises the importance of the pastoral care services and the career services as well, which we understand students have asked questions about. And within both the business school and the law school, they&#39;ve developed a capability that actually meets the needs of our students and in line with employers and industry as well. And we don&#39;t want to disrupt that benefit in that service that&#39;s been developed. And the university is constantly looking at changing how it needs to support our students, needs to support our external communities as well. So our services never stay the same. They&#39;re always adapting and changing because of our internal and external environments. But we absolutely see the value. And we have worked alongside the faculties on the design of their services as well. as well. So it will impact the non-academic staff. We just don&#39;t have concrete information on how. Well, we can&#39;t say how it&#39;s going to impact into the future, but we can say that the services that they provide are critical for the support of the students. . I think it&#39;s important that the university do recognise that because that is a student concern rather than a faculty concern or academic staff concern.</p></blockquote><p>So in particular, though, we are getting quite a few questions from the law side of things in regards to Māori and Moana Oceania students. We have, in my opinion, and the opinion of many students as well, a very concrete system in place to support them pastorally, whether that be through just or just the academic support, but also just the career support in particular as well. I did want a little bit more clarity, although I do appreciate that there isn&#39;t much right now, on whether there will be continued support in that avenue, particular to the law degree itself. Because I know the business department do have their own avenues for that, but law is a very niche and intricate and complex degree on its own. So could you just speak to that a little bit if you had conversations regarding that side of things?</p><blockquote><p>So taking careers to start with, for instance, we can see in the structure in both the Faculty of Business and Economics and the Faculty of Law that they have both prioritised resources in this area. So they both see it as really important. I think that makes sense because they&#39;re professional schools and they have a very close relationship with the professions. So I would indicate to me because of the current priority in both faculties that when they combine they will continue to have such a priority. For Māori and Pacific students and the level of pastoral care and student support provided, I do acknowledge that in law that has certainly been a priority for them and they have prioritised resources in that area. I think they have named roles to support Māori and Pacific students. In the business school, in terms of a combined faculty, I can&#39;t see why they would move away from current priorities when they&#39;re looking at their future structure. You can see though that there are likely to be changes in that structure and we&#39;ve indicated that in the proposal document itself. because there would be changes to the way it&#39;s organised, the management structure for professional staffing. Did we have any more follow ups about the staff or are we ready to move to the next question?</p></blockquote><p>I just have one other question. So around a quarter of the students at the business school are actually international students. So would there be any changes to the support or care that they&#39;re receiving with the combined faculty?</p><blockquote><p>Yes, probably a similar answer actually. Yes, the business school is very successful in attracting international students and particularly successful in taught postgraduate offerings to international students. And I think they are leading the university in terms of the way they provide support for those students. You know, I can&#39;t see that the faculty would suddenly change direction and not want to support international students where they&#39;ve been so successful in the past.</p></blockquote><p>OK. Sorry, could I interrupt really quickly? Yeah, of course. And apologies if this comes off rude in any way. I just want to go back to I guess the rationale surrounding the proposal as a whole then?</p><blockquote><p>I think that&#39;s a great question, in regards to why it&#39;s going ahead, if there&#39;s going to be a lot of changes to the professional staffing, particularly because, in my opinion, or the holistic law student opinion, we&#39;re on a very upwards trajectory in terms of building on what we&#39;ve started on with our teaching staff, with our professional staffing, with our courier staff. , and like you said, the name roles assisting specific demographics. So, could you just provide a bit more clarity then as to, if it&#39;s not affecting academic staff in any way, why are we merging the two faculties, or proposing to at least? So, that goes back to those other, the other rationale that the Vice Chancellor has in the proposal. is the organizational effectiveness objectives around having fewer and similar sized faculties at the executive level. There&#39;s the rationale around the effectiveness of academic leadership time and scale. There&#39;s the rationale around resilience, particularly in this current environment where we are looking at the level of the effectiveness of academic leadership time and scale, across a larger organizational unit. So, just going back to the question around professional staff, I cannot say or give any guarantees that there won&#39;t be reductions in professional staff, but that is irrespective of whether there was a merger or not. Right, okay. Because, over the whole university, we are having to look at our cost structures and we are reducing the number of staff, but that is not, you know, attached to this particular proposal. No, thank you, thank you for that.</p></blockquote><p>Could I follow up on that? A lot of students watching live right now feel a little frustrated that, you know, obviously it is true that the university does need to look at its costs and how we can, sort of, in the face of incoming funding cuts for academia, just in general, we need to be cautious of how we structure our university. . But I think a lot of students watching live right now have commented that they feel frustrated that this is a conversation that is happening while the university has made record profits over the past five years. And, you know, significant amount of surpluses. . So, how is it okay that we are talking about, sort of, cost saving measures when actually the university is making surpluses?</p><blockquote><p>So, we&#39;ve been looking at some of the surpluses that we have been reporting and we&#39;ve been looking at how we explain those surpluses. , that have been reported in the last two years that relate to non-cash items. And one of those, I don&#39;t want to bore you all of this, but in terms of our lovely new building, B201, we were fortunate enough to have an interest-free loan there. . And, because of that, accounting standards have required us to say that that is a source of revenue, the fact that we got an interest-free loan. So, that is part of, a very significant part, actually, of the surplus that we have been reporting. So, that&#39;s one of the interesting intricacies of our accounting standards. So, if you strip away those unusual items, our actually operating surplus is not significant. In terms of the TEC, that&#39;s the Tertiary Education Commission, they are wanting the universities to achieve a 4% operating surplus, so that&#39;s the surplus to revenue. We will not be able to do that on our current forecasts for several years. And a return to that level of sustainable surplus will require us to address a significant fiscal gap. So, I think it will be, maybe, important for students, then, if you&#39;re able to direct us to where we can find more clarity around this information. Yeah, is there anywhere we can go to read more about this? You can read the annual reports on our public website. But that&#39;s a good point. I mean, we&#39;re happy to provide students more information around that. We certainly have provided that to staff on the intranet. So, that&#39;s a good point, actually. Happy to take that further with you, Matthew, at some point. Thank you. . Thank you.</p></blockquote><p>So, another big question that a lot of students have was regarding the feedback and this perception that the feedback isn&#39;t being listened to or taken on board. We did a bit of homework before coming in today, and we read that the Criminal Bar Association here in New Zealand wasn&#39;t a big fan of this proposal. They came out against it, alongside prominent judges who were alumni here at the University of Auckland. We had some of our faculty representatives conduct surveys and found that, of those who filled out the survey, over 90% of law students stated they were strongly against this merger, as did the majority of business students. So, I guess the question is, how can we guarantee that the feedback that we have and the concerns that we have as students will be listened to? In the current structure, and I&#39;m not sure how many people are aware of how it works. This proposal, when it goes up to Council, will be listened to. When it goes up to Council, they are advised to, but don&#39;t have to listen or take any of the feedback into account when they finalise their decision. So, if there&#39;s overwhelming disappointment in this proposition, or disagreement, or students are very bullish on a certain aspect being changed, how do we know that we&#39;ll be listened to?</p><blockquote><p>One of the safeguards that we have. One of the safeguards that all stakeholders have is that the Vice-Chancellor has appointed a review committee with the chair being an ex-dean of the university, Professor John Hosking, and an independent party, I can&#39;t remember the name of who that is now, but on the review committee. So they will have access to all of the feedback that comes in. And we have invited members of the law profession and the business community to provide feedback directly as well. So that will be interesting for the review committee to see that. So that might mirror the feedback that you&#39;ve had unofficially around the outside of the proposal, or it may not. But all of that feedback will be analysed and all will be made available to members of the review committee. So, I&#39;ve had personal experience of these sorts of proposals in the past. I have been always impressed with how review committees here have considered feedback and have worked through quite complex matters that have been raised, and in general improved proposals as a result of consultation processes. Fantastic. Thank you. So hopefully that would happen again. Fingers crossed. . Fingers crossed.</p></blockquote><p>Could I interject really quickly? I&#39;d rather have a conversation here rather than just ask questions in a sense as well about this. Just to voice a bit of known frustration that the consultation period is over the summer break. This obviously does, was that the question that was? That was coming. Yeah. Okay. I just would rather have a conversation about this. I guess in a sense, what were the reasons for the, for the universities, his attempts to extend the consultation period when asked to do so? I guess, yeah, that&#39;s my main question. But building off of that, we can talk more. Sure. Yeah.</p><blockquote><p>And I do acknowledge the timing of the consultation period is particularly difficult for students. The Vice-Chancellor has acknowledged that though, and you can see that we&#39;ve got quite an extended period of consultation. . So while it is at a difficult time for students, it does allow for some coming and going and different times of being away, hopefully to enable more people to respond. . From what I understand, it doesn&#39;t appear to have stopped people making… No. …submissions. No. . No. …so that&#39;s a positive sign that we&#39;re not going to be making decisions in a vacuum. Yes. So we&#39;ve actually had a high degree of interest to date in the proposal. But in terms of the previous faculty rearrangement, I think the consultation process there was around three weeks for submissions, and I think this time it might be nine weeks, something like that. . So we have looked to provide a longer period of time in response to that.</p></blockquote><p>Okay. To follow up and continue talking about the consultation process itself, I think one concern that a lot of people have is that this proposal is very general.</p><p>A lot of the questions you might not have answers to right now. We’ll see as the proposal evolves. The feedback period ends while we still lack specifics on the proposal. As more specifics emerge, will there be another consultation period where students can voice feedback and have it heard?</p><blockquote><p>The Review Committee will consider all feedback and make recommendations to the Vice Chancellor. These recommendations could vary: they may recommend going ahead as proposed, suggest changes, or even decide it’s best not to proceed. The Vice Chancellor would then discuss this with Senate and Council. If the decision is made to proceed in some form, leadership, like the Dean, would be appointed to guide the design of academic governance, professional staff structures, and strategy.</p></blockquote><p>Section 12(7) of the Education and Training Act 2020 requires schools to reflect Māori values and ensure equitable outcomes for Māori students. Will there be opportunities for Māori staff and students to be involved post-consultation? There currently seems to be minimal information on their involvement in the process.</p><blockquote><p>The Pro-Vice Chancellor Māori has had conversations with Māori staff, and their views will be a key part of the Review Committee’s considerations. We’ve had student representation in previous reviews, and we will again in this one, including Māori and Pacific views in the transition and design.</p></blockquote><p>Many people watching are concerned about the consultation process, especially since it’s happening during summer. You’ve mentioned the Review Committee, which Gabriel and I will be part of, along with representatives from ALSS and ACCSA. But once the Review Committee makes its recommendation to the Vice Chancellor, will that report be made public for students? Can the Vice Chancellor or Council ignore the feedback and proceed even if there’s opposition?</p><p>? Legally, the Vice Chancellor and Council must seek advice from Senate, but they are not legally bound to follow it. The Vice Chancellor has generally taken the advice of Review Committees, but there’s no guarantee.</p><p>Will the report from the Review Committee be made publicly available?</p><blockquote><p>Yes, a summary report will be made available, but individual submissions and the Review Committee’s deliberations will remain confidential.</p></blockquote><p>The consultation period ends in five days, and changes could happen by Q3 of 2025. If the proposal moves forward and more clarity is added later, will students have further opportunities to provide feedback on updated versions?</p><blockquote><p>It depends. If the final proposal is consistent with the current one, there likely won’t be further consultation. If there are significant changes, it will be up to the Vice Chancellor to decide whether to consult again.</p></blockquote><p>Some viewers believe the proposal won’t affect student experiences, apart from pastoral services. How will this proposal improve the academic experience for students? Will it only be a behind-the-scenes restructure, or will it also affect academics?</p><blockquote><p>It’s hard to predict, but there could be opportunities to expand law programs, especially postgraduate offerings, which are currently limited. The law school has around 9% postgraduate students, which is low. There may also be more opportunities for research collaboration between faculties, benefiting both staff and students.</p></blockquote><p>What happens to public-leaning courses like international law, human rights, and indigenous studies? There’s concern that they could be submerged under the commercial aspects of merging Business and Economics with Law.</p><blockquote><p>There’s no preference for commercial law over other areas of law. The law school will continue to offer its full range of subjects, and the proposal doesn’t aim to change that. Both the law school and business school are strong academic units, and the university is committed to ensuring they continue to succeed.</p></blockquote><p>There’s a feeling that commercial law is receiving too much focus, and other important areas of law are being grouped under “other.” Could you address that concern?</p><blockquote><p>That’s not the intention. There’s no preference for one area of law over another. The law school will continue to consider what subjects to offer based on demand and relevance to students and society.</p></blockquote><p>There’s a lot of focus on commercial law, but it’s only a small part of the broader degree offerings. Will this proposal take away focus or resources from other important subjects?</p><blockquote><p>The university allocates funding based on student enrollments, so if commercial law attracts more students, it receives more resources. However, the business school regularly reviews its offerings to ensure they stay current and relevant to students.</p></blockquote><p>If commercial law isn’t the sole focus, why merge the law school with the Business and Economics faculty instead of, for example, the Faculty of Arts?</p><blockquote><p>That’s a good question, and I expect we’ll get many submissions about it. In some universities, law is part of social sciences. However, there are also strong arguments for law to be associated with business, especially around professional relationships, accreditations, and industry ties.</p></blockquote><p>If industry professionals don’t support the proposal, how might that impact the existing executive-in-residence and entrepreneur-in-residence programs at the business school? Would it affect the student experience?</p><blockquote><p>I’m not quite sure I understand your question. Are you asking if there might be negative perceptions that could lead to a lack of support? Potentially. Nothing concrete, though. That&#39;s something the university needs to consider—the potential benefits of the proposal in terms of strategy and organizational effectiveness and how it’s perceived by important stakeholders. The business community and the law profession are really important to the university, so we need to take their views into account. We wouldn’t want to upset either of those communities, especially if it would result in them not supporting the law or business schools.</p></blockquote><p>A good point about career progression. Many industry professionals in law, including judges and lawyers who are alumni of the University, have expressed concerns. As a law student myself, I’m worried about how this might affect my career prospects. Could this mean New Zealand law firms would be less likely to hire University of Auckland graduates? Will this affect our standing compared to other universities?</p><blockquote><p>This is just a personal view, but it’s not unusual for well-ranked, respected law schools around the world to be part of broader faculty arrangements without it negatively impacting their reputation. The University of Auckland’s law school is the leading one in New Zealand, and I don’t think the proposed changes would alter the quality of education or the prospects of graduates.</p></blockquote><p>What about students graduating under a Bachelor or Master of Commerce under the same faculty? Would this proposal affect their qualifications?</p><blockquote><p>This proposal won’t impact any qualifications.</p></blockquote><p>Just to clarify, the degree structure and names for current and future students will remain the same?</p><blockquote><p>Yes, everything will stay the same. But I want to emphasize the importance of professional staff, like the careers team, who help students find jobs. The careers team plays a key role in guiding students into the job market, which is just as important as academic learning. This proposal could impact staffing, and I’m concerned about what that might mean for the level of career support available. We&#39;re not in a position to provide specific details on that right now. However, both the law and business schools currently prioritize careers advice, and I expect a combined faculty would continue to do so. As for professional staff, we are under financial pressure across the university, and cost-saving measures are being considered.</p></blockquote><p>So, if this merger goes ahead, there will be changes to the professional staff structure?</p><blockquote><p>Yes, there would be a new professional staff structure, but I can&#39;t say whether the staffing resources allocated to career services would be reduced. Both faculties have made careers a priority, and I would expect that to continue.</p></blockquote><p>Could you explain, in 20 seconds, how the leadership of the various schools will work?</p><blockquote><p>Under the current proposal, the current Dean of the Faculty of Business and Economics would become the Dean of the combined faculty. The Law School would have its own Dean, who would report to the combined faculty Dean. The Law School Dean would oversee the academic structure, which might involve two heads of department, but that’s still under review.</p></blockquote><p>So, the Dean of the current Business School could become the Dean of the combined faculty, despite the different focuses of business and law?</p><blockquote><p>Yes, but the current Dean is a distinguished professor of law, so they are well qualified. In the future, leadership roles may present challenges, but that’s common in universities where Deans oversee multiple disciplines, like in medical and health sciences.</p></blockquote><p>If the law and business schools are combined, how will the autonomy of each school be maintained, especially in terms of funding and academic decisions?</p><blockquote><p>There’s a difference between identity and autonomy. Some areas, particularly those related to accreditation, will need to remain autonomous. Other areas might not need that autonomy, but maintaining separate identities will be important.</p></blockquote><p>It seems like the proposal lacks specific details right now, and the consultation period is ending soon. Students would appreciate more clarity as the proposal evolves, and we want to ensure that we are included in these discussions. Going back to Professor Watson potentially becoming the Dean of the new faculty, what&#39;s the succession plan if Professor Watson steps down? Will future Deans be qualified in both law and business?</p><blockquote><p>That’s something the Vice Chancellor will decide, considering the needs of all the disciplines in the combined faculty. Appointments like this are crucial to the success of the university, and great care will be taken.</p></blockquote><p>As student leaders, we work closely with Deans, so it’s important that future Deans understand the student perspective as well as the staff&#39;s.</p><p>One final question: How is this different from the Arts merger, which was contentious among students? What have you learned from that process, and how are you applying it to this proposal?</p><blockquote><p>We had significant student involvement in the Arts merger, and the student members of the Review Committee added considerable value. That student voice has continued into the new academic governance structures. I think the process has been positive overall.</p></blockquote><p>Just one last question: In the Arts merger, was it purely a numbers game in terms of feedback? Was the decision based on overwhelming support or opposition?</p><blockquote><p>No, it wasn’t just a numbers game. The Review Committee synthesized all the feedback to reach a considered view.</p></blockquote><p>It’s always important to ensure the student voice is central when the university makes these decisions because we are the ones funding these decisions. I appreciate both of you for your time today, and I want to remind everyone to use the feedback channel on the university’s website to voice any concerns or follow-up questions.
