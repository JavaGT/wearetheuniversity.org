(Image: Supplied)</p><p>Pattrick Smellie</p><p>Mon, 20 Jan 2025</p><p>If you want to blow minds in the legal profession, suggest merging the country’s leading law school with the country’s leading business school.</p><p>A proposal to amalgamate the University of Auckland’s (UoA) Schools of Law and Business and Economics has been a spanner in the works for the Christmas holiday plans of opponents.</p><p>“There is enormous pushback from the legal profession and the law faculty,” leading Auckland King’s Counsel Jim Farmer told BusinessDesk on a proposal that was first publicised in mid-November, with submissions due today, Jan 20.</p><p>As with most proposals to up-end the status quo, the voices in opposition have been loudest, although there is reportedly some support from &quot;big end of town&quot; commercial law firms.</p><p>But New Zealand Law Association president Clayton Kimpton sums up the legal profession’s view that “administration and protection of the rule of law is different from most, if not all, other degrees”.</p><p>“There is something different about law because of its support for civil society and access to justice,” Kimpton said.</p><h2 id="public-law-vs-private-law">Public law vs private law</h2><p>There is wide disquiet, in particular, about a part of the proposal that would split the law faculty into two departments, one teaching “private” and the other teaching “public” law.</p><p>This horrifies lawyers and academics, the Law School staff&#39;s submission saying the proposal “fundamentally misconstrues” the way law is both taught and practiced, and that such a distinction “is foreign to both of the streams of law that make up our domestic legal order”.</p><p>Said Kimpton: “The sense is that somehow a law degree is just another career opportunity. Merging with the Business School and then splitting the (law) school in two strikes us as showing a fundamental misunderstanding.</p><p>“It suggests you could practice commercial law without understanding trust law, human rights, RMA or Treaty issues.” If any part of the proposal looks ripe for abandonment, it is this one.</p><p>Asked if keeping the Law School as a single department would overcome the legal profession’s objections to the wider merger, Kimpton said it would “ameliorate some concerns” if not all.</p><h2 id="play-nicely">Play nicely</h2><p>However, splitting the school into two departments is a subset of the wider desire to fold the Law School more tightly into a university that seeks strategic alignment across the entire institution.</p><p>The subtext, discernible throughout the text of the proposal, is that the Law School is too much a law unto itself; that while its own staff claim to be “among the university’s most publicly engaged intellectuals”, that view is not universally shared.</p><p>The Business School, for example, is described as “renowned for its strong connections with industry and its focus on developing future business leaders”.</p><p>Its “emphasis on collaboration, innovation, and excellence has solidified its reputation as a top choice for students.” The Law School, by comparison, appears damned with relatively faint praise. While described as the country’s leading law school, “renowned for its commitment to excellence” and research output, there is no mention of the kind of collaborative, multi-disciplinary ethos commonly sought by modern universities.</p><p>“Expertise in commercial and private law is currently spread across two faculties with minimal interactions, making natural synergies and scale difficult,” says the UoA’s proposal summary. “A combined commercial law group would immediately create the critical mass needed to lead commercial law research and impact the nation.</p><p>“Both faculties ... would be enhanced by involvement of research academics from a wider range of disciplines.” The School of Business and Economics gained a new, purpose-built headquarters in the early 2000s. The Law School must wait until 2029 for new digs. (Image: NZME)</p><h2 id="fiscal-imperative">Fiscal imperative</h2><p>On top of this is perhaps the most pressing rationale for the university to do more with the same or less.</p><p>The push for amalgamation has not come from either the business or legal communities but from a university leadership that believes it must brace for an increasingly difficult future.</p><p>Among factors driving the tight timeframe for decision-making: if a merger is to occur by 2026, an early 2025 decision is needed.</p><p>Unwillingness to wait and consult for longer is, in turn, driven by a belief that the Government is about to announce major changes to tertiary education funding that will further disadvantage subjects outside the hard sciences and technology.</p><p>Last year’s Marsden Fund changes, which cut contestable research funding for the humanities, are seen as a precursor.</p><h2 id="economic-growth-focus">Economic growth focus</h2><p>There is a widespread expectation of further detail on Thursday this week, when the Prime Minister, Christopher Luxon, is scheduled to give his annual State of the Nation speech.</p><p>The chatter in academic and education policy circles is that the Government will double down on the pursuit of higher productivity and higher-value industries as part of an urgent kickstart narrative for a moribund economy.</p><p>In an environment where it has been commonplace for years to suggest that NZ trains too many lawyers, UoA is betting on a tougher time for its soft subjects, including law, while expecting support for education in business skills to remain relevant to a productivity improvement agenda.</p><h2 id="past-as-a-guide">Past as a guide</h2><p>Government funding pressures are not new, and the UoA’s vice- chancellor, Dawn Freshwater, has tended to move early in response to perceived threats.</p><p>When covid-19 hit, the university quickly cut 200 staff and pivoted to offshore learning for international students who would otherwise have come to NZ.</p><p>Compared with other NZ universities, Auckland believes it did a better job of keeping and then restoring its vitally lucrative international student cohort.</p><p>Post-pandemic, Freshwater has kept up the pace of institutional reform, with the university already amalgamating other faculties.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Arts, Creative Arts and Industries, and Education faculties were merged into a single entity, bringing the previous eight faculties down to six.</p><p>Now, it is the Law and Business School’s turn.</p><p>With just 70 or so academic staff and about 2,000 students, the UoA law school is already dwarfed by the other five faculties, all of which had between 5,000 and 9,000 equivalent full-time students (EFTS) in 2024.</p><p>There are 260 academic staff in the School of Business and Economics, and the deputy vice-chancellor for operations and registrar, Adrienne Cleland, told students last week that such a small department left senior academic staff overloaded with administrative tasks.</p><p>The amalgamation should “release time for strategic thinking and leadership,” she said.</p><h2 id="not-unusual">Not unusual</h2><p>Moreover, it was not unusual internationally for law schools to sit within wider faculties, despite the oft- cited examples of a failed similar merger at Canterbury University, which was unwound, and a proposal at Victoria University of Wellington that went nowhere.</p><p>“These things are like the mumps, aren’t they?” former attorney-general Chris Finlayson said. “They pop up from time to time. I fail to take it seriously.” However, Cleland observed that the majority of Australia’s eight top- performing universities housed their law schools in another faculty, as did the majority of equivalent universities in Britain, the so-called Russell Group.</p><p>Crucially, she observed “that might not be very evident to external audiences” for the very good reason that the amalgamation is an internal management rather than an external branding exercise.</p><p>In other words, universities are routinely keeping their law schools as separate entities within a combined faculty for the same reason as the UoA proposes to: in order not to diminish their standing to the outside world.</p><h2 id="can-it-really-be-done">Can it really be done?</h2><p>This is at the crux of the debate between the university’s leadership and the Law School’s defenders.</p><p>The university believes the brand and reputation of a separate law school can be retained in a different faculty strategy, whereas the school’s staff submission argues that Auckland’s ambition to be among the top 25 law schools in the world, but that all of the current top 25 are standalone faculties.</p><p>According to a Nov 11 internal memorandum on the proposal, the advantage of the university of this streamlined structure will be to: “Enhance collective executive decision-making and alignment with strategic goals.</p><h2 id="increased-efficiency">Increased efficiency.</h2><p>Improved inter-faculty collaboration. Enhanced flexibility and adaptability.” “There’s so much corporate jargon,” said one legal academic who, like most of those interviewed, preferred to remain anonymous.</p><p>Management-speak, an absence of financial analysis to underpin the claimed efficiencies, and a short, Christmas-knobbled timeframe for consultation may be salt in the wound for those opposed to the proposed changes.</p><p>Professor of law and Dean of the Auckland University School of Business and Economics, Susan Watson, would lead the proposed combined law and business faculty. (Image: NZME)</p><h2 id="takeover-fear">Takeover fear</h2><p>However, the most substantive issue may actually be that the proposal, as written and presented, feels like a takeover.</p><p>While the Law School would continue to operate separately – it would still get its promised new building by 2029 – its Dean would be a subordinate to the business school Dean, who would lead the amalgamated faculty.</p><p>At present, that is Professor Susan Watson, herself a former member of the Law School teaching staff but now in charge of a faculty that covers a wide range of business disciplines, including accounting, marketing, and management.</p><p>In the tribal world of academic institutions, status and influence matter as much, if not more, than salaries; the perception of law being “subsumed” by business is deeply problematic.</p><h2 id="possible-pathways">Possible pathways</h2><p>Yet, there may be a way through.</p><p>The Law School staff submission allows itself a lengthy sixth section on how an amalgamated faculty might work while insisting that “nothing in part VI should be taken to suggest support for the proposal”.</p><p>Among its suggestions is that the Law and Business Schools should each have a separate Dean, equal in status and reporting to a Faculty Dean of Law, Business and Economics, “who would not be Dean of either department”.</p><p>The Law School should also “retain a separate internal governance structure, identity and budget from the Auckland Business School”.</p><p>Should these and a range of other guarantees of autonomy be secured, law faculty staff say they would “readily collaborate with representatives of the Business School to develop a coherent and workable structure”.</p><p>“Structures which are genuinely co- designed by partners with goodwill have a considerably greater chance of being fit for purpose and successful.” And quite apart from anything else, a separate law school remains a statutory requirement of the NZ Council of Legal Education, which oversees the composition and accreditation of NZ law degrees.</p><p>In other words, for all the heat, there is also some light.</p><p>What is perhaps most lacking in a rushed and imperfect process involving a defensive group with a towering self-regard for its elite status is trust.</p><h3 id="about-the-author">About the author</h3><p>Pattrick Smellie</p><p>Founding Editor</p><p>+64 21 588 203 <a href="mailto:pattrick@businessdesk.co.nz">pattrick@businessdesk.co.nz</a></p><p>Pattrick was judged New Zealand&#39;s best overall columnist and business columnist of the year at the Voyager 2021 Media Awards.
