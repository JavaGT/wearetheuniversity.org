universities have voted to take up to five days strike
action in support of pay claims and new national collective
employment agreements for academic and general staff.
<br>Unions representing more than 7,000 university staff
have been in negotiations since October 2003 claiming two
new national collective agreements to replace more than 13
enterprise agreements currently negotiated at a local
university level. <br>Salary claims of up to 10% per annum
for each of the next three years were filed by staff in an
attempt to address long standing national and international
pay disparities. A claim has also been made for a national
job evaluation for general staff to provide a national
consistency to salary rates.<br>University employers have
offered salary increases of between 2.0% and 4.0%, and have
refused to agree to the new national collective employment
agreements.<br>At a series of meetings held in the seven
traditional New Zealand universities over the past week,
union members participating in the ballot have voted by 79%
to embark on the strike action over five weeks from 28
April. A full day’s strike action will take place on 28
April and on 25 May, with full or partial strike action
scheduled in the intervening weeks.<br>A further five days
of strike action have been foreshadowed for July if the
dispute is not resolved before then.<br>Speaking on behalf
of the combined unions, Association of University Staff
(AUS) General Secretary Helen Kelly said it was time
university employers and the Government seriously addressed
the salary and funding issues which have beset the sector
for over a decade. “Government funding of universities has
diminished by 23% in real terms over the last decade and
this has resulted in an erosion of salary rates which
threatens the long-term quality of university education,”
she said. “The decision, to take an unprecedented level of
industrial action, shows that staff are no longer prepared
to leave these matters unresolved.”<br>“Employers in the
sector have no strategy for challenging the Government’s
continued underfunding of universities; we are providing
that strategy,” said Ms Kelly. “Without increased funding,
looming workforce shortages will start to have a real impact
on the country’s ability to deliver quality university
education. Employers have a responsibility for the long term
health of the system and they are neglecting it.”<br>Ms
Kelly said that in light of the strong mandate in the
ballot, the unions have written to the universities inviting
further negotiations in an attempt to try and resolve the
dispute.<br>The universities affected are Auckland, Waikato,
Massey, Victoria, Canterbury, Lincoln and
Otago.<p>
