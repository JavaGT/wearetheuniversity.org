NZUSA is compiling this voice to help tertiary institutions truly understand how learners want them to embed the <em>TES</em> objectives into decision making and governance.</p>
<p>Te Mana Ākonga Tumuaki Takirua Nkhaya Paulsen-More says “Having tauira come together from all across the tertiary sector was incredible to see. We were privileged to hear from a variety of student leaders over the Summit, and are excited to welcome our incoming tauira in their new roles as we help them develop their skills and look forward to the next Summit.”</p>
<p>NZUSA and its partners will be creating ongoing professional development opportunities for student leaders based on the discussions held at the Student Voice Summit.</p>
