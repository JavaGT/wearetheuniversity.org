<p>&quot;With this morning’s increase in COVID Alert Levels, students face yet more uncertainty and stress at the start of the academic year. They&#39;ve already had their orientations disrupted by COVID; the Government cannot allow this virus to ruin their entire year&quot; says National President Andrew Lessells.</p>
<p>&quot;Government needs to step up for students to make sure they can access technology, to make sure they can pay their rent, to make sure they can afford to survive.&quot;</p>
<p>With the increase in Alert Levels also comes significant mental hardship for the 400,000 students across Aotearoa. The Government has committed $25 million to mental health support for students but only $2 million is available this year.</p>
<p>“Last year’s $25 million for student mental health was a good start, but this yo-yoing proves that far more is needed. This is the most stressful time to be a student in generations and that’s why NZUSA is asking the Government to double funding for student mental health.” says Lessells.</p>
<p>During the first lockdown in 2020, the Government introduced a Student Hardship Fund for those who had lost jobs, and experienced financial challenges because of COVID-19. NZUSA is calling for this fund to be reintroduced, to make sure that support is in place for students when they need it.</p>
<p>Students are also calling for tertiary institutions to get more Government funding to make sure they can teach remotely and offer the quality education that students deserve.</p>
<p>&quot;Many universities and most polytechnics don&#39;t have the resources to transition their courses to decent online delivery, so the Government needs to step in to make sure students get the education that Aotearoa&#39;s tertiary sector prides itself on.&quot; Lessells says.</p>
<p>NZUSA is working with our members and partners to ensure that students needs are met at this challenging time.</p>
