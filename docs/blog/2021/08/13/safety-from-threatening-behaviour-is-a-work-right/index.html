disturbed to note the continued
escalation of harassment, and racist and threatening
behaviour directed at academics in Aotearoa. An alarming
amount of this behaviour is directed at female academics of
colour, many of whom are our members.</p>

<p>It has been
suggested in some quarters that people who express opinions
in public should expect negative attention. TEU National
Secretary Sandra Grey disagrees. “Victim blaming is
unacceptable. It is an academic’s job to be the critic and
conscience of society and sometimes this means saying things
that some might find uncomfortable and/or threatening to
their world view. Having your ideas challenged comes with
the territory but racism and threats of death and violence
should not.”</p>

<p>Grey believes the time has come for
employers in our sector to stop sitting on their hands.
“Tertiary institutions need to take this seriously and
fulfil their duty to provide a safe and healthy working
environment where all staff can do their jobs without
worrying about being a target. Comprehensive audits into
physical and digital security are needed but at the very
least, safe spaces should be provided and anyone who
threatens a staff member must be trespassed from campus
immediately whenever
practicable.”</p></p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
