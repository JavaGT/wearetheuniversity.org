<p>The strike at AUT was a ban on entering or releasing student marks or course marks into the AUT student management system from 8am on 6 October until 5pm on 21 October. AUT confirmed that they intended to not pay our members for two weeks.</p>
<p>As a result, TEU has withdrawn the previous strike notices at AUT and issued a new one for a four-hour stoppage from 1pm until 5pm tomorrow, 6 October. The previously announced 12pm rally will go ahead as planned.</p>
<p>TEU has been advised that AUT will not take action to suspend, and members’ pay will be unaffected during the strike on Thursday.</p>
