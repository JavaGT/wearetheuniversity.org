<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Thad Hadaway says “salaries at Lincoln are amongst the lowest in the Aotearoa university sector. As a result, our members are acutely aware of the rapidly rising cost of living and particularly keen to speak out and participate in further action in this national campaign.”</p>
<p>At a recent all staff briefing, when questioned about the possibility of an 8% pay increase, Vice Chancellor Grant Edwards said he believes “it&#39;s a total package of what we offer here at Lincoln University which includes salary but it also includes the other key aspects of working in a wonderful environment with great colleagues, working in a place where we are establishing outstanding research, education, and service careers…”</p>
<p>Thad Hadaway says “While Lincoln is scenic place to work, such pastoral landscapes don&#39;t assist in making ends meet when the cost of living is so high.”</p>
<p>TEU members will gather at the Viewing Gallery in the Rec Centre for a rally at 1pm on Thursday 13 October and strike until 5pm.</p>
