<p>General (non-academic) staff at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) today voted to accept a new pay offer from the University. Acceptance of the offer, which was for a 3 percent salary increase from 1 May 2004, brings to an end a six week dispute which saw VUW general staff take strike action and threaten a University-wide shut-down during the first week of second semester enrolments.</p>
<p>General staff have been claiming a 4 percent pay rise, in line with their academic colleagues.</p>
<p>Association of University Staff (AUS) general staff spokesperson, Tony Quinn, said that the improvements in salary offer came as a direct result of industrial action. &quot;The strike on Monday 31 May resulted in the employer&#39;s offer being increased from 2.2 percent to 2.5 percent, and the threat of a &quot;first-week shutdown&quot; raised that offer further to the current 3 percent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;While union members remain unhappy about the disparity with their academic colleagues, they are delighted with their success in improving the offer,&quot; said Mr Quinn. &quot;Union participation is at an all-time high, and staff have the confidence that if need be they can repeat an effective industrial action campaign in the future if salary claims are not addressed in a satisfactory manner.&quot;</p>
