<p>The University of Auckland Council meeting to increase fees is Today (Monday 18th October) in the Music Theatre number 6 Symonds Street at 4pm.</p>
<p>University of Auckland Students will be attending the meeting to show their disgust at the proposed increases.</p>
<p>“I cannot talk about the exact proposed increases but they are big, bigger than last year, and will be crippling to students next year and in the long term” Said AUSA president Kate Sutton</p>
<p>The AUSA is encouraging all students and interested public to attend and see the fee setting discussion take place.</p>
<p>“It is so important that the councillors see the people that they are responsible too. Then maybe they will understand the debt that real students are facing and its negative effects.” Sutton ended.</p>
