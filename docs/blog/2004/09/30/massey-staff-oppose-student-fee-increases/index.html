Massey is proposing to increase fees by 5% for 2005, the highest permissible under the Government’s Fee Maxima policy, at its Council meeting tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>“The answer to the inadequate funding of universities lies with the Government. The University should not be reliant on student fee increases to balance its books,” said Harvey Jones, Massey AUS Branch President.</p>
<p>“The University seems to care more about making a huge surplus in order to meet vague Ministry of Education Guidelines than it does for the welfare of its staff and students,” said Mr Jones. “If it is genuinely committed to improving staff salaries, it would realise that a cash injection from Government rather than students is needed. AUS believes that increased funding for staff salaries needs to come from the Government.”</p>
<p>“The AUS is trying to convince Massey University to agree to a national bargaining strategy, similar to that being run by nurses, which will target the Government to fund a salary settlement for all university staff across the country”.</p>
<p>“Increased tuition fees will further limit participation in university studies to the rich or favoured, or to those willing to endure a crippling burden of debt on completion of their studies. Such increases also see more students working longer hours in employment while also trying to study full-time, thereby hindering their study”.</p>
<p>“Investment in tertiary education is a public good. The Government needs to put more money into universities to ensure that a quality education can be provided. Given that the Government is currently sitting on a $7.4 billion dollar surplus we cannot see why fees need to increase or why staff salary claims can’t be met”.</p>
