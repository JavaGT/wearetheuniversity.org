<p>Students Love Dick</p>
<p>Dick Hubbard received the majority of student support after the Auckland University Students Association Mayoral forum today.</p>
<p>“We only measured support by cheers and a show of hands but the crowd definitely seemed to be on Dicks side” Said AUSA National Affairs Officer Conor Roberts.</p>
<p>Around 300 Students showed up to the student union quad to hear Christine Fletcher, John Banks and Dick Hubbard speak, followed by a question and answer session.</p>
<p>“I am very happy with the turn out, It shows that students really care about who their mayor is” AUSA president Kate Sutton said “All we need to do now is make sure they put pen to paper and vote.”</p>
<p>“I think many students came to see John Banks” Roberts said “He plays up to the crowd and they like that.” “Christine Fletcher also had her supporters in the crowd and students seemed to like her point of view on youth issues and with public transport” he went on to say. “I would like to thank all the candidates for turning up and wish them all the best of luck in the upcoming elections” Roberts concluded.</p>
