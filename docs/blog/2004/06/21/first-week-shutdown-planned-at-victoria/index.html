<p>&quot;First-week shutdown&quot; planned at Victoria</p>
<p>General (non-academic) staff at Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) have approved a comprehensive campaign of industrial action aimed at completely shutting down the administration of the university for the first week of its second teaching trimester which begins on 12 July.</p>
<p>General staff at VUW have rejected a pay offer of a 2.5% increase with an additional $350 one-off payment, and are seeking a 4% increase in line with their academic colleagues.</p>
<p>The plan of action, entitled &quot;first-week shutdown&quot; will comprise a comprehensive build-up of action including a communications black-out, withholding exam grades and refusing to process enrolments. That will be complemented with rolling strike action (or lightning strikes), and sustained strike action in selected key areas.</p>
<p>Academic staff have promised that they will provide financial and practical support for the action.</p>
<p>Association of University Staff (AUS) general staff spokesperson, Tony Quinn, said general staff at VUW did not accept the Vice-Chancellor&#39;s view that they are worth less than those at other universities around the country. &quot;All others have been offered a salary increase of at least 3%,&quot; he said. &quot;That is why we have had to adopt a plan of action that will, unfortunately, go beyond the usual protest and result in serious and sustained disruption.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;General staff at VUW will not be categorised as second-class employees by accepting lower salary increases than everywhere else in the sector,&quot; said Mr Quinn. &quot;We will be asking students and the public to support us by encouraging the Vice-Chancellor to give general staff the salary recognition (and dignity) they deserve.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Quinn said that informal discussions would continue with the University in the hope that agreement could be reached before the July disruption.</p>
