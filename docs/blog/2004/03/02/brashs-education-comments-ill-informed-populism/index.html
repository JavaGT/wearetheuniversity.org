<p>Brash’s comments on education little more than<br>“ill informed populism”</p>
<p>The Auckland University Students’ Association has formally denounced what it sees as the clearly uninformed comments made by Dr Don Brash regarding preferential University admission for Maori.</p>
<p>“It should be clearly evident to New Zealanders that Dr Brash’s agenda has very little to do with equality and far more to do with ill-informed populism” noted AUSA President Kate Sutton.</p>
<p>“If Dr Brash wanted to do something both popular and which promoted equity he should increase access to living allowances for all students instead of reverting to racist slurs.” continued Ms Sutton.</p>
<p>The Auckland University Students Association has a long history of promoting equity; both in education and wider New Zealand Society, and Dr Brash’s comments have alarmed many within the organisation and the student body.</p>
<p>“As the evaluation standards for Maori and non-Maori students are the same Dr Brash’s claim that Maori graduates have substandard degrees in fact devalues all degrees” said Joseph Randall, Education Vice-President, “if anyone is creating unequal standards it is Dr Brash”.</p>
<p>AUSA firmly stands by Nga Tauira Maori, the Auckland University Maori Students Association, in their response to Dr Brash’s comments.</p>
