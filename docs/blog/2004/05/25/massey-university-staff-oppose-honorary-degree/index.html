<p>Massey University staff oppose honorary degree</p>
<p>The Massey University Branch of the Association of University Staff (AUS) has strongly criticised the decision of the Massey University Council to award an honorary doctorate degree to former Vice-Chancellor Professor James McWha at the Wellington graduation ceremony today.</p>
<p>&quot;Professor McWha&#39;s term as Vice-Chancellor was an absolute disaster,&quot; said AUS Massey Branch President Harvey Jones. &quot;The decision to award him an honorary degree reeks of cronyism and is a slap in the face to those staff that lost their jobs during his tenure, particularly as a result of restructuring in 2000.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Jones said that the University Council members should be ashamed of themselves and their decision. He said that, during his period as Vice-Chancellor, Professor McWha was responsible for:</p>
<p>* a restructuring exercise in which many staff unnecessarily lost their jobs, and caused significant lowering of staff morale;<br>* a massive cost-overrun on the renovations to the Museum building on the Wellington campus.<br>* building the Rugby Institute, Athletics Track and Equestrian Centre on the basis of a public relations exercise rather than because of any academic merit.</p>
<p>&quot;The University has decided to reward the architect of a flawed restructuring and its inevitable redundancies,&quot; Mr Jones said. &quot;Instead of an honorary degree, the Council should call on Professor McWha to publicly acknowledge former staff who lost their jobs during his tenure.</p>
<p>&quot;The Council is on the run with this award and they know it,&quot; said Mr Jones. &quot;They have delayed its announcement and are presenting it in Wellington where there is less chance of protest.&quot;</p>
