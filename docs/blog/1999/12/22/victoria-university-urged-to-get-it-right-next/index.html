<p>Victoria University urged to &#39;get it right&#39; next time</p>
<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) is urging Victoria University&#39;s Council to ensure that the process for appointing a replacement for departing Vice-Chancellor, Michael Irving, is open and democratic.</p>
<p>AUS President, Professor Jane Kelsey, said in Wellington today that as the Vice-Chancellor was the Council&#39;s only employee, there could be no excuses for getting the process wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important for Victoria to return to its traditional academic values and to hire a Vice-Chancellor who can provide the necessary academic leadership rather than a focus on narrow managerialism.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Staff at Victoria will now face a further unsettling time until a new Vice-Chancellor arrives. Council must move quickly to stem the growing number of staff departures and provide students with the certainty that they will receive a first-class university education,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The new Government has clearly signalled that the era of market-driven competition in tertiary education is over. This is therefore a golden opportunity for Victoria University to rediscover the traditional nature of the university.&quot;</p>
