One student is not able to represent the views of all students, so having two students doubles the number of student voices coming through.’</p>
<p>‘Two student places will make councils more diverse and reflective of the student community’, says Gee.</p>
<p>NZUSA says that the select committee has the chance to give community wisdom a stronger place on TEI councils through:<br>• Reserving a student seat for the students’ association president<br>• Requiring at least two staff and two student places on TEI councils<br>• Increasing the size of councils</p>
<p>‘As public institutions, our communities (and taxpayers) expect public benefit from our institutions, not just private return. It’s therefore essential that community wisdom has a stronger place on TEI councils through increasing the number of staff and student seats.’</p>
