<p>Evans says that this is just the first step to effective and true student representation.</p>
<p>‘Student voice does not exist in a vacuum. In order for genuine student voice to take place on councils, institutions must be willing to support student representatives through training, resourcing, connecting them with the independent students’ association and instilling a culture of hearing and heeding the student voice across the institution.’</p>
<p>NZUSA looks forward to engaging with Members of Parliament to ensure that the legislation is as robust as possible to facilitate effective student voice.</p>
