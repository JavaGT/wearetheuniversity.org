<p>Media release – 19 October 2018<br>Tertiary Education Union - Te Hautū Kahurangi o Aotearoa  </p>
<p>AUT strike</p>
<p>Union members at the Auckland University of Technology have voted overwhelmingly in favour of taking strike action in regard to their collective negotiations that have so far seen management not agreeing to their salary claims. The claims include a 3% increase and that the lowest paid staff members should be paid the Living Wage.</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Union (TEU) members are asking for a 3 percent boost in pay for all staff covered by the collective agreements. This modest increase would go some way to ensuring salaries at the university reflect the time, energy and skill that staff put into their jobs. In addition to this salary claim, staff have been negotiating collectively for the Living Wage at AUT. The university has so far refused to accept that the lowest paid staff working at AUT should be paid the Living Wage of $20.55 per hour. The union believes that regardless of whether an employee works full time, or as a student working in a café, or as a student mentor at AUT, they should receive this rate which enables them to pay for the basic necessities of life. AUT needs to follow the lead of the Auckland City Council which has agreed to pay the Living Wage to all employees. Basically, it is the right thing for a university to do.</p>
<p>Recently over a thousand staff and students signed a petition calling on the Vice Chancellor to pay staff the Living Wage.  </p>
<p>For two weeks, union members will not be releasing student marks to AUT. The TEU has notified the student union of its plans and has told them that AUT can ensure the release of marks by agreeing to what the union is asking for.  </p>
<p>Irena Brorens, the national industrial officer of the TEU, and lead advocate for negotiations at AUT, said: “What we’re talking about here are the people who make studying at AUT possible. Every person at the university makes a huge contribution to the quality teaching and learning AUT is known for”.  </p>
