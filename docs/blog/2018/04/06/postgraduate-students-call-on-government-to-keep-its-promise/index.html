I’ve had to move back home because I couldn’t afford my rent on top of travel costs to drive to placement each day. I’ve wanted to be a teacher my whole life but it’s been a struggle’, says Katrina (Master of Teaching and Learning, University of Otago).</p>
<p>Those who have missed out on the opportunity of postgraduate study are also speaking out.</p>
<p>‘I’m passionate about reducing New Zealand’s horrific suicide rate through studying towards a career in psychology. Unfortunately due to the lack of financial support at postgraduate level I’ve had to put that dream on hold’, says Nicole (Bachelor of Social Science in Psychology, University of Waikato).</p>
<p>Education Minister Chris Hipkins has yet to respond to NZUSA’s written request to restore postgraduate allowances.</p>
<p>The petition can be found on: <a href="http://www.students.org.nz/r?u=https%3A%2F%2Four.actionstation.org.nz%2Fpetitions%2Frestore-the-postgraduate-student-allowance-now&e=96a217cc8fd583b68bf0086c230fcdc10c832467&utm_source=students&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=postgrad1&n=1">https://our.actionstation.org.nz/petitions/restore-the-postgraduate-student-allowance-now</a></p>
