<p>Last week&#39;s Budget delivered a slight decrease in funding for tertiary education, down from $4 billion last year to $3.9 billion this year. Treasury forecasts that funding will continue to remain below 2009 levels ($4.5 billion) through until at least 2016, while student numbers will continue to remain higher than 2009 levels.</p>

<p><strong>Vocational training savaged in Victoria, AU</strong></p>
<p>It was meant to be the most significant shake-up to vocational education in Victoria, Australia, in years: a new demand-driven system where public TAFE institutes (the equivalent of polytechnics) competed for funding with private providers, and where almost anyone who wanted to &quot;up-skill&quot; would be guaranteed a subsidised place.</p>

<p><strong>PBRF changes employment practice</strong></p>
<p>TEU&#39;s branch co-president at Otago University Dr Brent Lovelock says PBRF is affecting the role of academic staff.</p>
<p>“PBRF means that staff are now much busier in terms of doing research, so whether they dedicate as much time to things like lecture planning, I don’t know. And community service? Pfft, it’s dropped off the edge somewhere!”</p>

<p>Australian higher education is often seen as a female-friendly industry, with overall numbers of both female students and academic staff outnumbering men. Yet women remain a minority as senior academics. In 2009 only a quarter of appointments to positions above the level of associate professor went to women. So what happens to all those women toiling away as tutors and lecturers and researchers when it comes time to move up? Do they simply lose interest or does something else get in the way? - The Conversation</p>
