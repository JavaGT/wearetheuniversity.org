<p>Cc: Dr Rod Carr, vice-chancellor of the University of Canterbury</p>
<p>28 March 2012</p>
<p><strong>Dear Mr Joyce,</strong></p>
<p>We write to you to deplore the proposed closure of entire programmes and majors at the University of Canterbury. We warned you last year that, without your intervention and support, many staff at the university would lose their jobs, and students would lose the opportunity to study the courses that inspire them.</p>
<p>That travesty, of course closures and job losses, is now imminent. However, we believe it is not too late to act to save these programmes and the opportunities for students in these majors. Canterbury needs, now more than ever, a broad and diverse tertiary education that provides opportunities for all its potential students.</p>
<p>You have refused to meet with us since we warned you of this. But the time has come now to listen. We, as representatives of tertiary education staff from across the country, call upon you to intervene and provide the financial security the University of Canterbury needs to get back on its feet.</p>
<p>We are ready to work with you to make sure that people throughout the Canterbury region have the opportunity to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Yours sincerely,</strong></p>
<p>Sandra Grey,<br>TEU national president</p>
