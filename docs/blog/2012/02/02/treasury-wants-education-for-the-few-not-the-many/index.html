<p>TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey says Treasury’s advice about tertiary education is misplaced and simplistic.</p>
<p>“There is no evidence that shifting funding to favour younger students getting degrees will have any impact on the economy at all. In fact Treasury’s focus on degrees at the expense of other qualifications will take away opportunities from some New Zealand families who most need education to lift themselves up and contribute to New Zealand’s economy.”</p>
<p>Dr Grey was responding to Treasury’s advice to government ministers, which was released today.</p>
<p>“Treasury thinks it can pick winners and invest only in them. This denies opportunities to all other ordinary New Zealanders,” said Dr Grey.</p>
<p>Dr Grey says Treasury’s desire to shift research funding to favour research that private firms ask for is effectively an attempt to privatise our public research institutions.</p>
<p>“We should not research things only because a private firm thinks it can make a profit. Often there is a crucial need for research that is not solely in the interests of private companies.</p>
<p>“If Treasury wants a vibrant growing economy and communities, it needs to invest equitably in all types of education and research,. “ said Dr Grey.</p>
