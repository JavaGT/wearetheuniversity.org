<p><strong>Tertiary education restructure must not have narrow economic focus</strong></p>
<p>Tertiary education is not just about science and economic development, says TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>
<p>Ms Riggs’ comments follow news that Steven Joyce, the minister of science, tertiary education and economic development agencies, is considering restructuring all three agencies at the same time.</p>
<p>&quot;Tertiary education is closely related to science as an economic development, but it is also closely related to health - people with tertiary education have better health outcomes on average. Access to tertiary education helps reduce crime. So, why not consider a merger between tertiary education, the department of health and police instead? Tertiary education links closely to agriculture, archives, the arts council, and the list goes on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are many important economic and scientific benefits from a broad, accessible, high quality tertiary education system. But those are not the only benefits. The minister needs to make sure that his focus on economic development and science does not crowd out space for all the other important social and community benefits that high quality public tertiary education should provide,&quot; said Ms Riggs.</p>
