<p>Students call to vote no confidence in the editor of Craccum</p>
<p>Students at the University of Auckland have called for a Special General Meeting to move a motion of no confidence in the editor of the student magazine, Craccum.</p>
<p>Craccum has been published since 1914. It has had a number of high profile editors, including former Speaker of the House of Representatives Jonathan Hunt, the Right Honourable Sir Owen Woodhouse, Martin &quot;Bomber&quot; Bradbury and Tim Shadbolt. Students last exercised their right to remove the editor in 1989.</p>
<p>20 students petitioned the Auckland University Students&#39; Association to hold the Special General Meeting, in line with the Association&#39;s constitution. The students claim that the magazine is not representative, and is overtly political.</p>
<p>&quot;The Auckland University Students&#39; Association has a proud history of electing the editor of the student magazine,&quot; says Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University Students’ Association. &quot;It&#39;s a democratic platform for expression of students&#39; views, and if students are unhappy about how it has been run this year, they&#39;re entitled to have their say at a Special General Meeting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Students&#39; Association does not support or oppose the students&#39; motion of no confidence in the editor. We have called the meeting because we think it&#39;s important that students views are represented,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The SGM will be held on Thursday 19 April in the University Quad. All students may attend, but only members of the Auckland University Students&#39; Association are entitled to vote. Quorum for the meeting is 200 and the vote of no confidence requires a simple majority to pass.</p>
