<p><strong>Tertiary education welcomes back Mr Joyce</strong></p>
<p>“We hope Steven Joyce’s reappointment as tertiary education minister will see a new focus on supporting people who would not otherwise be studying”, said TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey.</p>
<p>“Mr. Joyce talked regularly, during his first term as minister of tertiary education, of the need for greater pastoral care of students and for helping people into study who would not otherwise have that opportunity.”</p>
<p>“In this second term of Mr. Joyce’s ministership we would like to see the policy that supports those ambitions.”</p>
<p>“Tertiary education should not settle into a role of providing further education to those who are already succeeding. We want to help New Zealanders who need opportunities to contribute to our economy and our communities. But that means policies that focus on improving access to education and giving wrap around support for those who want to learn but do not know where to begin.”</p>
<p>“As professionals who work and study in tertiary education every day, we have got a suite of simple ideas to help students and potential students learn. We’re looking forward to the chance to meet with Mr. Joyce so we can work together on protecting and enhancing New Zealand’s world class tertiary education system”, said Dr Grey.</p>
