<p><strong>University of Auckland&#39;s $640,000 vice chancellor</strong></p>
<p>University of Auckland&#39;s boss Stuart McCutcheon received an increase in his remuneration of between $40,000-$60,000, according to data released by the State Services Commission. The vice-chancellor now has a remuneration package of between $640,000 and $649,999.</p>
<p>TEU national president Sandra Grey says Professor McCutcheon was the third highest paid public sector employee in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&quot;The 6-10 percent increase in his remuneration package is more than the salary for an entire staff member.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Many academic staff have gone without a pay rise all year because they will not agree to the university removing important academic conditions from their collective agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#39;t begrudge anyone being paid well for doing a tough job,&quot; said Dr Grey, &quot;but the university needs to question whether it has got its priorities right when it further rewards its highest paid staff member while undermining important academic conditions for other staff.&quot;</p>
