<p>Are doctoral graduates fleeing NZ?</p>
<p>A study released by the Ministry of Education shows that graduates with doctoral degrees are less likely to work in New Zealand than if they had only graduated with a bachelors or masters degree. More than a third of doctoral graduates were not employed in New Zealand four years after they had finished their study. A fifth of all doctoral graduates had never worked in New Zealand at all during the four year period.</p>
<p>The study, &#39;Do people with doctoral degrees get jobs in New Zealand post study? &#39; by the Ministry of Education notes the domestic employment rate of the New Zealand doctoral cohort was lower than in similar leaving cohorts in Canada and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey says that many doctoral students are looking for beginning positions as academics in tertiary institutions, but New Zealand&#39;s universities, wananga and polytechnics are not doing enough to provide the secure, stable job opportunities and academic working conditions these graduates need to keep them here in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s tertiary institutions have an ageing academic workforce because they are not doing enough to hire new academics. Many academics are nearing retirement age and we could soon have a severe workforce shortage because we have not done enough to bring new, young academics into our institutions,” said Dr Grey.<br>ends</p>
