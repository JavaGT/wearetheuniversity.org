<p>Hundreds of teachers and students will converge on Wellington&#39;s Cuba Mall on the Monday before the election to tell politicians it is time to speak up for education.</p>
<p>- Cuba Mall - 21 November - 5pm - 5.45pm</p>
<p>TEU&#39;s singing National President Dr Sandra Grey and her band Tolley and the Folly-Dollies will lead a line-up that includes:</p>
<p>- Louise Green, principal of Khandallah School (tambourines). A National Standards system forced into schools is bad for children&#39;s learning. - Kevin Bunker, PPTA general secretary (doo-wop vocals). Investing in smaller class sizes in public education is critical to learning. - Robyn Hambleton, Wellington High School adult community education deputy director (saxaphone). The government cut community and adult education in schools by 80 percent in 2009. - National student president David Do (ukelele). Despite growing student numbers tertiary education has had its funding cut each budget under this government and more cuts are forecast. - Actor and theatre producer Julia Truscott will MC the event.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#39;ll be loud and we&#39;ll be singing. We&#39;ll be telling politicians of all persuasions and predilections that it is time to speak up for education,&quot; says Dr Grey.</p>
<p>&quot;Education is not a cost or a burden - it is the best investment we can make in our people, young and old.&quot;</p>
