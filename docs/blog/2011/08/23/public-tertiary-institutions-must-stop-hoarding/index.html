<p>**Public tertiary institutions must stop hoarding**</p>
<p>Tertiary institutions are hoarding cash rather than investing in their staff and students, says TEU national president Sandra Grey.</p>
<p>A Tertiary Education Commission report released today</p>
<p>on financial performance of tertiary education institutions shows that publicly funded universities, w nanga and polytechnics are all generating surpluses significantly greater than the 3 percent of revenue that the commission told them to generate. Polytechnics had surpluses of 8.3 percent of revenue, universities 4 percent and w nanga 7.3 percent. In total, these public institutions hoarded nearly a hundred million dollars of public money that they could otherwise have invested in quality education.</p>
<p>&quot;Because they failed to spend this money students now have larger class sizes, highly respected staff lost their jobs and departments have shrunk or shut,&quot; said Dr Grey.</p>
<p>&quot;Institutions were trusted with that money, to spend it on students&#39; education. Hiding it in bank accounts while they make unnecessary cuts to the quality of education is irresponsible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hoarding it also gives the government a false justification for its relentless on-going budget cuts to tertiary education funding.&quot;</p>
<p>ends</p>
