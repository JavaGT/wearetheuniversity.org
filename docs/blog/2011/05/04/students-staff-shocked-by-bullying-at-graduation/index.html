<h3>Students and staff shocked by University bullying at graduation</h3>
<p>Students and staff at the University of Auckland have been shocked this week by University staff threatening to block a top student from attending his graduation ceremony for wearing a rosette.</p>
<p>Vernon Tava, who was graduating Masters of Law with first class honours, was told by graduation officials he would not be permitted to enter the hall while wearing a yellow rosette.</p>
<p>The rosette relates to a joint campaign from the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and the Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) to persuade the Vice-Chancellor to retain important academic conditions in their collective employment agreement.</p>
<p>“I was told that the rosette wasn’t appropriate for a meeting of the university council, and that I wouldn’t be crossing the stage and graduating if it was not removed,” Tava said.</p>
<p>AUSA President Joe McCrory, a member of the University Council, wore a rosette on stage as part of the official party.</p>
<p>“Students felt intimidated, with many thinking they would be unable to graduate for wearing the rosettes,” McCrory said.</p>
<p>“The threats made by university officials present a massive affront to freedom of expression,” McCrory said.</p>
<p>“The rosettes weren’t disruptive, but the bullying of graduates by university staff certainly was. The University of Auckland should be ashamed for treating graduates in this way,” McCrory said.</p>
<p>Students who felt intimidated or threatened by graduation staff are asked to contact AUSA confidentially on <a href="mailto:rosette@ausa.org.nz">rosette@ausa.org.nz</a>.</p>
<p>“AUSA will be working on behalf of students to seek an official apology from the University of Auckland for their disgraceful conduct,” McCrory concluded.</p>
