<p>Staff, alumni and students at the Victoria University of Wellington will be rallying tomorrow to protest planned cuts to its Social Sciences Research (SSR) programme.</p>
<p>Victoria University is proposing to close its acclaimed Social Sciences Research programme and make its two full time academic staff redundant. The university claims the programme is no longer financially viable, but staff are challenging that assessment.</p>
<p>The Social Science Research programme was established in 1987 to provide graduates with a high level of expertise in multi disciplinary applied social science research and to utilise the university’s strategic position in the capital city.</p>
<p>There are now over 100 graduates holding the MA (Applied) in Social Science Research all of whom have worked closely with government agencies and community or voluntary organisations during their study.</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Union organiser, Michael Gilchrist, says that SSR graduates are much in demand, especially among community organisations and government departments here in Wellington. “They have the leadership and critical thinking skills that epitomise the ideals Victoria University has for its graduates.”</p>
<p>“While the university is facing some real budgetary constraints, we don’t believe that the financial position of the programme has been carefully analysed nor its real value considered. The potential savings are small – the strategic costs to the university and the community are huge,” said Mr Gilchrist.</p>
<p>The rally will take place at 12.30pm Tuesday 25 August in the Hunter Courtyard (the Quad if wet) at Kelburn campus.</p>
