<p>Waikato Uni cuts hope for aspiring students<br> <br>Following pressure from the Tertiary Education Commission, the University of Waikato is considering disestablishing its pioneering Te Timatanga Hou and Certificate of University Preparation programmes. These programmes have over the years have helped many first-time students into tertiary study. Students and staff in the Certificate of Attainment in Foundation Studies also face an uncertain future.</p>
<p>In a letter to staff at the university’s Pathways College, which oversees its continuing education and foundation studies programmes, the courses, the university’s deputy vice chancellor, Doug Sutton, says that while no decisions have yet been made, “…the proposal or any revised version of it … is likely to result in the disestablishment of some positions at CUP and Te Timatanga Hou; some reduction in CAFS staffing levels may also be necessary.”</p>
<p>Even more ominously, he warned that the university is proposing “a significant and possibly total reduction in the number of pre-degree EFTS for 2010.”</p>
<p>The university has told staff that high numbers of degree-level enrolments are soon likely to exceed its student funding cap by as much as 7 percent by the end of this year. It must therefore take measures to avoid carrying too many un-funded students. Also, TEC has urged universities through the Tertiary Education Strategy and the Statement of Tertiary Education Priorities to focus on degree-level and postgraduate teaching. This direction, combined with an increase in enrolments, has led to entry-level courses and foundation studies programmes that help students move on to degree study being cut. </p>
<p>TEU president Dr Tom Ryan says this means that at the University of Waikato up to 450 students could miss out on admission to the university next year, of whom about 40 percent would identify as Maori.   </p>
<p>“So the very people we desperately want to have a chance at higher education, to have better opportunities to provide for their families and whanau, and to up-skill our communities and economy, are going to be excluded by such a decision. The university and the commission both need to reconsider the path they are taking.”</p>
<p>Staff have been given until 5 August to respond to the university’s proposal.</p>
