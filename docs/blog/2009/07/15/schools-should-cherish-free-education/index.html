<p>Schools should cherish free education</p>
<p>It is time public and integrated schools put an end to the pretence around voluntary donations and committed to the spirit as well as the legal requirement to provide free education says TEU communications officer Stephen Day.</p>
<p>“People working in tertiary education are all too well aware of the compromises that are made to public education by making students or their parents pay fees. If you believe that everyone has a right to education then you have to value that right by making sure that you remove the barrier of fees masquerading as voluntary donations.”</p>
<p>“We’re glad to see the Minister has told Education Ministry officials to investigate the latest controversy of Rathkeale College apparently demanding a parent secure $13000 of donations against her home. Hopefully the minister’s investigation goes wider than one school. Voluntary school donations of this type are like rust that one day grows into school fees, and eventually into a private education system that lets some students climb to the top while others miss out.”</p>
<p>“If school boards don’t want their students or parents encumbered with student loans, credit card debt and all the financial problems that plague many tertiary students they should take a stance against these pseudo-voluntary donations now.”</p>
<p>“Schools should cherish free education while they can because it doesn’t last once you turn 19,” concluded Day.</p>
