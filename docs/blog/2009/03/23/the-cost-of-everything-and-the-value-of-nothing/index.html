<p>The cost of everything and the value of nothing</p>
<p>“It’s appalling to see that the government‘s proposal to allow companies to swap holidays for cash is back on the table,” says Tertiary Education Union national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>
<p>“Annual leave is an important chance for workers to spend time with their family, their friends and their community. Schools, community groups, churches and families all rely on holidays to allow them to spend time with the workers in their lives.”</p>
<p>“A law that allows companies to encourage workers to sell holidays for cash would tell workers that we know the cost of everything and the value of nothing,” says Ms Riggs. “Four weeks annual leave is not excessive for a worker who wants to spend time with friends and family, volunteer at a local sports tournament or visit relatives elsewhere in the country. We all benefit from the stronger society that develops when workers have time to spend with their friends, families and communities.”</p>
<p>“Sadly some companies will misuse this law to trade holidays for cash if it is introduced, and those workers with the least financial ability to resist will be hurt the most.”</p>
