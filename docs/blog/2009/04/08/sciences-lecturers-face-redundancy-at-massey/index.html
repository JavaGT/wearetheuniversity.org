<p>Sciences lecturers face redundancy at Massey</p>
<p>News that Massey University intends to make six horticulture, agriculture and earth science staff redundant flies in the face of its own professed commitment to helping New Zealanders into jobs says TEU president Dr Tom Ryan.</p>
<p>Massey University last week announced its intention to restructure its Institute of Natural Resources. Twelve academic staff positions are under review, six of which are scheduled to be lost and eleven of the staff affected are TEU members. The Institute of Natural Resources combines agricultural and horticultural science and ecology. It teaches and researches sustainable production and conservation of natural resources.</p>
<p>“Massey’s vice chancellor Steve Maharey speaks publicly about his university’s role in creating a sustainable future by investing in science, of the need to develop the nation&#39;s food research expertise, and tells the government to focus on keeping people in jobs,” stated Dr Ryan. “But on his own campus he is letting go of lecturers and researchers who are teaching and researching the very area of applied science he and others espouse so strongly.”</p>
<p>“The vice chancellor should read his own speeches more carefully. At this time we need staff like this more than ever,” said TEU’s Massey branch president, Barry Foster.</p>
<p>“New Zealand’s economic, environmental, and social future is closely connected to teaching and research in the earth sciences. Is Massey intimidated by the proposed Lincoln-AgResearch merger? Have we now given up competing in that field?” Mr. Foster asked.</p>
