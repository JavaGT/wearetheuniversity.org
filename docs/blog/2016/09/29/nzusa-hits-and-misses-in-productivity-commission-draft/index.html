<p>&quot;We believe that students should instead be regarded as experts in learning and heard and heeded at all levels of tertiary institutions. If students are given an education grant and poor careers advice and poor student voice systems still exist, then these students are unlikely to make decisions that will ultimately be in their own interests or those of society. It will also make institutions extremely vulnerable, which is also not in students’ interests.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ultimately, NZUSA believes there is some good elements to this draft document but are deeply concerned by others. There are some further areas which deserve investigation and can be made good. We will continue to work with the Productivity Commission to work towards a final report that meets the best interests of students.&quot;</p>
