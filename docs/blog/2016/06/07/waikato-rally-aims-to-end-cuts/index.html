<p>Waikato rally aims to end cuts</p>
<p>People who work and study at the University of Waikato are rallying in black tomorrow afternoon to prevent cuts to their courses and jobs.</p>
<p>TEU&#39;s deputy secretary Nanette Cormack, who will be speaking the rally, says the cuts are widespread.</p>
<p>The university wants to cut the jobs of more than 20 people at the Faculty of Education. These people help new teachers learn the skills they need to teach our young children.</p>
<p>&quot;The university wants to cut the programme that teaches our new teachers.&quot;</p>
<p>The University of Waikato plans to sell off its Pathways College to a multinational company. People working at Pathways help hundreds of school leavers get the foundation skills they need to go to university.</p>
<p>The university also wants to cut jobs for telephonists and engineering staff.</p>
<p>Cormack says the university needs to hear from local people that these cuts are unnecessary, unwanted and unhelpful.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that the people of Hamilton and the Waikato do not want these cuts to their university.&quot;</p>
<p>Rally details<br>Venue: University of Waikato Village Green (beside the shops)<br>Date: Wednesday 8 June<br>Time: 1pm</p>
