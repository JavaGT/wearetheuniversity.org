<p>Student loans are contributing to growing inequality, says TEU national secretary Sharn Riggs.</p>
<p>Statistics New Zealand released data today showing that the top ten percent of households now own over half of the country’s total wealth.</p>
<p>The data shows extreme inequality between ethnicities. People of European ethnicity had a median net worth of $114,000, compared with $23,000 for people of Māori ethnicity, $12,000 for Pacific people, and $33,000 for the Asian ethnic group.</p>
<p>Riggs says part of the cause for this destabilising inequality is student loans.</p>
<p>Young people (aged 15–24) had the lowest individual median net worth of any age group – just $1,000. The most common debt for young people is education loans.</p>
<p>Riggs says student loans place huge financial pressure on people on low incomes.</p>
<p>“It is much harder for non-Pākehā people to grow their wealth during their life when they are saddled with debt liabilities that cut away such a huge proportion of their current wealth.</p>
<p>“The high cost of studying also means it is harder for Māori and Pasifika people to get a tertiary education.”</p>
<p>Median education loan liabilities are only one-tenth of Pākehā people’s median assets, but they are a quarter of Māori people’s assets and over a third of Pacific people’s assets (table 7.01).</p>
<p>The data shows that the households with the smallest median net worth have the largest median education loans (table 2.02). These loans make up nearly a quarter of their total debt (table 2.03).</p>
<p>Over a third of households within the poorest quintile of net worth have education loans, whereas less than a tenth of households in the wealthiest quintile have education debt (table 2.04).</p>
<p>Riggs says New Zealand has to cut the cost of education if it wants to restore a more equal and balanced society.</p>
