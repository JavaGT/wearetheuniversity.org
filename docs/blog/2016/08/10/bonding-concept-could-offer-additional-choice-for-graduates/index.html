<p>“We would also like to acknowledge other parties who have already made commitments to similar schemes, including New Zealand First.”</p>
<p>“Finally we look forward to the opportunity to explore this issue further with the Labour Party, and other parties, in order to identify the groups, and occupations, who may benefit significantly by this idea and could be addressed as a matter of priority. We naturally would also seek to incorporate the voices of students.”</p>
