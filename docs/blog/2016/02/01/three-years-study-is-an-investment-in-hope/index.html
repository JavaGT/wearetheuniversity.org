<p>The Labour Party’s ‘three years free’ policy gives people from all walks of life opportunity to learn, says TEU president Sandra Grey.</p>
<p>Grey says the policy is exciting.</p>
<p>The Tertiary Education Union is welcoming the new policy, saying it finally recognises that tertiary education is an investment for the country rather than a burden.</p>
<p>&quot;Three years of free education is a big ticket item but it will have an even bigger return for New Zealanders because they will have the freedom to pursue the dreams, careers and passions that inspire them,&quot; says Grey.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been a long time since anyone has talked about investing money in tertiary education for the good of students, and for the good of people, rather than for the benefit of business,&quot; says Grey.</p>
<p>&quot;This policy will help people get jobs but it will also help them give back to their communities and inspire their families.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That’s a big step in the right direction.&quot;</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
