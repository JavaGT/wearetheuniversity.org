<p>Don&#39;t sell costly degrees, fix low incomes</p>
<p>Remove money from the equation - education should be about learning not earning says TEU national president Sandra Grey.</p>
<p>Grey says the release of Universities NZ&#39;s study on graduate earnings tells us what we already know; that some jobs earn far more than others do.</p>
<p>&quot;Medicine might be the highest paying profession in New Zealand but that is the wrong reason for anyone to become a doctor. We want our future doctors to be passionate about helping people in need, not helping empty people&#39;s wallets.&quot;</p>
<p>Grey says tertiary education contributes to New Zealand&#39;s democracy, stability, social wellbeing and health outcomes.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet, constantly we tell students to value it only for its individual economic outcomes.&quot;</p>
<p>Universities New Zealand&#39;s study shows that several level 4 and 5 courses leave graduates worse off financially over their life than if they had not studied at all.</p>
<p>Grey says that is not a reflection on the quality of those courses. Rather it shows the damning effect of user pays education when it clashes with extremely low paid jobs such as teacher aiding.</p>
<p>&quot;The solution is not for everyone to avoid studying to become a teacher aide, but for us to lower the cost of study and raise wages for people who do such important jobs in our communities,&quot; says Grey.</p>
