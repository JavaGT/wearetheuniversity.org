<p>Vic University plans to privatise foundation studies</p>
<p>There is no evidence that privatising Victoria University&#39;s foundation studies programme will bring more international students to Wellington, says TEU national president Sandra Grey.</p>
<p>Victoria University has a plan to outsource its international students foundation studies programme to a private company. The university is worried that it is not attracting enough international students through the programme and has drafted a paper recommending that it close its in-house programme and contract the work out to an external company.</p>
<p>Grey says that though the proposal is in its early stages, it is bizarre.</p>
<p>“It is good that the university is consulting before it gets to the formal stages of a change proposal because its current plan lacks evidence or reason.”</p>
<p>Grey says the plan, which will see an entire programme closed and outsourced, assumes without evidence that an as-yet-unnamed private provider will bring in another 150 international students.</p>
<p>“Why would an independent company have more success recruiting students than an internationally regarded university?”</p>
<p>Grey says TEU rejects the assumption that a private company will be better either at teaching international students or attracting them to Wellington than the city&#39;s own highly-regarded university.</p>
<p>“Victoria University&#39;s document cites no evidence or figures. It talks about international benchmarking figures that we have never heard of, and dismisses publicly-owned options on the basis of guesses and assumptions.”</p>
