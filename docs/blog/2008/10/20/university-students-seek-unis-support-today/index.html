<p>University students seek<br>University’s support today</p>
<p>Auckland students will seek the University’s support for a universal student allowance at the University’s Council meeting this afternoon at 4pm in the Clocktower.</p>
<p>The two student representatives on Council, AUSA President David Do and AUSA Education Vice President Sophia Blair, have put the item on the Council’s agenda to be discussed and voted on.</p>
<p>“Many students at Auckland University find themselves in difficult financial circumstances due to lack of access to student allowances. Students who are properly supported while they are studying, not just academically but also financially, are more likely to achieve their full potential,” says AUSA President David Do.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently found that those who received student allowances did better academically and were almost twice more likely to successfully complete their studies than those who did not receive similar allowance support. Allowances made the biggest difference for Maori students, who were three times more likely to complete their qualification.</p>
<p>“With government funding becoming increasingly focused on lifting performance in student retention and completion rates, tertiary institutions will be better off when more students get an allowance.”</p>
<p>The item was placed on the Council agenda two weeks ago, before major political announcements on the issue.</p>
<p>“We felt the issue would be topical anyway and should be considered by the Council. We believe that the University should take a principled position in favour of properly supporting students through their studies,” concludes Do.</p>
