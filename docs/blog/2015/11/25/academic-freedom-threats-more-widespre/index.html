<p>Academic freedom threats more widespread than police data</p>
<p>The case of the police withholding data from Dr Gilbert is a breach of academic freedom but not an isolated one, says TEU national president Dr Sandra Grey.</p>
<p>Grey says government departments are wary of damaging headlines and this has led them to clamp down on public commentary from scientists.</p>
<p>A survey last year by AUT’s Work Research Institute revealed that nearly two-fifths of academics say that their level of academic freedom is worse than when they started work.</p>
<p>While there are some limited legitimate reasons why some data cannot be public, the current presumption against releasing data without a struggle is creating a climate of silence.</p>
<p>Grey says this is a dangerous trend because it means, at times, ministers do not have the full information they need to make decisions.</p>
<p>“If we want strong public debate and good policy making, research results need to be public. Where public interest is at stake, an academic needs to release work publicly - no matter who funds the research.”</p>
<p>Grey advises researchers not to take contracts with strong gag clauses such as the one the police tried to impose on Dr Gilbert.</p>
<p>“Fear of having contracts cut or being blacklisted for our work can lead to researchers double-guessing themselves unconsciously.”</p>
<p>Grey says academics have a legal duty under the Education Act to act as “critic and conscience” of society.</p>
<p>“They cannot be our critic and conscience if public agencies are actively discouraging research that does not suit their public image.”</p>
