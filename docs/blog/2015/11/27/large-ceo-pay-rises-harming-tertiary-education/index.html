<p>Large CEO pay rises harming tertiary education</p>
<p>Substantial pay rises for chief executives and vice-chancellors at New Zealand’s polytechnics and universities reveal growing inequality.</p>
<p>The State Services Commission released the pay bands of New Zealand’s tertiary education leaders yesterday.</p>
<p>Seven of the 19 universities, polytechnics and wānanga where the chief executive and vice-chancellor did not change in the last two years received a pay rise of more than $10,000.</p>
<p>Several of those leaders who left, such as Lincoln’s Dr Andrew West ($117,000 for his last day of duty), seem to have received substantial golden handshakes to see them on their way.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland’s vice-chancellor Prof Stuart McCutcheon saw his pay increase to over $680,000. Some of the lowest paid people working at his university earn $36,000. Professor McCutcheon earns that much in less than three weeks.</p>
<p>Dr Peter Brothers at Manukau Institute of Technology got a pay rise of over $60,000. During that time, Dr Brothers oversaw more than 50 people at his polytechnic losing their jobs and several courses closed.</p>
<p>Chris Collins at EIT took a $50,000 pay rise of over 16 percent, but tutorial assistants at his polytechnic got a pay rise of only 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>TEU national president Sandra Grey says these figures reveal growing inequality in tertiary education.</p>
<p>“Our members have been campaigning to make sure the people who earn the least get the biggest percentage pay rise. We are working hard for a Living Wage for everyone working in universities and polytechnics.”</p>
<p>“It’s embarrassing to see our bosses taking pay rises that they are not willing to offer to the people who work for them.”</p>
<p>ends</p>
