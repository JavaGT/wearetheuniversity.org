<p><strong>Govt cuts staff and students from university councils</strong></p>
<p>Parliament voted last night to remove the legal right of staff and students to have democratically elected representatives on their governing university and wānanga councils.</p>
<p>Government MPs passed the Education Amendment Bill, which has been opposed by an overwhelming number of public submitters, including vice-chancellors, staff and students.</p>
<p>TEU national president Sandra Grey says the union is now turning directly to the leaders of universities and wānanga to make sure their councils retain a space for independent staff and student representatives.</p>
<p>“We will be campaigning at with each local university and wānanga community for their council to set aside one-third of council seats for democratically elected staff and student representatives.”</p>
<p>“The government never gave a justification for removing the legislated right for staff and students to have democratically elected representatives on councils or for diminishing the size of councils.”</p>
<p>We know that despite the government&#39;s efforts to put councils in the hands of ministerial appointees and business executives, universities and wānanga still want their staff and students to have a voice on their councils.”</p>
