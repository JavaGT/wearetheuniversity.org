<p>Lincoln University’s advert for a new vice-chancellor calls for ‘superior execution skills’ but no mention at all of academic knowledge.</p>
<p>TEU national president Sandra Grey says Lincoln’s hunt for a vice-chancellor highlights just how removed some of our tertiary institutions have become from their core task of education.</p>
<p>&quot;Last year <em>the Press</em> dubbed former vice-chancellor Andy West the smiling assassin. Nevertheless, it seems astonishing that the university is following that appointment up by advertising for business execution skills rather than someone who has a background teaching and researching in a university,&quot; says Grey.</p>
<p>The advertisement talks about someone with excellent partnering skills.</p>
<p>&quot;Lincoln wants this Casanova to enter multiple relationships with industry, but it makes no mention of collegial relationships with staff and students,&quot; says Grey.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither is there any mention of vice-chancellor understanding the critic and conscience function legislated for New Zealand universities or the institution’s Treaty Partnership responsibilities.&quot;</p>
<p>Grey says Lincoln’s job advertisement suggests it has forgotten what a university is.</p>
<p>&quot;Successful businesses would not accept such jargon about ‘Transformational leadership’ and shaping ‘a future-focused culture’. So why do our universities and polytechnics persist with this failed pseudo-business culture of decades past? Their most important job is simply to teach and research, not to waffle on in meaningless business-speak.&quot;</p>
