<p>Negotiations for new national collective employment agreements between university unions and vice-chancellors have broken down. Universities will now, for the first time ever, face prolonged national strike action.</p>
<p>The negotiations, which resumed in Christchurch today, broke down after all of the university employers maintained their previous refusal to agree to national collective agreements, insisting on single-employer agreements with salary increases ranging from 2.0 percent (Massey) to 4.5 percent (Auckland).

<p>The unions will hold meetings over the next week to consider escalating industrial action, already proposed to start on 20 July.</p>
