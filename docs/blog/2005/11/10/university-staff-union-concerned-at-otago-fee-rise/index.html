<p>University staff union concerned at Otago fee rise</p>
<p>The Otago Branch of the Association of University Staff (AUS) expressed concern today at the 5 percent fee increases facing Otago University students next year.</p>
<p>Branch President Shane Montague-Gallagher said it appears that the University was in a no-win situation with fee increases. &quot;With rising costs for the University exceeding any increases in government funding, it seems the Council had little choice but to raise fees in this instance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A significant reduction in income in real terms for the University could compromise standards&quot;, said Mr Montague-Gallagher. &quot;There are serious issues confronting the University in terms infrastructure, and salaries are still at a level where it can be difficult to attract new staff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through years of inadequate salary increases and increasing student fees, both staff and students have borne the brunt of under-funding for too long,&quot; said Mr Montague-Gallagher.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the University Tripartite Forum, established as a result of the recent industrial unrest on most university campuses, and which involves unions, vice-chancellors and government representatives, will come up with some real solutions that will serve the sector long-term, said Mr Montague-Gallagher.</p>
