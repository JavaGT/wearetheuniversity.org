<p><strong>Otago should sponsor students not rugby players</strong></p>
<p>“The University of Otago’s sponsorship of the Highlanders rugby team had better not come at the expense of public education and research,” say TEU deputy secretary Nanette Cormack.</p>
<p>“We do not know how much the university will spend promoting itself to rugby fans, but we do believe that money the public gives to public education institutions should be spent on public education and research, not on advertising.”</p>
<p>“Tertiary education has suffered significant funding cuts in recent years. It seems ridiculous that a publicly-owned New Zealand university would believe that competing with other public universities for students is a funding priority. It should be investing in keep student fees down, lowering class sizes or bring high quality research and teaching to the people of Otago.”</p>
