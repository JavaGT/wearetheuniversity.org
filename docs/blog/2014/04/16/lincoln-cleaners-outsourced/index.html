<p>Lincoln University will outsource its staff to an as yet undecided cleaning company, but TEU organiser Cindy Doull says it’s not worth it, and what money the university might save is negligible.</p>
<p>“We’re disappointed that the university decided do this while we were in discussions with them about becoming a Living Wage employer.”</p>
<p>Cindy Doull says the plan to outsource the cleaners simply moves the money the university spends from one pot ‘salaries’ to another pot ‘operational’.</p>
<p>“The only way outsourcing saves a big organisation like Lincoln University any money is if the contracted cleaning company cuts wages or hours. It’s a coward’s way of cutting pay and conditions for our lowest paid workers.”</p>
<p>If the new cleaning company does cut its cleaning staff’s pay the money the university saves will be very little, says Cindy Doull, and it will do nothing to address the university’s financial troubles.</p>
<p>The university announced its decision yesterday after it finished consulting on its change proposal for Lincworks Property Services. As well as outsourcing its cleaners, the university also intends to disestablish an electrical coordinator, an electrician and a systems administrator. The proposal establishes four new positions and makes changes to eight other existing jobs.</p>
<p>Cindy Doull says the decision is particularly significant for some long-serving cleaners.</p>
<p>“Some have chosen early retirement as they are so distraught, and do not want to work for anyone else. They felt that they had no choice.”</p>
