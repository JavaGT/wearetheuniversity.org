<p>A group of students have chained themselves inside the University of Auckland Vice Chancellor’s office. Another group are occupying the building’s roof.</p>
<p>The protest comes in advance of the University’s fee-setting meeting, where fees are expected to be raised by 4%.</p>
<p>The students began the occupation at 9am, and are going to be joined by a rally at 1pm. They intend to stay until the fee-setting meeting at 4pm.</p>
<p>“We are here because the university continues to chain us to debt by raising fees every year,” says Mikaela Hunt.</p>
<p>“The fee-setting meeting has traditionally been open to the public but has moved off-campus due to recent student protests.”</p>
<p>“Because we’re locked out of the meeting, we’ve locked ourselves in his office,” Hunt says.</p>
<p>Students are also concerned about recent comments by the University’s Vice Chancellor, Stuart McCutcheon.</p>
<p>“McCutcheon has stated that he wants the government to remove the cap on fee increases, which would create an avalanche of student debt” says Mikaela Hunt.</p>
<p>The meeting is also where the Vice Chancellor’s salary is raised. Hunt says it unacceptable that McCutcheon is the highest paid public official in New Zealand, earning at least $640,000 per year.</p>
<p>Law student, Jamie Davies, says she’s worried about leaving university with nearly $40,000 of debt.</p>
<p>She says, “Around the world students are organising against fees. German students have recently forced their government to abolish fees.”</p>
<p>“Stuart McCutcheon’s generation benefited from fully-funded, fee-free education. My generation has decades of student loans to repay.”</p>
<p>Students are chanting, “Sack Stuart”, “They got it free, why shouldn’t we,” “Stuart McCutcheon, what’s your function?” “F**k the fees”.</p>
