<p><strong>Students shouldn&#39;t need to borrow to live</strong></p>
<p>&quot;To reclaim tertiary education for students we need to introduce living allowances for all students, and start working immediately to eliminate student fees.&quot;</p>
<p>This is our line in the sand, said TEU national president Lesley Francey, at tomorrow afternoon&#39;s <em>Te Kaupapa Whaioranga</em> Wellington launch, which focuses on student debt and on giving all New Zealanders access to education.</p>
<p>Demands to reduce the cost of education and remove the financial barriers to students participating form the basis for TEU&#39;s latest <em>Te Kaupapa Whaioranga</em> blueprint document.</p>
<p>&quot;Tertiary education is not primarily a public subsidy and skills factory for big business. It is about providing opportunities and hope for students and their local communities. If debt prevents students getting an education then our public education system is failing and our country is losing out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Te Kaupapa Whaioranga</em> - our blueprint for education represents that basic line in the sand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the best way to demonstrate that we are committing our education system to the wellbeing of students first and foremost, rather than corporations, is not to saddle them with huge debts while they study.&quot;</p>
<p>TEU will launch its student well-being blueprint, along with another blueprint on tertiary education governance, on Tuesday afternoon to a panel of tertiary education spokespeople including Dave Clendon (Greens), Hone Harawira (Mana), Tracey Martin (NZ First), and Grant Robertson (Labour).</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong><br>• DATE Tues 1 April<br>• TIME 3.45pm<br>• VENUE St Johns Church, Willis St, Wellington<br>• NOTE: The first <em>Te Kaupapa Whaioranga</em> document outlined a blueprint to renew the entire tertiary education sector for the New Zealand public, and the second focused on the big issues facing Māori tertiary education. The third and fourth documents, launched on 1 April cover students and governance. All documents are available at <a href="http://teu.ac.nz/blueprint">http://teu.ac.nz/blueprint</a></p>
