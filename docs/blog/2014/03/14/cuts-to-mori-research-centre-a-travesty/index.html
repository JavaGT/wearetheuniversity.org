<p>Cutting the funding to Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga centre of research excellence is a travesty and tragedy says Dr Margaret Taurere.</p>
<p>Dr Taurere is speaking on behalf of Māori tertiary education workers who gathered from around the country and passed a resolution today expressing their concern at the decision.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga learned it was one of four established centres of research excellence (CoREs) that would lose their funding from the Tertiary Education Commission next year. The Auckland-based Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga leads internationally respected research into Māori communities.</p>
<p>“Ngā Pae is a renowned beacon of success, both for Māori academia and for the wider Māori community, which benefits from its work,” said Dr Taurere.</p>
<p>Māori members of TEU passed a resolution at their annual hui today at Whangārei’s Te Puna ō Te Mātauranga Marae. The resolution calls for the Tertiary Education Commission to reconsider the Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga funding application immediately, because for Ngā Pae not to receive funding will detrimentally affect established and emerging Māori researchers, Kaupapa Māori and mātauranga Māori research outputs.</p>
<p>Dr Taurere says it is hard to imagine how Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga failed to meet the criteria for funding. She and the rest of the Hui are meeting with Māori politicians at 5pm at Te Puna ō Te Mātauranga Marae to express their concerns.</p>
