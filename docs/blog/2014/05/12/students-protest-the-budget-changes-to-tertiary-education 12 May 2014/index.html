<p>On the 16th of May, University of Auckland students are protesting changes to the Tertiary Education system.</p>
<p>Jak Davys, commerce student, says &quot;Education is a pathway to a fair and equal society. National’s cuts to tertiary education undermine that pathway by making access to education a privilege for those who can afford it.</p>
<p>&quot;Since 2009, inflation-adjusted funding for tertiary education has decreased by 8.7% ($400 million) and at the same time numbers of students have increased by 20,000.This means that less money is spent per student, deteriorating the quality of education.&quot;</p>
<p>Dayvs says that students are frustrated by increasing tuition fees and debt. He is concerned about how he will afford to pay for postgraduate study. &quot;The cuts to student allowances for postgraduate study and increased the loan repayment threshold to 12% have made it really difficult for me. I’m not alone, in 2013, postgraduate enrolments decreased by 7.1% at Auckland Uni.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When 15% of students are experiencing absolute financial distress and others are struggling to get financial access to the university, we can no longer say tertiary education policy is working.&quot; Davys is encouraging students to join him in protest on the 16th of May at 11:00am outside the University of Auckland Library.</p>
