<p>Statement regarding the dismissal of Dr Paul Buchanan, University of Auckland</p>
<p>In response to media enquiry in relation to the dismissal of Dr Paul Buchanan from his position as a lecturer in Political Studies at the University of Auckland, the Association of University Staff makes the following points.</p>
<p>Dr Buchanan is a highly respected academic with a high public profile.</p>
<p>We can confirm that Dr Buchanan sent an email to a student about which a complaint was made. Dr Buchanan has apologized to both the student and the University regarding this email.</p>
<p>There are extenuating circumstances surrounding the sending of the email, and the University had a range of options open to it other than to dismiss Dr Buchanan.</p>
<p>The Association of University staff does not believe Dr Buchanan should have been dismissed from his position.</p>
<p>Dr Buchanan’s dismissal is being appealed.</p>
<p>There will be no further public comment on this matter at this time</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
