<p>Students call for international fee stability</p>
<p>As AUSA continues its fee-setting campaign, students showed their support for the grandparenting of international tuition fees this week, and have also expressed concern at reduced levels of services for international students.</p>
<p>At yesterday’s Student Representative Council, students voted in favour of calling on the University to grandparent its international fees.</p>
<p>Grandparenting, as practised by other New Zealand universities(AUT, Massey, and Waikato), means holding a student&#39;s level of fees at the same level throughout the normal course of their degree, rather than having them increase every year.</p>
<p>“The University of Auckland claims it ‘grandparents’ its fees by ‘capping’ fee rises at 5%. This is disingenuous to call it grandparenting because it means continuous fee rises during the normal course of a degree,” says Bethanie Maples, AUSA Acting President.</p>
<p>“International students pay tens of thousands of dollars in fees annually, so any percentage rise means a large amount of money for students and their families. This is money that students often divert from their normal living costs, with negative impacts on their health and well-being,” says David Do, AUSA Education Vice President.</p>
<p>Students also voiced their concern at recently reduced opening hours for the International Students Information Centre.</p>
<p>The centre, which provides a variety of services for international students such as referral to pastoral student support and other enquiries, had been open 8:30 to 5pm weekdays. Until further notice it will only be open 9am to 2pm weekdays, almost a 50% cut in opening hours.</p>
<p>”Somehow it doesn’t seem right to reduce service levels for international students when the University is poised to increase their fees for yet another year,” concludes David Do.</p>
<p>The University of Auckland Council is meeting this Monday at 4pm to decide on 2008 fees for domestic and international students. AUSA will be holding a lively and visual student protest before this meeting on Monday afternoon, at the University Clocktower on Princes Street.</p>
