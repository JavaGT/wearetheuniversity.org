<p>Auckland students oppose unrestrained fee hikes</p>
<p>Auckland University Students are today shocked at the news that the National Party wants to remove the current policy of regulated fee maxima and allow universities to set their own fees.</p>
<p>“We are deeply alarmed at signs of any return to unrestrained fee rises. Students faced massive fee hikes in the 1990s, contributing to student debt reaching $9 billion and growing,” says AUSA Education Vice President David Do.</p>
<p>“National’s policy is particularly pertinent to our students as the University of Auckland also charges some of the highest fees in New Zealand. Under National’s policy, this would get even worse.”</p>
<p>National in government allowed institutions to set their own tuition fees as well as reduced government funding. This led to massive fees growth – the average annual university fee increased from $1300 in 1992 to over $4000 by 2000.</p>
<p>90% of Auckland students agreed or strongly agreed that tertiary fees are too high, according to a recent Income and Expenditure survey conducted by the New Zealand Union of Student Associations.</p>
<p>“High fees are a major barrier to accessing decent tertiary education. Resorting to the ‘market’ doesn’t address these issues and it wont build a high-quality tertiary education system. Better investment into universities will,” concludes Mr Do.</p>
<p>National leader John Key should know better. As he said to the National Party annual conference in Auckland in August:<br>“I know from personal experience that education is a liberator. Unless we ensure that every Kiwi is equipped with a decent education, we are robbing them of a future.&quot;</p>
