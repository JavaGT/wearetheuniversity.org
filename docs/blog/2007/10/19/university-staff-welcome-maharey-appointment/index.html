<p>University staff welcome Maharey appointment</p>
<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the appointment of Steve Maharey as the next Vice-Chancellor of Massey University, saying that his appointment should benefit the entire university and tertiary education sector.</p>
<p>It was announced today that Mr Maharey, a former senior lecturer at the University, will take up his appointment next year following the retirement of the current Vice-Chancellor, Professor Judith Kinnear.</p>
<p>AUS National President, Professor Nigel Haworth, said that, as a former minister responsible for tertiary education and the current Minister of Education, Mr Maharey is ideally placed to lead one of New Zealand&#39;s major universities.</p>
<p>Professor Haworth said that Mr Maharey was responsible for the initiation of many of the current reforms in the tertiary education sector, particularly around the need for collaboration and in the recognition of the distinctive contribution made by the different types of institutions, necessary to benefit the country as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr Maharey&#39;s experience and grasp of the issues facing tertiary education will have equipped him with the skills needed to provide strong leadership in Massey and in the broader sector. He will add important understanding to the work of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors&#39; Committee, particularly around the need for governance reform, increased funding and greater cooperation between institutions,&quot; he said. &quot;Not only do we look forward to working with Mr Maharey in the tripartite process, we also look forward to him to show strong support for bargaining multi-employer collective employment agreements within the sector.&quot;</p>
