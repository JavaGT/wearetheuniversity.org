<p>Ensuring provision is localised in regions that need it, regardless of the population size (bums on seats) that currently drives provision levels.<br>Well supported RoVE transitions that maintain and enhance educational quality and learner experience.<br>A seamless transition from education to employment, regardless of student background and qualification.<br>Independent students associations as opposed to student councils supported, with a guaranteed level of resourcing. This is in contrast to the current piecemeal system, leaving some institutes with no student voice whatsoever<br>Adequate on campus student services reflective of the pre-Voluntary Student Membership era, with a special emphasis on mental health services<br>Youth Guarantee Compulsory Student Services Fee (CSSF) payment exclusion covered by parent institute<br>Organisational structure and education that is flexible (e.g. blended learning) to suit the 21st century student, meanwhile avoiding online learning being used a crux<br>A National Center for Student Voice that enhances student voice capacity, quality and relationships.<br>Enhanced support for diverse learners (particularly Māori and Pasifika), including the incorporation of different worldviews into what is currently a homogenised western structure and way of educating<br>Free Tertiary Education, or at the very least the continued roll-out of the coalition Government’s Fees Free Policy<br>Fulfilling this wishlist will ensure that all vocational education students have a positive experience, and that all campuses will be able to experience the success of those ITP’s that have managed to cope throughout the system we currently have, such as the Eastern Institute of Technology</p>
<p>“The Eastern Institute of Technology has some of the most impressive student outcomes in the country. Half of EIT&#39;s domestic students are Māori and have some of the best achievement rates in New Zealand. EIT has a real connection with the communities of Hawke&#39;s Bay and Tairāwhiti which enable it to target the root causes of student challenges. A strong students&#39; association that can effectively lobby EIT and represent students&#39; views has been vital in ensuring good governance and decision making.” Said Andrew Lessels, President of the EIT Students’ Association Younited.</p>
