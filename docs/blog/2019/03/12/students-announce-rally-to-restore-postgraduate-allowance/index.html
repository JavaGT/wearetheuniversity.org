Having to work twenty or more hours a week in a part-time job to make ends meet takes a strain on important research, research that ultimately provides benefit to society as a whole”.</p>
<p>Alongside the improvement of support for researchers in crucial fields and a government showing accountability, the restoration of the postgraduate student allowance will also make our higher education more fair.</p>
<p>‘Fairness is important to all of us. We need a fair and equitable student support system across all course types, from certificate level right through to a PhD. Education should be upheld as a way of reducing inequality, however the lack of a Postgraduate student allowance stifles student opportunity’ says Ranstead.</p>
<p>Individual students have also been reaching out on this topic -</p>
<p>‘I’m passionate about reducing New Zealand’s horrific suicide rate through studying towards a career in psychology. Unfortunately due to the lack of financial support at postgraduate level I’ve had to put that dream on hold’, says Nicole (Bachelor of Social Science in Psychology, University of Waikato).</p>
<p>Students will walk on Parliament on April 11th, between 12.30 – 2pm, on Thursday 11th April.</p>
