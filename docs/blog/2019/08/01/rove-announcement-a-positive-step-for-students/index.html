The Minister has confirmed that for those students currently studying, there will be no or minor changes to their programme of study. For those students soon to begin studying, the qualifications on offer to them may differ, and likely be reduced.</p>
<p>‘We believe that these changes are overall a step in the right direction, however students need to be shown transparency and given certainty as early as possible on their programmes of study, and a smooth transition for students should be the number one goal for any decision maker in this space. This includes students from a variety of backgrounds, including international students who are still solely being labelled as a ‘market’ ’– said Ranstead.</p>
<p>Todays’ announcement from the Minister has been very high level, and while NZUSA respects the decision for the transition board to work out much of the granular detail over time, the board should not underestimate the importance of responding to the RoVE student wishlist.</p>
<p>‘There hasn&#39;t yet been any clarity on how a seamless transition (particularly in regards to students programme of study) from the current old model to the new model will be ensured. Whilst mention of the democratic structures are a plus, there is yet to be any certainty of students association resourcing, or the return of student services reflective of the pre-VSM era. Finally, we are also yet to hear about the Youth Guarantee CSSF payment exclusion, and the national centre for student voice. There are moves to fulfill 5/10 of our RoVE student wishlist, and the transition council can be assured that students will be putting on the pressure on these issues over the next 8 months.’ – said Ranstead.</p>
<p><strong>Reform of Vocational Education Student Wishlist 2019:</strong></p>
<p>1. Ensuring provision is localised in regions that need it, regardless of the population size (bums on seats) that currently drives provision levels.</p>
<p>2. Well supported RoVE transitions that maintain and enhance educational quality and learner experience.</p>
<p>3. A seamless transition from education to employment, regardless of student background and qualification.</p>
<p>4. Independent students associations as opposed to student councils supported, with a guaranteed level of resourcing. This is in contrast to the current piecemeal system, leaving some institutes with no student voice whatsoever</p>
<p>5. Adequate on campus student services reflective of the pre-Voluntary Student Membership era, with a special emphasis on mental health services</p>
<p>6. Youth Guarantee Compulsory Student Services Fee (CSSF) payment exclusion covered by parent institute</p>
<p>7. Organisational structure and education that is flexible (e.g. blended learning) to suit the 21st century student, meanwhile avoiding online learning being used a crux</p>
<p>8. A National Center for Student Voice that enhances student voice capacity, quality and relationships.</p>
<p>9. Enhanced support for diverse learners (particularly Māori and Pasifika), including the incorporation of different worldviews into what is currently a homogenised western structure and way of educating</p>
<p>10. Free Tertiary Education, or at the very least the continued roll-out of the coalition Government’s Fees Free Policy</p>
