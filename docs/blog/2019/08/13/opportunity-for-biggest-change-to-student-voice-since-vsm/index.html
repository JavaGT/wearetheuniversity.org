<p>“With a much greater pool of Māori and Pacific students in the tertiary education sector than previously, it is great that the Government is taking a focus on this, likewise with disabled students. It is however, disappointing to see that international students are not included in the consultation document whilst comprising 50,000 of our national student pool, so we will be pushing hard for a change on this in our submission” said Ranstead.</p>
<p>NZUSA partner the Tertiary Education Union has also come out in support of todays announcements.</p>
<p>Sharn Riggs, TEU National Secretary, noted that student voice has been silenced and compromised since the law changed in 2014 making membership of students’ associations voluntary. Riggs also welcomed Minister Hipkins recognition that action must be taken and committed to wide-ranging consultation to address these issues and ensure a strong student voice for the future. The TEU will continue to support the NZUSA and its members as they advocate for their preferred approach to strengthen student voice.</p>
<p>The consultation document will be soon uploaded on the Ministry of Education kōrero mātauranga website. NZUSA and Te Mana Ākonga will be mobilising student groups over the next couple of months to ensure it is students that are driving the discussion on this topic.</p>
