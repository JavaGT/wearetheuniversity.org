<p>Course cuts in South Auckland another blow to the aspirations of Māori<br>TEU members at MIT and nationally are condemning the cuts proposed for tertiary education provision in South Auckland. Cuts they say will harm Māori, Pasifika and low-income learners.</p>
<p>MIT is proposing to cut courses in Creative Arts, Horticulture, and Tourism, with at least 15 jobs lost.<br>The proposed cuts affect areas with high numbers of Māori and Pasifika students.</p>
<p>Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union Māori Vice President Hūhana Wātene, on behalf of the union’s national Māori committee Te Toi Ahurangi, has written to the Minister of Education noting that: “Once again, the most vulnerable learners in our society are being disadvantaged by an education system that has traditionally failed them at all levels.”</p>
<p>Wātene says that the words of the Minister of Education and the aspirations in the new Tertiary Education Strategy of boosting achievement of Māori and Pasifika are ringing a little hollow for staff in the polytechnic sector right now, as ever deeper cuts are made to what is taught and where.</p>
<p>“If Māori learners are really a priority of this government, they’ve got to step in to protect Māori and Pasifika positions and end the relentless job cuts in the polytechnic sector.”</p>
<p>In the letter Te Toi Ahurangi and MIT members argue that a culturally responsive tertiary education system is reliant on having a broad range of courses, including Māori tourism courses and creative arts courses which helps build the cultural identity and confidence of learners.</p>
<p>“Members of Te Toi Ahurangi and MIT want the future of vocational education to be bright for Māori and all learners.</p>
<p>That means ensuring there are enough courses, for the proposed NZ Institute of Skills and Technology to meet the needs of learners, whānau, hapū, iwi, communities, and industries,” says Wātene.</p>
