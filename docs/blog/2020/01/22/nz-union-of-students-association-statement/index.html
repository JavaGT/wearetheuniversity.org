work has influenced my studies - I have less time and even
though my jobs are flexible, I still have to put in more
work for them in order to get the job done and get paid”

<p>“If the post graduate allowance was
reinstated, I wouldn't have to work - I could use my time to
actually work towards my thesis. I wouldn't have to stress
about bills and food. The government still hasn't reinstated
the post graduate allowance, but the cost of tertiary
education or living costs in New Zealand hasn't decreased
either. It feels like New Zealand is purposely turning into
an elitist country, that I can't afford to stay in even
though I'm a New Zealand citizen.”<p>

President Isabella Lenihan-Ikin says, “the reinstatement
of post graduate student allowance is a vital step towards a
barrier free education for all New Zealanders.”<p></p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
