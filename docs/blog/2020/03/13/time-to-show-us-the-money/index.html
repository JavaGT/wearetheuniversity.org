And we&#39;re not going to let up until the Government ‘shows us the money’”, says TEU’s National President.</p>
<p>TEU members are taking actions across Aotearoa on Black Friday, 13 March, to demand that the government gets polytechnics back into the black.</p>
<p>Michael Gilchrist, Te Tumu Whakarae of Te Hautū Kahurangi | NZ Tertiary Education Union says the tutors, support staff, technicians, administrators, lecturers and all staff in the polytechnic sector know what’s at stake – access to education.</p>
<p>“They don’t want to watch as more courses are cut and more hopes dashed before a new, unified vocational education and training network for New Zealand is able to soar. That’s why they’re leading a day of action from Invercargill to Auckland.”</p>
<p>On the eve of the most significant public sector reform in a couple of decades, a reform promising inclusive, accessible vocational education, the government still hasn’t put the money on the table.</p>
<p>If we’re going to ensure all New Zealanders get great educational experiences through NZIST which begins operating on 1 April, we must have the public behind it.</p>
<p>“We all benefit from vocational education and training every day. We benefit from having trained nurses, plumbers, technicians, architects, early childhood workers, and much more – so we need to make sure we find and fund better ways to support their training.”</p>
<p>The Minister wants us to be behind his vision and in the past has commented on how he needs the support of staff, says Gilchrist.</p>
<p>“Well Minister, the staff are again saying give them some certainty that there’ll be enough money to make the vision a reality. Enough money to ensure all communities do have access to quality vocational training and to make sure staff have the capacity to help create the new world.”</p>
