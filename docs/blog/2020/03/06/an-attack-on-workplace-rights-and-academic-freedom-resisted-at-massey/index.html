<p>The members of Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union have chosen to down tools for two hours on 12 April at stopwork meetings on all three campuses of Massey to discuss the far reaching discussion documents.</p>
<p>TEU organiser Heather Warren says there is real anger at the proposed cuts because there is a feeling that much has been predetermined by a “small group of senior leaders”.</p>
<p>“The proposal will cut courses and change the style of delivery in other cases. We won’t stand by and watch the Massey senior leadership team cut back opportunities for students”.</p>
<p>TEU members have pored over the consultation approach and feel that both technological and financial determinism are present. Warren says “we are concerned that the leadership has forgotten what a university is for. And we are questioning the facts and figures used to justify the deep and drastic change.”</p>
<p>We know that the overall funding model means our tertiary education institutions are struggling, but we need our senior leaders to work with us on getting a better funding model rather than taking such drastic actions, says Warren.</p>
<p>“We know that the best educational quality comes from making sure decisions are made on sound teaching and learning outcomes; and on values which support the public good”.</p>
