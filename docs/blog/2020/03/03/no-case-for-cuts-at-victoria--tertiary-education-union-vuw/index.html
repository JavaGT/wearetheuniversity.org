media that the Vice Chancellor is working through redundancy
planning,” said Dougal McNeill, Victoria University
Tertiary Education Union Co-President. “There is no case
for cuts: coronavirus is a nation-wide medical issue, and it
demands a nation-wide, coordinated response across public
education, including from government. Cuts and job losses
are a short-term response that will do long-term damage to
student learning, our communities, and our University. There
is no justification for job losses.”</p>

<p>“Academic and
general staff at Victoria are already feeling overworked
from budget cuts,” McNeill continued, “and the kind of
teaching adaptation that might be needed to respond to
further cases demand more resources, not less. Our students
need certainty and support in this community of learning.
Announcing plans for job losses through the media doesn’t
help with that. The Tertiary Education Union will fight any
job losses at
Victoria.”</p></p></main><footer style="margin-top: 2rem; background: #0001; padding: 2rem; text-align: center;"><p>We Are The University</p><ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;"><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></footer></body></html>
