<p>Kaiwhakahaere | Organiser Shane Vugler says negotiations have “hit a wall.”</p>
<p>“The university has budgeted for a $24 million increase in revenue in 2024, of which only $4 million is allocated to salary improvement. Since the budget was set, between $6-7 million is being cut from personnel costs through restructuring, redundancy, enhanced retirement and a hiring freeze.”</p>
<p>“As a result of these austerity measures, compounded by previous cuts and a significant increase in student numbers this year, our members’ workloads have grown exponentially.”</p>
<p>“Over the course of negotiations, TEU have reduced our claim significantly, and it now sits at 5%. Meanwhile, after eight months at the table, the university has only increased their offer by 0.1% to an anaemic 2.85% (or 3.5% if we agree to a delayed increase which would deliver less money than the 2.85% offer over the full term of the agreement).”</p>
<p>“Our 5% claim fits within their $4 million budget for salary increases if they also agree to a three-month delay before they pass the increase on to non-members, who do not do any of the mahi or pay the union fees that enable us to negotiate.”</p>
<p>“Our members are rightly very angry, and they call on the Vice Chancellor to send his team back to the table with a mandate to increase their offer.”</p>
<p>The strike will run for 3.5hrs from 9am-12:30pm on Friday and will include a rally outside the Pā at 11:30am.</p>
