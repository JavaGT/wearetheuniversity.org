Dawn has finally refreshed her contract and is contracted another 5 years as Vice-Chancellor. Her ideology of consolidation and so-called efficiency has cost this institution valuable professional staff and countless years of institutional knowledge. Our teams &#39;lucky enough&#39; to have survived the last round of redundancies are now facing the prospect of another restructure. This will not stand again. The arts faculty has been decimated, there are issues with timetabling, increased workloads for staff, decreased quality and definition of their education for students.

I have a personal opinion on this matter; however, it would be poor governance practice for me to influence you. I will be making my own submission and, therefore, encourage you to do the same.</p><p>It is important to note that any member of the Public can observe the University Council&#39;s proceedings when it decides on the proposal on the 17th of March 2025. So come along. I beg you to engage with the process. My influence on other Council Members to vote in a particular way is dictated by the QUALITY AND QUANTITY of the consultation data.
