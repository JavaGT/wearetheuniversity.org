We expect this to happen sometime between 8 pm and midnight.</p><p></p><p>We know course coordinators have in some cases made alternate arrangements for tomorrow’s learning and teaching activity — we do not want to disrupt these.</p><p>News from VUW – 2.30<br>To ensure the continued health and safety of our community, Rankine Brown is now closed for the remainder of today, Thursday 19 September. This is a result of a short-term generator issue.</p><p>News from VUW – midday<br>A power outage continues to impact the University’s Kelburn campus, and generators are operating in a number of buildings.</p><p></p><p>The University and Wellington Electricity are working closely to maintain a consistent power supply for the campus. We are pleased at the progress being made this morning.</p><p>There is no impact on teaching, learning, and research for the Pipitea or Te Aro campuses, and other University premises.</p><p>The following buildings continue to be impacted by the power outage, but there have been some changes to operations since our update this morning:</p><p>– Cotton: open from 1 pm today for all teaching and learning<br>– Maclaurin: open from 1 pm today for all teaching and learning<br>– Rankine Brown: open<br>– The Hub: open, but no planned events are running in order to preserve power.<br>– Old Kirk and Kirk: expecting to be able to reopen tomorrow for teaching and learning<br>– Maru: closed today and tomorrow<br>– Student Union Building: closed for teaching and learning today and tomorrow<br>– Recreation Centre: closed until further notice.</p><p>We are still trying to minimise power usage in these buildings as they are running on generator power. This means you will notice intermittent power to some buildings throughout the day — this is not an indication that buildings are fully functional. WiFi continues to be affected in some buildings.</p><p>Until further notice, Mauri Ora—Student Health and Counselling on the Kelburn campus remains open in the Student Union Building with limited capacity. Students can access this service through the ground floor doors of the Student Union Building. All students with booked appointments have been contacted with alternative arrangements where this has been necessary — online or face to face at Kelburn, Pipitea and Te Aro.</p><p>It’s important to note:</p><p>Students will continue to receive triage for health appointments by our nursing team.<br>Same day medical and counselling appointments at Kelburn are still available.</p><p>You can still move through the Kelburn campus, including through buildings that are closed, but power may be intermittent and there may only be emergency lighting. Please take care.</p><p>Update 8.30 am 19 September</p><p>Wellington Electricity has commenced digging in the Tim Beaglehole Courtyard to fix issues with underground services.</p><p>A decision has been made to cancel all in-person teaching, learning, and research in Cotton and MacLaurin until 1 pm. Mauri Ora—Student Health and Counselling will be running four hours of clinics this morning, and you should have been contacted if you have an appointment. University Recreation on the Kelburn campus is closed today.</p><p>Some buildings are running on generator power. This may mean you will notice intermittent power throughout the day. WiFi is affected in some buildings.</p><p>The following buildings are closed for teaching and learning for the rest of the week:</p><p>– Old Kirk and Kirk<br>– Student Union Building</p><p>Your course coordinator will be in touch to confirm new arrangements.</p><p>The following buildings are closed until further notice:</p><p>– Maru<br>– Recreation Centre</p><p>All other buildings are open, including Rankine Brown and The Hub.</p><p>Update 6 pm, 18 September</p><p>The following buildings are closed for safety and security reasons, while generators are installed. If you are still on campus in one of the buildings listed below this evening and don’t have classes, please make arrangements to head home or study from elsewhere.</p><p>Student Union Building<br>Rankine Brown (the Library)<br>Old Kirk and Kirk, and<br>The Hub.</p><p>All other buildings are operational. Any interruption to timetabled classes will be communicated by your school or course coordinator.</p><p>Wellington.Scoop – September 18<br>Electricity was cut in parts of Kelburn, including Victoria University, just before midday today.</p><p></p><p>Wellington Electricity said the streets without power were<br>Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn<br>Kelburn Parade, Kelburn<br>Mckenzie Terrace, Kelburn<br>Mount Street, Te Aro<br>Salamanca Road, Wellington Central<br>Waiteata Road, Kelburn</p><p>It said it hoped to restore the power supply by 2.50pm.</p><p>It could not explain the cause of the power cut.</p><p></p></section><section class="footer"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></section></body>
