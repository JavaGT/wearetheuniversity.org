Subject: Course cutting student forum, 22nd August 2:30 pm, HSB (B201) Foyer
Tēnā koe Valerie,
As students at Waipapa Taumata Rau – University of Auckland, we have concerns
regarding central University’s ‘accelerated “optimisation” and “rationalisation” related
to the ongoing Curriculum Framework Transformation’ of courses and programmes
across our institution. In short, the student body has been left no choice but to
interpret central University management’s actions as being ‘course cuts’.
As a sign of good faith and to help alleviate anxiety, confusion and, at times,
indignation from across the University community, we would ask that you attend a
student-led open forum. As the Vice-Chancellor’s academic representative, we would
appreciate your attendance and cooperation in our hosting of a forum on Thursday,
22 August, 2:30–3:30 pm, in the foyer of the new HSB building (Level 4, B201).
Regardless of your attendance, we shall be inviting all members of the University
community to attend this event and have signalled to the AUSA our desire to co-host
as a sign of unity. We respect AUSA’s role of representing the student body in
consultation and decision-making with the University. It is our intention to show unity
as students and ensure a productive discussion regarding potential mass changes to
curriculum, teaching and learning outcomes.
The purpose of this forum is to provide an opportunity for affected community
members to better understand the rationale behind these changes. Such changes
regarding this ‘optimisation’ and ‘rationalisation’ process have not been well-
expressed by central University governance.
The Student Charter guides and informs our letter to you, and any future actions that
may occur due to the University&#39;s central management decision-making processes.
We feel that you have not fulfilled your role in ensuring partnership in decision-
making, including acknowledging and acting consistently with Te Tiriti o Waitangi. It
will negatively impact Māori and Pasifika students, staff and the broader community
if many of the courses in scope are eventually cut.
We recognise that interpretations of the Student Charter are at times hotly-debated;
such time would be better spent engaging in meaningful consultation and
collaboration with students and staff. Your attendance at our hui would be most
appreciated to ensure this.
It must be noted that should you decide not to attend our meeting on Thursday; we
shall take proportionate action to these course cuts at Mānawa Mai—the University
open day on Saturday next week (24 August)—by providing respectful and
constructive feedback, as per the Student Charter. We simply wish for student voices
to be heard and potential concerns alleviated.
We aim to ensure meaningful and constructive dialogue regarding an issue of mass
importance to the student body, University community, and tertiary sector as a whole.
We look forward to hearing from you in due course.
Naku noa,
Nā Concerned Students.
Relevant sections of the Student Charter, as follows:
This Student Charter sets out the principles underpinning the relationship between
you and the University of Auckland. It recognises the expectations you have of the
