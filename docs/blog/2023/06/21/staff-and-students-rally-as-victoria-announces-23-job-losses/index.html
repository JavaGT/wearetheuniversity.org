<p>Staff have been anxiously waiting to find out who would be targeted by cuts that were foreshadowed a month ago. Today’s announcement confirmed that the cuts target areas such as languages, secondary school teaching, tourism, management, geophysics and physical geography. Other programmes are merging, and 39 general (non-academic) roles are targeted within the cuts.</p>
<p>Speaking to the staff and students rallying to save their jobs this morning, Te Hautū Kahurangi | Tertiary Education Union Tumu Whakarae | National President Dr Julie Douglas said “it is so short-sighted to diminish staff, programmes and institutions at a time when our economy is in desperate need of trained educated workers in every industry.”</p>
<p>“This is so much more than just about jobs today – we are talking about a sector in crisis and on the line is the future of tertiary education being able to deliver what we need as a society into the future, the workforce we need in the future and the needs of a decent society to have educated citizens.”</p>
<p>“Future generations of young kiwis depend on a robust university sector to be there for them – to be able to follow their passions.”</p>
<p>After the rally, Dr Douglas called out the government and Minister of Education Jan Tinetti for not acting.</p>
<p>“They don’t even need to commit money right away, the debt ceiling for universities could be raised and this would provide a short-term solution that would then allow the breathing space to come up with something more sustainable.”</p>
<p>“It’s time to get off the fence. To not act now is to not support tertiary education.”</p>
