<p>Collective Agreements Settled at University of Waikato</p>
<p>Members of the Association of University Staff (AUS), the Public Service Association (PSA) and Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) yesterday voted by a majority to accept the University of Waikato’s latest salary offer.</p>
<p>This gives all members of those unions who are covered by the collective employment agreements a salary increase of 3.2% from 1 October 2001.</p>
<p>“Members are pleased at a positive settlement, given the depressing beginning of negotiations six months ago,” said AUS Waikato Branch President, Stan Jones.</p>
<p>&quot;We were particularly pleased to see backdating to the end of the last agreement and the understanding that this applies to our members only”.</p>
<p>“The whole process happened against a background of the permanent financial crisis caused by successive governments deliberately reducing the investment the country has to make in its university system.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the difficulties this situation continues to produce, Waikato shows how all parties in the negotiations have managed a settlement in the best interests of this campus and the community it serves.&quot;</p>
