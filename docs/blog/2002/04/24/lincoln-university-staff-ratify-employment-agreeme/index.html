<p>Lincoln University staff ratify employment agreement</p>
<p>Lincoln University academic staff members of the Association of University Staff [AUS] voted today to ratify the employer&#39;s offer for a collective employment agreement.</p>
<p>The offer is for a 3% salary increase from 15 May 2002, a further 2% from 2 January 2003, and a commitment to a further negotiated increase from 1 April 2003. The term of the agreement is to 31 October 2002.</p>
<p>Lincoln AUS Branch President, Dr Jim McAloon, said that the early expiry date, similar to that achieved in other universities, was a critical feature of the offer as it allowed the possibility of a co-ordinated national campaign for a more significant increase later in the year.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, Lincoln members only reluctantly accepted the offer as it falls far short of what is necessary to make up for a decade of salary erosion.</p>
<p>&quot;Academic staff have, in the strongest possible terms, called on Lincoln&#39;s Vice-Chancellor and Council to increase their efforts to persuade the government to implement real increases for university resources and staff salaries,&quot; he said. &quot;And we call directly upon the Government to address the underfunding of universities in a way that ensures staff do not continue to bear the cost of that declining funding.&quot;</p>
