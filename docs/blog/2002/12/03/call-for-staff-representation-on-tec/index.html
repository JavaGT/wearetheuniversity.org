<p>The call comes after today’s announcement that a learner (student) advisory committee will be established and a non-voting student will be appointed to the Tertiary Education Commission Board.</p>
<p>AUS National President, Dr Grant Duncan, said that the Association has been promoting the concept of a university reference group, but the need for a staff advisory committee was also vitally important. Fundamental issues such as workforce planning, funding, terms and conditions of employment, and overall resources for teaching and research require specific staff input.</p>
<p>Dr Duncan said that the Commission is a high level policy group with a broad strategic responsibility, but needs specific staff input to provide guidance on the operational implications of its decisions. Today’s announcement paves the way for such a group to be established.</p>
<p>Dr Duncan welcomed the appointment of a non-voting student representative to the Board but said that similar representation needs to be established for staff. “Staff and students form the basis of our tertiary education sector. It is appropriate that both groups are at the table when decisions about the sector are being made”, said Dr Duncan. “While Mr. Maharey had initially said that the Tertiary Education Commission was not to be a representative group, the appointment of a student representative now signals this is no longer the case”.</p>
<p>“The proposed tertiary education reforms will have a significant effect on staff and the establishment of a staff advisory committee, and a staff position on the Board, will provide a greater basis of support for the reform programme”, said Dr Duncan.</p>
