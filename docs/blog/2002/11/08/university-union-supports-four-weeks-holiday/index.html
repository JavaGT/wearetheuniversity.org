<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) today urged all members of the Government to support the call for increased annual holidays for all workers.</p>
<p>Association President, Dr Grant Duncan, said today that the Association believed it timely that Progressive Coalition MP, Matt Robson’s, private member’s Bill which seeks to increase the minimum annual holiday entitlement from three weeks to four is to be considered by Parliament.</p>
<p>“While many university employees presently have four weeks annual leave, there are still some university and many private sector employees who only have the current statutory minimum of three weeks”, said Dr Duncan. “At a time when workloads and productivity are increasing, three weeks is no longer a sufficient holiday entitlement. An average academic staff member now works 53 hours per week, a level which is not sustainable without additional leave.”</p>
<p>Dr Duncan said the Association was concerned by statements attributed to the Associate Minister of Education, Steve Maharey, prior to the general election, that Labour did not want to see holidays increased. In calling on Labour and United Future MPs to support Matt Robson’s bill, Dr Duncan said that employers had shown they could not be relied upon to increase leave entitlements, and it was up to Government to provide that leadership.</p>
