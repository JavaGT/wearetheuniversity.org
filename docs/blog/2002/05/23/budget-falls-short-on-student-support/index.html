<p>Budget Falls Short on Student Support</p>
<p>Auckland University Students Association has welcomed today’s budget announcement of a 4.5% increase in student funding for the next year, but believes the government has much more to do in relieving the debt burden for students.</p>
<p>“While we are elated that the era of massive annual tuition fee increases appears to be over, we had hoped that this budget would see some real movement towards a fairer allowance system,” said AUSA Education Vice-President, Stephanie Thompson.</p>
<p>“It is extremely disappointing that the government has not made any moves towards lowering the age of independence from 25, nor has there been an increase in the parental income levels since the scheme’s inception,” said Ms Thompson.</p>
<p>“Only through increasing access to allowances and lowering tuition fees can the government hope to make any real decreases in student debt,” concluded Ms Thompson.</p>
