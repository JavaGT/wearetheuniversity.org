The meeting coincides with world wide action against GATS.</p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg said the objective of the meeting will be to ensure that education and health, and other public services are excluded from GATS.</p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg said New Zealand’s five education unions and the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions are in a growing company which opposes education being included in GATS. This includes South African and all European Regional Ministers for Culture and Education. Similar opposition has been declared by four associations representing over 5,000 degree-granting universities and colleges in Europe and North America, and by Education International, the world’s main international education trade union body, representing 24.5 million teachers and education personnel.</p>
<p>Dr Rosenberg said that Dr Cullen’s assurances that public education would not be subject to GATS were compromised by New Zealand’s request to other countries to open all sectors of their education to competition. “Already our existing commitments are causing concern and should be revoked”, he said.</p>
