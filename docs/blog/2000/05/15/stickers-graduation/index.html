<p>&quot;The stickers announce a call for the valuing of public education and the protection of the diversity of teaching and research currently undertaken at Massey University. The Association of University Staff (AUS) believes the current &#39;repositioning exercise&#39; does not have the support of staff, is short-sighted and will have a negative impact on students, both past and present,&quot; said AUS spokesperson John Waldon.</p>
<p>&quot;Concerned staff will be leafleting students, their families and friends with information about the &#39;repositioning project&#39; before the ceremonies begin. We think that this presence is in keeping with our University&#39;s role of encouraging debate about important issues. We also hope the stickers will add a bit of colour to the ceremonies&quot; said John Waldon.</p>
<p>&quot;The presence of AUS members, colleagues and graduands and their families who choose to support AUS&#39;s stance will not only add colour to this wonderful occasion but it will also show that there is support for staff during this difficult time,&quot; said John Waldon.</p>
<p>&quot;AUS members at Massey University wish to extend our sincerest congratulations to the high quality and wonderfully diverse range of graduands Massey is currently able to honour, and has the privilege to teach,&quot; said John Waldon.</p>
