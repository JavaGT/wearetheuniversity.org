<p>AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier, acknowledged that Victoria University had been severely penalised by the changes to postgraduate student funding that had been made in the last Budget.</p>
<p>“The present Government, however, is committed to a review of the funding system and will shortly be establishing a Tertiary Education Advisory Commission to assist with such a review.</p>
<p>“The Government has also promised a move away from the competitive market model in tertiary education. The Association therefore challenges Victoria to re-evaluate its priorities and reduce its expenditure on marketing and public relations before cutting the core business of the university,” said Mr Crozier.</p>
