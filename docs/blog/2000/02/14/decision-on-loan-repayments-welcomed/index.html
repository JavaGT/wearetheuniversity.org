<p>The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the Government’s announcement that part-time students on low incomes will qualify for a full write-off on their student loan, if their annual income is lower than $24,596.</p>
<p>“From the inception of the student loan scheme, the Association has been critical of the threshold at which loans repayments commence,” said AUS President, Neville Blampied, in Wellington today.</p>
<p>“The Government’s decision fits well with a philosophy of encouraging life-long learning and retraining for new employment possibilities.”</p>
<p>“Growth in university enrolments has ceased and it is imperative for the future of New Zealand that all aspects of the loan scheme and student allowance provision are re-evaluated, along with Government funding for tertiary education.”</p>
<p>“We see this as the primary task of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission, which the Government has promised to establish,” said Mr Blampied.</p>
