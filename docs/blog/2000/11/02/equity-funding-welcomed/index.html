<p>AUS National President, Neville Blampied, said in Christchurch today that research shows that there has been a decline in participation by these groups as tuition fees have severely impacted on the cost of education during the past decade</p>
<p>“As a small society, struggling to meet the challenge to become a knowledge society, New Zealand cannot afford the loss of talent from any group or sector.</p>
<p>“AUS has, therefore, long been an advocate for properly funded and resourced foundation and bridging programmes, weighted funding and equity monitoring of institutions.”</p>
<p>“As the Minister says, this package recognises the additional costs in providing high quality education to disadvantaged groups.”</p>
<p>“The package therefore represents a good first step in the direction of ensuring that access to tertiary education is facilitated for all prospective students based on their potential to achieve<br>rather than their ability to pay.”</p>
<p>Neville Blampied added that a further major challenge for the government and institutions was to<br>ensure that when students participate in tertiary education, they can do so in a properly resourced<br>system that can achieve quality outcomes in a co-operative and collaborative way.</p>
<p>&quot;That is far from guaranteed under present policy settings and funding arrangements,&quot; Blampied stated.</p>
