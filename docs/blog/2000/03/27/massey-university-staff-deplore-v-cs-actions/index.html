<p>Association of University Staff (AUS) representatives at Massey University have finished a round of consultation with members across all Massey campuses. The meetings, all of which were well-attended, determined that the Vice-Chancellor&#39;s &#39;repositioning&#39; process at the University invites staff to engage in a divisive restructuring exercise.</p>
<p>&quot;Members are voicing their disgust that this &#39;repositioning&#39; will erode the academic integrity of Massey University&#39;s programmes,&quot; said AUS Branch President, Associate Professor Tony Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;We deplore being asked to point the finger at colleagues and label them as &#39;financially non-viable,&#39; and we do not wish to participate in such a process.</p>
<p>&quot;It is also becoming clearer that the demographic and enrolment changes cited by the Vice-Chancellor have been known for some time, yet we are suddenly confronted with &#39;repositioning&#39; in a timeframe that leaves little room for valid long-term planning. While University managers, by their own timeline document, have foreseen falling enrolments for some time, staff were informed about &#39;repositioning&#39; only last week,&quot; said Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;Staff are asking if the University cannot pay its bills, as the Vice-Chancellor implies, why are they spending so much money on expansionism around the country?</p>
<p>&quot;How can Massey staff continue to provide quality academic programmes that fulfil the needs of students and the university in accordance with the new government’s vision for New Zealand’s tertiary education system, when they receive veiled threats of staff cuts and programme reductions?&quot; asked Lewis.</p>
