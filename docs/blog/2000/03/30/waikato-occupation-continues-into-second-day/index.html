Today Fightback! Waikato&#39;s occupation of the registry continues, with the group calling on Labour to put right a sickening history of tertiary education management.</p>
<p>It was Labour who abolished free education in 1988 by increasing administration fees by 80%. It was Labour who gave the rich their biggest tax cut in this nation&#39;s history whilst shamelessly declaring free education impossible.</p>
<p>Labour&#39;s Phil Goff branded university students &#39;middle class&#39; yet excluded the working class from accessing university by bringing in fees in 1990.</p>
<p>The door Labour wedged open was flung aside by National when they hiked fees up even further despite feeble Lockwood Smith&#39;s infamous promise to abolish fees or resign.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence enrolments have dropped every year since 1992. No coincidence that Maori enrolments continue to plunge, despite Maori quotas.</p>
<p>Student loans have added an extra hurdle to working class youth on their road to university education.</p>
<p>This situation is intolerable, more than 324,000 students have racked up over $3.4 billion in dept through loans.</p>
<p>The huge fees mean many don&#39;t ever get into university to start with.</p>
<p>We are sick of being patronised and repressed. After twelve years of silence, Waikato university and polytechnic students are occupying.</p>
<p>Our campaign of joint, rolling occupations of campus&#39; nationwide is intended to press Labour to make real moves towards free education by making it more unaffordable for them to refuse.</p>
<p>For years Labour has turned their back on our plight. We call for them to look us in the face, engage in dialogue and right a sickening history of wrongs.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
