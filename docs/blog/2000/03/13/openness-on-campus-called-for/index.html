<p>“Academic freedom implies free discussion and that can only take place in an open atmosphere. Closed doors are the enemy of free discussion,” said Dr Savage from Ottawa today.</p>
<p>“One of the keys to successfully functioning university governance structures is a vigorous local policy in favour of openness.</p>
<p>“Academic boards should therefore take a lead by investigating how open their university actually is and how openness can be extended in their institution,” he said.</p>
<p>“Academic boards should also actively resist attempts by administrators to impose external speech codes on staff and should play a key role in policing the adoption of performance indicators, particularly those that rely on mindless counting and record-keeping instead of academic judgment.”</p>
<p>“All such indicators should first be approved by the academic board,” said Dr Savage.</p>
