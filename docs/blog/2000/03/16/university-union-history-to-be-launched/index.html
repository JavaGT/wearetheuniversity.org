<p>The publication, Professionals and Unionists, covers the 75–year history of the Association for the period 1923 –1998 and was written by Emeritus Professor Nicholas Tarling of Auckland University, a former National President of the Association.</p>
<p>AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier, said that Parliament has been chosen for the launch because more than 10% of MPs (including the Prime Minister) are ex members of the Association. Former member, the Hon Steve Maharey, now Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, will formally launch the publication.</p>
<p>Rob Crozier said that New Zealand’s union history was an important facet of the nation’s past and he was pleased that the Association had committed itself to commissioning this work.</p>
<p>“The launch comes during a week in which organisations such as ourselves will again have to regroup for the next phase of our existence.”</p>
<p>Note: Professionals and Unionists (132 pp) can be obtained from the Association of University Staff, P.O. Box 11-767, Wellington; price $15 (incl. Gst, p&amp;p)</p>
