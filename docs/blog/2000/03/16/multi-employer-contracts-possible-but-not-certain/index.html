<p>AUS has welcomed the introduction of the Employment Relations Bill as, combined with the Government’s declared intention to make the tertiary education sector operate in a more co-operative way, it provides scope for the real value of staff to the institutions to be recognised.</p>
<p>AUS National President, Neville Blampied, confirmed from Christchurch yesterday that AUS had resolved to develop and implement a national political/industrial strategy on university academic pay and conditions based on national and international relativities.</p>
<p>“This does not automatically translate into negotiations for a multi-employer contract. The proposed select committee inquiry into the resourcing of tertiary education, for example, could have a profound impact on salary levels in the sector.”</p>
<p>“As we understand it, before any multi-employer agreement could be negotiated this would first have to be approved by a majority of employees on each site.”</p>
<p>“AUS is extremely democratic in the way it takes such decisions. Members ultimately determine AUS policy and, as 50% of AUS members are general staff, their views will also be taken into account,” he said.</p>
