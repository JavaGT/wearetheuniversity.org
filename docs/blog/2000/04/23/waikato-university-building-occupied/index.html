<p>Press Release: For immediate use</p>
<p>Fightback! Waikato again controls part of Waikato University.</p>
<p>Last night ninety students stormed the building which houses Campus Services Limited (CSL). CSL is the university&#39;s profit-driven asset management division. More students will be arriving all day.</p>
<p>The lightening strike has been carefully organised to take advantage of slack security and university holidays. The purpose of this occupation is to prove to the university that students have control of campus. The occupation coincides with Fightback!&#39;s national hui. It is being held in the holidays so that students from all around the country could participate. It is a final warning shot to the university, and a practice run for the next phase of rallies and occupations.</p>
<p>Hamilton&#39;s mayor, Russ Rimmington, will visit the students later today to express his support.</p>
<p>The students will control the building for 51 hours, symbolising the number of years it will take an average woman to pay back her student loan.</p>
<p>This raid has been carefully organised, with support already flooding through from around the country. Many campuses are represented in the occupation.</p>
<p>&quot;The market-driven focus of tertiary education providers is unacceptable,&quot; student protester Miriam Bellard stated.</p>
<p>&quot;It is time for students to regain control of what is rightfully ours. We will not sit back and be dictated to anymore. We will not watch idly while universities prostitute themselves for money. We are asserting our control of this, and every campus,&quot; said Ms Bellard.</p>
<p>Anybody is welcome to visit the students.</p>
<p>To show that protesters can have fun too, a rave will be held tonight (using University resources) with guest DJ&#39;s and bands, with every $5 entry donation helping Fightback!</p>
