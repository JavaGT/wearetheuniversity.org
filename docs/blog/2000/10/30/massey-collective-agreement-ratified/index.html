Although staff gained a 1.7% wage increase, this becomes effective upon ratification rather than being backdated to the expiry of the previous contract in July.</p>
<p>Staff were pleased that management finally agreed to their suggestion to further assist those people leaving Massey as a result of the redundancies this year. The University is accordingly establishing an Employment Assistance Fund of $250,000 administered jointly by the Unions and management, to which those leaving can apply for grants of up to $10,000.</p>
<p>&quot;We also got management to withdraw proposed clawbacks in retirement clauses, which we thought was a significant gain given this year&#39;s push to be rid of staff. Management also agreed to a workloads clause that requires workload allocations which are &#39;transparent, equitable, flexible and that promote the wellbeing and safety of staff&#39;,&quot; said newly elected AUS Massey President Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite these gains, 16% of AUS members voted to continue industrial action. This is the highest level of dissent against a settlement with management that we have ever encountered. I think this has to be taken as a message to management that they will encounter stiff demands when this agreement expires a year from now. Staff are still angry about the management style at Massey University, and staff will work toward the collegial model of university governance,&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>
