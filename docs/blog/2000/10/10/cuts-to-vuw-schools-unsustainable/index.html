<p>&quot;We appreciate the need for and desirability of the University achieving a budget surplus,&quot; said Association of University Staff branch spokesperson Guy Reynolds &quot;but we don&#39;t believe the figure of $4M across the schools can be achieved without seriously undermining Victoria&#39;s academic reputation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have already seen cuts over the last year in several of the schools and departments of the Science and Humanities faculties. Early retirements, redundancies, and a rigorous rationalisation of academic, technical and administrative functions in those faculties would suggest there is little or no &#39;fat&#39; left to shed,&quot; said Mr Reynolds. &quot;However, if the University is determined to reduce schools&#39; costs by a further $4M to achieve its projected $3M surplus this will almost certainly result in the loss of around 50-70 jobs, probably including in some cases courses and whole programmes.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Reynolds recognise that the combination of harsh government policies and declining student enrolments are to a certain extent forcing the University&#39;s hand. However, he says that it&#39;s &quot;a bit rich of management to pronounce in their report on the deficit reduction project that the decisions will &#39;not involve a tradeoff between academic quality and revenue generation&#39; when this is currently the proposed fate of the excellently performing Geology department and Antarctic Research Centre&quot;.</p>
<p>He said staff are &quot;utterly dismayed&quot; at the fate of Geology and the Antarctic Research Centre in the wake of the recently completed review of the School of Earth Sciences. &quot;What hope can staff in the rest of the University have for their continued survival,&quot; said Mr Reynolds &quot;if the consistently excellent teaching and research record of Geology staff, and the internationally admired work of the Antarctic Research Centre, can be so readily disregarded by a management who seem to conclude simply, &#39;You cost too much&#39;&quot;.</p>
