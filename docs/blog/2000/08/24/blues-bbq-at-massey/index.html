<p>On Monday 21August, union members came to work dressed in blue. &quot;The action committee chose blue because it is the university’s colour and blue represents how Massey management makes our members feel,&quot; said Combined Union Action Committee speaker, Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually our members feel black and blue these days after months of high-handed treatment from the Vice-Chancellor and his management team. So, tomorrow (Friday 25 August) we are staging a &#39;pump up morale&#39; rally on the University concourse, with balloons, banners, bangers and a blues band, of course,&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>
<p>&quot;Staff feel tossed about by management&#39;s claims that their contract offers constitute a good package. The offers they have touted in the press in reality hold little for the vast majority of Massey staff. Furthermore, these small offers hide significant clawbacks in other areas. Staff think the offer represents nothing more than rearranging the deck chairs on a sinking ship. We need a new captain, one who believes in the expertise and goodwill of his own crew,&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>
