<p>The Association, which is currently making a legal challenge to Massey’s academic decision-making processes in relation to its ‘repositioning’ exercise has been advised that the Academic Committee yesterday passed the following resolution:</p>
<p>If it is determined subsequently that it was the Academic Committee’s role to advise the Academic Board in relation to the repositioning, the Academic Committee supports the advice given to Council by the Academic Board on the repositioning on 21 July, 2000.</p>
<p>AUS President, Neville Blampied, said in Wellington today that this was a cynical move that indicated apparent contempt for Massey’s own procedures.</p>
<p>“This is a sham decision in what has been a very shambolic process,” he said.</p>
<p>The lack of involvement of the Academic Committee earlier in the ‘repositioning’ process is a key factor in the AUS legal challenge that is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>“AUS affirms its belief that universities, when making academic decisions, must scrupulously follow the provisions of the Education Act 1989 and all of the procedures and statutes that the University Council has put in place. The proper role of academic committees and boards in a university is to consider carefully and debate fully the academic merits of proposals and make appropriate recommendations rather than act as a rubber stamp for management decisions,” said Mr Blampied.</p>
