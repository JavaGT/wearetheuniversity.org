The march leaves from Registry Building (main campus) for Hokowhitu campus at 9.00am.</p>
<p>&quot;The unions at Massey University have called stop-work time for Friday morning 9.00-11.00am to convey to the University Council and the wider community how important it is to abandon this divisive restructuring. Albany members are also calling a stop-work meeting and will be linked via teleconference to the University Council meeting at Hokowhitu which starts at 10.00am,&quot; said Association of University Staff (AUS) Branch President, Associate Professor Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;Staff and students will be marching to show solidarity to the 300 plus staff who do not have secure jobs, to protect the quality and diversity of teaching and research at Massey university, to protest the lack of consultation which has damaged staff morale and to insist on the principle of open governance at our public institution,&quot; said Professor Lewis.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not too late for University Council to recover from the damage that the &#39;DEpositioning&#39; project has caused. We urge Council members to consider the legal situation, abandon the proposals before them, and join with their staff and students in a genuine &#39;repositioning&#39; exercise which will move Massey forward and take account of our strengths in the arts and sciences, education and business,&quot; said Professor Lewis.</p>
