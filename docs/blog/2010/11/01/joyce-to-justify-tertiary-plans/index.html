<p>Minister for tertiary education Steven Joyce will give his first public speech to members of the Tertiary Education Union when he addresses their annual conference next week.</p>
<p>In the last year Mr Joyce has often talked about the $11 billion his government is investing to help New Zealanders improve our economic growth and productivity. However, these comments have largely been in his capacity as minister for transport, referring mainly to spending on new roads, rather than in his role as minister for tertiary education. In the latter role he has often said there will not be any significant cash injections in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Delegates at the conference will be eager to hear Mr Joyce explain his introduction of league tables, performance funding, and an overall budget freeze for the tertiary education sector.</p>
<p>He will be speaking to over a hundred delegates from universities, polytechnics, wānanga and other tertiary education institutions and organisations around the country.</p>
<p><strong>Mr Joyce’s presentation will be at the Brentwood Hotel in Kemp St, Kilbirnie, Wellington, at 11.45am on Tuesday 9 November.</strong></p>
<p>Also speaking at the conference will be TEU national president, Dr Tom Ryan (10am Mon 8 Nov), and Australian tertiary education union leaders Jeannie Rea (NTEU president, 3.30pm Mon 8 Nov), Pat Forward (AEU TAFE federal secretary, 9.15am, Tues 9 Nov), and Carolyn Allport (NTEU past president, 2pm, Tues 9 Nov).</p>
<p>Media are welcome to attend any of these speeches.</p>
