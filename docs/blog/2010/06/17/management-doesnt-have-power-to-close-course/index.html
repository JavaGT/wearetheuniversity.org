<p>Massey University management does not have the authority to axe the university&#39;s primary teacher education course in the Hawkes Bay. That is the view of TEU national president Dr Tom Ryan.</p>
<p>Massey is moving to close its Ruawharo teacher training course, forcing students to study extramurally or move to Palmerston North instead. But the union representing university staff, TEU, believes that the university&#39;s decision is not a fait accompli and that its management does not have the authority to make such a decision without first seeking the approval of the university&#39;s council.</p>
<p>The union wrote to the chancellor last week saying that it believes the decision is primarily an &quot;academic matter&quot; as per section 182(2) (a) of the Education Act 1989 and thus a matter for the council to decide, rather than university management.</p>
<p>Dr Ryan says that there have been several similar instances where a management decision to close a course has been overruled by a council after the council ruled that the decision was an academic matter rather than a management one.</p>
<p>&quot;We are requesting that the matter be put before the council,&quot; said Dr Ryan. &quot;And, until the council makes a decision no action should be taken to discontinue delivery of the primary teaching programme from the Ruawharo site in the Hawkes Bay.&quot;</p>
