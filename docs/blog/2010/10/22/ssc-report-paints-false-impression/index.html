<p>The State Services Commissioner&#39;s comments yesterday that there has been a big rise in the number of people earning more than $100,000 a year at universities, wānanga, and polytechnics, and that the sector needs to exercise more restraint, gives a false impression of the what is happening in the sector.</p>
<p>Tertiary Education Union national secretary Sharn Riggs says that ordinary staff in the sector have exercised considerable restraint over the last year and a half.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people working in tertiary education have had pay increases less than the rate of inflation in the 18 months since the economic crisis hit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The commissioner&#39;s report focuses on an increase in the total number of people earning over $100,000. But virtually all general staff across the sector and academics in polytechnics earn nowhere near that amount of money. Even the majority of academics in universities, who operate in a competitive international market, do not get that sort of salary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The State Services Commissioner has used the salaries of highly paid managers in the sector as a justification for proposing pay restraints on a completely different group of workers - on ordinary working people in the tertiary education sector that are earning an average New Zealand salary,&quot; said Ms Riggs.</p>
