VUWSA President Rory Lenihan-Ikin says, ‘Students are telling us the cost of getting to class is so high that they’re skipping class. This is backed by lecturers who have seen their class numbers drop as the cost of living for students grows each year.’</p>
<p>‘Having student fares on public transport is the norm for most major cities around the world, so these policies would bring us a step closer to competing globally for more people to live, study and go on to work in New Zealand,’ says Lenihan-Ikin.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national voice of students in tertiary education. The organisation is governed by students’ associations from universities and polytechnics around the country.</p>
