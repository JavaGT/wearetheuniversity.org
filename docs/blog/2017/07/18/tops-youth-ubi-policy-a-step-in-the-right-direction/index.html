Thirty-five per cent of 18-24 year olds were in provider-based study alone, plus a number from that age group in workplace-based tertiary level education. This suggests that the overall number of young people in tertiary education is considerably more than 30%.</p>
<p>‘Morgan seems to believe that only those at university are engaged in tertiary-study. Yet he forgets that those in polytechnics, wānanga, industry training, community providers and apprenticeships are also engaged in tertiary education.’</p>
<p>Gee calls on TOP engage with students and young people in the development of future policy.</p>
<p>‘While this policy is a start, it must acknowledge the rising living costs faced by students and young people and also speak to their lived experiences. For example, while financial security is a significant factor in the mental health crisis and suicide rate of young people, we know from talking to them that there are also a range of other significant factors, such as the trauma and stress they carry with them, or that they are currently facing in other parts of their lives.’</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national voice of students in tertiary education. The organisation is governed by students’ associations from universities and polytechnics around the country.</p>
