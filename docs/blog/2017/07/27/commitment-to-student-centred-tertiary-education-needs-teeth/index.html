We are also pleased that he is willing to explore developing a framework for tertiary teaching. However, Gee was cautious at suggestions to continue to consider changes to fee regulation and to review the requirement for research-led teaching in degree-level study.</p>
<p>‘Barrier-free, affordable and equitable access to tertiary education needs to be front and centre of any changes to the system. We would expect active engagement and consultation with students on any possible changes to tuition fees or the way we are taught,’ Gee says.</p>
<p>In referring to the Minister’s commitment that tertiary education should meet the needs of industry and employers, NZUSA noted that students’ needs also need to be prioritised.</p>
<p>‘The Minister himself referred to the importance of tertiary education in deepening our understanding of ourselves, our history, the world and finding solutions to our many challenges. Skills that match with the needs of industry are essential, but we must equally prioritise tertiary education’s role as a powerful social lever that transforms the lives of individuals and their communities.’</p>
<p>‘We look forward to working with Government to ensure that tertiary education is working best for students.’</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national voice of students in tertiary education. The organisation is governed by students&#39; associations from universities and polytechnics around the country.</p>
