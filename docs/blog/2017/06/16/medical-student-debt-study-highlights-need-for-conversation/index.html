The first step would be by addressing the rising cost of living for students. Living costs make up a third of the national student loan balance.</p>
<p>‘An immediate step to lessen the burden of student loan debt is to increase access to the Student Allowance, which currently only 33% of students have access to.’</p>
<p>Gee says that, more importantly, a national conversation about student debt needs to take place in order to combat inequality.</p>
<p>‘Loan debt is not just a student issue. Tertiary education is a public good and we owe it to future generations to have a national conversation about student debt and its impact on society.’</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national voice of students in tertiary education. The organisation is governed by students’ associations from universities and polytechnics around the country.</p>
