<p>Today at 4.30pm in Old Government House, Princes Street, Auckland, politicians and candidates from Labour, the Greens and Māori Party will address a public meeting to discuss National’s plans to change the law to funnel public money into private education.</p>
<p>Green Party MP, Denise Roche, Labour’s candidate for Auckland Central, Helen White, and George Ngatai, chair of the Tāmaki Makaurau branch of the Māori Party, will address the meeting. Unfortunately Nikki Kaye, MP for Auckland Central and Minister for Education, is unable to attend due to other commitments.</p>
<p>Other speakers include Will Mathews, AUSA President, Chris Walker, NZEI, David Cooke, Unitec, Sean Sturm, TEU University of Auckland Branch Committee member, and Sandra Grey, national president of the TEU.</p>
<p>The Education (Tertiary Education and Other Matters) Amendment Bill would funnel public money into private tertiary education institutions and undermine quality public education in New Zealand. TEU members and student activists across New Zealand have been coming together to discuss the Bill and write submissions to the Select Committee so the government understands that they can’t quietly sneak through changes which will threaten public, local tertiary education in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Full details of the meeting are:<br>Date: 13th June 2017<br>Time: 4.30 – 5.30pm<br>Venue: Old Government House, Princes Street, Auckland</p>
