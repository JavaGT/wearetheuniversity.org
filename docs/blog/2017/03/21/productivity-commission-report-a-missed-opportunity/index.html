<p>NZUSA is also concerned about the recommendation to abolish University Entrance.</p>
<p>“Students want the certainty of having a target that gets them into a university. Removing it is not in students’ interest.”</p>
<p>Recommending that the Government should adjust fee subsidy rates over time to reduce subsidies (or pay no subsidies) is short-sighted and does not acknowledge the public good of greater participation in tertiary education.</p>
<p>“The suggestion that some courses offer higher returns than others is a big generalisation. For example, applying less of a subsidy to law graduates could incentivise them to work just as commercial lawyers rather than in community law centres, as they struggle to repay their student loan.”</p>
<p>NZUSA, however, welcomes the Commission’s call for better career education for school students.</p>
<p>“Good, consistent career information and guidance for school students is severely lacking. Improving career education helps all students from all backgrounds get a better understanding of what qualifications they need to achieve their dreams.”</p>
<p>“The Productivity Commission proposes deregulation to support innovation, but by doing so it fails to protect, let alone enhance, student interests in tertiary education.”</p>
