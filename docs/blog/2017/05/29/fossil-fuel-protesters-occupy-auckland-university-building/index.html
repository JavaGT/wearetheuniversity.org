<p>Fourteen students started a sit-in at 8am today to demand the Vice-Chancellor publicly support their call for divestment.</p>
<p>Campus security locked the students in the reception area to prevent other students joining them.</p>

<p>Speaking from behind a locked glass door, group spokesperson Alex Johnston said about 1.5 percent of the university&#39;s $120 million investment fund was in companies with fossil fuel interests.</p>
<p>Though it was a small amount, divestment would signal to the fossil fuel industry that its business model was &quot;no longer compatible with our futures&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;This is something that&#39;s a really easy step for the university to take, to show that it takes climate change seriously.&quot;</p>
<p>In a statement, a spokesperson said the university itself didn&#39;t hold any investments in fossil fuel companies, and it had no jurisdiction over the University Foundation, which manages its own funds, mostly for educational charitable purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;However, we are aware that the Foundation&#39;s investment managers are signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement said the university&#39;s specific objectives of seeking to reduce energy consumption, wastewater, waste to landfills and carbon dioxide emissions would &quot;make a direct, rather than token, contribution to environmental sustainability.&quot;</p>
<p>Students had a right to voice their views but protests should be peaceful and not disrupt the normal activities of staff and students, it said.</p>
