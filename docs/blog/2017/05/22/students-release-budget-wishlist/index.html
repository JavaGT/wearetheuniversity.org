<p>Replace it with an Australian-style progressive repayment system so that those on lower incomes pay less and can have enough take home pay to survive.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Restore postgraduate allowances.</strong> The cut has hurt New Zealanders who should be supported to research and innovate, and is especially significant as teaching qualifications shift to Masters level</p>
<p>5. <strong>Raise the parental income threshold on Student Allowance.</strong> Only 30% of student have access to the Allowance. Raise the threshold to a reasonable rate so fewer students graduate with unmanageable debt.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Restore the national significance exceptions on Student Allowance.</strong> Make an exception to the 200-week limit on Allowances, by restoring a category of qualifications of national significance. This would support student pursuing qualifications such as medicine, optometry, dentistry and veterinary science.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Restore full access for over-40s to Student Allowances and Allowances and Loans for over-65s.</strong> Many New Zealanders enter tertiary education later in life to upskill and retrain. Don’t discriminate against them purely because of their age.</p>
<p>8. <strong>Lift the course-related costs loan cap.</strong> This has been frozen at $1000 since 1993. Students are getting into bank and credit card debt just to pay for basics like upfront hall costs and necessary educational materials.</p>
<p>NZUSA is the national voice of students in tertiary education. The organisation is governed by students’ associations from universities and polytechnics around the country.<br><strong>ENDS</strong></p>
