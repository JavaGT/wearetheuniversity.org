<p>AUS National President, Neville Blampied, said in Wellington today that the Association considered that TEAC’s recommendation that there be a review of the various cost categories which establish the basis on which institutions are funded was an absolute imperative for the Government.</p>
<p>“The categories were established at the beginning of the 1990s and have been cut regularly since then,” said Mr Blampied.</p>
<p>“It is an acknowledged fact that these cuts have resulted in a fall in the value of course funding of more than 20% in real terms over the past decade. There is a need to inject substantial new resources into tertiary education in New Zealand if we are to catch the knowledge wave.</p>
<p>“It is vitally important, therefore, for the Government to commit itself to giving this review priority and commencing it as soon as is practicable. In our view, this task could begin immediately under the supervision of the Transition Tertiary Education Commission,” he said.</p>
<p>“Finally, we warmly congratulate the Commission for recognising the importance of staff in the tertiary sector – a welcome change after a decade of neglect by previous Governments.”</p>
