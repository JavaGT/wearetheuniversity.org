Each University Council has until 31 August to accept or reject the Government&#39;s budget offer to Universities.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that our Vice-Chancellor is on public record as saying the Government offer means either increasing student fees by 27% or cutting $11.5 million in expenditure for 2002, AUS foresees a year of staff and student unrest at Massey campuses,&quot; said AUS Massey Branch President, Dr Karen Rhodes.</p>
<p>&quot;Our past experience, if the choice means cuts, shows that those cuts will come primarily from the Palmerston North campuses which have already seen three years of steady staff cuts. Massey is bleeding. That means students are bleeding too and will bleed more if the choice is a fee rise to them,&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>
<p>&quot;Students are already overburdened with debt and having to take part-time jobs in order to study; staff have for years been absorbing higher workloads with fewer resources. With staff pay not even meeting inflation over the last ten years much less keeping pace with international colleagues, is it any wonder we are asking the Government to join with staff, students and management in some compromise to their funding offer?&quot; said Dr Rhodes.</p>
