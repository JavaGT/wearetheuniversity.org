<p>“For over a decade institutions have been financially rewarded for going into direct competition with each other. This has ultimately been a waste of both taxpayer and student funds,” said Ms Thompson. “In a small country like New Zealand, that is economic suicide.”</p>
<p>“Clearly, the secret to success in a modern economy is through a rational and planned approach to the provision of Tertiary Education, for which this report lays down the foundations”</p>
<p>While the TEAC report sets out a pathway for sensible reforms these will all be in vain if the Government does address levels of funding in Tertiary Education.</p>
<p>“You cannot expect the Tertiary education sector to perform like a BMW when the funds only allow for a Mini,” concluded Ms Thompson.</p>
