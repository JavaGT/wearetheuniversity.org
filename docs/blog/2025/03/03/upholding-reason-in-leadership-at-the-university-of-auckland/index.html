Important discussions are happening at today’s senate meeting. <strong>We hope you will be in attendance 1:30-4:30pm @ UoA ClockTower.</strong></p><p>While key issues discussed may pertain to specific schools and faculties, those same issues are small pieces of a much larger pattern, which pertains to us all. We have written here some key points that We Are The University believe need to be considered regarding the management strategies at this university.</p><p>Universities are built on the shared commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and truth for all. From these goals we derive commitment to the democratic principles of transparency and the recognition of diverse knowledge freely exchanged between peoples across academic traditions and disciplines. Such principles are not confined to any single discipline but are the bedrock of academic life. Ongoing failure of the university administration to realise these values in their decision making processes create serious concern about the direction of this university. Amongst academics, views on key issues regarding the short-term direction of the university differ – issues such as the Curriculum Framework Transformation and the rapid Law and Business School merger. Long-term, many more of us are in agreement; the values and processes which are guiding our institution at the highest level are not fit for purpose.</p><p>Students and staff have been gaining the courage to vocalise their lack of confidence in some of the poorly formed and fast-tracked plans of the administration, such as rapidly cutting significant numbers of small courses from the curriculum. It is apparent in the shift towards bad-faith tactics that the administration is aware of their lack of academic capital to lean/stand on in regards to proposed changes, such as the CFT transformation-adjacent course cuts. Such tactics mediate their engagement with students and staff, and the ability of students and staff to engage in return. These ministry-of-truth style strategies manipulate the narrative around what forecasted problems require addressing (if identified at all), what solutions are desired by students and staff, and if there is any reasoning at all informing their proposed solutions.</p><p>When the university administration bypasses the democratic participation of the senate, misrepresents submission data, or obscures information, they undermine the very foundations of intellectual integrity and reasoned decision-making that define a university. Such actions erode trust and compromise the university&#39;s ability to fulfill its missions in education and research. Along the way it dramatically lowers the standard of integrity below that which excellent research requires.</p><p>Below are just a handful examples from recent key issues where these bad-faith tactics are being used by management. Individually these examples are unacceptable mistakes, collectively they show a pattern of values eroding the <strong>academic authority</strong> of our institution.</p><p>Despite diverse views on any individual action (rightly so), there is common recognition of faulty values and mechanisms for decision making guiding this university, and that unites us despite any differences in opinion on individual issues. We expect reasoned and just processes managing our university, process informed by fact, research, and which represents the collective expertise of this incredible academe. Leading the university administration, Dawn’s predecessor, Stuart McCutcheon, was not universally agreed with either – that is an impossible achievement. But he was not dishonest about his intentions and would face the music of his decisions.</p><p>Just as academics recognise the importance of reasoned methods in science and research, we recognise the importance of reasoned and just process in leadership and governance. We call on the administration to recommit to the principles of shared governance, open dialogue, and evidence-based decision-making. A university thrives when it fosters collaboration, respects its community, and prioritizes truth over unjustified expediency. It is time to restore trust, ensure accountability, and safeguard the democratic processes that are the foundation of academic excellence and institutional integrity.</p><h4 id="what-you-can-do"><strong>What You Can Do</strong></h4><p>While your participation, votes, and actions are up to you, we suggest a serious consideration of the governance of this institution and the expectations you have for New Zealand’s leading university. Whether or not you agree with our claims, you are needed at the senate meeting today. It is important that despite any attempts to undermine representation, that staff are heard, at the very least by each other. <strong>Please attend the senate meeting today</strong> <strong>1:30-4:30pm @ UoA ClockTower.</strong></p><p>A copy of this letter will be available on <a href="http://wearetheuniversity.org/blog/2025/03/03/upholding-reason-in-leadership-at-the-university-of-auckland">our website</a>, this is where any updates, corrections, additions etc will be posted. Feel free to reply to this email. Feel free to share broadly and discuss with peers.</p><h3 id="examples-of-bad-faith-tactics-employed-by-university-management"><strong>Examples of bad-faith tactics employed by university management</strong></h3><ol><li><h5 id="manipulatinghiding-reference-data--poor-research-practices"><strong>Manipulating/hiding reference data &amp; poor research practices</strong></h5><ol><li>According to the Vice-Chancellor’s email to members of the Faculty of Law on 27th February; the proposed changes are “A common structure internationally”. This statement and its basis, the Review Committee Report, are misleading, it is not common in institutions which are truly the University of Auckland Law Faculty’s peers, in ranking and national significance, to be merged with their Business School – this data was selected carefully and has now misinformed students, staff and public media. Such misleading statements were not effectively reasoned or discussed after the November announcements which, making such misinformation resemble more categorically disinformation. Had such flawed rationale been presented with the proposal, the full community of scholars could have checked the analysis botched so badly by the administration.</li></ol></li><li><h5 id="minimising-the-capacity-of-students-staff--research-teams"><strong>Minimising the capacity of students, staff &amp; research teams</strong></h5><ol><li>The timing of senate meetings.<ol><li>Previous senate meeting for the discussion &amp; vote of the CTF was put the week after it was requested, during mid-semester break when staff were less likely to be on campus. Proxy voting was disallowed, as was online attendance.</li><li>This senate meeting for the law-business merger discussion &amp; vote was pushed back a week, into the first day of teaching when fewer people will be able to attend due to new students &amp; teaching obligations.</li></ol></li><li>Only giving schools 1-2 weeks notice to recommend classes eligible for cuts in order to compensate for logistical and financial mismanagement.</li><li>Lacking open mechanisms for direct, rather than derived, student voice on course offerings and similar.</li></ol></li><li><h5 id="lying-to-students-about-normal-course-review-processes--refusing-to-engage-with-staff"><strong>Lying to students about normal course review processes &amp; refusing to engage with staff</strong></h5><ol><li>At the student-led open forum on August 22nd 2024 the discussion centered on the fast-tracked approach to course cuts coming from a top-down directive from management. The provost, who attended after students proposed pamphleting attendees of the upcoming open day, lied to students and said that this approach to course ‘review’ was normal, despite the normal process involving a three-year review cycle which was not yet due. This lie conveniently covers information unfamiliar to students who typically churn through university in less than four years. On the day the lie was unchallenged, but was highlighted by the provost Valorie Linton’s unprovoked statement that she would not answer questions from staff.</li></ol></li><li><h5 id="misrepresenting-the-feedback-of-students-staff--research-teams"><strong>Misrepresenting the feedback of students, staff &amp; research teams</strong></h5><ol><li>Vice Chancellor Dawn Freshwater’s email to members of the Faculty of Law on 27th February had misleading language, “The report acknowledges key concerns raised during consultation and proposes refinements to the original proposal. Based on this, and subject to University Council approval, I am inclined to accept the Committee’s recommendations.” This language obscures that the report mentioned does not recommend that the merger proceed, it merely seeks to minimise harm if university management is to proceed with the merger despite all the negative feedback they’ve received.</li></ol></li><li><h5 id="rationale-last-approach"><strong>Rationale-last approach</strong></h5><ol><li><p>University management’s rationale-last approach is evident in the same Law-Business merger report which suggests articulating the rationale (implicitly, developing rationale) and addressing the concerns of students, which would be significantly subdued had any considered rationale been provided.</p></li><li><p>At the student-led open forum on August 22nd 2024 students identified the differences in rationale provided to different schools for the rapid course cuts (financial limitations, logistical limitations, staff workload issues, and that students want less choice), after which they were presented an entirely new justification, that this was supposedly normal process.</p></li><li><p>Finally, Dawn notes (Law-Business merger email again) “change is necessary” and the global forces of “new technology, changing job markets and evolving government priorities” somehow implicitly demand the merging of faculties. Once again the absolute disconnection of cause and effect, need and solution, are on display and instead, reading critically and considering the audience of this message (members of the Faculty of Law), and the seemingly random statement – this is evidently either change for change’s sake (or managerial CV building), or it is a poorly veiled threat against opponents of the merger intending to undermine their efforts to continue fighting this unnecessary reform.</p></li></ol></li></ol></section><section class="footer"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></section></body>
