<p><a href="https://lawnews.nz/administrative-public/uni-council-takes-law-school-merger-off-the-agenda/">Uni council takes law school merger off the agenda –  for now</a></p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The University of Auckland has delayed a crucial vote on merging its law and business faculties following backlash over plans to discuss the matter in secret. Initially, the university council, led by Vice-Chancellor Dawn Freshwater, intended to hold a private meeting to consider the merger, sparking criticism from Law School staff, students, alumni, and legal professionals, including The Law Association of New Zealand (TLANZ). They argued the issue was of significant public interest and should be debated openly.</p>
<p>After pressure, Freshwater reversed her stance and proposed a public discussion, but due to insufficient time to prepare updated agenda papers, the vote was postponed. The university’s senate had already rejected the merger proposal by a large margin, and a review committee failed to fully support it. Critics view the merger as a takeover by the business school rather than an equal partnership, fearing it could harm the Law School’s reputation and lead to the loss of experienced academics.</p>
<p>TLANZ and others criticized the university’s lack of transparency and flawed consultation process, arguing that an open debate would not compromise privacy or negotiations. The Tertiary Education Union (TEU) has not ruled out legal action if the merger is approved, and major donors have reportedly expressed concerns. Critics also highlighted the lack of evidence or cost-benefit analysis supporting the merger.</p>
<p>The review committee suggested modifications to make the proposal more acceptable, such as maintaining the autonomy of academic programs and preserving the Law School’s identity. However, opposition remains strong, with fears the merger could undermine the faculty’s standing as New Zealand’s top legal education institution.</p>
