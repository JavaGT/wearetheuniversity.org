     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend student leaders from across Aotearoa
</code></pre>
<p>attended NZUSA’s annual Student Voice Summit, held in
partnership with Te Mana Ākonga, Tauira Pasifika, NZISA and
the National Disabled Students’ Association.</p><p>This
years’ Summit was the first to be attended by both the
University and Polytechnic sectors, and signals NZUSA’s
desire to bring the tertiary sector together to share best
practice and collaborate on solving the significant issues
that our students face.</p><p>NZUSA National President
Andrew Lessells says that “This weekend’s Student Voice
Summit has been a huge success. We were bold and ambitious
in our planning, bringing the Universities and Polytechnics
together, in a way that has never been done
before”.</p><p><br>“COVID-19 certainly threw a spanner
in the works, but we ended up with an online two-day Summit
that was the largest event that NZUSA has held in a decade.
Over 120 student representatives and tertiary sector leaders
attended the Summit and shared their views on how we can be
bold and redefine the education system to truly put learners
at the centre”.</p><p>The keynote speaker at the Summit
was the Minister of Education Chris Hipkins, who spoke of
his vision for the education system and was presented with
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.students.org.nz/whiria-nga-rau"><i>Whiria
Ngā Rau: Progressing from Student Voice to
Partnership</i></a><i>, </i>a framework designed by
learners, as a gift to the tertiary sector.</p></p>

<p>At the end
of the second day, student leaders developed definitions of
what the <i>Tertiary Education Strategy’s</i> primary
objective of <i>“learners at the centre” </i>means to
them. NZUSA is compiling this voice to help tertiary
institutions truly understand how learners want them to
embed the <i>TES</i> objectives into decision making and
governance.</p><p>Te Mana Ākonga Tumuaki Takirua Nkhaya
Paulsen-More says “Having tauira come together from all
across the tertiary sector was incredible to see. We were
privileged to hear from a variety of student leaders over
the Summit, and are excited to welcome our incoming tauira
in their new roles as we help them develop their skills and
look forward to the next Summit.”</p><p>NZUSA and its
partners will be creating ongoing professional development
opportunities for student leaders based on the discussions
held at the Student Voice
Summit.</p>
