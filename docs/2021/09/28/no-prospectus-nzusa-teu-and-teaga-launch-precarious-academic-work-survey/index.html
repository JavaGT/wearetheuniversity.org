<p>The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations
    (NZUSA), Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and representatives
    from the Tertiary Education Action Group Aotearoa (TEAGA)
    have launched a joint Precarious Academic Work
    Survey.</p>
<p>The survey is part of the joint campaign,
    ‘No Prospect[u]s’, aimed at bringing about awareness of
    tertiary staff working in casualised academic labour with
    the collective aim of improving the lives of academic staff
    and increasing opportunities for full-time work.</p>
<p>The
    campaign comes at a time where many students and early
    career researchers are facing uncertainty in their
    employment. Postgraduates employed by New Zealand’s
    tertiary education institutes often work on part-time,
    fixed-term or casual contracts that do not reflect the level
    of skill and time required, to effectively carry out the
    responsibilities that are associated with academic work. A
    recent survey conducted by the Otago Tutors and
    Demonstrators’ Network found only 35% of tutors were paid
    for preparing for a tutorial or demonstration.</p>
<p>“With
    large numbers of postgraduate and early career researchers
    in debt, and with minimal academic work opportunities due to
    COVID and a greying academy, casualisation is becoming
    increasingly common” says NZUSA’s National Education
    Officer, Ellen Dixon.</p>
<p>Dixon, a Doctoral Scholar from
    Victoria University of Wellington, says that “postgrads
    and post-docs are taking on multiple casual contracts at
    their provider because they are in debt. They have minimal
    access to resources, are labeled “half-staff”, and are
    often not remunerated for all of their hours. Many also
    suffer from mental health and general illness issues due to
    workplace stress. This is just not good enough”.</p>

<p>The
    survey is a result of work carried out over a number of
    months by NZUSA, TEU and TEAGA - with researchers from
    across Aotearoa - and aims to provide mechanisms to empower
    precarious workers in sharing their experiences and pushing
    for change.</p>
<p>Chair of TEAGA and Doctoral Scholar at the
    University of Auckland, Luke Oldfield, says “this survey
    is about establishing what those at the coalface view the
    tertiary sector as, and what the future of an academic
    career looks like in our universities. Until now, policy
    makers are relying on guess work as to determine the size
    and scope of precarity in the university sector. This is our
    chance to rectify that”.</p>
<p>The survey will run until
    October 22nd, 2021.</p>
<p>An interim report from the survey
    will be tabled in the first week of December.</p>
