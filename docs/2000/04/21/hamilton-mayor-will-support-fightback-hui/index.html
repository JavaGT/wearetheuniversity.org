MAYOR OF HAMILTON AND ALLIANCE COUNCILLOR TO SHOW SUPPORT AND SOLIDARITY WITH THE "HUI IN HAM" FOR FREE EDUCATION</p><p>PHOTOSHOOT 1.30pm SATURDAY 22nd APRIL</p><p>The Mayor of Hamilton, Russ Rimmington, will support the Fightback Hui in Hamilton this weekend. The "Hui in Ham" is uniting student activists from all over New Zealand, building on last months wave of occupations and rallies that rocked campuses nationwide. Over the course of the weekend, delegates will be comparing experiences and tactics, and will hammer out the strategy for the next round of action to win their demands for Free Education, the Abolition of Student Fees and Debt, and the replacement of the discredited WINZ loans scheme with a Universal Student Living Allowance.</p><p>"We debated Steve Maharey on the Waikato campus a fortnight ago, and he promised us gradual change within the next three terms of government. That's another decade of loans, debt and student poverty, and we are not prepared to condemn another generation to the problems we face today" said Fightback spokesperson Joe Carolan.</p><p>"The support that our Mayor Russ Rimmington and Alliance Councillor Dave Mc Pherson are giving to the Hui in Ham, shows that there is huge support for Fightback's demands in the wider community. We have said that we are not just fighting for ourselves- Education should be a right for everyone in the community, regardless of class or income, and not just a privilege for the wealthy few. User Pays discriminates against those who cannot afford high debt, and present government reforms are pitiful."</p><p></p><p>"Our movement has grown stronger and gained more support since the wave of occupations and actions at the end of March. The Hui this weekend will look at ways we can translate this huge amount of passive support into action and results. We have gathered thousands of names on our petitions for Free Education, that support nationwide simultaneous occupations to abolish loans, fees and debt. The government was warned by the last round, now we are preparing for the major battle ahead."</p><p>"At the end of this conference, we hope to have the activists and organisers necessary to occupy and close the financial centres of all the campuses nationwide. This is the only way students can take strike action against a system that has ignored our calls for change. We appeal to students, parents and the wider community to support us when this happens. In the words of the Manic Preachers song...</p><p>"If you tolerate this, then your children will be next".</p><p>ENDS</p><p>Photoshoot at 1.30pm, SATURDAY 22nd APRIL Contact Joe Carolan at 025 6169177 Contact Russ Rimmington at Hamilton City Council Contact Dave Mac Pherson at Alliance, Hamilton<br></p><p></p></section><section class="footer"><ul><li><a href="/">Home</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li></ul></section></body>
