<p>The Fightback Hui in Ham brought together over sixty
activists from all over  Aotearoa, to plan the next phase in
the fight for Free Education.  Activists  from Auckland
University, AUT, the University of Waikato, Victoria 
University, Waikato Polytech, Massey and Canterbury met over
the Easter  weekend, and reconfirmed the 10 goals of the
national campaign first put forward in Wellington.  These
are-</p>

<p>1.  Free Education for all by taxing the rich (top
5%) and corporates.<br>2.  Universal Student Living
Allowances.<br>3.  The scrapping of all student debt.<br>4. 
Immediate reinstatement of the emergency unemployment
benifit.<br>5.  An end to the Privatisation Agenda on
campus.<br>6.  Democratic control of tertiary institutions
by student and staff.<br>7.  Adequate government funding to
tertiary providers.<br>8.  Adequate research funding not
controlled by corporates.<br>9.  No cops on campus.<br>10.
Removal of all non financial barriers, including, but not
limited     to women, Maori, Pacific Islanders,
international, queer and     disabled students.</p>

<p>The Hui
resolved to take two days of action in the upcoming months
to bring  our demands to the local Labour party and the
national Labour led  government.  After the recent debate
with Fightback on the Waikato campus, Education Minister
Steve Maharey admitted that Labour MPs had beifitted from 
free education themselves and had not entered the workplace
with huge debts.    We want to bring this to national
attention and to make clear to the  government that this
generation of students will not wait for an undefined
"gradual change" within "the next three terms of government"
(Maharey's  words).   In effect, this is an admission by
Labour that students can expect  another 9 years of debt,
loans and fees- another decade of the problems we face
today.<p>
<p>The first National Day of Action for Free Education
will take place on the 31st of May.  In addition to raising
the 10 demands, we will be calling for  the immediate
sacking of Christine Rankin, the scrapping of the WINZ loans
scheme, and stressing the need for a Universal Student
Living Allowance and  the restoration of emergency benifit
for students during holidays.  "Sack Rankin Day" will look
for wider support from the trade unions, community
assocations, campus staff and local city councils.  Rallies
on campus will march to local Labour Party offices, with
Wellington to march on the  Beehive.</p>

<p>The government and
Labour Party will be given time to respond- we will make  it
clear that we are coming back for concrete action and
answers. Campuses on the North Island will Hui on the
1st/2nd of July, campuses on the South Island on the
8th/9th, to consider the response. A second National Day of
Action has been agreed for the 26th of July.  It is
envisaged that if there  is no change in position by then,
we will go into nationwide occupation.</p>

<p>Over the next
phase, Fightback will be involved in an intensive education
campaign on the local campuses, holding teach ins,
organising campaign  stalls several times a week, signing up
new members, and taking our message  onto the Polytechs. 
The nationwide petition for the ten demands will gather 
thousands more signatures in support of free education, and
we will hold weekend stalls in town and city centres to
enlist community support.   Alliance and Green MPs and
Councillors who support free education will be asked to come
on the National Days of Action, and to join students in the
next wave of occupations.</p>

<p>We hope that the next wave of
occupations, O2, will involve 500 to 1000  students per
campus.  Polytechs will be joining us in the next wave.  We
will also be petitioning staff unions to call for
sympathetic industrial action in support of Free
Education.</p>

<p>Many people voted Labour to get National out. 
They did not vote Labour for  a continuation of National
education policies.  We will work with this huge  mandate
for change and put concrete demands on Labour, rights that
many of their MPs enjoyed during their student days.  The
ACT party estimates the cost of Free Education at 450
million dollars per year.  This sum can easily  be raised by
taxing the corporations and the ultra rich a mere percentage
point extra in tax.</p>

<p>Be reasonable- Demand the
Possible</p>
