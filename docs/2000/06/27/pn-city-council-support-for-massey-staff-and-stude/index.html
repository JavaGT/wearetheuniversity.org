of University Staff (AUS) members, led by National
President, Neville Blampied, and Massey Branch President,
Tony Lewis, attended the Palmerston North City Council
meeting on Monday evening (26th June). They were supported
by a large number of Massey University staff. The delegation
spoke in support of a recommendation from the Council's City
Development Committee that the Council had a leadership role
with respect to the Massey "repositioning" and should seek
briefings from Massey management, and from staff, students
and other groups on the proposals and their
impact.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Council, Neville Blampied said
“Any city or region which wished to prosper in the knowledge
society/information economy of the 21st century needs to
build deep and wide links with their local university.” He
pointed out to the Council that both were public
institutions, with clear responsibilities to their
communities, and both would benefit from working together to
meet current challenges.<p>

<p>“AUS asked the City Council to
support a very reasonable, commonsense resolution of the
university staff, asking the University management and
University Council to defer any further action on the
planned ‘repositioning’ until the Tertiary Education
Advisory Commission had reported to the Government on the
strategic direction of the sector,” Neville Blampied
said.<p>
<p>Supporting the AUS claim that the scale of the
proposed Massey University redundancies was unprecedented
for a New Zealand University, Tony Lewis gave details of
heavy cuts proposed for staff in science, applied science,
social science and humanities subjects. “Staff are convinced
that there are effective alternative ways to solve the
University’s current problems. Staff need time and support
to work through these alternative ideas,” he said.”</p>

<p>After
lively debate the City Council passed five resolutions, all
indicating concern with the social and economic impact of
the Massey University “repositioning”, and committing the
Council to express its concerns directly to Massey
University Management and Council. The Council resolved to
"invite" the university to consider delaying the
"repositioning" until after the TEAC report had been
considered by the Government.<p>

<p>Speaking after the meeting,
Neville Blampied said, “This is a very positive development.
The University can treat the City Council’s interest as a
threat or an opportunity. It should be treated as an
opportunity for the two organisations, each with a vital
role in their communities, to work together long-term for
the good of the city and its people, the region and its
economy, and the university and its staff and
students.”</p>
