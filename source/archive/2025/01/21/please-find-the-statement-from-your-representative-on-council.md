Kia ora, my name is Fa and I am your student representative on the University Council for 2025.

I'm making this video to fulfill my campaign pledge to ensure robust communication and promotion of relevant council business.

This video is dedicated to the proposed merger of the law and business faculties.

These comments are made in a private capacity and are not to be interpreted as a representation on behalf of the university itself.

As many students will know, there is a proposal for a merger of the law school and business faculty.

The proposal and necessary information is linked below or in my bio as well as a copy of documents released in response to an official information request.

There is some key information I would like to point out. The consultation period is now closed.

This is only a proposal. No decision has been formally made.

I had met with senior staff at the end of last year to discuss the proposal on an informal basis.

I am sure there are some strong feelings about this proposal among students and members of the wider university community.

I am encouraging you now to channel these feelings into the consultation process in good faith if you haven't already done so.

Treat your submission as an academic exercise with reason, thought-out responses.

The attacking senior staff, myself or other university officials is pointless.

This proposal will be scrutinized by other parts of the university if it gets that far.

Including scrutiny from our academic board, the Senate, as required by law.

Finally coming to the board table if it gets to that point in March for the scrutiny of members on council, of which I am a member.

I make the phrase "if the proposal gets to that point" as management may decide to not proceed with the proposal at any point during the process.

Such a decision would be based on the advice they may receive from the various groups such as the initial review committee, the Senate and finally my council.

You can observe the proceedings of the Senate and of council during parts of the meetings which the public has not explored it.

I encourage you to do this as you can hold me to account at council and other student leaders who are on the Senate.

The Official Information Act is very much a tool for you to seek further information.

However to streamline and organize I would suggest you use the FYI website or ask the relevant student associations to make those requests on your behalf.

Ultimately such requests can be given to you, go allowing the university ample time to respond appropriately.

I have my own opinions on this proposal as I am like any other human being.

However I will be keeping those opinions private until this business reaches the council's agenda in March if it gets that far.

I want to state unequivocally that I remain open to what might be presented at any council meeting.

This is because of the legal duties placed on me as a member of the council.

This does add an element of complexity to issues on which students have strong opinions.

Rest assured I will be bringing your voice to the table.

I was very upfront about that complexity when I ran for this office last June.

I know students will respond that this is a cop out.

However I am listening.

I continue to monitor what students are saying online.

I have been reading public comments made by alumni and other professional groups.

I have my ear to the ground listening to the critics.

To my knowledge I am the only student representative on council to give you such a robust update and making myself as accessible as possible.

I am also happy to hear from students directly about the proposal and you can do that by emailing me or DMing me through Instagram.

I will also be releasing dates in which you can speak with groups or individuals as part of what I am terming councilor clinics.

You can speak with me on high level issues council should be informed about.

This is not limited to the merger proposal.

I will also provide clear guidelines on what I can do during these sessions.

It is important to note that any comment you provide to me does not form part of the official consultation that the review committee will consider.

Please be on mind that if I cannot answer questions about the substance of the proposal due to the legal duties I cited earlier,

I can explain at a high level how the council functions which might be of some use to you.

I want to thank other student leaders for their advocacy, especially those within AULSS, AUCSA and AUSA,

as well as other unofficial groups such as We Are The University.

The recent Q&A court at all with the Deputy Vice Chancellor of Operations and Director of Academic and Student Services highlights the quality of our other student leaders.

I commend them for having a respectful conversation and asking tough questions on behalf of students.

I too will be asking similar questions if the proposal comes to the council.

You will see more videos from me about how the council works and the duties that I am subject to later in the year.

I hope you will remain safe during your summer break.

If you are taking courses through summer school, I wish you well.
