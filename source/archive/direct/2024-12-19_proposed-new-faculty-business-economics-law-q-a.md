# Staff-focused Q&A on proposed new faculty arrangements: Business and Economics, Law

Updated 19 December 2024

### Will combining the faculties impact the rankings of either the Auckland Law School or the University of Auckland Business School?

<sub>(added 19 December 2024)</sub>

The planned merger will not have any direct impact on subject rankings. International subject rankings are not defined by internal faculty or department structures. They take into consideration research outputs in subject-defined journals and conferences, citations, individual researcher performance and honours (such as highly cited researchers and award winners), and university reputation voting.  
  
In effect, staff in the current Law School and in Commercial Law who publish in Law aligned Elsevier-indexed publications are already contributing to the Law subject ranking.

### Why does the proposal include a Dean of Law when other schools in the University do not?

<sub>(added 21 November 2024)</sub>

The requirement for a Dean of Law is set out in the [Law Practitioners Act 1982 – Part 2 (s31(2)(d))](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0123/latest/DLM62817.html). This role includes key responsibilities such as liaising with the Council of Legal Education, the Law Society, and other professional bodies.

### Why does the proposal suggest creating two departments within the Auckland Law School instead of a single department?

<sub>(added 21 November 2024)</sub>

The proposal reflects the scale and complexity of a combined law school, which if established, would include academics from the current Faculty of Law and the Department of Commercial Law – resulting in around 70 academic staff, with the potential for growth following the introduction of the [Juris Doctor](https://www.calendar.auckland.ac.nz/en/progreg/regulations-law/jd.html) and elevating postgraduate programmes across both faculties.

While there are similar-sized schools elsewhere in the University, the Dean of Law carries additional responsibilities, including extensive internal and external functions and serving on the executive of the combined faculty. Establishing two departments would ensure academic staff receive the necessary mentoring and support while enabling the Dean to be supported by a Deputy Dean of Law, who would lead the second department.

### Why is the University proposing to combine the faculties of Business and Economics, and Law?

A combined faculty aims to leverage the strengths of both faculties, creating a larger academic community that enhances research support, enables postgraduate growth, leverages complementary strengths and offers expanded opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. This proposed structure would align more closely with other faculties in size and capacity, creating a foundation for future strategic impact and resilience.

### What benefits would this proposed combined structure provide for research activities?

By joining Business and Economics with Law, the faculty would broaden its research networks and expand access to donor-funded research centres. For both faculties, this proposal offers a more extensive network of research support, collaboration, and mentorship. Law academics would have increased opportunities to work alongside business experts on interdisciplinary projects, while Business and Economics staff would gain insights from legal scholars, helping to tackle complex issues across sectors. This alignment strengthens the University’s standing as a hub of innovation and research excellence.

### How would the proposed combined faculty impact existing support structures for research?

The proposed new arrangement is designed to streamline resources and support structures, making research funding and support more accessible across all areas of Law and Business. Economies of scale would allow the combined faculty to provide enhanced research support and funding opportunities for academic staff across disciplines.

### Would this proposed change affect my role as an academic staff member in terms of reporting lines or departmental structure?

Specific details on any departmental, reporting-line changes for academic staff would be communicated in any further phases if new faculty arrangements are established. Our goal is to ensure that any changes enhance collaboration and support across both faculties.

### Would Law be represented in the proposed new faculty’s name?

The Vice-Chancellor is supportive of Law being in the name of a combined faculty and, should the proposal be adopted, consultation engagement with staff and students would be undertaken accordingly.  

### How would this proposed combined faculty strengthen the University’s connection to industry?

A combined faculty of business and economics and law would serve as a dynamic gateway, connecting the business community to a broad spectrum of legal expertise and providing the legal sector with essential insights into commercial and corporate practices. This alignment enhances our ability to serve as a vital bridge to industry, strengthening the University’s role as a leader in business and legal education.

### What does this change mean for professional development and career progression opportunities?

With access to a larger academic community and broader resources, the combined faculty would offer opportunities for professional growth, including enhanced professional development, mentorship, and interdisciplinary engagement. Academic staff would benefit from a richer environment that supports learning, collaboration, and career advancement. Professional staff would gain exposure to a wider range of activities and functions within the larger faculty, equipping them with valuable experience for progression within the proposed combined faculty or roles across other faculties.

### Will combining these faculties affect the identity and distinct strengths of each?

The proposed combination is designed to retain the unique identities and strengths of both faculties, ensuring the legacy and prominence of the Auckland Law School and University of Auckland Business School remains visible. Law will continue to focus on areas of existing research and teaching strength. This proposal is about fostering collaboration without compromising the distinctive areas of expertise each faculty brings, thus providing a more interconnected but still distinct academic structure.

### Could the combined faculty’s focus shift away from Law, overshadowing its unique contributions?

The University is committed to ensuring that Law, and Business and Economics contributions are equally valued. A combined structure would establish clear leadership roles to represent both fields, including a dean of the Auckland Law School, which would safeguard Law’s distinct contributions and advocate for its priorities. By aligning resources, the structure would also allow Law greater access to research funding and academic support, which strengthens its contributions rather than diminishing them.

### Could the distinct academic cultures of Law and Business lead to challenges in collaboration?

The University values the unique cultures of both faculties and would look to prioritise initiatives that respect and integrate these traditions. Collaborative forums, joint research projects, and professional development workshops would encourage cross-disciplinary engagement while maintaining each faculty’s identity. Leaders from both faculties would guide integration efforts to ensure a balanced, inclusive approach.

### Would the proposed new faculty arrangements impact Law’s autonomy in curriculum design and academic decision-making?

Under the proposed new faculty arrangements, academic staff in Law would continue to play a leading and active role in shaping their curriculum and programme designs, in alignment with a broader faculty under the oversight of the dean of the combined faculty. Input from Law’s academic leadership will be essential to this process, ensuring that curriculum development reflects both Law’s distinctive strengths and the collaborative opportunities that the new structure provides. This approach aims to balance self-determination with shared strategic goals that benefit the entire faculty.
