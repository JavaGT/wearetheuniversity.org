# Future Ready Schools

Project information

### Future Ready Schools Steering Group 

####  Purpose 

 The Steering Group is responsible for developing a set of recommendations for the organisation of academic units in the Faculty of Arts and Education.  The Group will generate ideas for the structure of the faculty, advocate for the ideas and ensure wide discussion within the faculty.  It is not a decision-making group.   

 Final decisions about the faculty’s school structure will be made by the Dean.  

The Steering Group will test ideas with a consultative group made up of two or three academic staff members from each of the existing schools.  The Heads of CLL, Humanities, and Social Sciences will nominate three members of the consultative group, all other HoS will nominate two members.
