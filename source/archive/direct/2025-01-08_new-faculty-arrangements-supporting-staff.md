## Webinars

A series of webinars designed to help us navigate potential uncertainty and change were offered and delivered through the new faculty arrangements proposal phase. As we move into the transition period these continue to be a valuable resource.

### Understanding ourselves and others during uncertainty and change

Using the change curve and SCARF to recognise common responses to change and create a more positive change experience.
