Thank you to the staff and students who shared their feedback and helped shape these important decisions.

In partnership with the Office of Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori, a te reo Māori name was also gifted to the Faculty of Arts and Education: Te Pūtahi Mātauranga, which means “the confluence of knowledges/disciplines and of knowing.”

The Faculty of Engineering and Design is currently undergoing a similar process to determine its te reo Māori name, which will be announced shortly.

## Committee structures

A review of the existing committee structures and faculty meetings from the (previous) four faculties has been completed and a proposed new structure has been drafted for consideration.

## Background

In March 2024, Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland proposed a change to its faculty arrangements for four faculties to enhance collaboration, interdisciplinary work, and research opportunities, positioning the institution for the evolving tertiary education environment.

The Arts, Creative Arts, Humanities, Education, and Social Sciences have been integral to the University's commitment to academic comprehensiveness and societal impact. These disciplines offer diverse programmes, research initiatives, and engagement activities that have prominence across the country. Despite their vital roles, they faced declining student demand over the past decade, leading to funding and resource allocation challenges, aligning with trends observed in universities nationally and internationally.

In response to the volatile tertiary education landscape, it is imperative that we adapt and evolve. To stay ahead, we need to be agile, innovative, and responsive while delivering high-quality education and impactful research. By realigning our faculties, we aimed to proactively shape our academic landscape, ensuring resilience to challenges and making strategic decisions that benefit students, staff, and the broader community.

### Drivers for change

- Enhance collaboration across and within faculties
- Strengthen resilience in our areas of excellence
- Enable increased strategic capacity for future success
- Enhance inter- and trans-disciplinary research
- Broaden career development opportunities for academic, professional and technical staff
