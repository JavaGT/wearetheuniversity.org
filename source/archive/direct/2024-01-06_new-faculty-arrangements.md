# New faculty arrangements

Updated January 6 2025

The new **Faculty of Arts and Education** and the expanded **Faculty of Engineering and Design** were established on 1 January 2025. 

The Faculty of Arts and Education was created by amalgamating

- Faculty of Arts 
- Faculty of Education and Social Work 
- Elam School of Fine Arts 
- School of Music
- Dance programme (previously with the Faculty of Creative Arts and Industries)  

The Faculty of Engineering (now Faculty of Engineering and Design) was expanded to include Architecture and Planning and the Design programme (previously with the Faculty of Creative Arts and Industries). 

## Faculty leadership and staffing

Professor Nuala Gregory is the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Education and Associate Professor Richard Clarke is the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Design. 

Confirmed academic leadership and professional staff structures for each of these faculties were established after extensive staff consultation in December 2024 and have also come into effect from 1 January.  

## Website changes

Website structure and content changes are being made from 6 January 2025 to reflect the new faculty arrangements.

Changes are primarily being made within the find a study option, Faculty of Arts and Education, Faculty of Engineering and Design and programme sections.

The Faculty of Creative Arts and Industries and the Faculty of Education and Social Work no longer have a presence on the website.   

## Additional information

In March 2024, Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland proposed a change to its faculty arrangements for four faculties to enhance collaboration, interdisciplinary work, and research opportunities, positioning the institution for the evolving tertiary education environment.

By realigning our faculties, we aimed to

- Enhance collaboration across and within faculties
- Strengthen resilience in our areas of excellence
- Enable increased strategic capacity for future success
- Enhance inter- and trans-disciplinary research
- Broaden career development opportunities for academic, professional and technical staff

## Faculty names

Following consideration of faculty names at the Senate meeting on 11 November 2024, the Vice Chancellor has confirmed that the new faculty and expanded faculty of Engineering will be known as: 

- Faculty of Arts and Education 
- Faculty of Engineering and Design  

Thank you to the staff and students who shared their feedback and helped shape these important decisions.

In partnership with the Office of Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori, a te reo Māori name was also gifted to the Faculty of Arts and Education: Te Pūtahi Mātauranga, which means “the confluence of knowledges/disciplines and of knowing.” 

The Faculty of Engineering and Design is currently undergoing a similar process with the Office of the Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori to determine its te reo Māori name, which will be announced shortly.
