## Overview

Recent international media reports advise that some people are receiving increased scrutiny at the US border. These may include, but are not limited to, the following individuals:

- Academics/researchers/others who are publicly associated with research areas or work that may be perceived as politically sensitive. This may include published research, public commentary, affiliation and/or social media posts with views that may be considered contrary to the current administration.  
    
- Transgender and gender-diverse travellers whose gender identity and documentation may not align between their passport and birth certificate.
- Travellers entering the US from countries of political interest to the current administration.
- Travellers with a history of criminal convictions.
- Travellers with ambiguous purpose of travel to the US (or where visa status is perceived to not align with the purpose of travel).  

In January 2025, the US Government also issued an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-othernational-security-and-public-safety-threats/) that includes increased scrutiny of all travellers to the US.

The situation at the US border is dynamic and can change rapidly. We will update information as it becomes available.

Think carefully about how you might be affected prior to booking US travel.

## Considerations for US border: entry and exit

Entry requirements to the US are strict. US authorities have broad powers to decide if you're eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law. Check US entry, registration, transit and exit requirements.

Be aware of how US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) would view your online profile and social media posts as this may lead to attracting further attention and questioning. CBP may also search your phone or other devices for downloaded content or social media posts viewed, to help inform their inquiries.

### Ensure you follow good travel practice

- Whether you're travelling on a visa or under the Visa Waiver Program, ensure you understand all relevant terms and conditions before attempting to enter the United States.
- Carry printed copies with you of all bookings for accommodation and return travel, and evidence of purpose of travel, e.g. conference registration/invitation.
- Consider downloading the free [Mobile Passport Control app](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/us-citizens/mobile-passport-control) (U.S. Customs and Border Protection), which can streamline the process at US border entry.  
    
- Consider taking your Campus Card with you to confirm employment in New Zealand, along with evidence of funds available to support your stay, e.g. a recent bank statement.
- Notify a close contact from home or work of your arrival at your destination. Advise the close contact to email [riskoffice@auckland.ac.nz](mailto:riskoffice@auckland.ac.nz) for further advice if there are any issues.

## Additional advice for LGBTQIA+ travellers

- Healix has provided guidance that states that Foreign Nationals who identify as LGBTQIA+ should exercise increased caution and be mindful of local attitudes or risks while travelling within the United States.  
    
- If the gender listed on your travel documents is not the same as the gender in any visa application or customs declaration, please contact the Risk Office. riskoffice@auckland.ac.nz for further guidance.
- To date, ‘X’ gender passport holders should be able to enter the United States if their passport is not expired and/or damaged.
