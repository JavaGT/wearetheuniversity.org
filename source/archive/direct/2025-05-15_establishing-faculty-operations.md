## Overview

We understand the importance of continuity, especially in times of change. As we start the new year, much of the existing structures and how we do things will stay the same for 2025, particularly in our schools.

## Transition timeline

### 1 January to 3 April 2025

- Continuation of existing processes, most workflows continue unchanged
- Professional staff structures for Student Support and Engagement Teams (SSE) and Academic Services Teams (AS) will run parallel to existing structures
- Existing associate deans in roles that carry into the Faculty of Arts and Education will remain in place until 28 March 2025 to support handover and ease of decision-making

### From 4 April 2025

- Full implementation of new professional staff structures
- SSE and AS Teams transition fully into the new faculty arrangements
- Identify known processes likely to change over time and establish a process for gathering and managing feedback on transition challenges

Note, this timeline also appears on the Improvement projects and programmes [Transition to new faculty arrangements](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/intranet/stay-informed/improvement-projects-programmes/transition-new-faculty.html) page.
