# Future Ready Schools FAQs

### Why are changes to school structure being proposed?

Our new faculty has inherited

- eleven schools and a programme (independent of any school) that host between 65 and eight full-time equivalent academic staff
- four approved faculty research centres and
- hosting responsibilities for one University research centre and a CoRE.

In addition, there are academic staff engaged in teaching activities that sit outside school structures.

The aim of the work being undertaken is to create a coherent set of schools that will facilitate ever better research, teaching and community engagement. We are also mindful of the need to develop a manageable and governable academic structure.

### When will any changes take place?

No change to existing structures will be made until **1 January 2026**.

The plan is to have a revised structure designed and approved by mid-June 2025. This will allow six months to appoint new heads ready for the new structure and for the faculty and University to carry out the systems and business processes work needed to ensure the revised structure is introduced smoothly.

New heads of school will work with their schools to determine intra-school organisation.

### What principles are guiding this work?

The following principles are guiding the work that is being done

- Takes account of the University’s principles of manaakitanga, whanaugatanga and kaitiakitanga
- Takes account of Taumata Teitei, maximising opportunities for intellectual inquiry, collaboration, creativity, and equity and diversity
- Brings together complementary disciplines and creates a research ecosystem characterised by collaboration and agility
- Brings all academic staff, disciplines and programmes within a school structure
- Accounts for the needs of professional programmes
- Considers parity of size amongst the schools
- Considers sustainability, location and the University’s approach to resourcing support services
- The number of schools will be limited by governability considerations

### Will existing discipline groups be broken up or changed?

No decisions have been made about the way discipline groups will be grouped but we are not intending to make change for change’s sake. We are also committed to hearing what people have to say about their placement.

This organization will not look at individuals and their placement in teams. It is possible that as the new structure becomes clearer individuals may have a case (on the basis of their teaching or research interests) to shift from one school to another. Decisions about these changes will be made by the Dean with the Faculty Operational Leadership Team (which includes all heads of school).

### Who is doing this work?

The task is entirely controlled within the faculty.

The Dean has asked Professor Mark Barrow (the former Dean of Education and Social Work) to progress the development. He is working with a steering group to generate potential structures.

There will be tested with a consultative team and available for wider consultation before decision are made.

### What is the membership of the steering group?

AP Kathy Smits (Deputy Dean, Chair)  
AP Fiona Jack  
AP Aaron Wilson  
Professor Kim Phillips  
Professor Melinda Webber  
Professor Yvonne Underhill-Sem  
Claire Philipson  
Bevan Iles  
Jeanine Scholey  
Professor Mark Barrow (Transition Lead)

### How many schools will there be in the new structure?

There is no predetermined number of schools. The interests of sensible discipline groupings and governability will decide the final outcome. At the Faculty meeting of 28 February the Dean suggested 4-5 schools. The working group will test that with HoS and the consultative group (in the first instance) and make recommendations if it thinks more or fewer schools are needed.

### Who will make the final decisions?

The Vice-Chancellor will make the final decision on the basis of a recommendation from the Dean. The VC is required to consult with Senate, but the decision is hers to make.

### How can I have a say?

If you have views on where your discipline should be located you can raise these with your HoS, any member of the steering group or the consultative team (see question “who is doing this work?” for names of these people).

### How will changes affect professional staff?

We can’t be clear on how any new school structure might affect professional staff until a proposed revised school structure is available. However, a change in the school structure may, for example drive a change in portfolio for Group Services staff work (e.g., supporting a new academic head in a newly established academic unit). We may need to look at service levels or how we operate in some areas, but we will aim to minimise disruption. If proposed changes have the potential to affect staff numbers, consultation will occur in line with employment agreements.

The focus at this stage is on the school structure and we will be able to begin thinking through possible implications for professional staff towards the end of Q2 and the start of Q3 2025 (i.e., in late June/July) as the plan is to have a revised school structure designed and approved by mid-June 2025. We are committed to transparent communication and will provide updates as the process unfolds.

### How will the new schools be organised internally?

The work currently underway (as at March 23025) is to determine the number of schools in the faculty and the disciplines that each will encompass.  Each new school will decide on its internal organisation.  It is expected that this work will take place towards the end of 2025, following the appointment of the head of school.  

### **What will the new school structure mean for the faculty’s programmes?**

The new school structure has no direct effect on the programmes the faculty offers.  Questions have been raised about whether this is a step in a move to generic programmes.  It is not.  Those named programmes and majors in programmes that are currently offered in different schools will be assigned to the relevant school for their ongoing oversight.  Of course, this does not mean that our programmes and programme mix will stop evolving.  Indeed, it is hoped that the new faculty arrangement will open possibilities for improving our programmes and programme mix in ways that encourage more students to study with us and to better support the disciplines and professions that we serve.

### Would it not be better to wait for individuals in the faculty to come to know each other better before developing a new school structure?

There is no doubt that interpersonal relationships are important in developing academic partnerships that facilitate research and interdisciplinary course development.  However, interpersonal relationships are not the basis for a faculty’s internal organisation.  The steering group is working to bring together discipline and professional groupings in logical ways.  The logic of those groupings will be subject to testing by the members of the consultative group, current heads of school, faculty leaders and staff in schools.  Following that testing, a structure will be proposed to the Dean for her approval.  The structure will be presented to faculty at its meeting on 22 May, 2025.
