*00:46-00:48*

**Speaker 3**: Three, two, one.
*00:48-00:49*

**Speaker 2**: Thank you.
*00:52-00:52*

**Speaker 1**: All right.
*00:55-00:56*

**Speaker 1**: Greetings to everyone and welcome to the Tarokoukaha Hikiti USA debate.
*00:58-01:02*

**Speaker 1**: Kia ora, I am Amelia. I'm one of the moderators for this session.
*01:02-01:05*

**Speaker 4**: Kia ora, I'm Jessica. I'm the other moderator for this session.
*01:06-01:09*

**Speaker 1**: In this session, you're going to hear directly from student candidates for the Wellbeing and Equity vice president who are standing in this year's election.
*01:09-01:16*

**Speaker 1**: They will be representing you in all matters related to Wellbeing and Equity here at the university.
*01:17-01:21*

**Speaker 1**: We have four candidates who have joined us today.
*01:22-01:24*

**Speaker 1**: Thank you all for coming.
*01:24-01:25*

**Speaker 1**: To explain what the rules of this session are, each candidate will have one minute to answer the moderator's questions.
*01:26-01:32*

**Speaker 1**: Follow-up questions will be asked with 30 seconds to respond.
*01:33-01:36*

**Speaker 1**: Moderators will keep the time and ensure that all rules are followed.
*01:36-01:39*

**Speaker 1**: And rules include no interrupting other candidates.
*01:40-01:43*

**Speaker 1**: Only a candidate being addressed should respond to a question.
*01:43-01:46*

**Speaker 1**: And candidates must all uphold the university's zero-tolerance policy on bullying, harassment and discrimination.
*01:46-01:52*

**Speaker 1**: I hope all of the candidates know what that is considering.
*01:53-01:55*

**Speaker 5**: running for well-being equity vice president.
*01:55-01:57*

**Speaker 1**: So now that we've covered the rules, let us meet our candidates.
*01:58-02:01*

**Speaker 1**: Each candidate will be given 30 seconds to introduce themselves.
*02:02-02:04*

**Speaker 1**: Jessica, could you pass the mic over?
*02:05-02:06*

**Speaker 1**: Introduce yourself, tell us about your past experience, and talk about some of your aspirations for the next year in 30 seconds, so a bit of a challenge.
*02:06-02:13*

**Speaker 6**: - Kia ora, I am Saifio.
*02:21-02:23*

**Speaker 6**: I am studying a conjoint, photobop, and verbal studies.
*02:23-02:27*

**Speaker 6**: My goals really for the next year would be just to kind of improve on well-being, especially when it comes to the equity part, especially with people with disabilities or waiting for diagnosis that really struggle to kind of have accommodations, especially when it comes to tests and the amount of readings, especially people with dyslexia.
*02:29-02:46*

**Speaker 6**: I've heard a lot of people tell me about that.
*02:46-02:48*

**Speaker 6**: I've had experience in different kind of leadership roles, both from working in here and working with the council.
*02:49-02:55*

**Speaker 7**: Stand your date.
*02:56-02:57*

**Speaker 7**: Kia to everyone.
*02:57-02:58*

**Speaker 7**: My name is Nadia Malik.
*02:59-03:01*

**Speaker 7**: I'm a Sydney hero.
*03:01-03:02*

**Speaker 7**: I'm really excited to be running for this role.
*03:03-03:06*

**Speaker 7**: Over the past couple of years, I've been leading in wellbeing and equity spaces on campus.
*03:07-03:12*

**Speaker 7**: For those of you who don't recognise me, I'm also the girl who jumped off the plane with Nadia written on my hands. But well-being and equity aren't just buzzwords to me. I'm so excited to run for the role and make a difference. Good everyone, good morning, great to see you all here.
*03:13-03:34*

**Speaker 8**: My name is Leah. I'm a current conjoint student here studying a Bachelor's of Laws and a Bachelor's of Science majoring in Environmental Science and Geography. Some of you might recognize me as a current member of the AUC engagement committee and delighted to now be running for next year's well-being and equity VP role as well. My overall focus is that I just so we believe that you know uni life for our students shouldn't just solely be on exams, stress, everything. We should have
*03:34-04:02*

**Speaker 9**: mental awareness as well. Thank you. Kia ora, konmele nga wamo.
*04:02-04:07*

**Speaker 9**: G'day, my name is Mele. I am a Bachelor of Science student studying a major in Biology and Psychology.
*04:11-04:19*

**Speaker 10**: I run for Equity and Wellbeing Vice President because I truly believe that equity and well-being should be at the forefront and the heart of student life.
*04:19-04:29*

**Speaker 10**: I believe in just a shift in our student culture which can start with me.
*04:30-04:37*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect, amazing.
*04:39-04:40*

**Speaker 1**: Just are there any conflicts of interest before we get started that you would like to declare now?
*04:41-04:45*

**Speaker 1**: Anyone? No? Great.
*04:46-04:47*

**Speaker 1**: Conflicts of interest, we're just asking.
*04:48-04:50*

**Speaker 1**: There are a couple of candidates who are affiliated with political parties, and that's the only conflict we will be asking people to declare.
*04:50-04:55*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect. That brings us into our first question round.
*04:56-04:59*

**Speaker 1**: Jess, would you like to ask our first question?
*04:59-05:00*

**Speaker 4**: It's very easy, very simple, considering what you're running for.
*05:01-05:04*

**Speaker 4**: But what does well-being and equity mean to you?
*05:04-05:07*

**Speaker 4**: every candidate will get 30 seconds to answer.
*05:07-05:09*

**Speaker 7**: I believe that well-being exists on a spectrum.
*05:11-05:14*

**Speaker 7**: There is no such thing as good well-being and bad well-being.
*05:15-05:18*

**Speaker 7**: Also, I don't think it is for me to decide.
*05:19-05:22*

**Speaker 7**: My campaign is all about giving students the voice.
*05:22-05:25*

**Speaker 7**: So if you go on my candidacy Instagram right now, you won't see my face plastered everywhere.
*05:26-05:31*

**Speaker 7**: You'll see yours.
*05:31-05:32*

**Speaker 7**: I think as the role of Wellbeing and Equity VP, it's about advocating for the students.
*05:33-05:41*

**Speaker 7**: So I would prioritise whatever the students think their wellbeing needs are, not what I think the students' wellbeing needs are.
*05:42-05:49*

**Speaker 8**: For me, and I think I'm speaking for most students, the majority here as well, I feel like well-being and equity for us universities is more towards inclusive civility and as belonging here at university as we want to feel like we belong here and that you know we are part as a one big partner here at university and that we should all feel supported and being able to go to university with a positive energy as well.
*05:57-06:21*

**Speaker 10**: Wellbeing for me is about the all aspects of well-being that we see in Te Fade Takah Fa that's taking care of your spiritual, your mental, your relationships, etc.
*06:25-06:37*

**Speaker 10**: I think especially at a university that's largely of this, I think in New Zealand, I think this is something that we should be tackling head on.
*06:39-06:46*

**Speaker 10**: In terms of equity, it truly is just about fairness and giving all students a fair start to invest in life so they can see it academically.
*06:46-06:54*

**Speaker 10**: but also as well being an equity vice president, maintaining a strong presence is very important.
*06:54-06:59*

**Speaker 6**: I'm just gonna, yeah.
*07:11-07:12*

**Speaker 6**: Yeah, I think everyone's got really good points.
*07:13-07:14*

**Speaker 6**: Obviously we're running for similar roles, so it's very important to consider student voice.
*07:15-07:19*

**Speaker 6**: I do think, I think that's really good because we can make our own policies obviously, but if it's not actually gonna help other students, it won't make any sense.
*07:20-07:29*

**Speaker 6**: I think equity is a big part.
*07:29-07:31*

**Speaker 6**: So I know a lot of students will get opportunities for some scholarship because of good grades and stuff, but I do think it's important that when you're getting scholarships or not, you are able to achieve great opportunities and stuff.
*07:32-07:44*

**Speaker 1**: Great, and so we also just wanted to give the candidates to give a quick high level rundown of what their policies are.
*07:46-07:52*

**Speaker 1**: So you will have one minute.
*07:52-07:54*

**Speaker 1**: Just give us a quick summary about what your policies are and what's most important to you there.
*07:54-07:58*

**Speaker 1**: Begin with, let's begin with Leo.
*08:03-08:05*

**Speaker 8**: - Sweet, all right, thank you.
*08:05-08:07*

**Speaker 8**: So yeah, my campaign, I'm drawing on the focus on four main pillars.
*08:08-08:11*

**Speaker 8**: The first one is inclusivity in action for all students and as well as more specifically as new community, being established seeing what the AUC engagement committee has done this year representing all students across the board spectrum I absolutely believe that by incorporating that in the well-being and mental health and equity space we have a massive positive difference for all students and thirdly as well it would be you know everything is digitalized in this day in life right now so having a hub online where everyone can access well-being and mental health information is is super important as data shows that one in five key reasons in their life experience mental health challenges and often they don't get the support that they often need.
*08:11-08:56*

**Speaker 8**: So I believe having that might be available where students can exit like one second is my book. Thank you.
*08:57-09:04*

**Speaker 1**: Sweet. And we're just going to ask a quick follow-up to that.
*09:05-09:07*

**Speaker 1**: The Engagement Committee, it is a new committee established this year. I'm not sure if everyone knows what that is.
*09:08-09:12*

**Speaker 1**: It's a committee under the Vice President Engagement. It is made of student volunteers.
*09:12-09:16*

**Speaker 1**: How would you say that that committee has been representative of the diverse range of students at the university?
*09:17-09:21*

**Speaker 8**: Yeah, so that committee is led under the great leadership of the current vice president, Kalina.
*09:23-09:28*

**Speaker 8**: And so there's roughly 10 or so of us in the committee.
*09:29-09:33*

**Speaker 8**: And all of us come from different backgrounds and different diverse experiences.
*09:34-09:39*

**Speaker 8**: Most of us are executives in other clubs on campus as well.
*09:40-09:44*

**Speaker 8**: So having that wider viewpoint of voices being represented in our meetings, covering all different aspects, from cultural activities to public policies, and as well as sports as well.
*09:45-09:58*

**Speaker 8**: So I just think that having the wider broad of voices represented has been most effective.
*09:58-10:05*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect. Thank you.
*10:06-10:07*

**Speaker 1**: Melanie, next. Do you remember the original question?
*10:07-10:09*

**Speaker 10**: Could you just say it again one more time, please?
*10:10-10:11*

**Speaker 1**: So original question, just give us a quick rundown of what policies you're planning on implementing at a very high level.
*10:11-10:17*

**Speaker 10**: Okay, cool.
*10:17-10:18*

**Speaker 10**: So my campaign is around ensuring that students at this university are number one safe, two supported, and three seen.
*10:19-10:27*

**Speaker 10**: I think those are the three things that really do matter to students and make them feel at home here at the university of Auckland, where they'll then be able to succeed academically.
*10:28-10:36*

**Speaker 10**: My policies include, my main policies are around women's safety, especially at our recreational facilities, that being HIWA.
*10:37-10:46*

**Speaker 10**: Whether that looks like looking at women-only gym spaces or class times built only for women specifically.
*10:47-10:55*

**Speaker 10**: I've spoken with a lot of women here on campus and this is something that is very important to them and their health.
*10:56-11:01*

**Speaker 10**: Two, increasing our cross-campus relationships with our satellite campuses, that being Grafton and South Auckland.
*11:02-11:11*

**Speaker 10**: So students at those campuses feel quite disconnected from AUSA, and I think having a stronger presence at those campuses is very important to ensure well-being and equity across the entire university body.
*11:12-11:24*

**Speaker 10**: My Lord.
*11:24-11:24*

**Speaker 1**: Just a follow-up on that one.
*11:25-11:27*

**Speaker 1**: This is a round where you guys get a lot of follow-ups, so apologies in advance.
*11:27-11:31*

**Speaker 1**: For the satellite campus representation, that has been a notoriously hard issue.
*11:32-11:35*

**Speaker 1**: Historically, student council has actually had reps from satellite campuses sitting, but those roles were disestablished due to a lack of engagement.
*11:36-11:42*

**Speaker 1**: This year, some efforts have been made by smaller clubs.
*11:42-11:45*

**Speaker 1**: For example, AUSA has offices at these satellite campuses.
*11:45-11:48*

**Speaker 1**: How do you propose to sort of bring AUSA's presence to these in a way that is actually going to generate engagement?
*11:48-11:54*

**Speaker 10**: Again, I believe the first way to tackle this is face-to-face engagement.
*11:55-12:00*

**Speaker 10**: I don't see why our executive can't just spend an hour a week at these campuses engaging with the students there.
*12:00-12:06*

**Speaker 10**: I think having specific office hours where we just set up a stall in the main lobby and just remind students that come through that we are there to support them.
*12:07-12:15*

**Speaker 10**: And obviously just maintaining a vibrant digital presence as well.
*12:16-12:20*

**Speaker 10**: Perfect, thank you.
*12:21-12:22*

**Speaker 1**: Do you remember the original question?
*12:24-12:25*

**Speaker 7**: Yes.
*12:26-12:26*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect, off you go.
*12:27-12:28*

**Speaker 7**: My policies are centered around making campus safer and more supportive for every student.
*12:29-12:35*

**Speaker 7**: I would actually really encourage you to read my policy document because I talk about what the policy is, how it will realistically be implemented and why I'm the right person to do it.
*12:35-12:47*

**Speaker 7**: But right now I will give you a brief overview.
*12:48-12:50*

**Speaker 7**: The third space is my main policy, where it is a dedicated wellbeing hub on campus, something like queer space or women's space, also boosting chaplaincy support, a wellbeing portal where students can go and access any support that they want, whether that's chaplaincy, health and counselling, maybe asking for an assignment extension.
*12:51-13:16*

**Speaker 7**: I will also promise to be very transparent and upload fortnightly updates on what I do.
*13:17-13:23*

**Speaker 7**: I do think it's very important that students are given the voice again.
*13:25-13:31*

**Speaker 7**: So a big part of the position itself is advocating for the students' needs.
*13:31-13:37*

**Speaker 7**: And that's what I'll be doing. Thank you.
*13:37-13:39*

**Speaker 4**: Just a quick follow-up on that one.
*13:39-13:41*

**Speaker 4**: In terms of the wellbeing portal, what does it look like?
*13:41-13:44*

**Speaker 4**: How are you going to implement it in a year?
*13:44-13:46*

**Speaker 4**: And how is it actually going to work?
*13:46-13:47*

**Speaker 7**: That's a really good question.
*13:48-13:49*

**Speaker 7**: Thank you, Jess.
*13:49-13:50*

**Speaker 7**: The Wellbeing Portal has already started.
*13:50-13:53*

**Speaker 7**: This year's President Gabriel Boyd and the current Equity and Wellbeing Officer Lola have already started works with WDCC on making the portal.
*13:54-14:05*

**Speaker 7**: I have asked for an update on progress and it's going super well.
*14:05-14:09*

**Speaker 7**: My addition to the portal will be not just telling students what the support services are, but also giving them guides on how they can access it.
*14:10-14:19*

**Speaker 7**: So maybe emails for how to ask for an assignment extension with a template of what they can say.
*14:19-14:27*

**Speaker 4**: Can you just give us a quick rundown on how you are going to get students to engage with this, I guess, portal?
*14:28-14:32*

**Speaker 4**: Because we've seen other apps like YoA Pahu being shut down because students aren't engaging with it.
*14:32-14:36*

**Speaker 7**: Malia made a great point about face-to-face engagement.
*14:37-14:40*

**Speaker 7**: I think while we're all running for our positions, we've been going around campus talking to hundreds of people.
*14:40-14:47*

**Speaker 7**: I think it is also important to uphold that once you get the position because at the end of the day, it's not only to engage with students for the votes or for CLARC.
*14:48-14:58*

**Speaker 4**: It's to engage with the students so you can represent them.
*14:58-15:01*

**Speaker 4**: Okay, thank you.
*15:01-15:02*

**Speaker 4**: Thank you.
*15:02-15:02*

**Speaker 4**: Thank you.
*15:02-15:03*

**Speaker 1**: The original question was just give us a broad overview of your policies and what you plan on doing in your participating, if it's successfully elected.
*15:03-15:12*

**Speaker 6**: Thank you. I'm going to read because I'm anxious and forget words.
*15:14-15:17*

**Speaker 6**: So overall my policies will be things like safety on campus.
*15:18-15:21*

**Speaker 6**: So I know a lot of us get harassed, especially around orientation week, by certain groups on university grounds.
*15:21-15:28*

**Speaker 6**: I have a lot of connections with council and law enforcement to be working with things like campus security to create policy where they cannot follow you into class, they cannot stop you from going into certain buildings because they are known to do that.
*15:30-15:41*

**Speaker 6**: I would work with the campus groups for that so that they don't feel like they're being targeted at all, it would be something that we all agree on.
*15:42-15:49*

**Speaker 6**: Things like opportunities, so volunteering and opportunities to learn how to vote in the upcoming election.
*15:51-15:56*

**Speaker 6**: This will be my fourth year of voting because I'm old, so I have quite a lot of experience with that.
*15:56-16:02*

**Speaker 6**: Disability equity, I've said a lot about that. You can check out my Instagram for that.
*16:03-16:07*

**Speaker 6**: And then things like transparency is another big one that I'm really passionate about.
*16:08-16:12*

**Speaker 4**: Just a quick follow up on that, in terms of health safety on campus, which key stakeholders within the university groups would you work with to combat that?
*16:12-16:19*

**Speaker 6**: I'd probably work with a lot of the kind of like faith-based groups because I know that a lot of the time the people who are doing a little bit of the passionate pushing for cups and bits and bobs are faith-based and I don't want it to seem like it's a target on faith-based groups.
*16:20-16:38*

**Speaker 6**: I want it to be kind of overall any groups like that, and I want to work with them so they know how it's best to approach students to get them involved, but also where there's a line where it's crossing over intimate harassment.
*16:39-16:52*

**Speaker 4**: Do you think it's within the power of the Wellbeing and Equity VP to, I guess, to talk to those groups and actually make those mandates?
*16:52-16:58*

**Speaker 6**: I do think it's possible.
*17:00-17:00*

**Speaker 6**: I think it's obviously a larger conversation to have down the line, but it comes under Wellbeing when it comes to faith.
*17:01-17:08*

**Speaker 6**: We want people to feel safe. We want people to feel like they can go to these faith groups, but not pressured to. Awesome. Thank you so much. And one last question for all about Can Do Next.
*17:08-17:17*

**Speaker 1**: We'll start with you, Samuel, and then work our way down the line again. This is going to be a really, really quick answer. We want just 10 seconds only, sort of one sentence. If a struggling student reached out to you directly for support in your role as well being Equity Vice President,
*17:17-17:33*

**Speaker 6**: what would your approach be? Depending on what they were after, I would, if it was just like stopping me on the campus sort of thing at the time, I would sit with them and talk to them face to face. If it's something that is out of my control, I would point them in the direction of things like campus care and then you know follow up on that support if I see them again or if I'm in contact.
*17:34-17:57*

**Speaker 7**: okay Nadia thank you um I am a certified lifekeeper and I also do volunteer with a lot of help lines so I do think I have the experience to talk to struggling students however if it is a serious issue I would direct them to the appropriate counselors or different support services at
*17:57-18:17*

**Speaker 8**: university um so yeah um as an experienced welfare officer you must use the best one by you and you and also it's very normal to see students coming up to you to voice the concern.
*18:19-18:30*

**Speaker 8**: So I think for us keeping this communication to see what offer support that we can offer, and if we need to guide them to other supporting people as well where they can offer even further support as that has been seen quite effective in our youth events across the New Zealand.
*18:31-18:45*

**Speaker 10**: Depending on the severity of the issue that they bring to me, I would also like Nadia said, direct them to the proper forms of support that being our counselling services etc but I think first it really is just important to sit there and listen and be an ear on your shoulder for them to just lay it all on I think that's definitely the most important part in the way I would start
*18:46-19:09*

**Speaker 1**: engaging with this student perfect all right we're going to move on to section three which is policy scrutiny um should we start with jessica we'll start with nadia because you're at the top of our list um your policies have focused a lot on well-being what are you going to do in this sort of equity space how are you going to engage there um i want to say my biggest equity related policy
*19:09-19:36*

**Speaker 7**: is closing the gaps which is a faculty wide faculty's wide initiative and how basically So there's an engagement committee on campus now.
*19:37-19:47*

**Speaker 7**: I would also like to create something similar to the wellbeing committee.
*19:47-19:51*

**Speaker 7**: I know that every faculty has the equivalent of an equity and welfare officer.
*19:52-19:56*

**Speaker 7**: And these are the students who sit on those specific faculty's equity committees, like I do on the faculty of science equity committee.
*19:57-20:04*

**Speaker 7**: A lot of these meetings are just talking about issues, but obviously these specific faculty clubs don't have a big reach like AUSA does.
*20:04-20:14*

**Speaker 7**: So my idea is to get all these offices together and focus on faculty specific needs of students
*20:14-20:21*

**Speaker 4**: and different equity and working groups across campus.
*20:21-20:24*

**Speaker 4**: Just to follow up from that, could you name some equity issues that students are facing right now that you would want to work towards?
*20:25-20:30*

**Speaker 7**: Yes. I think one of the biggest equity issues is access to immediate support that a lot of students are facing.
*20:31-20:42*

**Speaker 7**: So we all know that counseling at uni or just in New Zealand in general has such a long wait line.
*20:43-20:50*

**Speaker 7**: And sometimes students, especially I want to say women, they deserve like a safe space, a safe immediate space where they can go for help.
*20:50-21:00*

**Speaker 7**: My policies like the Wellbeing Hub give people an immediate space where they can go to reset or talk to people.
*21:01-21:06*

**Speaker 7**: boosting chaplaincy is immediate, low effort counselling almost.
*21:08-21:13*

**Speaker 1**: Okay, thank you very much.
*21:16-21:17*

**Speaker 1**: Who's next?
*21:18-21:19*

**Speaker 1**: Leo?
*21:20-21:20*

**Speaker 1**: So, looking at your policy, you are aware that AUSA does not manage counselling and wellbeing services, right?
*21:21-21:30*

**Speaker 1**: One of your policies is to increase the supports available in the counselling and wellbeing space.
*21:30-21:35*

**Speaker 1**: How are you in your role planning on increasing the accessibility to these services?
*21:36-21:41*

**Speaker 8**: Yeah, so Nadia brought up a good point.
*21:44-21:45*

**Speaker 8**: In general, students experience crazy long wait lines, etc. across the country for counseling support.
*21:45-21:53*

**Speaker 8**: So one role that's within this equity and well-being space is balancing strong and positive relationships with external stakeholders.
*21:53-22:01*

**Speaker 8**: So by doing so, we can often get the support that we need as an AUSA committee, and by doing that, we can reach out to students in a way that offers just an extra support what the university already offers, whether that is counselling or even mental health.
*22:02-22:18*

**Speaker 8**: And one other thing that I'm not sure if I mentioned on policy or not, but it's the way that students often feel that they don't have the accessibility to step their foot forward first and go to support.
*22:20-22:37*

**Speaker 8**: But having a designated space and a designated support centre where it acts like a talking centre where students come and get support whenever they need to be beneficial for this role.
*22:37-22:47*

**Speaker 1**: Sweet.
*22:50-22:50*

**Speaker 1**: Are you aware that the university already does partner with external services to offer additional counselling and support?
*22:51-22:56*

**Speaker 8**: Yes, but following that, I believe that by enhancing that, because you can never get more support, you can never get enough support.
*22:56-23:04*

**Speaker 8**: There's always the possibility of getting more support and more of it.
*23:04-23:07*

**Speaker 8**: So by enhancing that relationship, we're getting additional support.
*23:07-23:13*

**Speaker 1**: And what would a drop-in centre for support look like?
*23:14-23:17*

**Speaker 8**: Yeah, so as a volunteer at UN Youth, where they do this, in my opinion, perfectly, where they have, at every event, they have a designated room or designated center where people from all backgrounds can go there for support.
*23:18-23:32*

**Speaker 8**: We have welfare, equity, queer.
*23:33-23:35*

**Speaker 8**: So I believe all of that falls under the well-being and equity category.
*23:36-23:39*

**Speaker 8**: And so just having that widely available in all events across the university would be beneficial.
*23:39-23:46*

**Speaker 1**: And just one final question, you mentioned specifically at events across the university, would you be looking to implement that at club events as well or just at sort of those larger
*23:47-23:56*

**Speaker 8**: university events? Yes I do because I believe all kind of events regardless of their size should be capable of providing support at all students need. Perfect thank you and we'll move on to Malay.
*23:57-24:10*

**Speaker 4**: Looking at your policy on making AUSA a more accessible and welcoming space, AUSA already has an open door policy. Do you not think that this would make your policy redundant?
*24:12-24:23*

**Speaker 10**: No. So the open door policy at AUSA House is a great start. My policy around accessibility is about making AOSA House a welcoming place.
*24:26-24:38*

**Speaker 10**: The empty lecture rooms at our university are also open, are they not?
*24:39-24:43*

**Speaker 10**: The point is making AOSA House a place where students not only are able to come into, but are welcome to come into.
*24:44-24:51*

**Speaker 10**: And what that looks like is having, number one, digital outreach about why this space is available to them, what it can offer, and two, Just simple things like having seasonal decorations around Christmas time, around Easter, around Hanukkah, around what have you, Chinese New Year.
*24:51-25:11*

**Speaker 10**: Just somewhere that these are simple changes, but what they do is they communicate to the Shoe body that this is a place that they can belong and that everyone is welcome to come into.
*25:12-25:22*

**Speaker 10**: Thank you.
*25:23-25:23*

**Speaker 4**: Currently, just to follow up, I guess currently the open door policy is already advertised on their social media channels.
*25:24-25:30*

**Speaker 4**: How would you plan to improve it?
*25:31-25:32*

**Speaker 4**: Because I guess what you're trying to say is that currently it's not accessible because people don't feel like they're welcome.
*25:32-25:36*

**Speaker 4**: So I guess how would you improve the media presence to make it more welcoming?
*25:36-25:39*

**Speaker 10**: Well, there is a media presence, but my point is that it's not good enough.
*25:42-25:45*

**Speaker 10**: I think we can have better engagement online, having, you know, just trending TikToks or just conversing with students face-to-face as well to let them know that this space is available.
*25:46-25:58*

**Speaker 10**: We're having a visible sign outside.
*25:58-26:00*

**Speaker 10**: so they know that this building is for them and not just this old, run-down historical site.
*26:01-26:06*

**Speaker 4**: We have seen a lot of discourse in terms of people not really believing in the AUSA cause.
*26:08-26:14*

**Speaker 4**: Do you think that is a barrier to accessibility?
*26:15-26:17*

**Speaker 4**: And I guess how would you improve that?
*26:17-26:18*

**Speaker 10**: Of course, and that just begins with me in the role of wellbeing and equity and my presence at these student events, at these classes, at whatever have you.
*26:19-26:28*

**Speaker 10**: I think I'm the first representation of well-being and equity and what AUSA can provide for students.
*26:28-26:36*

**Speaker 10**: And I think having that culture shift and really looking at what students actually want and just changing the way students view AUSA, it begins with me and how I act and how I present myself to the student body.
*26:37-26:48*

**Speaker 4**: Thank you. Awesome. Moving on to Stabiel.
*26:49-26:51*

**Speaker 4**: Your policy states that you'll streamline communication between undiagnosed student support.
*26:54-26:59*

**Speaker 4**: Could you provide further information on how you achieve this?
*27:00-27:03*

**Speaker 6**: So at the moment, there's a lot of barriers just in general with the health system in Aotearoa.
*27:04-27:10*

**Speaker 6**: But I think for uni students, there's a lot of pressure to kind of like walk in and just do the assessment whether the lighting is annoying you, whether you're struggling with your reading.
*27:10-27:20*

**Speaker 6**: I have a lot of friends who have things like visual and hearing impairments, which I think they really struggle to get that accessibility.
*27:21-27:30*

**Speaker 6**: I think having disability service have a bit more of a straightforward process, especially for undiagnosed students, because a lot of the forms, like I myself am still waiting for some stuff.
*27:30-27:41*

**Speaker 6**: There's a lot of just filling out forms and waiting for a response.
*27:43-27:45*

**Speaker 6**: If there was some sort of, I don't know how to really learn, but like kind of like an open door policy even with them a bit more than there is for undiagnosed students to come and state their case and then get recommendations or get, you know, like write-ups for, to give to lecturism.
*27:45-28:07*

**Speaker 1**: Sweet. And your policy also focuses a lot on sort of like these broader level pushes.
*28:07-28:12*

**Speaker 1**: You've outlined, I guess, more tangible steps you could take.
*28:12-28:15*

**Speaker 1**: What about for the rest of your policy?
*28:15-28:17*

**Speaker 1**: What are the sort of tangible steps that you are going to take to implement the things that you said you will push for?
*28:17-28:23*

**Speaker 6**: Specifically for the undiagnosed?
*28:24-28:26*

**Speaker 1**: Not specifically for the undiagnosed.
*28:27-28:29*

**Speaker 1**: I think you've also talked a lot about getting more equitable representation in clubs, for example.
*28:29-28:34*

**Speaker 1**: How are you going to approach that?
*28:34-28:37*

**Speaker 6**: I'm already in talks with some people I know from clubs to get a bit more representation like not everyone this is like a broader level not everyone is keen for things like albatry party which I know as well but there are lots of signs and a lot more party drinking vibes for some of the clubs and I think it'd be more accessible if there are quiet events and things like that and I know for I'm part of the fencing club we're trying to get in wheelchair fencing and you don't have to be in a wheelchair to do it.
*28:38-29:09*

**Speaker 6**: And it's just making things, especially those sports clubs, more equitable for people with disabilities or people who want to try new things but are not super extroverted and stuff.
*29:09-29:20*

**Speaker 6**: So I've got a few kind of things in the bag for that and I would be just kind of pushing those out for the year.
*29:21-29:26*

**Speaker 1**: - Perfect, and we are going to move to open questions from the crowd.
*29:27-29:31*

**Speaker 1**: Is there anyone who has any questions?
*29:32-29:34*

**Speaker 1**: - Yeah.
*29:34-29:34*

**Speaker 11**: Thank you to all the candidates for being here and for your commitment to student well-being and equity.
*29:40-29:49*

**Speaker 11**: I can't remember if the multiple candidates have talked about disability equity, but this is open to everyone.
*29:50-29:59*

**Speaker 11**: In terms of getting access to things like student disability services without a diagnosis, is everyone aware that SDS does need a diagnosis to go through a formal process number one?
*30:00-30:15*

**Speaker 11**: And number two, are you aware of the existence of the Disabled Students Association, of which I'm a member and have been on the exempt in the past, and we already do things like movie in game sites and speed trending and that we're in connection with wider national DSA and also others at different universities.
*30:15-30:37*

**Speaker 11**: And finally, how would you liaise with the disability rights officer to help in all of these areas?
*30:39-30:45*

**Speaker 11**: Thank you.
*30:45-30:45*

**Speaker 4**: I think we'll give each candidate 30 statements to respond to that.
*30:49-30:52*

**Speaker 6**: Cool, so I am aware that your club is definitely one of the more accessible ones, obviously.
*30:54-31:00*

**Speaker 6**: And I think it's just kind of pushing it out through other clubs, and not even just clubs, but just having it open to the general student population.
*31:01-31:10*

**Speaker 6**: Especially, I know a lot of international students aren't quite sure how to access that, so just kind of reaching out to them I think would be really good.
*31:11-31:17*

**Speaker 6**: I've got my second half.
*31:19-31:20*

**Speaker 3**: What's your question?
*31:21-31:23*

**Speaker 3**: Oh yeah, sorry.
*31:25-31:27*

**Speaker 6**: Well, I, depending on who gets the next part, I know Riley over here is running for that and is one of my good friends and has helped me learn a lot about how to make Canvas more accessible, especially as someone with a visual impairment, walking around campus with them, learning, like, I can't just jay walk across the road is one of the things.
*31:28-31:53*

**Speaker 6**: My time is up.
*31:56-31:57*

**Speaker 6**: Yep.
*31:58-31:59*

**Speaker 7**: In terms of making support services more visible, I do have a well-being portal policy that I working with the disability rights officer is an important thing.
*32:05-32:18*

**Speaker 7**: I think with the wellbeing and equity position, working with all the portfolios is super important.
*32:19-32:23*

**Speaker 7**: I did have a talk with the current disability students officer candidates about my ideas to maybe create a UOA accessibility map or support services in different languages.
*32:24-32:36*

**Speaker 7**: But that is something that I'm not promising, but I am promising to work on.
*32:37-32:41*

**Speaker 8**: Thank you for your question.
*32:46-32:47*

**Speaker 8**: For the first part, yes.
*32:48-32:49*

**Speaker 8**: Expanding on that, I guess one of the policies that I mentioned was that online public students can reach out for access to the media.
*32:51-32:58*

**Speaker 8**: We know that's often not enough.
*32:59-33:01*

**Speaker 8**: A common way that's often reflected for quite some time is actually reaching out physically to each and every club because all clubs need that kind of support and available and information regardless of how you put information out there.
*33:02-33:19*

**Speaker 8**: And for the second part of it, your question, how would you be ace?
*33:20-33:23*

**Speaker 8**: So again, physical, communication, different types of variations of communication, social media, different types of people with hearing aids, those kinds of supports.
*33:24-33:36*

**Speaker 8**: Thank you.
*33:39-33:39*

**Speaker 10**: In terms of visibility for students with disabilities, I think this again would be a great start for collaboration with the club, the Students with Disabilities Club.
*33:40-33:51*

**Speaker 10**: I think just having an AUSA presence at your club events would help students with disabilities who do engage in your events to see that AUSA is here and we can support you in that way.
*33:51-34:00*

**Speaker 10**: Your second point about how I would liaise with the Disability Rights Officer.
*34:01-34:06*

**Speaker 10**: Just from my conversations with Lola, the current Wellbeing Equity Vice President, I understand this role as one that sort of overarches every other role.
*34:08-34:16*

**Speaker 10**: And so it would be important to me in this position to take the time of my day, weekly, to look at working with every single office holder and that also begins with the Disability Rights Officer.
*34:16-34:30*

**Speaker 10**: I already do it in a club that I'm involved with and an Equity Officer for and it definitely will translate well into this role as well.
*34:30-34:37*

**Speaker 1**: All right.
*34:40-34:40*

**Speaker 1**: For the next, we have time for one more question.
*34:41-34:43*

**Speaker 1**: We do need this to be quite a snappy answer, so please just make sure you're keeping it to one sentence as we're about to run out.
*34:44-34:50*

**Speaker 12**: I mean, Tina and Roto, I'm Riley, and I'm also a disability rights officer.
*34:51-34:55*

**Speaker 12**: My question is for Cid Hill.
*34:56-34:57*

**Speaker 12**: So many students, including disabled students, but all students, struggle to access events and find out about them.
*35:00-35:08*

**Speaker 12**: And I think this is an equity issue, because if you can't access events, how are you supposed to take part?
*35:09-35:14*

**Speaker 12**: what would you do if you were elected to make this more accessible?
*35:14-35:18*

**Speaker 6**: Thank you, Raleigh.
*35:22-35:23*

**Speaker 6**: Do you mean like, finding out initially about the events or actually physical access?
*35:25-35:29*

**Speaker 6**: Finding out at the event.
*35:30-35:31*

**Speaker 6**: Both?
*35:32-35:32*

**Speaker 6**: I think finding out is very much, kind of, I think a lot.
*35:33-35:38*

**Speaker 6**: I know there's a lot of events that I've heard about that have been in the past I haven't known about them myself, whether that's just because the post has been lost on Instagram or the poster was somewhere where I just couldn't see.
*35:38-35:52*

**Speaker 6**: I think if these clubs were kind of promoting their events or like an event map, I know that like AUX does that, especially on club time, then you know that there's events coming up and to remain involved with those.
*35:53-36:05*

**Speaker 6**: If clubs, when they're posting, can add like alternative text for people who struggle to read them or see them properly.
*36:06-36:13*

**Speaker 6**: That would be good.
*36:14-36:15*

**Speaker 6**: Making them accessible, making sure that there's, you know, things like wheelchair access or very straightforward instructions, not just a sped up video of you running to whatever room you're posting it in.
*36:16-36:26*

**Speaker 6**: I think that'd be, that'd be at least a start.
*36:26-36:28*

**Speaker 1**: All right, thank you very much.
*36:29-36:30*

**Speaker 1**: Can we get a round of applause for all of our incredible candidates?
*36:30-36:33*

**Speaker 1**: They all have some great policies.
*36:33-36:35*

**Speaker 1**: Thank you very much for coming and speaking.
*36:35-36:37*

**Speaker 1**: And it is really important that you guys are all running for these positions.
*36:37-36:40*

**Speaker 1**: So regardless of what happens, I wish you all the best.
*36:41-36:43*

**Speaker 1**: Thank you very much.
*36:44-36:45*

**Speaker 1**: We will have a five-minute intermission before we begin our engagement vice president debates.
*36:45-36:49*

**Speaker 1**: See you all in a sec.
*36:49-36:50*

**Speaker 13**: I don't think it's working.
*37:07-37:10*

**Speaker 13**: I think it's honestly better for you to be looking at it and then just like tell them, like five minutes, and we'll tell the candidates to like watch.
*37:10-37:16*

**Speaker 4**: Some of them like viewers who really like Taki, but it's good for him.
*37:17-37:22*

**Speaker 4**: But for like I don't know about her baby, she's really nervous when you start with her.
*37:23-37:28*

**Speaker 4**: Yeah, I'm thinking maybe this month or just not have it.
*37:28-37:32*

**Speaker 4**: Only three for all?
*37:33-37:33*

**Speaker 13**: I think, I don't care about what they do.
*37:34-37:36*

**Speaker 13**: Because I don't think it's going to work.
*37:38-37:39*

**Speaker 13**: So you just...
*37:40-37:42*

**Speaker 4**: Because they feel they work.
*37:43-37:44*

**Speaker 14**: Yeah, yeah, I think it's good for you to just clean it up when it's our time.
*37:44-37:47*

**Speaker 14**: And we'll just have it all between now.
*37:47-37:49*

**Speaker 8**: I'm so impressed with you, you're all right?
*37:57-37:58*

**Speaker 8**: Yeah, I'm so impressed with you.
*37:59-38:00*

**Speaker 8**: All right.
*38:04-38:05*

**Speaker 15**: It's so good.
*38:06-38:06*

**Speaker 15**: We're at our engagement.
*38:07-38:08*

**Speaker 15**: We're at our engagement.
*38:10-38:11*

**Speaker 14**: No, we'll probably finish this at 12:30.
*38:23-38:25*

**Speaker 16**: Wait, we'll probably finish this at...
*38:27-38:28*

**Speaker 16**: We're fine, we're pretty on time.
*38:29-38:30*

**Speaker 16**: We're a little bit late.
*38:31-38:31*

**Speaker 14**: We'll probably start this a bit, finish this early.
*38:32-38:35*

**Speaker 16**: Engagement.
*38:36-38:36*

**Speaker 14**: Yeah, we'll probably finish it at 12.
*38:37-38:37*

**Speaker 16**: Education, postgraduate, undergraduate.
*38:44-38:45*

**Speaker 16**: Attendant meet and greet.
*38:46-38:47*

**Speaker 16**: Yeah.
*38:48-38:48*

**Speaker 16**: Look at that.
*38:48-38:49*

**Speaker 4**: Just more social media.
*38:49-38:52*

**Speaker 4**: Yeah, just the more social aspects.
*38:52-38:53*

**Speaker 2**: And then you have the best.
*38:54-38:54*

**Speaker 4**: And then the best.
*38:54-38:55*

**Speaker 2**: Good questions.
*38:58-38:59*

**Speaker 17**: Good questions.
*39:08-39:09*

**Speaker 17**: It's just a bit of
*39:09-39:13*

**Speaker 3**: - I think I'm gonna talk.
*39:39-39:48*

**Speaker 3**: I don't know what you're saying.
*40:39-40:41*

**Speaker 4**: Rachel!
*40:43-40:44*

**Speaker 4**: I'm gonna
*41:07-41:09*

**Speaker 3**: There's one there and then there's one there.
*41:41-41:42*

**Speaker 4**: Could we get all the engagement VP candidates to come to the front?
*41:43-41:46*

**Speaker 4**: If you want to fit, you can fit in the order that we put you guys in.
*41:55-41:58*

**Speaker 18**: I feel like it's okay if you guys just wait until like Xavier comes down and stuff.
*42:04-42:08*

**Speaker 18**: - Yeah, we're getting cute little photos or something.
*42:08-42:11*

**Speaker 4**: Do you guys want to sit on the order that we put you in?
*42:43-42:46*

**Speaker 4**: So, save your grass and we'll be in the middle and then sign your high.
*42:46-42:49*

**Speaker 4**: Just FYI in terms of how timing is going to work.
*42:52-42:54*

**Speaker 4**: So, Brina here, raise your hand, Brina.
*42:54-42:56*

**Speaker 4**: She will be keeping time.
*42:57-42:58*

**Speaker 4**: So, Rachel is briefly on how long you have to answer each of the questions and follow-up questions.
*42:58-43:03*

**Speaker 4**: And she will raise her hand when there's five seconds left.
*43:04-43:06*

**Speaker 4**: so please close off your sentence when she knows that, okay?
*43:06-43:08*

**Speaker 1**: All right, we're going to get this started.
*43:10-43:12*

**Speaker 1**: Tēnā koutou kātou, nō mai haere mai.
*43:12-43:15*

**Speaker 1**: If you weren't here for the last debate, my name is Amelia.
*43:15-43:18*

**Speaker 1**: I'm one of the moderators for this session.
*43:18-43:19*

**Speaker 1**: Kia ora, I'm Jessica.
*43:20-43:21*

**Speaker 1**: In this session, you are going to hear directly from the student candidate standing in this year's election to represent you at the University of Auckland.
*43:22-43:29*

**Speaker 1**: This round is our engagement vice president, so they play a big role in student culture on campus, so I'm sure everyone who is here today has a lot to say about that.
*43:30-43:39*

**Speaker 1**: For our debate's rules, each candidate will have one minute to answer the moderator's questions.
*43:40-43:44*

**Speaker 1**: Follow-up questions may be asked with 30 seconds to respond.
*43:45-43:48*

**Speaker 1**: Moderators will keep time and ensure that rules are followed.
*43:49-43:51*

**Speaker 1**: Only the candidate being addressed should respond to a question.
*43:52-43:55*

**Speaker 1**: And candidates must uphold the university's zero-tolerance policy on bullying, harassment, and discrimination at all times.
*43:56-44:03*

**Speaker 1**: please do not interrupt the other candidates while they are speaking.
*44:03-44:06*

**Speaker 1**: Now that we've covered the rules, let us meet our candidate.
*44:07-44:10*

**Speaker 1**: Each of you will be given one minute to introduce themselves and tell us a bit about your past experiences and some of your policies coming into this year.
*44:10-44:18*

**Speaker 6**: Kia ora, again, if you're just running now.
*44:21-44:24*

**Speaker 6**: I'm Xavier.
*44:24-44:24*

**Speaker 6**: I do a conjoint BA in global studies in my second year.
*44:25-44:29*

**Speaker 6**: I'm kind of the same skill as before. I have experience working with local council as well as many years of student council back when I was in school.
*44:33-44:41*

**Speaker 6**: I've had a lot of leadership staff working on film sets and working with large crowds of mixed types of people, introverts, extroverts.
*44:42-44:51*

**Speaker 19**: Kira, I'm Olunda. I'm a second year communication student.
*44:56-44:59*

**Speaker 19**: My past experiences that I bring to the table are as a communications faculty rep for 1.5 years.
*45:00-45:06*

**Speaker 19**: I am the AES Digital Media Officer and also a social media intern with AESA.
*45:07-45:12*

**Speaker 19**: I have also recently established a communications and media at the society within the university, which will start next month.
*45:13-45:20*

**Speaker 19**: So definitely very important to the community engagement.
*45:20-45:24*

**Speaker 19**: The policies that I would bring to the table would be to rewrite student initiatives, to bring the Maori concept of co-design, and also set for the listening hub.
*45:25-45:36*

**Speaker 20**: Hello, my name is Sonia. I'm a second year law and global studies student.
*45:39-45:43*

**Speaker 20**: Currently, I am an events coordinator under the AUSA Engagement Committee, the Marketing Director for Public Policy Club, and one of the the director of creative designs in Filmsoft.
*45:44-45:56*

**Speaker 20**: This year, my policies are surrounding more focusing on clubs and student engagement and doing more for students, by students.
*45:57-46:07*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect.
*46:10-46:10*

**Speaker 1**: And just before we get started as well, we do ask all of our candidates to declare any conflicts of interest.
*46:11-46:16*

**Speaker 1**: This is largely just political conflicts of interest.
*46:16-46:19*

**Speaker 1**: If you're a member of any political parties, does anyone have anything to declare?
*46:19-46:22*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect, sweet. So we will move on to our first question. Engagement obviously encompasses a white umbrella of things, but we are asking what does engagement mean to you?
*46:24-46:34*

**Speaker 20**: To me, engagement is like, it's not just about numbers, it's about creating a community where students feel like welcomed and excited to be there.
*46:37-46:48*

**Speaker 19**: Two certain engagements to me would be a place where students feel generally invited to participate, like they have actual influence and that they can help co-design clients.
*46:50-47:01*

**Speaker 19**: This is what I'm bringing with my policy to the team.
*47:01-47:04*

**Speaker 6**: I agree it's not just about numbers, it's about keeping people involved, not just having everyone show up for one big event, people engaged, keeping people coming throughout the entire semester if not a year.
*47:06-47:20*

**Speaker 4**: And then following up on that, what is everyone's first initiative as engagement vice president what would that look like coming with you, Sabine?
*47:21-47:29*

**Speaker 6**: That's a big question. I think the engagement itself but like equitable engagement.
*47:35-47:43*

**Speaker 6**: I have obviously a lot to do with equity within my policies, making sure things are accessible from kind of the start and not just kind of bringing it in throughout the year.
*47:43-47:58*

**Speaker 6**: I want to try so that everyone can start the semester on a roll and then continue that.
*47:58-48:03*

**Speaker 19**: My first submission would be definitely actualizing the policy of core design that I'm talking So, as for now, the events that are organized are quite essential, wherein they come up with the events, they come up with how to execute them, whereas I would like to open up a forum where students can send them ideas and whichever idea gets the most votes maybe per month there would be one event wherein students get to work from the beginning to the end of that event and actualize their ideas.
*48:07-48:39*

**Speaker 20**: I think my first initiative would be bringing more people together because a lot of faculties across campus are very segregated and a lot of them don't really interact with one another unless you're doing a conjoint or something.
*48:42-48:56*

**Speaker 20**: So definitely trying to do more things that bring all faculties together across all the different campuses, so the city, Boston, and possibly the South as well.
*48:57-49:07*

**Speaker 1**: Cool. Just sort of on the end of that, this is a question for all of the candidates.
*49:08-49:14*

**Speaker 1**: Student engagement is a big pressing issue on campus.
*49:15-49:18*

**Speaker 1**: Students are historically under-engaged in person.
*49:18-49:21*

**Speaker 1**: What do you guys see as some of the biggest barriers to student engagement on campus at the moment?
*49:22-49:26*

**Speaker 1**: And we'll start with Rosanna.
*49:26-49:27*

**Speaker 20**: Yeah, so like I said, obviously a lot of our faculties are segregated.
*49:29-49:33*

**Speaker 20**: And also information is just like kind of all over the place.
*49:34-49:37*

**Speaker 20**: So it's very overwhelming.
*49:37-49:39*

**Speaker 20**: You don't know where to look or there's just so many things to look at that you don't know what to look at.
*49:39-49:45*

**Speaker 20**: So that brings me to my policy on making a centralized student calendar.
*49:45-49:49*

**Speaker 20**: So that means all the events would be in one place.
*49:49-49:52*

**Speaker 20**: You can see, oh, today this club has this event or this other club has this event.
*49:52-49:56*

**Speaker 20**: So then that caters to all different types of needs and interests.
*49:57-50:00*

**Speaker 19**: That's a good one.
*50:03-50:04*

**Speaker 19**: Definitely visibility and accessibility is one issue.
*50:05-50:08*

**Speaker 19**: ALEOS is very visible, they do offer a lot of services, but people don't really feel like they're representative of their interests.
*50:08-50:15*

**Speaker 19**: These services, when students try to reach out for help, as of now students have to go through multiple links and messages and even then make appointments by email for actual advice.
*50:16-50:25*

**Speaker 19**: I would try to set up an actual query form where students looking for help can directly ask for help when they need it and someone to respond to that with them maybe the same way at max.
*50:26-50:37*

**Speaker 6**: Could you repeat the question, Sarah?
*50:41-50:42*

**Speaker 1**: How are, what do you think the biggest barriers to engagement on campus are at the moment?
*50:43-50:47*

**Speaker 6**: Kind of what has been mentioned is accessibility, especially for our both our dislaveled and our Akatakui students.
*50:50-51:00*

**Speaker 6**: I think on a base level, it can be a lot of clashes.
*51:01-51:04*

**Speaker 6**: Some event times are when people still have classes, and then it's less likely to show up.
*51:05-51:08*

**Speaker 6**: A lot of events are held on the same days at the same times.
*51:09-51:11*

**Speaker 6**: I know that I'm in multiple clubs that have the same event times weekly, and it's really hard to be able to keep attending things like that.
*51:12-51:20*

**Speaker 6**: As well as when events run late at night.
*51:20-51:23*

**Speaker 6**: It's hard for a lot of students who rely on public transport to kind of manage their time to be able to get back home and then will be able to come to and from an event.
*51:24-51:33*

**Speaker 6**: And I think people should take into account more of that sort of stuff.
*51:34-51:36*

**Speaker 1**: Yeah, so obviously there are sort of, I think, over 200 clubs on campus. Is that right, Emma?
*51:37-51:42*

**Speaker 1**: Yeah? Yeah? Oh, over 200 clubs. Over 300? Yeah, around 300 clubs on campus.
*51:43-51:50*

**Speaker 1**: That is a lot of clubs, that is a lot of information.
*51:50-51:52*

**Speaker 1**: You guys have all sort of proposed initiatives that relate to clubs.
*51:53-51:57*

**Speaker 1**: How are you going to make sure that those 300 clubs are engaged equitably?
*51:57-52:01*

**Speaker 1**: And how are you going to ensure that this isn't sort of information overload for students?
*52:01-52:05*

**Speaker 6**: That's a really good question.
*52:09-52:10*

**Speaker 6**: I think starting with the basics when it comes to smaller clubs, helping them kind of keep their traction throughout the year so they don't just kind of die off.
*52:10-52:20*

**Speaker 6**: Because I think a lot of those smaller and more niche clubs are still really important to a lot of people.
*52:21-52:25*

**Speaker 6**: So kind of upholding that stuff.
*52:26-52:27*

**Speaker 6**: For kind of overall engagement within the clubs, I think it'd be really smart to have representatives from some of those clubs be able to access or be part of the engagement committee so that we have more the voice of a lot of the publicists.
*52:29-52:48*

**Speaker 19**: The first proposal that I have is about revitalizing student clubs.
*52:54-52:59*

**Speaker 19**: From being in club, I'm aware that currently clubs face issues because of grants and funding.
*53:00-53:04*

**Speaker 19**: I don't feel like just because the club isn't able to write as effectively as they should, it should be taxed about how much they're stealing from the university in terms of supporting resources.
*53:05-53:14*

**Speaker 19**: So I'm trying to set up a system wherein a monetary and financial exchange of resources wouldn't be the only resource available.
*53:15-53:21*

**Speaker 19**: Maybe a club with bigger budgeting could reach out to a club that doesn't have as many resources but they have human skills which they could provide.
*53:22-53:29*

**Speaker 19**: So that would be a beneficial sort of relationship for both the clubs involved and that would bring more visibility and engagement to both of those clubs at a good time.
*53:29-53:38*

**Speaker 4**: Just to follow up on that answer, how would you implement this realistically?
*53:38-53:42*

**Speaker 19**: Definitely maybe set up a portal for some clubs who are looking for financial help from the club or financial collab.
*53:43-53:50*

**Speaker 19**: They could set up a request form where they would say that, "Hey, I'm looking for this amount of events, this is the sort of thing we're doing," and also provide information on what services we could offer in exchange.
*53:50-54:00*

**Speaker 19**: Whereas the other clubs who are looking for these services are a wider audience, could look at these request forms that have bigger budget issues again and could offer their budgeting and resource allocation with those clubs.
*54:00-54:12*

**Speaker 4**: Would this not add a lot of work, I guess, in terms of having to manage all of those homes on top of your other responsibilities?
*54:13-54:19*

**Speaker 19**: Well, there is an engagement committee and I'm sure there would be students who would love to take part in more student community engagement roles.
*54:21-54:28*

**Speaker 19**: So there would be definitely people who would be up to doing that.
*54:28-54:30*

**Speaker 19**: I feel like it would bring in a lot of experience for students to engage with each other and actually take part in student leadership, as well as I feel like there would be a good that work they've set up for themselves.
*54:31-54:42*

**Speaker 19**: So they wouldn't be holding up the paperback.
*54:43-54:45*

**Speaker 19**: Thank you.
*54:46-54:46*

**Speaker 20**: Could you repeat the question, please?
*54:49-54:50*

**Speaker 1**: What are the barriers to student engagement that you see as most pressing crime?
*54:51-54:54*

**Speaker 1**: Oh, sorry, your answer.
*54:56-54:58*

**Speaker 4**: It was about the engagement overload, and I think specifically because you mentioned in your answer that you would put like an engagement calendar with all of the events, where would you advertise this?
*55:00-55:11*

**Speaker 4**: Would students actually engage?
*55:11-55:12*

**Speaker 4**: And how would you get clubs to give you all that information?
*55:13-55:15*

**Speaker 20**: I think definitely advertising it on Instagram because a lot of students nowadays are obviously on Instagram and social media.
*55:19-55:27*

**Speaker 20**: And I know that AUSA does have a TikTok as well, so we can advertise on there.
*55:27-55:31*

**Speaker 20**: It is like, it doesn't receive a lot of engagement right now what I have seen and looked at. But obviously I think doing it more consistently and just like, yeah, just more consistently does boost engagement. Sorry, what was the second part?
*55:32-55:54*

**Speaker 4**: How would you get clubs to, I guess, put their events on that?
*55:54-55:58*

**Speaker 20**: I think it's just like contacting clubs as well because I know that a lot of clubs do have events planned like a few weeks before they actually like you know have them posted out to their um their community so just like contacting them being like hey like would you like to be a part of this like it would be like a really great way to like get more people to come to your events
*55:59-56:19*

**Speaker 1**: and so on so thank you sorry i got lost my own question that you guys are doing such a good job at discussing things um just one final question before we move on to policy scrutiny i see that we've got some of our candidates for postgraduate education vice president here one of the big issues that we've been hearing from postgraduate students is a lack of engagement in that space how do you propose to work with the postgraduate students officer and the postgraduate education vice president to make sure that postgraduate students find these events accessible there are lots of i guess comments from the community that a usa seems like an undergraduate only club.
*56:19-56:52*

**Speaker 20**: Definitely working with both of those roles and getting them to talk to their community to see what postgrad students want and what type of events they would like to see and then taking from that we would host more events that cater to not just undergrad but also postgrad as well.
*56:55-57:11*

**Speaker 20**: So it wouldn't just be like an opportunity party.
*57:12-57:15*

**Speaker 20**: It could be like panel and stuff like that.
*57:16-57:19*

**Speaker 19**: One issue that I have noticed is that a lot of students are looking at undergrad students, whereas for postgrad there would be maybe one of them for a month.
*57:22-57:31*

**Speaker 19**: There would be specifically for postgrad, so I feel like that creates quite an extension between the two, whereas the other might feel like they are receiving less events.
*57:32-57:39*

**Speaker 19**: This would be again to set up joint events where they receive support from the undergrad community as well, they get to participate in a wider community of events and get together when they wouldn't feel like they only have specific events for themselves at quite a less amount.
*57:40-57:56*

**Speaker 6**: I think it'd be really important to find out what clubs are more popular with post grades and
*58:04-58:10*

**Speaker 1**: master students and then kind of I think I think the issue at the moment is that clubs are seen very much as an undergraduate space so in general there's like a lack of representation across the board so how would you how would you start even engaging with those communities and encouraging clubs to engage with postgraduate students I think I'd work with the postgrad like officers engagement
*58:10-58:35*

**Speaker 6**: people to really push them to attend things like clubs expose and make sure that clubs are aware that undergrads though they are the majority are not the only students here making sure things are accessible obviously a lot of post-graders have a lot going on so i know that the workload itself can be one of those barriers but just opening up that conversation and seeing you know what kind of things those shoes specifically would benefit from when it comes to accessibility to the wider range I think it would be a good conversation to have, and then we'll be able to plan for them now.
*58:35-59:09*

**Speaker 6**: Perfect, thank you.
*59:09-59:10*

**Speaker 6**: And we will move on to specific policy scrutiny.
*59:10-59:13*

**Speaker 1**: Jeff?
*59:14-59:14*

**Speaker 4**: Starting with Samuel, because you're on call to Mike, what engagement events do you want to continue that were successful in bringing energy back to campus?
*59:16-59:26*

**Speaker 6**: I think more recently was things like the cultural event.
*59:28-59:32*

**Speaker 6**: I think it was really cool to see all the different performance.
*59:32-59:35*

**Speaker 6**: and then acknowledge a lot of people from them who are the only people from their culture and be able to share that with the rest of our school because Auckland itself and Aotearoa as a whole is very diverse. We're huge mixing cultures and I think it's only right to celebrate that and push for things like that.
*59:35-59:55*

**Speaker 6**: Yeah, that's kind of the main one that's in my mind at the moment.
*59:57-59:59*

**Speaker 6**: So I think more events that kind of embody our diversity as a university and engage international students as well as university.
*59:59-01:00:08*

**Speaker 4**: And what kind of new ideas do you have for events and why do you specifically think that those events would attract better engagement?
*01:00:09-01:00:16*

**Speaker 6**: I have a couple that I've kind of poorly at the moment but nothing's set in stone.
*01:00:18-01:00:24*

**Speaker 6**: I think it would be important to get engagement to some of the current events, like pushing for more people to come and watch a lot of the sporting events and things like waka'ama, and really kind of celebrating a lot of international holidays, whether that's Lunar New Year or whether that is, you know, Makariki and stuff.
*01:00:24-01:00:46*

**Speaker 6**: I think if we push for bigger events around those times, it would kind of really hold to that.
*01:00:46-01:00:51*

**Speaker 1**: Awesome. Right. And Mulya, what experience do you have in sort of, you talk a lot about your sort of media experience, what about an on in-person engagement? What can you offer
*01:00:56-01:01:07*

**Speaker 19**: there? As my role in digital media officer within ASA, my responsibilities so far haven't included in direct event related engagement, but I do believe that I have a strong role in building and mobilizing community support. Again, as I was trying to build my communications and media club, I was able to mobilize a huge amount of support from under that and post that both. That was through reaching out to staff members, circulating all of the message of the information and also letting students know what they would get out of that experience from actually being part of the club and the executive.
*01:01:08-01:01:44*

**Speaker 19**: Secondly, within ASA, I have led the initiative of increasing our digital responsiveness in contact portfolio.
*01:01:45-01:01:51*

**Speaker 19**: I do build semester reports where this time I have reported that I built our increase of digital responsiveness by 2300%, whereas our joint marketing team has increased our account impressions by 1600%, which I feel is quite a lot of work that you see from students that would translate into actual student engagement in events.
*01:01:53-01:02:16*

**Speaker 1**: I guess beyond the sort of just increasing direct engagement, the engagement officer does deal a lot with logistics and planning of events.
*01:02:16-01:02:25*

**Speaker 1**: How would you sort of make up for that lack of experience there, do you think?
*01:02:27-01:02:31*

**Speaker 19**: I don't think that I have a lack of experience in that first place.
*01:02:33-01:02:36*

**Speaker 19**: I have experienced mobilizing event support, just not within the university.
*01:02:36-01:02:41*

**Speaker 19**: I have personally interned with another company within India where there's an arts festival that receives like quite two to three thousand attendees per year.
*01:02:42-01:02:53*

**Speaker 19**: It's an annual event.
*01:02:53-01:02:54*

**Speaker 19**: It receives international support.
*01:02:54-01:02:56*

**Speaker 19**: You can actually look it up.
*01:02:56-01:02:57*

**Speaker 19**: It's called the Serendipity Arts Festival, where I was responsible for reaching out to people building coaching relationships and again bringing them to events and planning the industry. Perfect. Alright.
*01:02:57-01:03:10*

**Speaker 4**: Um, in terms of transparency, sorry back to Amulya, I just have one more question.
*01:03:12-01:03:17*

**Speaker 4**: In terms of your policy for transparency, as engagement VP, what control do you have as a top-down transparency policy? Do you mean top-down from the universe? Do you know that
*01:03:18-01:03:30*

**Speaker 19**: or do you mean about being AAS ethical?
*01:03:30-01:03:32*

**Speaker 19**: Yes.
*01:03:32-01:03:32*

**Speaker 4**: Top down, over the risk, over, I guess, the control that you would hold as an engaging VP?
*01:03:33-01:03:37*

**Speaker 19**: From the 2024 edition of the AAS Constitution, as far as I know, there isn't a direct control that AAS will hold over uni policies.
*01:03:38-01:03:47*

**Speaker 19**: A transparency policy from the university would be a clear direction of how they're reaching the decisions that they're reaching, about doing engaged students and their lives, but as engagement, a control that I would have would be able to push for a clearer process wherein they have to make sure that they're not only releasing what agreements and decisions are reached, but how they exactly reach them, what issues were considered, and what issues were decided, so students know what issues are being actively heard and taken seriously.
*01:03:48-01:04:20*

**Speaker 4**: Moving on to Sanya.
*01:04:25-01:04:26*

**Speaker 4**: In terms of your policies, a lot of your policies are very engagement intensive and logistically challenging.
*01:04:29-01:04:36*

**Speaker 4**: For example, we read about you visiting halls and also when you talked about creating that events calendar.
*01:04:37-01:04:42*

**Speaker 4**: Are you confident that you and the engagement committee would be able to commit to everything that you promised within the one year span that you would be in office?
*01:04:43-01:04:51*

**Speaker 20**: Yes, because I'm only working in the engagement community, so I know what the workload is and I know what's realistic.
*01:04:53-01:05:00*

**Speaker 20**: That is what I base my policies on, on being realistic and that it's achievable.
*01:05:01-01:05:06*

**Speaker 20**: And engagement isn't just like, I'm not going to be working on engagement alone.
*01:05:06-01:05:11*

**Speaker 20**: I'll be working with the engagement committee to go through all those policies that I promised and making sure that they're all done properly.
*01:05:11-01:05:20*

**Speaker 4**: Just to follow up on that, does that not place a lot of pressure on your committee to do a lot of work and they're volunteering their time and they won't be paid for their hours like you are?
*01:05:21-01:05:30*

**Speaker 20**: I don't think that there will be a lot of pressure because what I've done, like, what I've, like, released as policies is based on what we have done this year.
*01:05:31-01:05:40*

**Speaker 20**: And I'm not, like, making anything new but, like, going off on what has worked.
*01:05:40-01:05:44*

**Speaker 20**: Okay, thank you.
*01:05:47-01:05:48*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect. And moving back to, I guess, what's our next segment, what's hot on campus. Engagement, again, always a pressing issue. You guys have talked a lot about engaging people on social media, but there is definitely a potential to suggest that that only engages the students who are currently engaged.
*01:05:51-01:06:08*

**Speaker 1**: Students on campus face a lot of barriers to engaging beyond just not having access to the information.
*01:06:09-01:06:14*

**Speaker 1**: For some, it's been recognised that there's a sort of apathy or a lack of interest in engaging with AUSA.
*01:06:14-01:06:19*

**Speaker 1**: How are you going to appeal to students who might not necessarily even have the time to engage with AUSA through events?
*01:06:20-01:06:27*

**Speaker 1**: What are your ideas around that beyond social media?
*01:06:29-01:06:32*

**Speaker 20**: I think definitely more like face-to-face because it's like a lot of people don't know what AUSA is and a lot of people like don't check it out online. So definitely holding more pop-ups and being like, hey, this is what we offer and we can do more adjustments. These are like the services that we have. And not just making the pop-up stream like a week, but also doing like just like throughout the semester. So like fortnightly or like maybe a month if I can fortnightly would be better.
*01:06:34-01:07:02*

**Speaker 20**: What would these pop-ups actually look like?
*01:07:03-01:07:05*

**Speaker 20**: I think just the stall and being like, hey, this is what we have, this is what you can do with us.
*01:07:05-01:07:10*

**Speaker 1**: But do you think students are actually, if there's a stall with the AUSA post, are students actually going to see that and want to come over and talk?
*01:07:11-01:07:17*

**Speaker 1**: Or are they just going to walk past?
*01:07:20-01:07:22*

**Speaker 20**: You see all these people out here in the lobby doing right now.
*01:07:22-01:07:24*

**Speaker 20**: I think we could do little mini games or something, or just something that will have them come over.
*01:07:25-01:07:31*

**Speaker 20**: like you could do like oh you could do this and like maybe when a prize model then just like standing there and sitting and talking to them
*01:07:31-01:07:37*

**Speaker 1**: and what about the students who don't come to campus
*01:07:38-01:07:40*

**Speaker 20**: online i think yeah i'm not really sure how to answer that one sorry
*01:07:47-01:07:51*

**Speaker 1**: no that's okay um we'll pass on to it more yeah so the initial question was about how are you going to engage groups of students that are sort of already not interested in or disengaged with a USA.
*01:07:52-01:08:01*

**Speaker 19**: That's actually related directly to the third policy that I'm proposing, which is sent from the list seen in her. There is definitely, I feel in my opinion, a lot of focus on inclusivity in terms of cultural representation, sexualities, genders, but what I feel like is lacking right now is academic inclusivity, whereas it is in terms of newer faculties and postgraduate students as we mentioned. It is the students through the staff members that could be engaged. We could directly convene the staff members to put out those announcements to students who are coming in class or on campus. That's one way to mobilize student support for any students who aren't coming to campus but would definitely see those announcements and would have a general idea of what's going on that's specifically targeted to them. With academic inclusivity, our staff members
*01:08:03-01:08:53*

**Speaker 1**: on campus last year we had many protests with the TEU staff members are already sort of overworked and underpaid for the amount of work that they're doing do you think that this adds more to their workload than what academic staff have necessarily signed up for in their role as just academic staff
*01:08:53-01:09:09*

**Speaker 19**: i don't feel it would be that rare because mostly it would be not only to be academic staff that is relevant to whatever event that is being reached out of that secondly there would be a lot of work that would be put into to reduce their workload as a very clear announcement that they just definitely need to copy in place into their announcements together it wouldn't be something that they would have to think a lot over or have to put in a lot of effort that they're
*01:09:10-01:09:34*

**Speaker 1**: really good in what's wrong and how i guess are you going to sort of figure out who these academic staff are that these events are relevant to and again doesn't that bring a lot of work onto you as engagement vice president to do a lot of people searching for staff who are relevant to these
*01:09:34-01:09:50*

**Speaker 19**: I feel like that, research is part of any possession. The information about what staff members are and what faculty is very easily available online.
*01:09:51-01:10:01*

**Speaker 19**: That's what the university does really when. So literally it's just about one search, making maybe one Excel spreadsheet and just reaching out with the same announcement to all of them if they would be able to help with that.
*01:10:02-01:10:13*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect. And Samuel. What was the first? I've forgotten it now. What was it, Jess? Thank you.
*01:10:14-01:10:21*

**Speaker 4**: We are asking about students that are disengaged with AUSA. How would you engage them beyond social media?
*01:10:23-01:10:29*

**Speaker 6**: I feel like it's already been really well answered by these two. I also thought about having the stall up.
*01:10:33-01:10:38*

**Speaker 6**: It's very much about having a lot more ASA presence that is not just at things like you know orientation and O week and stuff but like events throughout the year. Like I know that there was ASA presence at things like Culture Fest and at like the Alcestry party and things like that.
*01:10:39-01:10:56*

**Speaker 6**: Those kind of bigger events. I think it'd be important to have them attend solo events as well even if it's people who are on the committee or one of us or whatever go to our club events and promote a USA, you know, if that's something they want to do. For like students off campus, if they're, depending if it's a health reason sort of thing compared to people who just don't come into campus, I think that really affects how we can approach it. If obviously it's a health thing, you can kind of try and do online things. I know something I did with my friends during COVID a lot was playing games from the school of like game phone and I think that was really fun to do and you know you can get a little bit of your beer to your lounge as well. But yeah I think just really kind of pushing over engagement.
*01:10:56-01:11:49*

**Speaker 4**: I guess just to follow up on that school's question, similar to what Amelia asked on it, do you think students would actually engage with those So it's still considering that students sometimes don't even come to EEC events in general.
*01:11:51-01:12:04*

**Speaker 6**: I think they do. I know that when I am doing things like Open Day or when I'm doing uni guide stuff, I always push that if you're going to sign up for anything, EEC is a good one to start with.
*01:12:06-01:12:18*

**Speaker 6**: Not just because of, obviously it's big on engagement, but they streamline a lot of things.
*01:12:19-01:12:25*

**Speaker 6**: I think kind of what's happening is like having some sort of interactive thing to draw people over.
*01:12:27-01:12:33*

**Speaker 6**: Because there's a lot of people who, if you're just standing there to talk, won't feel comfortable talking to you.
*01:12:33-01:12:38*

**Speaker 6**: They'd rather kind of fixate on a free, you know, Mentos or something like that.
*01:12:38-01:12:42*

**Speaker 1**: Yeah, and I feel like something, you guys have already touched well on what AUSA can do.
*01:12:43-01:12:49*

**Speaker 1**: We have, again, as we've said, around 300 clubs on campus.
*01:12:50-01:12:53*

**Speaker 1**: Something I feel like hasn't sort of been explored as much is how would you guys engage with and mobilize clubs to actually support their student communities?
*01:12:53-01:13:01*

**Speaker 1**: Because obviously there are a lot of clubs who are already doing great work engaging with their students.
*01:13:01-01:13:06*

**Speaker 1**: What really quick 30 seconds because we do want to open questions to the crowd.
*01:13:07-01:13:10*

**Speaker 1**: How are you guys planning on working with clubs beyond just the themed weeks tender?
*01:13:11-01:13:16*

**Speaker 1**: We can go to-- does anyone have an answer that they've got?
*01:13:30-01:13:33*

**Speaker 19**: Selena has actually done really great work in that sphere.
*01:13:34-01:13:38*

**Speaker 19**: I think we set up the All About E-mails channels, wherein we've received direct updates about what AES is doing and how they can be more engaged with that.
*01:13:38-01:13:46*

**Speaker 19**: I think that's a great initiative and definitely would want to continue that.
*01:13:46-01:13:50*

**Speaker 19**: More than that, it would be an entering of the systems of where clubs who aren't receiving enough support could have a channel to reach out to support for different services that would mean that wouldn't be exclusively AUSA, but rather building a community engagement within each other as good at once.
*01:13:50-01:14:07*

**Speaker 20**: One of the policies that I have is doing a club spotlight series.
*01:14:11-01:14:15*

**Speaker 20**: So this is definitely focusing more on your clubs and small niche clubs.
*01:14:15-01:14:19*

**Speaker 20**: Obviously not because everyone doesn't know what, so we have 300 clubs, not everyone knows what those clubs are.
*01:14:20-01:14:25*

**Speaker 20**: So if we focus on the more niche ones or like smaller ones, they can definitely gain more attraction and engagement in those clubs.
*01:14:25-01:14:34*

**Speaker 6**: I had a bit of brain foam just before.
*01:14:38-01:14:40*

**Speaker 6**: I think adapting not to rules but guidelines to push for inclusivity to keep your club members updated on things.
*01:14:41-01:14:55*

**Speaker 6**: If you go quiet for a bit and don't rush to any events that can drop overall engagement and it can be able to pick that up again.
*01:14:55-01:15:02*

**Speaker 6**: I think just pushing for people to really reach out and communicate.
*01:15:02-01:15:08*

**Speaker 6**: If execs and the presidents are really busy and can't push events as often, if they can communicate that to their members, I feel like they'll feel a bit more secure and continuing.
*01:15:09-01:15:21*

**Speaker 1**: Great, sweet. And now, questions to the crowd. Does anyone have anything they would like to ask?
*01:15:21-01:15:26*

**Speaker 10**: You guys are doing amazing.
*01:15:32-01:15:34*

**Speaker 10**: Just regarding AUSA election specifically, if you were to enroll, if you were to get this position, what would you do differently next year to help improve voter turnout, especially probably directly towards postgraduate students as well?
*01:15:36-01:15:51*

**Speaker 6**: I myself am a big fan of people working together to promote, not necessarily endorsing specific people but just helping each other.
*01:15:56-01:16:06*

**Speaker 6**: I know that we've already spoken about this, but yes it's an election but that doesn't mean you can't support your friends who are running and stuff and making sure that people just in general that there is this election happening.
*01:16:06-01:16:21*

**Speaker 6**: As someone who's a class rep as well, I've spoken to my class about not being an effort for me kind of thing, but just being like, "Hey, are you aware that this is happening?" And there was actually quite a few who weren't.
*01:16:22-01:16:34*

**Speaker 6**: So kind of just pushing that that is happening.
*01:16:35-01:16:36*

**Speaker 6**: I think what's already going with having the little voting stall around has been really good.
*01:16:37-01:16:42*

**Speaker 6**: I've seen a lot of people engage with that.
*01:16:42-01:16:44*

**Speaker 6**: I just think it's communicating, talking to people face to face, obviously not trying of other people when you're obviously studying.
*01:16:45-01:16:52*

**Speaker 6**: But yeah, just kind of putting yourself out there is a good way to be familiar with your place on campus.
*01:16:52-01:16:58*

**Speaker 6**: Sweet.
*01:16:59-01:16:59*

**Speaker 19**: Yeah, I think that's really good policy.
*01:17:00-01:17:02*

**Speaker 19**: I and I have reached out and I have engaged with all other candidates even if they're in the same position as me.
*01:17:02-01:17:08*

**Speaker 19**: I've been keeping up with their campaigns and interacting with their boss even if it means that their policies might overtake mine.
*01:17:09-01:17:14*

**Speaker 19**: But that just means that students would get to see more of the good work that the other I'm being able to make the best decision for themselves.
*01:17:15-01:17:21*

**Speaker 19**: Definitely, I agree with everything that she said on that.
*01:17:23-01:17:26*

**Speaker 19**: That's a really good concept.
*01:17:26-01:17:27*

**Speaker 20**: I think both of the people before me, they brought up really good points.
*01:17:30-01:17:35*

**Speaker 20**: I also think maybe just doing more in lectures, because I haven't really noticed that.
*01:17:36-01:17:42*

**Speaker 20**: Just before class, I take a minute or two to be like, "Hey, this is happening.
*01:17:42-01:17:47*

**Speaker 20**: this is something you should engage in, this is something that affects your student life and
*01:17:48-01:17:52*

**Speaker 1**: overall life, your experience on campus. Sweet. Alright, for this next one, we'll try to keep the answers super short because we are running out of time. James? Unfortunately, I don't have a
*01:17:53-01:18:05*

**Speaker 2**: question that really can be answered shortly, but yeah, two parts. First of all, well, in general, The two organizations that AOC are currently Shadows, the bar, and Crackham.
*01:18:05-01:18:20*

**Speaker 2**: Firstly, Shadows.
*01:18:21-01:18:22*

**Speaker 2**: We've seen in the past it's been a great place to engage students.
*01:18:23-01:18:27*

**Speaker 2**: You know, people go over there and that sort of thing.
*01:18:27-01:18:29*

**Speaker 2**: But currently, I mean, I think everyone's aware of their current struggles.
*01:18:30-01:18:34*

**Speaker 2**: So what sort of plans do you have regarding Shadows, the bar?
*01:18:35-01:18:40*

**Speaker 2**: Also, okay, it's probably too much to unpack, so I'll go over there.
*01:18:41-01:18:45*

**Speaker 2**: But with Prattam as well, we've seen just, I think, last week, their announcement to sort of separate from AUSA.
*01:18:45-01:18:54*

**Speaker 2**: First of all, your thoughts on why they've chosen to do that, so maybe what AUSA's done wrong this year and in the past, and what you feel is the direction for them and your relationship with them going forward.
*01:18:54-01:19:07*

**Speaker 2**: I know that's a lot, sorry, but yeah.
*01:19:08-01:19:09*

**Speaker 2**: Okay, summarize, what's your plan about Shadows and engagement at Shadows and its future and basically the same with Crackham, your relationship with Crackham?
*01:19:11-01:19:23*

**Speaker 4**: I'm planning with you.
*01:19:24-01:19:24*

**Speaker 1**: And I don't know what's about the answer, by the way.
*01:19:33-01:19:35*

**Speaker 19**: You're not sure it's okay.
*01:19:35-01:19:36*

**Speaker 19**: I'm sure someone.
*01:19:37-01:19:39*

**Speaker 19**: About Sharan's
*01:19:40-01:19:43*

**Speaker 6**: I'm not a big shades on a Friday night kind of person, but when I do go, I do notice there's a lot of community sense there.
*01:20:13-01:20:20*

**Speaker 6**: People do seem happy there. I think to build more engagement, what I've obviously seen recently with a lot of their events is having the musicians from around the university performing there, what I've seen is drawing a lot more attention to them.
*01:20:21-01:20:33*

**Speaker 6**: And I think if they were able to keep that up, that would definitely kind of help going forward.
*01:20:34-01:20:38*

**Speaker 6**: For Kraken, I know that there's certain people, I haven't fact-checked, so I won't say names, but who do really want to separate from university and some people are holding them back.
*01:20:40-01:20:52*

**Speaker 6**: I think that would be a conversation to have with them down the line.
*01:20:53-01:20:54*

**Speaker 2**: Are you saying not that Kraken is like a big...
*01:20:54-01:20:57*

**Speaker 6**: Yeah, yeah.
*01:20:57-01:20:58*

**Speaker 2**: No, yeah, yeah.
*01:20:59-01:21:00*

**Speaker 4**: This is our last question.
*01:21:00-01:21:03*

**Speaker 4**: It's just a yes or no.
*01:21:03-01:21:05*

**Speaker 4**: So very quick.
*01:21:06-01:21:07*

**Speaker 21**: Because the engagement VP is also the boss of Crackham, if you were to win the election, would you allow Crackham to split from AUSA as per the requests of the editors of Crackham?
*01:21:09-01:21:22*

**Speaker 1**: Just an addendum, sorry.
*01:21:25-01:21:26*

**Speaker 1**: Just to clarify with Mauricio, Is the engagement VP the boss of cracking?
*01:21:27-01:21:32*

**Speaker 1**: Or do they settle?
*01:21:33-01:21:33*

**Speaker 1**: No?
*01:21:34-01:21:34*

**Speaker 1**: No clarification?
*01:21:34-01:21:35*

**Speaker 1**: Opinion.
*01:21:36-01:21:36*

**Speaker 1**: Go.
*01:21:38-01:21:38*

**Speaker 1**: What did you say?
*01:21:39-01:21:40*

**Speaker 1**: So they're part of the board.
*01:21:43-01:21:44*

**Speaker 6**: The board.
*01:21:44-01:21:45*

**Speaker 6**: What do you think?
*01:21:45-01:21:45*

**Speaker 6**: If it's something that they wanted to do and it was like unanimous, sure.
*01:21:48-01:21:54*

**Speaker 6**: I think, as I said before, it's a conversation to have further down the line.
*01:21:54-01:21:58*

**Speaker 6**: with more information.
*01:21:58-01:21:59*

**Speaker 19**: Same answer actually, I don't have enough contact with them yet, so that would definitely depend on how well their proposal is and what they would propose if they feel they come as a separate entity and how they would plan the function after that.
*01:22:01-01:22:13*

**Speaker 20**: Yeah, the same as both of them, we'll have this be done online.
*01:22:15-01:22:17*

**Speaker 1**: Perfect, that is all for our engagement.
*01:22:18-01:22:20*

**Speaker 1**: Big round of applause, thank you guys very much for running.
*01:22:20-01:22:23*

**Speaker 1**: Remember to vote in the AUSA elections, we are going to have a brief intermission, the The food has been replenished, so make sure you go and grab some.
*01:22:23-01:22:29*

**Speaker 1**: Everyone who's lurking in the background, also feel free to go and grab some food as well.
*01:22:30-01:22:34*

**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we'll see you guys in a bit for the postgraduate debates.
*01:22:35-01:22:38*

**Speaker 1**: Thank you guys.
*01:22:38-01:22:39*

**Speaker 4**: We're going to ask hard questions here as well.
*01:22:39-01:22:40*

**Speaker 3**: I'm sorry.
*01:22:48-01:22:49*

**Speaker 3**: Oh, I'm sorry.
*01:22:49-01:22:51*

**Speaker 16**: Oh, we're going to switch it up.
*01:22:52-01:22:53*

**Speaker 16**: We're going to do it here now.
*01:22:53-01:22:54*

**Speaker 3**: Yeah, we're going to do it.
*01:22:54-01:22:55*

**Speaker 16**: It just had the sign on it.
*01:22:56-01:22:57*

**Speaker 16**: I think it should be consistent here.
*01:22:57-01:22:59*

**Speaker 16**: *Sigh*
*01:24:54-01:24:56*

**Speaker 1**: Sorry, and if you are running for postgraduate educations, can you come to the candidate check-in station just over here?
*01:24:57-01:25:03*

**Speaker 1**: We're missing two of them so far, but that's okay.
*01:25:04-01:25:06*

**Speaker 3**: When is it starting?
*01:25:06-01:25:07*

**Speaker 4**: Intermission.
*01:25:09-01:25:09*

**Speaker 4**: Intermission.
*01:25:10-01:25:10*

**Speaker 4**: Intermission.
*01:25:10-01:25:10*

**Speaker 4**: Not at all.
*01:25:10-01:25:11*

**Speaker 22**: What is it?
*01:25:13-01:25:14*

**Speaker 22**: You've got five minutes?
*01:25:14-01:25:15*

**Speaker 4**: Yeah, we have five minutes.
*01:25:15-01:25:16*

**Speaker 22**: That's a cool intermission.
*01:25:17-01:25:18*

**Speaker 4**: Steph, are you ready?
*01:25:19-01:25:20*

**Speaker 4**: Are you ready?
*01:25:20-01:25:21*

**Speaker 3**: Are you ready?
*01:25:21-01:25:22*

**Speaker 3**: Are you ready for after the fall?
*01:25:22-01:25:23*

**Speaker 3**: I don't know how to do it.
*01:25:33-01:25:34*

**Speaker 23**: I don't do that.
*01:25:34-01:25:34*

**Speaker 23**: There should be like a volume thing.
*01:25:37-01:25:39*

**Speaker 23**: What?
*01:25:41-01:25:41*

**Speaker 23**: Tell people to put the mic post.
*01:25:42-01:25:44*

**Speaker 3**: Yeah.
*01:25:44-01:25:44*

**Speaker 1**: I know, I know, I know. Are you ready?
*01:26:09-01:26:10*

**Speaker 1**: Oh, we need to get a copy. We only have two, so we're going to have to briefly edit it up so I try.
*01:26:11-01:26:14*

**Speaker 1**: Yeah. And then two coming.
*01:26:16-01:26:17*

**Speaker 1**: Yeah, I know, it's a bit of crazy.
*01:26:17-01:26:18*

**Speaker 3**: Which two?
*01:26:18-01:26:19*

**Speaker 1**: Uh, comma and...
*01:26:19-01:26:21*

**Speaker 1**: Are we playing?
*01:26:22-01:26:23*

**Speaker 3**: Oh, yeah, I don't know.
*01:26:24-01:26:26*

**Speaker 3**: I'm not mistaken.
*01:27:27-01:27:29*

**Speaker 3**: They might have even talked with that.
*01:27:56-01:27:57*

**Speaker 3**: They might have even talked with that.
*01:27:58-01:27:59*

**Speaker 3**: Like, I'm a member of that.
*01:27:59-01:28:01*

**Speaker 2**: But then I'm a member of that.
*01:28:01-01:28:02*

**Speaker 2**: I'm a member of that.
*01:28:03-01:28:04*

**Speaker 2**: I'm not forgetting what I'm getting older than that.
*01:28:07-01:28:09*

**Speaker 2**: No, thank you.
*01:28:09-01:28:10*

**Speaker 21**: Anyway, I'll tell you, did you listen to today?
*01:28:12-01:28:14*

**Speaker 21**: He's been amazing.
*01:28:15-01:28:15*

**Speaker 3**: Okay, thanks.
*01:28:18-01:28:19*

**Speaker 3**: *incomprehensible*
*01:28:21-01:28:21*

**Speaker 24**: *incomprehensible*
*01:28:21-01:28:23*

**Speaker 3**: Wait, I don't remember I'm talking to you
*01:28:33-01:28:35*

**Speaker 24**: That's how I go Wait, this is crazy I don't remember I've never realized - I'm sorry.
*01:28:36-01:28:47*

**Speaker 22**: Who is my husband?
*01:29:17-01:29:18*

**Speaker 22**: I don't know.
*01:29:18-01:29:20*

**Speaker 24**: No, the child was born.
*01:29:21-01:29:23*

**Speaker 3**: This makes us the answers.
*01:29:25-01:29:29*

**Speaker 3**: I'm doing it this way.
*01:29:31-01:29:32*

**Speaker 19**: Was someone dancing last year?
*01:29:34-01:29:36*

**Speaker 15**: Yeah.
*01:29:37-01:29:37*

**Speaker 3**: I don't think it's the same.
*01:29:40-01:29:42*

**Speaker 3**: - I don't know.
*01:29:43-01:29:44*

**Speaker 3**: - I'm gonna take the text and pass it on.
*01:29:44-01:29:46*

**Speaker 3**: - I don't know.
*01:29:48-01:29:49*

**Speaker 3**: - He's coming through the bed.
*01:29:49-01:29:50*

**Speaker 17**: - My favorite part is.
*01:29:50-01:29:51*

**Speaker 3**: - We'll be taking off our bed.
*01:30:09-01:30:10*

**Speaker 3**: - We love it.
*01:30:11-01:30:12*

**Speaker 3**: Okay.
*01:30:42-01:30:42*

**Speaker 3**: There are many clients who have there been clients that have gone in I'm hungry.
*01:30:43-01:31:13*

**Speaker 15**: I'm not hungry.
*01:31:15-01:31:16*

**Speaker 3**: Really?
*01:31:17-01:31:18*

**Speaker 3**: And I was like, no!
*01:31:18-01:31:18*

**Speaker 1**: Um, did we delete spam?
*01:31:23-01:31:24*

**Speaker 1**: Yeah.
*01:31:24-01:31:24*

**Speaker 3**: So when they met me, they were fucking stoked.
*01:31:30-01:31:32*

**Speaker 3**: They were like, oh, you have money.
*01:31:33-01:31:34*

**Speaker 3**: And I was like, yeah.
*01:31:34-01:31:35*

**Speaker 3**: All right.
*01:31:35-01:31:35*

**Speaker 3**: You're going to get started.
*01:31:36-01:31:36*

**Speaker 3**: They were like, holding them up.
*01:31:37-01:31:39*

**Speaker 3**: Like, they're going to be crazy.
*01:31:39-01:31:42*

**Speaker 3**: Alright everyone, welcome back. I hope you're going to interrupt in the break.
*01:31:42-01:31:46*

**Speaker 1**: Could we please hit up, we'll try to do it in the comments.
*01:31:46-01:31:49*

**Speaker 1**: You can take the stand, the stage, the stand.
*01:31:50-01:31:53*

**Speaker 1**: And for those of you in the back, is the sound better. Can you hear any sound?
*01:31:55-01:31:59*

**Speaker 1**: The alarm will be at you. Save the world, it's not for you.
*01:32:00-01:32:03*

**Speaker 1**: Thumbs up, sounds good? Yay! It's a great to hear.
*01:32:04-01:32:06*

**Speaker 1**: Before we get started, let's throw our worst.
*01:32:07-01:32:08*

**Speaker 1**: - I'm just gonna make you guys do a little sound check so we can be sure that people can make sure they have a wonderful policies.
*01:32:09-01:32:13*

**Speaker 15**: Take a seat, take a seat.
*01:32:17-01:32:18*

**Speaker 15**: I'm gonna wear a pink arm.
*01:32:18-01:32:20*

**Speaker 1**: Alright, just do a little sound check.
*01:32:21-01:32:24*

**Speaker 1**: - Hi, I'm Jeffrey.
*01:32:26-01:32:26*

**Speaker 1**: - You guys can hear that at the back.
*01:32:27-01:32:28*

**Speaker 1**: - Woo!
*01:32:29-01:32:30*

**Speaker 25**: - Hi, my name is Jeffrey.
*01:32:34-01:32:34*

**Speaker 26**: - No, no, no, no.
*01:32:37-01:32:38*

**Speaker 26**: - Anything?
*01:32:38-01:32:38*

**Speaker 26**: - Anything?
*01:32:39-01:32:39*

**Speaker 26**: - Woo!
*01:32:39-01:32:40*

**Speaker 26**: - Good.
*01:32:40-01:32:40*

**Speaker 1**: - Sorry, we just had some issues with the sound of things.
*01:32:42-01:32:45*

**Speaker 1**: So, welcome back to our second round, second, yeah, second post-information round.
*01:32:45-01:32:52*

**Speaker 1**: I've got some moving, I don't know what I mean, and I have to be replenished.
*01:32:52-01:32:56*

**Speaker 1**: We have our post-writer education in late here, and we're just gonna do another little historical special guest here this time.
*01:32:56-01:33:05*

**Speaker 1**: So if you have been able to do this, Mayfair is my guy, one of the great model is.
*01:33:05-01:33:09*

**Speaker 1**: And I'm Finn.
*01:33:10-01:33:12*

**Speaker 1**: In this session, we have a performance student candidate standing in the season, and I represent you at the University of Oakland.
*01:33:14-01:33:20*

**Speaker 1**: This is for our postgraduate education that sits up there on the screen.
*01:33:20-01:33:24*

**Speaker 1**: For our candidate candidate, to share information to the conference of the campaign, we're gonna finish off with a couple of questions from the crowd.
*01:33:24-01:33:32*

**Speaker 1**: The debate rules of each session are each candidate will have one minute to answer the moderator's questions.
*01:33:33-01:33:37*

**Speaker 1**: We're going to understand the current phase is going to be a little this signal when it's time to start wrapping up what you're saying.
*01:33:38-01:33:44*

**Speaker 1**: You also get 30 seconds to respond to any follow up questions asked.
*01:33:44-01:33:48*

**Speaker 1**: Moderators repeat time and make sure that the polls are followed.
*01:33:48-01:33:51*

**Speaker 1**: Only the candidate will address should respond to the question.
*01:33:51-01:33:54*

**Speaker 27**: Candidates, you must also uphold your university's zero-forwards policy for the international installation at all times.
*01:33:55-01:34:00*

**Speaker 27**: Please do not interrupt the moderator and let it be alerted by that I was speaking.
*01:34:01-01:34:04*

**Speaker 1**: Now, let's meet our candidates.
*01:34:04-01:34:07*

**Speaker 1**: You guys are going to get 30 seconds to introduce yourself in with a brief overview of your policies.
*01:34:07-01:34:12*

**Speaker 26**: Hello.
*01:34:17-01:34:18*

**Speaker 26**: My name is Toma.
*01:34:19-01:34:19*

**Speaker 26**: I'm a PhD student in philosophy.
*01:34:19-01:34:21*

**Speaker 26**: I studied philosophy in Spain.
*01:34:22-01:34:25*

**Speaker 26**: I also studied a few more masters in Spain about autonomy.
*01:34:25-01:34:30*

**Speaker 26**: and I have experience also in both ways and outside university.
*01:34:32-01:34:37*

**Speaker 25**: Hi, my name is Eugene. I'm a research master student in computer systems engineering.
*01:34:41-01:34:46*

**Speaker 25**: I'm a veteran for PhD nature. I have a heavier experience of entrepreneurship and business and I'm ready for PhD education.
*01:34:47-01:34:59*

**Speaker 15**: - Hi, I'm Rikri, and I'm a university candidate for Urban Plenty, and at the same time, I'm also a graduate education assistant, and I lead both sides of the CrossFit Graduate Institute and I'm not trying to be a support class student, but also for myself as a PhD student and do my own research, not from research.
*01:35:01-01:35:22*

**Speaker 15**: So I'm here running for postgraduate education.
*01:35:22-01:35:28*

**Speaker 15**: We are postgraduate. Thank you.
*01:35:29-01:35:31*

**Speaker 1**: And just before we get started, if there are any conflicts of interest you'd like to declare, local relations, go.
*01:35:32-01:35:39*

**Speaker 17**: Awesome. So go begin. If you could please summarize your key policy that will be in third and third.
*01:35:41-01:35:46*

**Speaker 5**: We'll be back in the next one.
*01:35:47-01:35:48*

**Speaker 26**: So my aim goal is to provide with the FMA objective all the processes in the past and applying for scholarship.
*01:35:50-01:36:01*

**Speaker 26**: I think right now there is not clear any criteria at a different point that makes me really believable and it's going to be one of the important things.
*01:36:01-01:36:15*

**Speaker 26**: Thank you.
*01:36:15-01:36:15*

**Speaker 26**: I have a few apologies, although I'd like to just mention one.
*01:36:19-01:36:22*

**Speaker 25**: I'm going through this session to address the issue of PostgreSQL represented roles in the AUSA being elected by the whole student body, where 80% of student body are university.
*01:36:23-01:36:35*

**Speaker 25**: I don't think it's a true PPP representation.
*01:36:36-01:36:38*

**Speaker 25**: I plan to change the lesson for the future role to be assessed in order to provide post-graders with me.
*01:36:38-01:36:45*

**Speaker 15**: My first aim is to aggregate all the separate information about funding and working activities such as BDMTA and also lack working time and schedule time and combine all the separate information to a navigator and help all my assistant and PhD student to use this, make full use of this information.
*01:36:47-01:37:15*

**Speaker 1**: - Great.
*01:37:17-01:37:17*

**Speaker 1**: So how do you plan to navigate this role within an executive team, where so the executive team is likely comprised of undergrads who may not understand opportunities that post-route issues.
*01:37:18-01:37:28*

**Speaker 26**: I think something very important is just to know what's been done in the past, to know what's working, what actually is not working.
*01:37:33-01:37:41*

**Speaker 26**: Also to be in touch with people in faculty and people in class, just to know what's actually going to be in a problem, with that, just trying to grow the deeper nature of different situations that help to satisfy their needs.
*01:37:42-01:37:58*

**Speaker 25**: I think for me, I think everyone can agree that this is a problem.
*01:38:00-01:38:05*

**Speaker 25**: Although if I have other experts having a hard time understanding, I'm a very open person in conversation.
*01:38:05-01:38:12*

**Speaker 25**: I'm very open for engaging in conversation today for a decision.
*01:38:13-01:38:16*

**Speaker 25**: So yeah, I will try to communicate with other candidates and other faculty as possible.
*01:38:17-01:38:23*

**Speaker 25**: Also, I've come to some of the other candidates as well, and you might have to support from the and for the students.
*01:38:24-01:38:32*

**Speaker 15**: I think for me, as a first year, I was to know all the students' requirements, and that and we will communicate with undergraduate student and past undergraduate student and we have some common requirements.
*01:38:35-01:38:52*

**Speaker 15**: So the main point is to solve this common requirement and go to some specific requirements for the first grade.
*01:38:54-01:39:02*

**Speaker 17**: Thank you.
*01:39:03-01:39:04*

**Speaker 17**: So you're serving as student population of over 150 conservative program options.
*01:39:04-01:39:10*

**Speaker 17**: What do you pay for meaningful and meaningful students to under the experience of diversity?
*01:39:11-01:39:16*

**Speaker 17**: So you're serving over 150 conservative options.
*01:39:21-01:39:25*

**Speaker 17**: What do you pay for meaningful and meaningful students to under the experience of diversity?
*01:39:25-01:39:31*

**Speaker 26**: So something that I think we need to do first of all is to give thanks for every single public experience, so we take the team.
*01:39:32-01:39:40*

**Speaker 26**: First of all, let's do a special education after the meets with the executive team that to know what they are currently doing and also trying to be involved with other activities and public schools, and also
*01:39:41-01:39:58*

**Speaker 1**: especially when you're assuming that it's a post-graduate study.
*01:40:26-01:40:30*

**Speaker 26**: This is a real question.
*01:40:30-01:40:32*

**Speaker 26**: It is the main goal of this goal, actually, how you're going to be in the age of so many growth and so many athletes and so on.
*01:40:33-01:40:40*

**Speaker 26**: Contrary to you is that actually, you said it's not only coming from one partner, it's not one person.
*01:40:41-01:40:51*

**Speaker 26**: So we are going to be every day surrounded by people
*01:40:52-01:40:56*

**Speaker 25**: So we finished 150 programs, but I think the main difference is undergrad program and the post-grad program is that there are three different types of programs.
*01:41:07-01:41:16*

**Speaker 25**: It's research methods, how methods, and PhDs mainly under the field.
*01:41:17-01:41:23*

**Speaker 1**: I wouldn't say that's necessarily true, but also a lot of postgraduate performance.
*01:41:23-01:41:26*

**Speaker 1**: So you've been presenting a full program, for example, the postgraduate performance
*01:41:27-01:41:32*

**Speaker 25**: and communication position.
*01:41:32-01:41:33*

**Speaker 1**: It's very good at specifics.
*01:41:34-01:41:35*

**Speaker 25**: I want to say, often I'm interested in master's students that have been practiced, like the education students.
*01:41:36-01:41:42*

**Speaker 25**: So, professors that are mainly doing practice and probably are approaching on research, and the master's students that are many doing this and post-class students that are many doing this.
*01:41:45-01:41:54*

**Speaker 1**: But what about the students that have practical components that they have a lot of the degree?
*01:41:54-01:41:59*

**Speaker 1**: For example, the Doctor of Critical Psychology, where whatever kind of state of internships, or that education and post-graduate teaching the point of where what kind of state in place and students is part of the learning as well.
*01:42:00-01:42:11*

**Speaker 1**: I know that those are quite different,
*01:42:11-01:42:13*

**Speaker 28**: different students associated with those internship performance.
*01:42:16-01:42:19*

**Speaker 25**: I do think that probably in a current point in time they might be interested in other situations.
*01:42:20-01:42:26*

**Speaker 25**: I'm saying the whole scope of a program, the whole program, the one year and one after, building a top master program, research master program.
*01:42:26-01:42:35*

**Speaker 25**: I'm also talking on my experience with my type of team.
*01:42:36-01:42:40*

**Speaker 25**: But of course, I'm sure there are other types of programs out there.
*01:42:40-01:42:44*

**Speaker 25**: But I think what I'm trying to say is trying to find out what the problem is the biggest thing.
*01:42:44-01:42:52*

**Speaker 25**: From my experience at FACC, I was able to find out what the problem was, what different programs were, and what the different issues that the students were having.
*01:42:53-01:43:07*

**Speaker 25**: I think that's the main issue.
*01:43:07-01:43:08*

**Speaker 25**: And my goal of being effective in the U.S.A. is to be able to reach out to all the other companies and listen to their support.
*01:43:09-01:43:18*

**Speaker 25**: And that's, I think, the core characteristic of the effective effect that is really important.
*01:43:19-01:43:27*

**Speaker 15**: From my perspective, the best question is how to solve the drivers students needs from different backgrounds.
*01:43:30-01:43:40*

**Speaker 15**: The first step should be we need to clarify different types of needs because although the needs are different, also had comments. We need to clarify different types of and to think about which kind of resources we can collaborate with to deal with this kind of common question. Like we need to collaborate with campus life, collaborate with library, collaborate with SDC, collaborate with different community to solve this kind of problem. And the second step is to, yeah to track and keep a clear report about the issue went to closure or not.
*01:43:42-01:44:30*

**Speaker 15**: And as for the second question about how to make sure the library is best, I think maybe we need to keep very, very clear report and we need to keep our time bound.
*01:44:30-01:44:44*

**Speaker 15**: then we've done really time to solve up this problem.
*01:44:45-01:44:49*

**Speaker 15**: If you don't solve up this kind of problem, we need to go to an SGS to find some solution.
*01:44:49-01:44:59*

**Speaker 17**: So you've also opened up the need to engage with the diverse perspectives and we've discussed that there's a big issue around that.
*01:45:01-01:45:11*

**Speaker 17**: So how would you use anything for the demands of the school that's completely full time studying?
*01:45:11-01:45:16*

**Speaker 17**: Is that what I would do?
*01:45:17-01:45:18*

**Speaker 17**: I can buy a palace.
*01:45:21-01:45:22*

**Speaker 15**: So, for my demand.
*01:45:26-01:45:27*

**Speaker 15**: When I just first arrived, I was really overwhelmed by unlucky.
*01:45:29-01:45:33*

**Speaker 15**: My colleagues and my friends and my support why is it happening, what, running to give back these kind of enemies.
*01:45:33-01:45:42*

**Speaker 15**: And running that is turning people a lot of energy into my research.
*01:45:43-01:45:47*

**Speaker 15**: But at the same time, just sitting in the office and reading and writing, actually cannot.
*01:45:47-01:45:54*

**Speaker 15**: We have many people, our own research, cause researching about real world practical experience.
*01:45:56-01:46:04*

**Speaker 15**: just sitting in the office, you cannot get more knowledge.
*01:46:04-01:46:08*

**Speaker 15**: For more effective, I need to communicate with different students and that is varied from different backgrounds.
*01:46:10-01:46:18*

**Speaker 15**: What I need is just to find a very clear route and very quickly to find a different property to solve out this virus problem.
*01:46:19-01:46:30*

**Speaker 25**: I think since I'm already in the core department of FHCC and the faculty of FHCC and the teaching and learning quality community, and I'll be able to jewell this around while doing my research.
*01:46:37-01:46:54*

**Speaker 25**: and I think the thing about research and I think about PhD is that we're possible to do your own time for yourself, so I
*01:46:54-01:47:06*

**Speaker 26**: with the knowledge on the economy and how that different things are going to understand social injustice.
*01:47:24-01:47:31*

**Speaker 26**: So I know what this is going to be, but I don't understand the social injustice.
*01:47:32-01:47:36*

**Speaker 26**: This is actually what we need to do with this position, this whole, to understand what's the main problem in the economy.
*01:47:38-01:47:46*

**Speaker 26**: and we see why I have to meet this is not a problem, but to combine into a possible research on the broadcast.
*01:47:46-01:47:55*

**Speaker 26**: Thank you very much.
*01:47:57-01:47:58*

**Speaker 1**: And so, a lot of the policies that you received for Prospect with in terms of candidates focused on the supervision relationship and how guidelines around that could be clearer. This is obviously a point of contingent among Prospect with students.
*01:47:59-01:48:13*

**Speaker 1**: How about finding public students on the supervision?
*01:48:14-01:48:17*

**Speaker 1**: Because we've heard from the prospective community that there are lots of difficulties around even finding supervision opportunities at the moment, and some students aren't able to fill in their findings because they can't even find a supervision.
*01:48:17-01:48:30*

**Speaker 1**: We're not even sure. Do you have any funds to your set?
*01:48:30-01:48:32*

**Speaker 26**: Thank you.
*01:48:35-01:48:36*

**Speaker 26**: I think that's part of my proposal. I think it's a lack of knowing what's going on in the PhD, what's the possibility that you have finding or not different supervisors.
*01:48:36-01:48:50*

**Speaker 26**: I think that we need to modify that kind of culture in the rest of the day, showing what it actually means to be a PhD student, to make students be part of the department and not be part.
*01:48:50-01:49:03*

**Speaker 26**: So for example, before I met in the case, I didn't know anything about the cultural philosophy, but it started like two years before coming here to know what's going on in that department, or if this is another department or not.
*01:49:04-01:49:17*

**Speaker 26**: So obviously, I really can modify that.
*01:49:18-01:49:20*

**Speaker 26**: We need, first of all, to do access
*01:49:21-01:49:24*

**Speaker 5**: with every year students or college students
*01:49:25-01:49:28*

**Speaker 26**: to inform them from the perspective of our PhD students.
*01:49:28-01:49:32*

**Speaker 25**: I don't know that. I don't have any, I don't have any, I don't have any kind of thing that I mentioned. But university trying to search for a supervisor was not easy. But there were methods in the university to search for, I would say, filter supervisors that had I think making obvious of these information is really important.
*01:49:38-01:50:02*

**Speaker 25**: I think the main problem that professors get into is accessing useful information.
*01:50:02-01:50:09*

**Speaker 25**: They're not informed with the basic information that they need to navigate their program in the initial stages of their program.
*01:50:10-01:50:19*

**Speaker 25**: So I think it's time to make that obvious and also important.
*01:50:19-01:50:21*

**Speaker 25**: for the supervision. I think there's a staff profile page where you can search and you can filter on staff with supervision on the community. So things like that should be more obvious and more
*01:50:22-01:50:33*

**Speaker 17**: scientific. This is a follow-up question. Do you have technical papers that you would to take student action and raise sentences and have some more interesting questions?
*01:50:34-01:50:44*

**Speaker 25**: I do wish in correlation with everything else, every other part of my campaign.
*01:50:46-01:50:53*

**Speaker 25**: I think the orientation is very important.
*01:50:55-01:50:57*

**Speaker 25**: A lot of students, the new students that came in, dependent orientation have mentioned how they didn't feel that information that I can do orientation more than two years old.
*01:50:57-01:51:12*

**Speaker 25**: I think in the initial orientation, I think there should be a better plan of spreading the information more science plan.
*01:51:14-01:51:21*

**Speaker 25**: Also, another thing is to have a department scale gathering in the orientation section, because right now it's mostly a factor from control.
*01:51:22-01:51:34*

**Speaker 25**: So in one back to me, I think because of the recent transition to merging all these faculty together, I think within the faculty there are different departments that are not really in the same learning environment or program type as the other department. So I think that causes education where it's too wide and scope.
*01:51:34-01:51:55*

**Speaker 25**: So yeah. And to
*01:51:55-01:51:59*

**Speaker 15**: sort out this problem, we have two staff. The first from the perspective of past-sanded religious, the Bison, we need to give the full guidance and suggestion about how to face it and where's the problem with it and what can we offer.
*01:51:59-01:52:17*

**Speaker 15**: And if these kind of suggestions do not work, we just go to sign full rules and the constitution to help about this kind of question.
*01:52:19-01:52:32*

**Speaker 15**: And the second step is we need to set up some groups about how long will the supervisor to give feedback and how long will pass-by-lates, you can have meeting with providers and what's the kind of quality where the feedback of the supervisor will be.
*01:52:34-01:52:56*

**Speaker 15**: Yeah.
*01:52:56-01:52:56*

**Speaker 17**: - Thank you so much.
*01:52:57-01:52:59*

**Speaker 17**: Now, engagement is a persistent challenge across Paying Payroll.
*01:53:00-01:53:03*

**Speaker 17**: I was so particularly for postgraduate students who kind of see your clothes.
*01:53:04-01:53:08*

**Speaker 17**: Given that meaning they left the time or even the information to complete surveys, how do you plan to get an urgently representative for graduate boys?
*01:53:09-01:53:19*

**Speaker 17**: And we'll start with you.
*01:53:20-01:53:21*

**Speaker 17**: - Right.
*01:53:21-01:53:21*

**Speaker 17**: - Can we?
*01:53:23-01:53:23*

**Speaker 17**: - Can we look at the last one?
*01:53:24-01:53:25*

**Speaker 17**: - Yeah.
*01:53:25-01:53:26*

**Speaker 17**: Education is a participant in the class that I've enrolled, and particularly for postgraduate students.
*01:53:26-01:53:33*

**Speaker 17**: So how would you pay a generally group of postgraduate boards, given that many extra times or recommendations don't think we throw that in?
*01:53:34-01:53:44*

**Speaker 15**: Okay, I think we have three factors. One factor based on Sweden itself.
*01:53:44-01:53:51*

**Speaker 15**: And from USA we can gather more events for your engagement.
*01:53:51-01:53:57*

**Speaker 15**: And the way we have a retirement event could enhance your engagement, such as we just have a retirement event for Instagram and the release of our lab.
*01:53:58-01:54:14*

**Speaker 15**: and we can tell the supervisors for some well-being event and tell the supervisor to give more channel to students. And the second perspective is about different faculties' perspective.
*01:54:14-01:54:34*

**Speaker 15**: And we need to talk, you know, for patients, we have a doctoral coordinator, right?
*01:54:34-01:54:40*

**Speaker 15**: We need to collaborate with doctoral coordinators and let the coordinator staff help us to talk to them or we need to engage this kind of event or that kind of activity.
*01:54:40-01:54:53*

**Speaker 15**: And the circumfractor is about, well, our own staff, we need to get our own influence.
*01:54:54-01:55:01*

**Speaker 15**: and we can get into our classmates, our colleagues, and our friends.
*01:55:01-01:55:07*

**Speaker 15**: And most of them are also a postgraduate student.
*01:55:07-01:55:11*

**Speaker 15**: If we can advertise that our activity as an activity, then that would enhance the events of staff.
*01:55:11-01:55:20*

**Speaker 25**: I don't think I used to record the problem, The question is about how we try to make engagement more active in the postgraduate on stage. I think because for master students, they're kind of very short, they need to have a fixed event system going on where they get in each other in every department. So they They are not forced, they are led to engaging in a short amount of time for the people in the field. I think also in the SSCC there are PhD representatives and master representatives.
*01:55:24-01:56:03*

**Speaker 25**: I know this is not for every department but I think it's getting better. So when I become, if I win this election, I plan to operate my sub-community with these representatives.
*01:56:04-01:56:15*

**Speaker 25**: So we have good voice for the whole scope of the postgraduate.
*01:56:15-01:56:21*

**Speaker 25**: And one question.
*01:56:22-01:56:23*

**Speaker 25**: I've encountered this from other PhD students.
*01:56:24-01:56:26*

**Speaker 25**: The word postgraduate student, is that PhD and math学 or just math学 students?
*01:56:27-01:56:32*

**Speaker 1**: It is anyone who is post undergraduate study.
*01:56:32-01:56:35*

**Speaker 1**: In some cases, it does actually focus on students as well.
*01:56:35-01:56:39*

**Speaker 1**: I know it's very placed by class, but there's also good students who are doing a postgraduate homework.
*01:56:39-01:56:44*

**Speaker 25**: So I think this is another thing that we have to make, Shankar. I've encountered many students that didn't understand what postgraduate was. So I think also in my education, trying to tell people what postgraduate means and postgraduate representative are actually going to go to tell these students that the postgrad vice president is actually representative of PhD and master's students.
*01:56:45-01:57:10*

**Speaker 25**: and trying to listen to the avoidant of the problem, not just to the message for all post-graduate students.
*01:57:10-01:57:15*

**Speaker 26**: - Well, my proposal is actually in relation with this engagement.
*01:57:20-01:57:24*

**Speaker 26**: I feel like a good way just to not only to engage with post-graduate students, but also to learn how to be part of that event live.
*01:57:25-01:57:34*

**Speaker 26**: This could be eight months per year.
*01:57:34-01:57:37*

**Speaker 26**: these events where the PhD students and master students can meet together, where they can propose, they can do a presentation of paper and PhD students can also work on a scientific committee that are going to validate what they are doing and it is a way not only to engage and to know each other, it is also a way to start working on their future. I totally agree I agree that we need, like you said before, we need to do different actions to engage
*01:57:38-01:58:07*

**Speaker 5**: and all, but I do not say that it is just a matter of doing an action.
*01:58:08-01:58:12*

**Speaker 26**: I can do an action to engage between the student and the other student, but maybe next year another person will take the role and we would like to do something different.
*01:58:14-01:58:23*

**Speaker 26**: So it is a matter of establishing a habit, something remarkable in the university that to help students to be connected with each other.
*01:58:24-01:58:32*

**Speaker 28**: Perfect. And one final question before we have questions from the crowd, and we asked this for maybe 30 seconds short.
*01:58:33-01:58:41*

**Speaker 28**: How are you...
*01:58:42-01:58:43*

**Speaker 28**: What is your first initiative going to be when you edit the song?
*01:58:46-01:58:49*

**Speaker 26**: Thank you. This is consistently in America.
*01:58:50-01:58:54*

**Speaker 26**: I want to be in touch with different committees in terms of confirming the scholarship, works, job opportunities, just to be more transparent, more clear about what are the criteria, why you can apply, why you can not apply a future job, because there is right now a lack of transparency about what PhD students, master students can work with the future.
*01:58:54-01:59:20*

**Speaker 26**: I think the first thing I want to do is get in touch with all the FCCC representatives,
*01:59:20-01:59:38*

**Speaker 25**: Mastery and PHE representatives, and first gather all the issues and concerns that are in their department, in their faculty.
*01:59:38-01:59:48*

**Speaker 25**: I think that's the most important thing for the role, to understand what is actually going on.
*01:59:48-01:59:52*

**Speaker 25**: And I mean, the issues that are going on that I know are actually mostly based on my faculty and my department.
*01:59:53-02:00:00*

**Speaker 25**: But I would love to know what's going on in other departments here, and try to come up with a united concern, and try to address those things first.
*02:00:00-02:00:08*

**Speaker 25**: That's the first thing I would do.
*02:00:09-02:00:10*

**Speaker 3**: - Anything?
*02:00:11-02:00:11*

**Speaker 15**: The best platform is to set up an advisory group from different countries.
*02:00:13-02:00:18*

**Speaker 15**: We need to select one group from different countries to give us more concrete and precise issues like past graduates with a pack.
*02:00:18-02:00:28*

**Speaker 15**: Because before we conduct our own policy, we need to know concrete requirements of past graduates students need.
*02:00:29-02:00:40*

**Speaker 15**: and then you can get more simple policy.
*02:00:41-02:00:44*

**Speaker 15**: Yeah, let this modify back.
*02:00:46-02:00:47*

**Speaker 1**: Thank you. Alright, do you have any questions for the crowd for how to post-graduate from some of us?
*02:00:49-02:00:53*

**Speaker 29**: So with the budget cut schools in the world of university education to be placed on postgraduate teacher assistance, do you feel there being adequately supported by both university administration and university currently?
*02:01:07-02:01:19*

**Speaker 29**: And if not, how do you think this is?
*02:01:20-02:01:22*

**Speaker 29**: I think this is a question.
*02:01:22-02:01:23*

**Speaker 29**: Not closer?
*02:01:24-02:01:25*

**Speaker 29**: Oh, damn.
*02:01:26-02:01:26*

**Speaker 29**: One more time.
*02:01:27-02:01:28*

**Speaker 29**: With time, budget cut schools in the world of university education to be placed upon postgraduate teachers Do you feel they are being adequately supported by both the university administration and the USA currently?
*02:01:30-02:01:41*

**Speaker 29**: If not, how would you change the situation as education VP?
*02:01:42-02:01:45*

**Speaker 3**: Can you just go ahead?
*02:01:48-02:01:48*

**Speaker 15**: For me, we need to know that our program projects are class projects, and we need to verify different importance in the first class, the second class, the third class, and we need to know our most important aim is to support the most important research output and hardship, right?
*02:01:55-02:02:20*

**Speaker 15**: And after that, that will be the first class.
*02:02:20-02:02:23*

**Speaker 15**: After we secure the first class project and we can go second class project, second class project might be...
*02:02:24-02:02:33*

**Speaker 15**: And in second class, we need to know which kind of program we can put more budget on and we can get more output.
*02:02:41-02:02:53*

**Speaker 15**: Yeah, this is a classwork to clarify the classwork, different programs, and to manage our own budget.
*02:02:54-02:03:03*

**Speaker 15**: Thank you.
*02:03:04-02:03:05*

**Speaker 25**: Could you expand the question? I think we're going to hear too quickly.
*02:03:09-02:03:13*

**Speaker 29**: Do you feel postgraduate teachers assistants are being supported currently?
*02:03:17-02:03:22*

**Speaker 29**: Yes or no, but if not...
*02:03:23-02:03:25*

**Speaker 29**: Teachers assistants?
*02:03:25-02:03:26*

**Speaker 29**: Yeah.
*02:03:26-02:03:26*

**Speaker 5**: Most right, yes.
*02:03:27-02:03:27*

**Speaker 29**: Okay.
*02:03:28-02:03:28*

**Speaker 29**: Good man and the world of background.
*02:03:29-02:03:31*

**Speaker 29**: Do you feel they're being supported right now? And if not, would you change anything?
*02:03:32-02:03:37*

**Speaker 25**: I'm a very honest person. I actually don't know if the teaching assistants are actually supported well or not.
*02:03:39-02:03:44*

**Speaker 25**: But like I said, the first thing I would do is get actual teaching from all departments and all faculty.
*02:03:44-02:03:51*

**Speaker 25**: I'm sure during that process we will hear if there is actually a problem going on.
*02:03:51-02:03:56*

**Speaker 25**: And if you have to address it, you have to address it.
*02:03:56-02:03:58*

**Speaker 26**: I think it's really good.
*02:04:00-02:04:03*

**Speaker 26**: This is my main goal because I think that GTAs are not really the principal right now in the rest of your problem.
*02:04:03-02:04:11*

**Speaker 26**: As you said, there is a problem here in the lack of transparency and the lack of criteria.
*02:04:12-02:04:16*

**Speaker 26**: We don't really know what are the different criteria to be eligible, what's going to be your job as GTA, but we need to modify that in order to be your
*02:04:16-02:04:28*

**Speaker 1**: Thank you very much to our postgraduate education vice presidential candidate.
*02:04:31-02:04:35*

**Speaker 1**: To make sure you're voting in the AUSA elections, I think that is all we're going to do for now.
*02:04:35-02:04:39*

**Speaker 1**: Thank you all very much for coming and speaking about your wonderful policies.
*02:04:40-02:04:42*

**Speaker 1**: And I look forward to seeing one of you at present postgraduate students.
*02:04:42-02:04:46*

**Speaker 1**: We're going to have a five minute in transition before we start with our education candidates.
*02:04:46-02:04:50*

**Speaker 16**: Yeah.
*02:04:59-02:05:01*

**Speaker 3**: I love you, I love you.
*02:07:51-02:07:52*

**Speaker 3**: Thank you.
*02:09:51-02:09:52*

**Speaker 3**: Thank you.
*02:10:25-02:10:28*

**Speaker 4**: What's up?
*02:10:53-02:10:54*

**Speaker 4**: What's up?
*02:10:54-02:10:54*

**Speaker 4**: What's up?
*02:11:00-02:11:01*

**Speaker 22**: That's really awesome.
*02:11:23-02:11:24*

**Speaker 3**: Ja, ja.
*02:11:31-02:11:34*

**Speaker 3**: Alright guys, we're going to get started with the undergraduate education.
*02:12:13-02:12:18*

**Speaker 4**: Me and the old hand please come up to the front.
*02:12:18-02:12:22*

**Speaker 4**: Nice point.
*02:12:24-02:12:25*

**Speaker 3**: Can we just say your name to the mic?
*02:12:26-02:12:39*

**Speaker 25**: Josiah.
*02:12:40-02:12:41*

**Speaker 25**: Okay.
*02:12:42-02:12:42*

**Speaker 4**: Armile.
*02:12:43-02:12:44*

**Speaker 4**: To kind of explain how the debate will work, you have a good question and you should not have heard of any other while you're speaking, you may have written the address of the candidate and at all times, the House of the University Bureau called this policy on bullying harassment and discrimination.
*02:13:12-02:13:28*

**Speaker 4**: Cool.
*02:13:30-02:13:30*

**Speaker 4**: So, hello everyone.
*02:13:32-02:13:33*

**Speaker 4**: My name is Jessica.
*02:13:34-02:13:34*

**Speaker 22**: I'm one of the moderators for this debate.
*02:13:35-02:13:37*

**Speaker 22**: Cool.
*02:13:37-02:13:38*

**Speaker 22**: And I'm Judy.
*02:13:38-02:13:38*

**Speaker 22**: I'm the other moderator.
*02:13:38-02:13:39*

**Speaker 4**: Awesome.
*02:13:40-02:13:41*

**Speaker 4**: Just a very general question to start.
*02:13:41-02:13:44*

**Speaker 3**: Can you guys please introduce yourself, your background, and your experience in one minute?
*02:13:45-02:13:49*

**Speaker 30**: I'm really proud to be standing around here with two amazing candidates for the undergraduate education vice president role. So my name is Matthew, I'm the current undergraduate education vice president and I'm re-running for the role because I've had the privilege of a lifetime to be serving students this year. So there are two parts of the job that I really, really love.
*02:13:55-02:14:13*

**Speaker 30**: One part is student voice. It's uplifting the voices of students and making sure that the issues that we all care about are elevated all the way to the university and beyond to the national level as well.
*02:14:13-02:14:23*

**Speaker 30**: And the other part that I really care about is addressing quality education and controlling all as students in quality education, but also addressing the barriers to that education. So things like public transport, things like that. So that's something that I care about. And yeah, thank you.
*02:14:24-02:14:37*

**Speaker 19**: I am a communication student.
*02:14:39-02:14:42*

**Speaker 19**: The experiences that I have been on the table are as an academic faculty director of communications, as well as the new founder and president of the communications and media society.
*02:14:43-02:14:52*

**Speaker 19**: The policies that I have been used are more assessment inclusivity, and most importantly, So I'll be the animals for PCOS and PCOE.
*02:14:53-02:15:04*

**Speaker 23**: My name is Josiah.
*02:15:07-02:15:09*

**Speaker 23**: I'm a, and they told me to disclose my political affiliations or whatever.
*02:15:10-02:15:14*

**Speaker 23**: So I'm a socialist.
*02:15:14-02:15:15*

**Speaker 23**: I've organized here on campus with the International Socialist Organization.
*02:15:16-02:15:19*

**Speaker 23**: I'm an activist.
*02:15:20-02:15:20*

**Speaker 23**: I've been organized in the Palestine Movement.
*02:15:21-02:15:24*

**Speaker 23**: I believe that we need a student movement to take back power from AUSA, from the university.
*02:15:25-02:15:30*

**Speaker 23**: We need a protest.
*02:15:31-02:15:32*

**Speaker 23**: we need to be out there in our numbers, in thousands, showing the university who holds the power.
*02:15:32-02:15:37*

**Speaker 23**: That's essentially what I'm fighting for.
*02:15:39-02:15:42*

**Speaker 23**: So yeah, thank you.
*02:15:42-02:15:42*

**Speaker 22**: - Awesome, and if the other one, if the other candidate wanted to say about the political affiliation as well, if you have any.
*02:15:43-02:15:50*

**Speaker 22**: - Yeah, so,
*02:15:51-02:15:51*

**Speaker 30**: - I'm a member of the Green Party, but all of you are my own, and I don't represent the Green Party, so yeah.
*02:15:52-02:16:00*

**Speaker 22**: Cool, we'll start with the general questions. In the amount of time that you have, can you explain what the powers of your role are and be stoked for the role?
*02:16:02-02:16:11*

**Speaker 30**: Yeah, so the way that I like to explain is there are two parts of my role. The first part is education and student voice, and the other part is being a vice president of AUSA.
*02:16:13-02:16:21*

**Speaker 30**: So in terms of education and student voice, I sit on all of the academic committees on on campus and I'm making sure that when policy changes are being introduced I'm the student voice to make sure that students are always part of that conversation and student voice is about like I said before uplifting the student voice addressing barriers to education things like cost of living and stuff like that and the second part of that is being a good vice president so as a vice president as an officer of the association I have legal obligation to the association to make sure that it's operating in a way that is best for the interests of our members which are all of students. So that's the word.
*02:16:22-02:16:55*

**Speaker 19**: I think it's been pretty well. For my understanding of it, my responsibilities would include sitting on academic on the meetings, the student council, and making sure all student concerns and voices are heard.
*02:16:57-02:17:08*

**Speaker 19**: Also, when policies are being made, it would be important for me, if there's someone who's doing at least to reach on a decision someday with those policies in mind.
*02:17:09-02:17:16*

**Speaker 23**: Yes, obviously, Matthew being the post-grad, so the undergrad vice president has a good understanding of the role, but I think what's important as well that you emphasize is that AUSA is a service that the university pays for, and I think that's something that a lot of people who stand up, who come up onto the stage of these banks fail to realize, is that AUSA would not exist if it did not provide something useful to the university, and that to the function of that institution.
*02:17:19-02:17:48*

**Speaker 23**: So what our actual role is as an EPA is, A, we sit on a lot of boards, right?
*02:17:49-02:17:54*

**Speaker 23**: Absolutely student advocacy, and student voice, but student voice for who?
*02:17:54-02:17:59*

**Speaker 23**: For the university, so they can say, oh, we've added student voice, look, here's our rubber stamp, here's the electoral mandate, and probably 10% of students, and everything's sweet because of that.
*02:18:00-02:18:11*

**Speaker 23**: Actually, what we need is not a rubber stamp, We need genuine democracy, not a 10% noonday, right?
*02:18:11-02:18:22*

**Speaker 4**: Thank you. Our next question is, what do you think is the biggest issue in terms of academics for students at the university?
*02:18:23-02:18:30*

**Speaker 19**: From my understanding, the current issue that students are facing in their academics is there being less engagement from the newer faculties.
*02:18:34-02:18:43*

**Speaker 19**: I'm aware that new programs have been released in fields of communications, artificial intelligence, behavioural sciences, and these communities are trying to receive enough student reps and student voices.
*02:18:43-02:18:52*

**Speaker 19**: That's why I really have worked in the communications faculty as a student myself to establish an educated student group for them.
*02:18:53-02:19:00*

**Speaker 19**: And if elected, I would also encourage other students from those faculties who have their voice of help.
*02:19:01-02:19:06*

**Speaker 23**: Could you just repeat the question?
*02:19:10-02:19:11*

**Speaker 4**: What do you think is the biggest issue in terms of academics for students on campus right now?
*02:19:12-02:19:16*

**Speaker 23**: Yeah, well, okay, so students are in Ireland.
*02:19:18-02:19:20*

**Speaker 23**: We're not just robots who come to university, set up essays and exams and then go home.
*02:19:21-02:19:27*

**Speaker 23**: We live in a world and we're humans.
*02:19:27-02:19:29*

**Speaker 23**: So the biggest issues are probably the non-academic issues.
*02:19:29-02:19:32*

**Speaker 23**: The cost of transport, the cost of living, the cost of rentals, the cost of food.
*02:19:33-02:19:37*

**Speaker 23**: Those are the biggest problems that students face.
*02:19:37-02:19:41*

**Speaker 23**: And that affects our ability to be on campus, to come to lectures, to be students.
*02:19:42-02:19:48*

**Speaker 22**: Sorry, just to follow up on that.
*02:19:48-02:19:50*

**Speaker 22**: What specifically about, obviously the students with all of these other issues facing them, but what specifically about academics do you think was initially introduced?
*02:19:50-02:19:59*

**Speaker 23**: What specifically about academics?
*02:20:00-02:20:01*

**Speaker 23**: As in, like, exactly, like, what, can you define academics?
*02:20:03-02:20:07*

**Speaker 23**: Sorry?
*02:20:07-02:20:08*

**Speaker 22**: Learning, assessments, that sort of stuff.
*02:20:08-02:20:11*

**Speaker 23**: So to learn, you need to live in a good house, a warm house, happy, so I would say that essentially falls into, that answers the question in my opinion.
*02:20:11-02:20:20*

**Speaker 30**: - Yeah, I mean, so the role is undergraduate education vice president.
*02:20:23-02:20:26*

**Speaker 30**: So this year I've had a lot of opportunities to be part of AI policy, and I think that is actually, to answer the question, AI is one of the biggest issues facing our academic journey at university.
*02:20:26-02:20:35*

**Speaker 30**: But artificial intelligence is here to stay, and I think we need to acknowledge that.
*02:20:36-02:20:40*

**Speaker 30**: The university has taken steps to acknowledge it, but I can continue to go further.
*02:20:40-02:20:44*

**Speaker 30**: Right now, there aren't clear policies and guidelines as to when we can use AI, and how we can use AI, and that's something we need to fix.
*02:20:44-02:20:51*

**Speaker 30**: So the university is going to be introducing a lot of new initiatives and ideas as to how we can solve that problem.
*02:20:52-02:20:58*

**Speaker 30**: What's really important is that students are at the center of that voice, because we are here as students, we're here to learn, and AI is posing a threat to the academic journey that we have.
*02:20:58-02:21:08*

**Speaker 30**: So what we need to do is actually rethink what education actually means to make sure that when we graduate from this university, we're good graduates and that employees are able to to
*02:21:09-02:21:18*

**Speaker 22**: Awesome. Last question. What is one initiative you want to implement going to office in a Florida design?
*02:21:20-02:21:26*

**Speaker 23**: One initiative? So by initiative, do you mean like policy within a USA or do you mean something broader?
*02:21:28-02:21:35*

**Speaker 22**: Just the policy within rural areas.
*02:21:36-02:21:39*

**Speaker 23**: Yeah, well, so one of the things that we put forward is obviously the UBIT shutting down and there's nothing we can do about that.
*02:21:39-02:21:45*

**Speaker 23**: That is a fact, we've got to deal with it.
*02:21:45-02:21:46*

**Speaker 23**: Actually, something that one of my comrades suggested was we need - well, I'm a social, so you're a comrade.
*02:21:47-02:21:54*

**Speaker 23**: Something that one of my comrades suggested was we need to be able to address that problem, right?
*02:21:55-02:22:00*

**Speaker 23**: And the best way to address that problem is we need to be able to recycle textbooks.
*02:22:00-02:22:03*

**Speaker 23**: Now, in the debate, you know, you asked the question over, you know, well, what do we do if we need to import new textbooks here? That's kind of the whole problem. We do need to be able to bring a new textbook, so we do need a university bookstore for students, but how do we tangibly, you know, make change right now?
*02:22:04-02:22:22*

**Speaker 30**: So something that I think I'd like to work on next year is on the Class Grant program.
*02:22:27-02:22:31*

**Speaker 30**: So for context, currently I'm needing the rewrite of the university Class Grant policy.
*02:22:31-02:22:37*

**Speaker 30**: And moving forward, what we want to do is actually just improve the Class Grant program to make sure it works for everyone.
*02:22:38-02:22:42*

**Speaker 30**: So something that we've already done is improving the training system for Class Grant, but I think we need to look at the program holistically to make sure that, you know, right now Class Grant have a very specific purpose, But I think actually looking at what are the opportunities that Class Groups can provide us.
*02:22:43-02:22:58*

**Speaker 30**: Class Groups are, I think, the most direct form of representation that students have, especially on academic matters, and actually just providing the tools to Class Groups to make sure they're good representatives of their class.
*02:22:59-02:23:10*

**Speaker 30**: So I think, yeah, one thing that I want to do next year is look at the Class Group program and see how we can improve that for our students.
*02:23:10-02:23:15*

**Speaker 22**: Cool. Just to follow up on that, obviously your policy requires a certain amount of burden to be placed on the people volunteering for Class Group.
*02:23:16-02:23:23*

**Speaker 22**: for example, acting into knowledge banks and those programs and training, do you think A, it's achievable to have quite a lot of class reps engaging in these programs, and B, would it deter
*02:23:23-02:23:32*

**Speaker 30**: people from volunteering? Yeah, really good question. I think two points to that. I think, first of all, class reps are already quite engaged people, and actually this year, as we've been leading the class repolity rewrite, a lot of class reps are super engaged with that process, so that's
*02:23:32-02:23:47*

**Speaker 22**: actually really awesome to see. And the second part to that, I guess, sorry, I should probably
*02:23:47-02:23:55*

**Speaker 30**: teach our people. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I think what we need to do is provide better incentives for ClassGraphs to be ClassGraphs. So I think through the ClassGraph training, the training, refresh, what we're doing is giving people more skills, things like how to talk to people, that kind of stuff. What we can do is continue to uplift and give those skills to ClassGraphs and just teach them how to be better representatives and leaders and these are incentives for people to volunteer to do contracts.
*02:23:55-02:24:20*

**Speaker 22**: Awesome, thank you.
*02:24:21-02:24:22*

**Speaker 19**: Could you give us a question for me please?
*02:24:24-02:24:25*

**Speaker 22**: What is one initiative you want to implement going into the office?
*02:24:26-02:24:29*

**Speaker 19**: One issue that I've been seeing quite a lot throughout the San Francisco is students being troubled by the high transportation costs.
*02:24:31-02:24:39*

**Speaker 19**: There's quite a lot of conversation going around about that, about how they would be bringing campus costs to the various education.
*02:24:40-02:24:45*

**Speaker 19**: However, since that is an issue that is outside of the university control, I would like to propose an issue that I would offer an alternative solution until that resolution is raised about confirmation costs, which would be the hybrid mode of attendance proposal that I have.
*02:24:46-02:24:59*

**Speaker 19**: This will offer students a chance to get an incentive in the campus if that is an actual barrier that they are facing at the moment.
*02:24:59-02:25:07*

**Speaker 19**: Can you just clarify what you mean by hyperbolic content?
*02:25:08-02:25:11*

**Speaker 19**: Again, it would be online. Since I'm pretty sure they obviously already did a really good job about the mainstream, about the online content.
*02:25:12-02:25:24*

**Speaker 19**: So I think that could be carried away in both cases.
*02:25:25-02:25:27*

**Speaker 19**: I think this is somehow a little bit like.
*02:25:28-02:25:30*

**Speaker 4**: But our lectures have not already been recorded in person, so my question is how would you add to that in terms of how to do it?
*02:25:32-02:25:41*

**Speaker 19**: Well, lectures are really the attendance market that's currently being used.
*02:25:42-02:25:46*

**Speaker 19**: It's tutorials where the attendance is mandated, pre-insured, and I feel that's the biggest issue where students are doing the pressure to come out to campus.
*02:25:46-02:25:53*

**Speaker 19**: But if there wasn't a way to mark attendance through the same, maybe proposing different So we are going to move on to specific policy questions now.
*02:25:54-02:26:17*

**Speaker 4**: I'll just start with Chris Ryan.
*02:26:17-02:26:19*

**Speaker 22**: Also, obviously you're quite open about being part of the Socialist Club, having that affiliation.
*02:26:23-02:26:28*

**Speaker 22**: But obviously your role on ASA is to represent as many students in this as possible.
*02:26:28-02:26:33*

**Speaker 22**: Do you think you'll be able to represent the entire undergraduate portfolio in a way that is more partisan?
*02:26:33-02:26:38*

**Speaker 23**: I don't think anyone whether they claim to be political or unpolitical can represent an entire thousands of students on this campus.
*02:26:40-02:26:49*

**Speaker 23**: In fact, for the 10% that voted anyway on the AUSA election, that's money for sending students who are completely unrepresented.
*02:26:50-02:26:57*

**Speaker 23**: That is not a functioning democracy, that is not a healthy democracy.
*02:26:58-02:27:00*

**Speaker 23**: No one here can genuinely say that is what we aim for and hope to achieve.
*02:27:01-02:27:05*

**Speaker 23**: So the actual question will be, how do we keep people accountable?
*02:27:06-02:27:10*

**Speaker 23**: How do we keep student input coming in?
*02:27:11-02:27:13*

**Speaker 5**: How do we keep AUSA, well, how do we make AUSA, because it isn't,
*02:27:13-02:27:17*

**Speaker 23**: how do we make AUSA an organization for students and by students?
*02:27:18-02:27:21*

**Speaker 23**: And to do that, you need to use the fact that AUSA can call special general meetings like Crackham is currently doing, right?
*02:27:22-02:27:27*

**Speaker 23**: You can call special general meetings, you can change the constitution, you can keep it directly accountable to the student base.
*02:27:28-02:27:34*

**Speaker 23**: You need to, I see I'm out of time, but people, or turn this on here, so can I keep going?
*02:27:35-02:27:40*

**Speaker 23**: Or, 10 seconds, yeah.
*02:27:40-02:27:43*

**Speaker 23**: Secondly, we need to have open public meetings.
*02:27:44-02:27:47*

**Speaker 23**: It isn't just the meeting of the student groups.
*02:27:48-02:27:53*

**Speaker 23**: It has to be in a public space.
*02:27:53-02:27:55*

**Speaker 23**: It has to be well advertised, so every single student can come along and have a say, and we actually directly do the credit to every single student as an equal vote in deciding what the policy or the constitution of ASA looks like.
*02:27:56-02:28:08*

**Speaker 4**: I guess the question is though, do you think students would engage with that process of going to those SGOs that you want to host and changing the constitution and voting on those changes?
*02:28:09-02:28:20*

**Speaker 23**: I think it's a it's a it is it is a difficult question right because like I would say like to an extent yes, to an extent we do have at least 10% of the student base relatively politicized voting in the USA election. I'd also like to point to the fact that we have around roughly 40 something candidates running in this election, running campaigns, leafleting, you know, doing a listening of things to try and get into this position. Imagine if they use all that energy and all that desire for a political position to organize students, to organize a student case.
*02:28:22-02:29:01*

**Speaker 23**: Instead of having a little one month of fame, what if you had 12 months of 40 people who are genuinely dedicated to organizing, to organizing students?
*02:29:01-02:29:11*

**Speaker 23**: So yes, I do think it is possible.
*02:29:12-02:29:15*

**Speaker 23**: I think it requires work, and that is true, but it is possible, yeah.
*02:29:15-02:29:19*

**Speaker 4**: Okay, thank you.
*02:29:20-02:29:21*

**Speaker 4**: Our next question is specifically, and also on the role.
*02:29:21-02:29:25*

**Speaker 4**: You've been told a lot in your podcast, and also in the answer that, being undergraduate EDP is not just about academics, it's beyond that.
*02:29:25-02:29:32*

**Speaker 4**: So do you think that the UD EDP role should be focusing primarily on advocacy rather than focusing on substantive undergraduate educational action?
*02:29:33-02:29:43*

**Speaker 23**: That's a good question.
*02:29:44-02:29:45*

**Speaker 23**: I haven't been in the role, so I'm not sure what it looks like on the day to day.
*02:29:47-02:29:51*

**Speaker 23**: What I will bring to this role is my experience as an advocate and as an organiser.
*02:29:52-02:29:57*

**Speaker 23**: So that's something that I've had to grapple with when I'm actually in a position because I'm not sure, for example, what Matthew, what his data looks like in this role.
*02:29:58-02:30:10*

**Speaker 23**: But I know I am doing a different perspective and I would say a broader, more institutional perspective into what this role can be and what a USA can do.
*02:30:11-02:30:20*

**Speaker 31**: And I guess to follow up, do you think that is something that you would be able to actually change and affect within your one-year term?
*02:30:21-02:30:28*

**Speaker 23**: No, I think that a student movement is not a one-year term project.
*02:30:30-02:30:34*

**Speaker 23**: A student movement is independent of me.
*02:30:34-02:30:36*

**Speaker 23**: Actually, it's about mobilising everyone here and getting everyone here to go out and picket, just like our teachers are at the moment.
*02:30:37-02:30:43*

**Speaker 23**: There's currently a teacher strike nationally.
*02:30:43-02:30:45*

**Speaker 23**: We need to be, you know, just like we need to be out there picketing, we need to be out there occupying, which is what they did in the 1990s.
*02:30:45-02:30:51*

**Speaker 23**: when education was brought in.
*02:30:51-02:30:55*

**Speaker 23**: There is a historical precedent here.
*02:30:57-02:30:59*

**Speaker 23**: It's just a matter of having the political will and the political direction to reach out and make it a reality.
*02:30:59-02:31:06*

**Speaker 22**: Thank you.
*02:31:06-02:31:07*

**Speaker 22**: Thank you.
*02:31:12-02:31:13*

**Speaker 22**: We're going to move on to you.
*02:31:13-02:31:14*

**Speaker 22**: Our first question is, you have a large policy section section about speaking up and have a concerted effort on making statements.
*02:31:15-02:31:22*

**Speaker 22**: I guess the question here is how effective do you think broad statements are, firstly, in terms of galvanizing actual change, and secondly, in engaging the student body?
*02:31:23-02:31:31*

**Speaker 30**: Yeah, that's a really good question. It's actually a conversation we've been having throughout the year as an exec this year. First of all, it is actually really important for AUSA to be speaking up on issues that students fear about, and what that looks like is making statements to show the student body that actually we are listening to the issues and we actually want to speak out about these issues.
*02:31:31-02:31:50*

**Speaker 30**: But those statements are meaningless unless we take action against them, right?
*02:31:51-02:31:54*

**Speaker 30**: So we'll take one example at the start of the year when the anti-stalking legislation was brought in and our women's rights officer was very passionate about that.
*02:31:54-02:32:02*

**Speaker 30**: And as an executive, what we did was we put in our statement saying our support for anti-stalking legislation and saying some changes that we wanted to be made, and that was the statement.
*02:32:02-02:32:10*

**Speaker 30**: But what we also did was we submitted to Parliament some of our recommendations and actually bringing the experiences of students with stalking on campus.
*02:32:10-02:32:19*

**Speaker 30**: And so that was an effort led by a women's rights officer.
*02:32:20-02:32:22*

**Speaker 30**: I don't know if he's here.
*02:32:22-02:32:23*

**Speaker 30**: But that's an example of what we can do, not just to make statements, but to back it up by action that would actually affect some change.
*02:32:23-02:32:31*

**Speaker 22**: Just as a follow-up, to clarify, what kind of issues would you make these statements on, particularly how do you ensure that the statements you're making are representative of the student body if you were sort of thinking about that?
*02:32:31-02:32:43*

**Speaker 30**: So the statements that we make, obviously, are going to be student-related, right?
*02:32:44-02:32:48*

**Speaker 30**: And so a lot of the times we'll look to the executive, and the executive has a lot of portfolio positions that include the different communities, and those are really direct channels we have to different communities to make sure that things that AUC is doing in general respond to the needs of different communities around campus.
*02:32:49-02:33:05*

**Speaker 30**: We're also held accountable by the student council, and they question us on things that we do all the time, once a month, and in looking at that as well, of course.
*02:33:06-02:33:14*

**Speaker 30**: and they've put us accountable.
*02:33:14-02:33:14*

**Speaker 30**: But I think it's really important for us to be taking a stand on two issues and on things that we believe are things that affect students.
*02:33:15-02:33:22*

**Speaker 30**: Things like public transport, things like the high cost of rent and the high cost of food on campus as well.
*02:33:22-02:33:26*

**Speaker 30**: These are things that we can and absolutely should be taking a stand against.
*02:33:26-02:33:29*

**Speaker 4**: - Just to kind of follow up on that, do you think engaging with the executives of the student council is representative of the student body?
*02:33:33-02:33:41*

**Speaker 30**: So yes and no, right? It's a representative democracy where the executive represents different communities and student council represents different faculties, but of course we should be doing a lot more to reach out to students in general. That's why I think it's something that AUSA should and could be doing better is reaching out to the communities that don't already engage with AUSA and making sure that we're putting things out there and holding events and doing things that actually attract people and hearing from everyday students and not just ones who are engaged already with students.
*02:33:43-02:34:16*

**Speaker 30**: But that means that I think it's also just important for AUSA to be taking stands on things that we believe are important and are actually things that we campaign on taking a stand on.
*02:34:17-02:34:27*

**Speaker 4**: This was an asking Thomas question.
*02:34:28-02:34:29*

**Speaker 4**: Looking at the IGVIC report, we saw that you wrote a little bit about the Student Voice Forum.
*02:34:30-02:34:35*

**Speaker 4**: What's the purpose on that and have you gotten any feedback in terms of student input on those?
*02:34:36-02:34:41*

**Speaker 30**: Yeah so for context for those who don't know at the start of the year as an executive actually we talked a lot about doing something we wanted to call the open house project or initiative essentially it's kind of similar to like general meetings but it's just you know once a month or once every two weeks we go to a public space like here or shads or the quad where students are able to come to talk to us about their issues, hear about what we're doing, and just hold us accountable in general.
*02:34:42-02:35:08*

**Speaker 30**: So we've talked about that as an executive, and we brought that to the student council to talk about as well.
*02:35:10-02:35:14*

**Speaker 30**: But one of the issues that we run into is actually the point that you raised earlier, Jessica, was how do we make sure that we're not engaging people who are already engaged?
*02:35:15-02:35:24*

**Speaker 30**: How do we make sure that we're engaging people who aren't already engaged with AUSA already?
*02:35:24-02:35:29*

**Speaker 30**: But how are we reaching out to people who don't already engage with the process?
*02:35:29-02:35:32*

**Speaker 30**: And so that's one of the hurdles that we're trying to face right now.
*02:35:33-02:35:35*

**Speaker 30**: We've thought about different ways to do it, but it's quite a difficult thing and requires more than just a visitor.
*02:35:36-02:35:42*

**Speaker 30**: And so at the end of the year, what I want to do is review our entire student voice pipeline to see actually where and when do students have an opportunity to have meaningful contribution to that consultation process, all the way from the students all the way up.
*02:35:42-02:35:55*

**Speaker 22**: Thank you.
*02:35:55-02:35:55*

**Speaker 22**: Just a final question.
*02:35:57-02:35:58*

**Speaker 22**: Obviously, you've been previously affiliated with a number of movements, particularly Students for Fair Rent.
*02:35:58-02:36:03*

**Speaker 22**: Do you consider this to have been a successful campaign?
*02:36:04-02:36:06*

**Speaker 22**: Sorry, I'm going to repeat the last one.
*02:36:07-02:36:08*

**Speaker 22**: Do you consider Students for Fair Rent to have been a successful campaign?
*02:36:08-02:36:12*

**Speaker 30**: Just to clarify, Students for Fair Rent is the first and only campaign I've actually been a part of.
*02:36:12-02:36:17*

**Speaker 30**: The reason why I started SFR was because I worked at Holes for three years, I thought it was really expensive and I wanted to do something about it.
*02:36:17-02:36:25*

**Speaker 30**: That's the only reason why I did it.
*02:36:25-02:36:27*

**Speaker 30**: It was the first campaign I did, so of course there were a lot of mistakes made, but I also learned a lot from that process.
*02:36:28-02:36:33*

**Speaker 30**: Was it a successful campaign? Obviously not.
*02:36:33-02:36:35*

**Speaker 30**: Our goal was to decrease rates, but we knew that there was a reasonable ask.
*02:36:35-02:36:39*

**Speaker 30**: What we did achieve, though, was rather than increasing rent by 8%, the university increased it by 1% because of the movement that we did.
*02:36:40-02:36:47*

**Speaker 30**: And that was a movement that students really rallied behind, and are really proud of that campaign.
*02:36:47-02:36:52*

**Speaker 30**: Of course, you know, I think we can all understand that under this current political climate, it's quite difficult for student campaigns to continue.
*02:36:53-02:37:00*

**Speaker 30**: It's really easy to read the news every day and feel really upset and apathetic about everything.
*02:37:00-02:37:06*

**Speaker 30**: But I think, for me at least, that gives me more motivation to continue.
*02:37:06-02:37:10*

**Speaker 30**: That's why I want to keep fighting for students through 80%.
*02:37:10-02:37:12*

**Speaker 4**: Just a follow up on that, in terms of your policies you spoke about how student accommodation is and the one that you want to work on as a VP, how would you build on this experience to actually make a difference?
*02:37:13-02:37:24*

**Speaker 30**: So I mean, in terms of just general skills and experience, like I said, that was my first campaign. I learned a lot about how to talk to students on the campaign, how to rally, build a movement, that kind of stuff.
*02:37:24-02:37:34*

**Speaker 30**: I'm bringing that to AUSA as well.
*02:37:34-02:37:36*

**Speaker 30**: How I'm going to do that through AUSA is actually, being in this position, I have access to a lot of the higher ups at university, and especially the people who have direct influence over this stuff.
*02:37:36-02:37:46*

**Speaker 30**: And so that's where I am able to bring a lot of the advocacy skills to be like, actually, this is an issue that students really care about.
*02:37:47-02:37:54*

**Speaker 30**: And I'm grateful enough to be in a position where they will actually listen to what we have to say and take on that feedback as well.
*02:37:54-02:38:00*

**Speaker 4**: - Thank you.
*02:38:01-02:38:01*

**Speaker 4**: I am from the University of New York. In terms of any previous experience, do you have any previous experience or contributions or academic initiatives that would be related to the EG/UVP role?
*02:38:02-02:38:13*

**Speaker 19**: My name is Elka Ishimu. I have mobilized the board from the communications and media classes that I'm in and I have established a club that will be coming to the next one.
*02:38:14-02:38:25*

**Speaker 19**: The minimum requirement for setting up an initiative would be around 30 students, but I've luckily got the amount of double time.
*02:38:26-02:38:34*

**Speaker 19**: So it was a very successful initiative, and it has exceeded now, which will be starting soon.
*02:38:35-02:38:40*

**Speaker 22**: Do you think that experience in a lot of impact expectations is comparable to the role you were in here, or how would you expand all the experiences that already match the size of the role?
*02:38:42-02:38:51*

**Speaker 19**: Of course, the UGDVP role would be much bigger, but I believe that I don't have that experience because there's a lack of opportunities that currently exist to mobile exchange with something as good as that without being directly involved in a role as good as that.
*02:38:52-02:39:06*

**Speaker 19**: So I have engaged a lot this year. I have been in ASA's digital media officer. I have been social media intern. So I have reached out and done as much as I could have with the opportunities that are available to students without directly being involved as a university.
*02:39:07-02:39:23*

**Speaker 4**: Do you think those skills that you gained from being a part of those other clubs or committees would transmit well into the role that you would have as an undergraduate UDP?
*02:39:24-02:39:35*

**Speaker 19**: Definitely, because as a faculty vet, I have to attend multiple meetings a year where faculty-based issues about education and academic policies are derived.
*02:39:35-02:39:46*

**Speaker 19**: I was part of the Arts faculty meeting where we discussed the merger of Arts and Education faculty, and some really important decisions were made about what programs would be should they do, which can't be.
*02:39:47-02:39:59*

**Speaker 19**: So yes, I definitely have some experience coming in there.
*02:40:00-02:40:02*

**Speaker 4**: And this is just a follow-up from your first, our first session when we asked about, when we spoke about the hybrid modes of education, you spoke specifically on tutorials.
*02:40:03-02:40:12*

**Speaker 4**: My question is how much power does the United EVP have over the teaching of the students who are teaching the students on the campus?
*02:40:13-02:40:23*

**Speaker 19**: There wouldn't be a direct control because that is a university staff issue, but it does appeal to the engineering leaders in the history of the issues in those academic committees where I would be bringing those issues and proposing some suggestive solutions which they would have to consider when they make the policy.
*02:40:24-02:40:45*

**Speaker 4**: Do you think just considering the policy enough to enact ten full change in terms of those hybrid-intensive changes?
*02:40:46-02:40:53*

**Speaker 19**: Again, that's the other transparency one that I'm pushing for, wherein even if they don't exactly enact it, they would have to be transparent about how they're going to do decisions and what considerations they actually include within their decisions.
*02:40:54-02:41:08*

**Speaker 19**: So I feel like that would make students more involved and make their intentions more about what they're wanting to do with the student concerns that they're hearing about.
*02:41:09-02:41:17*

**Speaker 22**: Do not tell any of your other policies about academic assessment inclusivity, what does that look like annually?
*02:41:22-02:41:29*

**Speaker 19**: The current assessment inclusivity is in terms of just maybe some extra time or maybe less students, but there are cognitive impairments and different experiences of less students being on the table, especially at the university within Aotea and Oro.
*02:41:30-02:41:44*

**Speaker 19**: there should be more of a focus on Mataranga Maori instead of a PR listed notion that has a really big significant and standardising objective ability, whereas Mataranga Maori would be more interconnected and dynamic and holistic.
*02:41:45-02:42:01*

**Speaker 19**: So I feel that would represent cognitive impairments as well as our specific community.
*02:42:01-02:42:06*

**Speaker 4**: Thank you. Awesome.
*02:42:07-02:42:09*

**Speaker 4**: Moving on to our next section, we will be opening questions to the crowd if anyone in the crowd has any questions to these candidates.
*02:42:09-02:42:15*

**Speaker 32**: Hi, just a quick question for me. I know AUSD is involved in thinking about how assessment works and things like that.
*02:42:23-02:42:30*

**Speaker 32**: So I was just wondering if you think the way the university conducts assessments and the ways that we do is different, especially with the rise of AI and things like that.
*02:42:30-02:42:40*

**Speaker 32**: And if you were to make change, what's something you think you could do concretely in the world to make that better experience?
*02:42:40-02:42:46*

**Speaker 4**: Every candidate can just answer this in around 30 seconds.
*02:42:48-02:42:51*

**Speaker 30**: Yeah, I think assessment is one of the biggest things that we're looking at.
*02:42:52-02:42:55*

**Speaker 30**: In terms of AI, how are we assisting students to make sure that they're learning, right?
*02:42:55-02:43:00*

**Speaker 30**: and AI poses the biggest threat to that.
*02:43:00-02:43:02*

**Speaker 30**: So the way that we're doing assessments now, no, not really good for purpose because it's quite easy to get around a lot of things, right?
*02:43:02-02:43:09*

**Speaker 30**: The university has a digital first policy for assessments, but a lot of lecturers want to go back to paper-based exams, and I don't think that's actually accessible and good for students.
*02:43:09-02:43:18*

**Speaker 30**: So something that the university is looking at is the two-lane approach, right?
*02:43:19-02:43:22*

**Speaker 30**: And that's something that I'm making sure that students are a part of as well, is making sure that there are multiple forms of assessments and diversity of assessment to make sure that we're able to capture the need of assisting students but doing it in a way that is ethical and safe in this current climate.
*02:43:22-02:43:37*

**Speaker 32**: Essentially I'm just asking if you think the way the university currently conducts assessments is fit for this especially with the way that education is changing.
*02:43:44-02:43:53*

**Speaker 19**: The current assessment format is very limited in terms of accessibility I think.
*02:43:58-02:44:02*

**Speaker 19**: It definitely prioritises students who are better than writing or comprehending information through text.
*02:44:03-02:44:08*

**Speaker 19**: There can be different assessment formats.
*02:44:08-02:44:10*

**Speaker 19**: If you know Dr. Kitty Ves, she has done really good work by incorporating other number of Māori formats into her assessments that aren't directly so textually related.
*02:44:11-02:44:20*

**Speaker 23**: Yeah, so assessments, AI, all that stuff. I think that, well personally, I hate AI. It's dead. It's literally stealing people's work and you're, you know, the data that you're training on is stolen. I think that if students choose to use AI, they're actually hurting themselves.
*02:44:23-02:44:44*

**Speaker 23**: If lecturers choose to use AI, and I know there's classes which have used AI in the material, It basically ruins the whole course.
*02:44:45-02:44:53*

**Speaker 23**: I think it's done courses.
*02:44:53-02:44:54*

**Speaker 23**: I don't think AI should be in university.
*02:44:55-02:44:56*

**Speaker 23**: It's generally speaking it's wrong most of the time.
*02:44:56-02:44:59*

**Speaker 23**: I don't think people really, it may have some application, but I think it shouldn't be in university at all.
*02:45:00-02:45:06*

**Speaker 4**: - Awesome, thank you.
*02:45:07-02:45:08*

**Speaker 4**: Anyone else have a question?
*02:45:08-02:45:09*

**Speaker 29**: - Can you hear me?
*02:45:18-02:45:18*

**Speaker 29**: Two of the most visible parts of AUSA's relationship with students were its association with UBIC and Kraken.
*02:45:19-02:45:27*

**Speaker 29**: With the limitation of Korgulu, UBIC happened so suddenly and Kraken's continuing budget cuts and censorship from the AUSA constitutional changes in 2024 fracturing that relationship, do you believe that the student body was effectively informed and involved in these events?
*02:45:27-02:45:44*

**Speaker 23**: No, not at all. I think. Well actually, how about you do a raise of hands here. How many people knew Kraken had its funding cut? Raise your hand. I don't mean in the past few weeks, I mean in 2024. Were you aware? That looks like about four or five people out of maybe 25. So I think I can, yeah, you can say no, not at all, not remotely. And that is again fundamentally the problem with AUSA is it is the students are forced to essentially be bureaucrats, are forced to represent the interest of AUSA and not the interest of students. AUSA should be for students. I mean, the levy, and I don't know if many people here know this, but the university levies $1,100 every single year from every single student, right?
*02:45:45-02:46:40*

**Speaker 23**: That's $30 million across the whole year.
*02:46:41-02:46:43*

**Speaker 23**: That money is only about $1.2 million of those dollars go to AUSA, right?
*02:46:44-02:46:52*

**Speaker 23**: The rest of that is spent by the university.
*02:46:52-02:46:53*

**Speaker 23**: We get no input to how that money is spent.
*02:46:53-02:46:55*

**Speaker 23**: AUSA itself...
*02:46:56-02:46:57*

**Speaker 23**: Sorry, I'm out of time.
*02:46:57-02:46:58*

**Speaker 30**: First thing I'll say is please fill in the survey for the CSSF, it's happening right now, it's ending on Sunday.
*02:47:03-02:47:09*

**Speaker 30**: That's the most direct input you'll have on how the suit levy is spent.
*02:47:10-02:47:13*

**Speaker 30**: Please fill it in, it's really really important that you guys have a voice in that as well.
*02:47:14-02:47:17*

**Speaker 30**: In terms of, so the question was about you Beck and Kraken, and what was the last part of that question, sorry?
*02:47:18-02:47:22*

**Speaker 3**: In 2024 the AUSA has been constantly in, so Kraken will kind of release a few of that, right?
*02:47:22-02:47:27*

**Speaker 30**: So I was not in AUSN 22 before, so I can't speak on that, unfortunately.
*02:47:28-02:47:32*

**Speaker 30**: I didn't know about it until recently either.
*02:47:32-02:47:34*

**Speaker 30**: So I can't make any comments on that, I'm sorry.
*02:47:35-02:47:36*

**Speaker 30**: And on UBIC as well, to be clear, I guess, AUSA was not involved in that decision.
*02:47:37-02:47:42*

**Speaker 33**: The executive is not involved with the operations of UBIC.
*02:47:42-02:47:46*

**Speaker 33**: We found out at the same time as everyone else.
*02:47:46-02:47:48*

**Speaker 33**: So just I agree we're not part of that decision, and I can't make any comments on that.
*02:47:48-02:47:52*

**Speaker 33**: I'm sorry.
*02:47:52-02:47:52*

**Speaker 33**: I am aware that the engagement baby has to sit on the board for CACM, and ask for you if there is more information about what
*02:47:54-02:48:00*
