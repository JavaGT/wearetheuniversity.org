# Student-focused Q&A

Questions and answers about the proposed new faculty arrangements for the faculties of Law, and Business and Economics.

### Why is the University merging the faculties of Business and Economics, and Law?

This proposed change is designed to strengthen our teaching, research, and community engagement by creating a faculty that unites the expertise of both Business and Law. This alignment would help enhance our programmes, increase the range of academic opportunities, and improve access to interdisciplinary learning.

### How would the combined faculty affect my degree programme?

For students currently enrolled in Business and Economics, or Law programmes, there would be no changes to your degree requirements or course offerings. The combined faculty would provide added opportunities, including expanded research and networking opportunities, as well as the potential for new interdisciplinary programmes or courses in the future.

### Will combining the faculties impact the rankings of either the Auckland Law School or the University of Auckland Business School?

The planned merger will not have any direct impact on subject rankings. International subject rankings are not defined by internal faculty or department structures. They take into consideration research outputs in subject-defined journals and conferences, citations, individual researcher performance and honours (such as highly cited researchers and award winners), and university reputation voting.  

### Would the name of my degree change under the new faculty?

No, the names of existing degrees in Business and Economics, and Law would remain the same. This proposed change only affects the faculty structure, not individual degree titles or content.

### What new opportunities would this proposed combined faculty create for students?

The combined faculty would allow students to access a wider range of extra-curricular, research, mentorship, and interdisciplinary learning opportunities. Students in Law, for example, would benefit from expanded access to business and commercial insights, while Business students could engage with legal studies relevant to their fields.

### How would the combined faculty enhance research and learning?

By creating a larger academic community, the faculty can offer additional research resources, donor-funded centres, and access to new networks that support interdisciplinary projects. This gives students enhanced opportunities to work with leading experts and gain insights across a wider range of fields.

### Would Law still be represented in the new faculty’s name?

The Vice-Chancellor is supportive of Law being in the name of a combined faculty and, should the proposal be adopted, consultation engagement with staff and students would be undertaken accordingly.

### How would this new faculty benefit my career prospects after graduation?

By bringing together Business and Economics, and Law into a single faculty, the University would strengthen its position as a leader in these fields. This would allow us to build stronger connections with industry, creating more pathways for students to engage with businesses and legal firms, and positioning graduates for success in diverse fields.

### Would access to student services or support services change?

These proposed changes are not expected to impact the current availability of resources and support services for students. We are committed to providing ongoing support to ensure your academic success. We envision that in the future, the proposed new faculty arrangement may lead to improved access to resources and support services that enhance the overall student experience.

### How will student engagement and student support teams for specialised areas such as career support, well-being and pastoral care be structured? Will they remain separate to preserve their specialised skills or is there a plan to merge them into a single team?

The proposal is still at an early stage, and no decisions have been made about the future structure of these teams. Should the proposal proceed, we are committed to ensuring that the strengths of both faculties in delivering exceptional support to students—including career advice, pastoral care, and well-being—are not negatively impacted. Any future alignment or synergy opportunities would be carefully considered.

### Are there any specific plans for how the new public law and private law departments would look? How will this proposal impact the courses offered and the teaching and learning especially considering that law students need to have knowledge of both private and public law to pass the bar?

The proposal suggests creating two distinct departments in the Auckland Law School: one focusing on private law (e.g., commercial, corporate, intellectual property, and technology law) and the other on public law (e.g., criminal, environmental, indigenous, and international law). Faculty members from the Business School’s Department of Commercial Law would join the private and commercial law department under this proposal. 

This proposed change is structural and does not impact existing courses or degree programmes. Students will continue to receive a comprehensive education that equips them with the knowledge needed to pass the bar. We are keen to hear feedback and alternative ideas for structuring the Law School, ensuring we maintain excellence in teaching and learning.
