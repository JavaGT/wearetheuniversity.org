Culinary delights - From a historical perspective

From the advice of Aunt Daisy to Spanish Cream - they'll all be up for discussion at the New Zealand Culinary History Conference to be held at Victoria University next week.

The Conference, which will examine the importance of food and cooking in the history of New Zealand and Australia, has been organised by the History Programme in the School of History, Philosophy, Political Science & International Relations, the Stout Research Centre for New Zealand Studies and the Wellington Symposium of Gastronomy. It will be held at the Kelburn Campus on Monday 14 and Tuesday 15 November.

The keynote address will be given by Professor Helen Leach, Professor of Anthropology, from Otago University, on the archaeology of cookbooks while other speakers include Michael Symons, author of One continuous picnic: a history of eating in Australia and the award-winning, A history of cooks and cooking, and Wellington chef and writer, Lois Daish. Also speaking will be Roger Haden, Director of the Adelaide University's Research Centre for the History of Food and Drink.
