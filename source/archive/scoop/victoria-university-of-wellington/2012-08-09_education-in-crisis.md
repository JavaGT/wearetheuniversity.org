Education in Crisis?

What should school and university students learn in the 21st century? Will performance pay improve teacher quality, or are class sizes a more important factor in making a difference to student success? What do we know about how young people and university students learn?

Eminent researchers from Victoria University’s Faculty of Education will examine current educational concerns such as these during a new six-week lecture series, Education in Crisis?

“Finding workable solutions to the questions we face in education is never straightforward but looking at the sort of research that informs this course can give us some pointers on the best direction to take,” says Senior Lecturer Dr Mark Sheehan.

People interested in the future of education in New Zealand are encouraged to attend these two-hour interactive lectures, which will address some of the topical issues facing New Zealand’s education system Issues covered include the knowledge that counts in the ‘knowledge society’, how young people learn to think critically, the purposes of tertiary education in New Zealand today and how can schools can help create active engaged citizens.

The Education in Crisis? series will be held each Monday evening for six weeks (20 August—24 September) from 6–8pm. The cost for the full series is $120, or $25 per session.
