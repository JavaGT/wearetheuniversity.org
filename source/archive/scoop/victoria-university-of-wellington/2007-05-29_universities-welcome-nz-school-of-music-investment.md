Universities welcome NZ School of Music investment

Plans for a purpose-built home for the New Zealand School of Music—a centre of musical excellence established by Massey and Victoria universities—moved a big step forwards yesterday thanks to an $11 million investment from the Government.

The Minister for Tertiary Education, the Hon Dr Michael Cullen, announced the funding at the School's inaugural graduation reception at Parliament's Banquet Hall last night.

The universities' plans to build a central city purpose-built home for the School have already won the support of the Wellington City Council which has offered the former Circa Theatre site in Wellington's Civic Square.

The School, which has been fully operative since January 2006, brings together the music programmes of Victoria and Massey universities and has more than 300 students.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, thanked the Government for its investment.

"The Government's announcement indicates its support for the vision the two universities have for a School that is a national centre of musical excellence and for a facility that will be a major public amenity to be enjoyed by New Zealanders for many generations.

"While the School has achieved much in its first year—including appointing the inaugural Director and delivering a host of joint programmes—the full benefits will never be realised until it has a purpose-built home, ideally with a performance auditorium attached to it."

Massey University Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Andrea McIlroy, said the central city site remained the best option.

"The Civic Square site, so close to the Wellington Town Hall, the Michael Fowler Centre and other performance venues, opens the doors for enhanced collaboration with organisations such as the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. Its location will also bring more students into the inner-city and enliven the vicinity socially and economically."

School Director, Professor Elizabeth Hudson, said the Government's backing meant that fundraising efforts could now begin in earnest.

"To achieve the ambition of the School, it has quickly become clear a new building is not window-dressing, but an absolute necessity. A single space within which to operate will not only mitigate the challenges of working across two universities, but will realise our vision for collaboration. Through student presence and through staff and student performances, we can contribute to the cultural and economic development of Wellington."
