Tax Working Group invites public discussion

After five months of meetings, the Tax Working Group is holding a public conference to discuss creating a world-class tax system for New Zealand.

Entitled ‘A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future’, the conference will include discussion on: frameworks to guide tax reform; current challenges; income tax and transfers; GST; the taxation of capital income; land taxes; and company tax.

The conference will be held on 1 December and will be opened by Hon Bill English, Minister of Finance and closed by Hon Peter Dunne, Minister of Revenue.

The Tax Working Group was set up in June 2009 to consider the medium-term direction of the tax system. Victoria University’s Centre for Accounting, Governance and Taxation Research, in partnership with the Treasury and Inland Revenue, has brought together individuals from the private sector and academia, as well as tax policy officials from the Treasury and Inland Revenue to look at a variety of policy options.

Professor Bob Buckle, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Commerce at Victoria University, is Chair of the Group.

“We have worked through the pros and cons of a variety of policy options in our meetings,” says Professor Buckle.

“Now it’s time to share our thinking with the wider public and provide a forum to hear their views.”
