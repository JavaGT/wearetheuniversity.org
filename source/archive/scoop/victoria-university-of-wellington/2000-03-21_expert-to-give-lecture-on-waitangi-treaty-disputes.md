Expert to give lecture on Waitangi Treaty disputes
==================================================

**Tuesday, 21 March 2000, 3:13 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Jock Brookfield, author and Emeritus Professor of the University of Auckland, is to give a public lecture about Waitangi Treaty disputes at Victoria University on Friday 24 March.

The lecture, ‘Constitutional Disputes, Revolutions and Waitangi: the Role of Courts and Tribunals, and other matters’ is hosted by the New Zealand Institute for Dispute Resolution and the New Zealand Institute of Public Law.

Author of the recently published 'Waitangi and Indigenous Rights: Revolution, Law and Legitimation' (Auckland University Press), Professor Brookfield retired from the University of Auckland Law Faculty in 1993. During his 27 years of teaching and research he focused mainly on constitutional law, land law and conveyancing.

Professor Brookfield has a special interest in the role of law in revolutionary constitutional changes and in the factors that legitimate such changes.

The lecture is to be held in Lecture Theatre Two, Rear Courtyard, Victoria University Law School, Old Government Buildings, 15 Lambton Quay at 5.30 pm on Friday 24 March 2000.
