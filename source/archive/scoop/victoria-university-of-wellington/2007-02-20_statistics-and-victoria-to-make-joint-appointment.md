Statistics NZ and Victoria to make joint appointment

An Adjunct Professor of Official Statistics is to be appointed at Victoria University in a joint appointment with Statistics New Zealand.

Statistics New Zealand is recruiting a new executive to its team who, while remaining an employee of the Government department, will be seconded on a half-time basis to be the Adjunct Professor in Official Statistics in Victoria’s School of Government.

The new position reflects a shared desire by Statistics New Zealand and the University to satisfy the need to enhance knowledge in the use of official statistics in New Zealand, particularly toward informing good public and social policy.

The new Adjunct Professor will develop and deliver a suite of new courses as well as advocating improved use of and understanding of official statistics in both academic and student research. The new position will not only benefit students in the School of Government, but also the School of Mathematics, Statistics & Computer Science.

A Memorandum of Understanding to establish the position was recently signed by Government Statistician Brian Pink and Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, and a recruitment process has begun. An appointment is expected in late February.

Professor Walsh welcomed the partnership with Statistics New Zealand, which builds on the Strategic Tertiary Alliance established between the University and the States Services Commission in 2003.

“The Alliance, which formalised the long-standing relationship between Victoria University and the public sector as its leading education provider, was designed to build the sector’s capability to deliver to the Government and the wider New Zealand public. This latest relationship with Statistics New Zealand not only reflects Victoria’s reputation for excellence in teaching and research in statistics and public policy, but also the strong and positive relationship enjoyed by the School of Government with the wider public sector and its role as ‘gateway’ to the University.”

Mr Pink said a clear knowledge of the use, breadth and limitations of official statistics, was vital in the modern public service.

“I am delighted by the opportunity to work collaboratively with Victoria University to build statistical capability across a range of sectors. Good official statistics are key to good governance and a cornerstone for objective decision making. They provide an objective perspective of the changes taking place in national life and allow comparisons between periods of time and geographical areas.”
