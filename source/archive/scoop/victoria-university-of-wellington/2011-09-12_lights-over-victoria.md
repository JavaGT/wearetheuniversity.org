Lights over Victoria

On Friday the night sky over Wellington came alive, with lights being beamed across the city.

Victoria University has teamed up with a group of companies to present 'Lights over Victoria', a project designed to shine a light over Wellington during the months of September and October.

High-powered beams will be projected from a building at each of Victoria University's Kelburn, Te Aro and Pipitea campuses and will converge over the CBD.

"Victoria University is proud of its capital city location and this light show will contribute to the amazing atmosphere that will grip the city during the exciting sporting and cultural events planned for that time," says Andrew Simpson, Chief Operating Officer at Victoria University.

"Fuji Xerox, Dimension Data, EMC, Mainzeal, Downer and NEC Business Solutions have come on board to sponsor what they regard as a unique chance to work with a key client-Victoria University-to shine a light on the city of Wellington."

The lights will be on from 9pm each evening until October 23.
