Real men do read poetry, as All Black Conrad Smith, Black Cap selector Dion Nash, poet Bill Manhire and author Lloyd Jones will prove when they announce the shortlist for this year’s Bell Gully National Schools Poetry Award on Tuesday 19 July.

Since 2003, the International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) at Victoria University of Wellington has teamed up with leading law firm Bell Gully to invite secondary school poets from around the country to enter their poems for the award.

The shortlist will be released at 12.30pm on Tuesday 19 July, at a reception at Bell Gully’s offices, L21, HP Tower, 171 Featherston Street, Wellington.

The award shortlist announcement joins the chorus of poetic activity taking place around the country in the run-up to National Poetry Day on Friday 22 July.

You are invited to attend. Please confirm your attendance to Cheryl Lovett at Bell Gully on 04 915 6895 or email cheryl.lovett@bellgully.com.
