**Victoria graduands celebrate their success**

Nearly 1250 students, including 84 who are graduating with a PhD, will mark the successful completion of their studies at Victoria University of Wellington during graduation ceremonies and a parade in Wellington this week.

A total of 1350 qualifications will be awarded to 1248 students over three graduation ceremonies. The number of PhDs being awarded is the highest ever for Victoria University. The students are graduating from the faculties of Commerce;Architecture and Design; Education; Engineering; Humanities and Social Sciences; Law; Science; Toihuarewa and Te Kōkī New Zealand School of Music (NZSM).

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford says graduation is a time to celebrate many years of hard work, dedication and achievement.

“My message to graduands is not to underestimate the significance of their accomplishment or the depth of pride that their family, friends and teachers—both past and present—feel in their success.

“During their time at Victoria, our school leavers have matured into confident and knowledgeable young adults, while our adult learners have broadened their horizons and proved to themselves that they are capable of achievements their early circumstances did not allow.

“I know that this week’s cohort of Victoria graduates will go on to make a valuable contribution to New Zealand and the world and I wish them every success in their future endeavours.”
