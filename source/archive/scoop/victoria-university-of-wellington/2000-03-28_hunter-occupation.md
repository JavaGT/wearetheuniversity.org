Hunter occupation
=================

**Tuesday, 28 March 2000, 2:54 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp confirmed this afternoon that around 50 student protesters had occupied the historic Hunter building at the university’s Kelburn Campus.

The occupation followed a rally in the University’s Hunter courtyard at which Government Ministers Steve Maharey and Laile Harre addressed students.

Professor Sharp said while he supported students’ right to non-violent protest and freedom of speech, he was extremely disappointed that students used force in gaining access to the building.

Professor Sharp confirmed that a small number of university staff members were physically injured during the occupation.
