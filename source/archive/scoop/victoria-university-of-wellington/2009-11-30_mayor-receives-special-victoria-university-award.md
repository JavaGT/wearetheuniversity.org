================================================

Mayor Kerry Prendergast was honoured with a special award at Victoria University’s MBA annual dinner on Saturday night.

  
Mayor Prendergast, who graduated with an MBA from Victoria in May 2004, received the highest rankings by Victoria’s current MBA students out of a list of six high profile Victoria MBA alumni. The candidates were ranked on their skills in innovation, integration and leadership, the principles of the Victoria MBA’s mission.

  
Mayor Prendergast’s citation—read by Dr Paul McDonald from Victoria Management School, who was one of Mayor Prendergast’s lecturers—referred to her strong work ethic and commitment to service, and her ability to “function effectively within a world of complexity and diversity”.

  
Her leadership skills and support of innovation were also commended. “She is accessible, democratic and personable while keeping her vision for Wellington as a creative capital firmly in focus,” said Dr McDonald.

  
“The Victoria MBA builds on almost three decades of quality and tradition,” says MBA Director Dr Arun Elias.

  
“We believe that innovative leadership is essential in the 21st century business environment, and awarding excellence in this area sends a positive message to our students about the desirable qualities of leadership.

  
“We have a number of highly successful graduates, but Kerry was judged as the individual who most embodies the values, aspirations and beliefs that define our Victoria MBA.”

  
The winner was selected after Dr Elias shortlisted six candidates for the award, following consultation with three previous Victoria MBA Directors—Professor Lawrie Corbett, Dr David Stewart and Dr Paul McDonald. Current MBA students then ranked the candidates.

  
The award was granted as part of the Victoria MBA’s 25th anniversary celebrations. Over 25 years Victoria has produced around 1000 graduates, many of whom populate the executive ranks of business as well as public sector enterprise, in New Zealand and abroad.
