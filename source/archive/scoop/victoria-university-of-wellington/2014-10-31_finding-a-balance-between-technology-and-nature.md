**Finding a balance between technology and nature**

As peoples’ lives become increasingly high-tech they need to actively connect with the outdoors or they could become alienated from nature altogether—that’s the stark message from a best-selling author who is coming to New Zealand to speak at an upcoming conference and public lecture series.

Richard Louv is a journalist and writer whose work has helped launch an international movement to reconnect children and their families to nature. He will be the keynote speaker at the ‘A Place To Live’ conference (Whanganui, 16-19 November) and will deliver a series of additional public lectures, co-sponsored by Victoria University of Wellington, the MacDiarmid Institute, and the Department of Conservation.

Richard uses the term ‘nature-deficit disorder’ to describe what he sees as the human costs of increased alienation from nature. “These effects include diminished use of the senses, attention difficulties, higher rates of physical and emotional illnesses, obesity, and Vitamin D deficiency, among other things,” he says.

While it may be hard to wean ourselves off televisions and computers, Richard says incorporating more nature into our lives is worth the effort. “Technology-fasting while spending time in the natural world is the most effective antidote to the downsides of technology,” he explains. “Contact with nature can assist with recovery from mental fatigue and can also help reboot the brain’s ability to think. Your kids may complain at first, but they—and you—will come back from the technology-fast feeling better.”

Richard says his vision for the future—where peoples’ lives are as immersed in nature as they are in technology—offers better psychological, physical and spiritual health for everyone. “I’m not against technology but we do need a balance, and time spent in the natural world—whether it’s in nearby urban nature, or in the wilderness—provides that. The ultimate multitasking is to live simultaneously in both the digital and physical world—this is the hybrid mind.”

Professor Charles Daugherty, Victoria University’s Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Sustainability) says he’s delighted to be able to bring someone of Richard’s calibre to New Zealand. “More and more international research is showing that the environment has a huge part to play in terms of people’s physical and emotional wellbeing,” he says. “We believe that striking a balance between technology and the natural world is crucial not only to Victoria as a centre of learning, but also to society as a whole. We’re excited to be bringing Richard’s important message to New Zealand.”
