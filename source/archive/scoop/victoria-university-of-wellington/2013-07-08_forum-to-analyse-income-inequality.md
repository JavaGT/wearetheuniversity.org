**Forum to analyse income inequality**

The latest research and policy debates on inequality issues will be the focus of a Victoria University Institute for Government and Policy Studies (IGPS) forum this month.

Three main issues will be under the spotlight:  
·         The causes and consequences of the rise of income inequality in most OECD countries since the 1980s  
·         How some of the negative social impacts of inequality might be mitigated  
·         Options for reducing income inequality and which, if any, have merit.

Many of the speakers at the forum contributed to a major book on the issue, _Inequality: A New Zealand Crisis_, edited by Max Rashbrooke, which was released in June.

“New Zealand today exhibits much starker contrasts between rich and poor, with many families struggling to satisfy their basic needs,” says Professor Jonathan Boston, Director of IGPS.

“This forum will investigate the nature, causes and consequences of inequality—especially income inequality—and evaluate various proposals for building a less unequal and less divided nation.”

Speakers include Dr Michael Forster (OECD), Professor Robert H. Wade (London School of Economics) and Dr Cathy Wylie (New Zealand Council for Educational Research).

**Date:** Thursday 18 July  
**Venue:** Rydges, 75 Featherston Street, Wellington  
**Time:** 8.30am-5pm  
**Cost:** $90 (incl GST)
