Impact/Collision—Three Short Plays

Impact/Collision, the first of four seasons showcasing third year theatre students’ directing talents at Victoria University, promises to start things with a bang.

It’s not everyday you get the chance to see three plays in one evening, but each of the seasons on offer from the students of Theatre 304 gives you just that.

The three young directors are promising the first season, which focuses on hard-hitting plays from three generations of controversial U.K. playwrights, will pull no punches.

The season kicks off with Benyamin Albert directing Caryl Churchill’s This is a Chair. Mr Albert says it is a play that explores contradiction and metaphor.

“The play concerns the carelessness of people, the nature of knowledge and how it relates to reality.”

Following that, Mitch Tawhi-Thomas directs a New Zealand premiere of Mark Ravenhill’s Shoot/Get Treasure/Repeat: Love (But I Won’t Do That). The play, set in war-torn Iraq in 2004, involves a British civilian and Māori security guard’s quest “to stay sane in an insane world,” says Mr Tawhi-Thomas.

Wrapping up the evening is Harry Meech’s production of Edward Bond’s Passion—a play where the dead speak.

“We may bury their bones and smother their sins in crosses and kind words, but the dead, in having lived their lives, still speak,” says Mr Meech.

With three hard-hitting plays from three generations of controversial U.K. playwrights, Impact/Colllision is a night out not to be missed.
