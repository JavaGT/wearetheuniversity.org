Auckland to get a taste of Wellington style

Aucklanders will be hearing more about the attractions and advantages of living south of the Bombay Hills in Wellington and studying at Victoria University, New Zealand’s Capital City University.

From early June, Victoria University will have a Senior Liaison Officer from its Student Recruitment & Course Advice Team permanently based in Auckland. The additional staff member will establish and run the University’s Recruitment Centre in Auckland.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor David Mackay says the move is about giving Auckland secondary students greater choices as well as raising awareness of the postgraduate options Victoria has to offer to potential mature students.

“Our Student Recruitment & Course Advice Team regularly visits secondary schools in the wider Auckland region, and we have responded to increasing interest from young Aucklanders in the Victoria University experience. A permanent presence will mean we can increase our services to local schools, individual students and their families.

“Many school leavers in the Auckland region are keen to leave home and experience a taste of life outside of their home turf. Wellington is a premiere destination and Victoria is one of the nation’s leading research-led universities.”

Professor Mackay says Wellington is not only the home of Parliament, the Judiciary, Government and the diplomatic corps, but also of many of New Zealand’s leading creative, cultural, historical and scientific organisations.

“The connections Victoria’s academics and the University as a whole have with those groups give added value to qualifications as varied as politics, international relations, law, public policy and administration through to film, theatre, art history, history and science. The Capital, for example, has New Zealand’s highest concentration of scientists.”

Professor Mackay says Victoria and Wellington offer lifestyle, choice and a high-energy environment for a student who was considering studying away from Auckland.

“Wellington is a compact city that is easy to get around with recreational, sporting, social and cultural options that are some of the best in the country. Victoria also oversees more than 2,000 beds for students wanting to live in Halls of Residence as well as providing a full range of support services including counselling, medical and student learning support. Our message to Auckland students considering leaving home is clear: Absolutely, Positively Wellington.”
