Addressing the underlying causes of offending
=============================================

**Tuesday, 24 February 2009, 10:38 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Good morning,

Attached, and pasted below, is a media advisory about an upcoming forum at Victoria University on the underlying causes of criminal offending.

Researchers, community groups and practitioners will gather at Victoria University of Wellington tomorrow for a two-day forum to assess research into the underlying causes of criminal offending.

Conference organiser Dr Gabrielle Maxwell says the Government has signalled an ambitious legislative programme aimed at addressing these underlying causes.

“The goal of the forum is to begin preparing a report on the relevant evidence together with policy makers, politicians and sector leaders for whom this evidence is most relevant.”

Hosted by the Institute of Policy Studies within Victoria University’s School of Government, the forum will be held in lecture theatres one and two at the Old Government Buildings from 26-27 February.

Keynote speakers include:  
• Minister of Justice Hon. Simon Power  
• Children’s Commissioner Dr Cindy Kiro  
• Dr Rev Hone Kaa  
• Judge Andrew Becroft  
• Criminologist Associate Professor Michael Rowe

Media who wish to attend are asked to contact the event organisers (details below). For a full conference programme visit www.ips.ac.nz.

Institute Director Jonathan Boston says criminal justice policy must be based on the best available evidence and take proper account of the needs of victims, offenders and society as a whole.

“Above all, policies must be just, reflect our common humanity, and reduce offending and the harm it causes. This forum will provide an opportunity to discuss the cost-effectiveness of various policy instruments based on current evidence and build consensus on the best way forward.”

Conference sponsors include the Families Commission, Te Puni Kokiri, UNICEF and the J.R. McKenzie Trust.
