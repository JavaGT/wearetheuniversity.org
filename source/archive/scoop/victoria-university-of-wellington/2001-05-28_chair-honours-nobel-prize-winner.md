Chair honours Nobel Prize Winner
================================

A Chair in Physical Sciences has been established at Victoria University in recognition of the accomplishments of Nobel Prize winning alumnus, Professor Alan MacDiarmid.

Victoria's Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Science, Professor Peter Englert, says the Chair underlines the university's commitment to teaching and research in physical sciences and is intended to attract a succession of outstanding scientists and educators.

"With Professor MacDiarmid's endorsement we have embarked on a search to find an eminent scientist in the area of physical sciences to occupy the inaugural position," Englert says.

"Hand-in-hand with this search, we are seeking sponsorship from public and private sector organisations to help fund the Chair through the Victoria University Foundation."

He says the creation of the Chair contributes to the University's and wider government objectives of nurturing and investing in human capital and of fostering talent, intellect and determination.

"These qualities are inherent in Professor MacDiarmid, evidenced by his recent Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the work he has done on conducting polymers. He is an inspiration to past, present and future science students and a prominent public figure, his achievements are to be celebrated.

"The establishment of the Alan MacDiarmid Chair in Physical Sciences is one tangible way of Victoria University recognising the man, while setting the scene for future excellence in physical sciences at the University and the wider scientific community."

Victoria University is hosting a public lecture by Professor MacDiarmid where it is hoped the first appointee to the Chair will be announced.

The public is welcome to attend the Lecture: Wednesday 4 July from 5.30pm - 7.00pm, at the Wellington Town Hall.
