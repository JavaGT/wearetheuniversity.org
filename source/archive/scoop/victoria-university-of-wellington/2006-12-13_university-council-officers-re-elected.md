University Council officers re-elected

The Council of Victoria University of Wellington this week re-elected its two leading officers for a further year.

The Council on Monday re-elected Emeritus Professor Tim Beaglehole as Chancellor and Ian McKinnon as Pro Chancellor for their third terms as its two leading officers, effective from 1 January 2007.

The Chancellor chairs the University Council, has a casting vote on tied issues and is responsible for providing leadership to Council in the execution of its governance responsibilities. As the University's ceremonial head, the Chancellor also presides at graduation ceremonies and, on behalf of the Council, confers degrees. The Pro Chancellor is the Council's deputy chairperson and deputises for the Chancellor when required.

Emeritus Professor Beaglehole, who has Master of Arts degrees from the University of New Zealand and Cambridge University and a PhD from Cambridge, has had a long association with Victoria University as a student and member of the staff. He was a staff representative on the Victoria University Council, 1968-71 and 1982, and since 1999, has been a representative of alumni on the Council.

Emeritus Professor Beaglehole was a staff member of the former History Department, Warden of Weir House, Dean of Arts, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor and is a life member of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association. He has recently published a monumental biography of his father and distinguished New Zealand historian, John Cawte Beaglehole, A Life of J.C. Beaglehole: New Zealand Scholar.
