New Hunter Fellows Announced

One of the country’s most committed arts supporters, a former New Zealand High Commissioner and Victoria University Chancellor, and a dedicated fundraiser have been awarded 2009 Hunter Fellowships.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says he is delighted to have the opportunity to recognise the valuable contributions made by David Carson-Parker, Russell Marshall and Rosemary Bradford.

“Hunter Fellows are people who have made a substantial contribution to the advancement of Victoria University through a variety of activities relevant to the University’s strategic directions and interests,” says Professor Walsh.

The Hunter Fellowship was instituted by the University Council in 2003.

“The awarding of a Hunter Fellowship is the way the University acknowledges the outstanding contributions of certain individuals to those goals pursued by the University,” says Professor Walsh.

The Hunter Fellowships will be presented at a ceremony in the Hunter Council Chamber at Victoria University’s Kelburn Campus on 19 October.

The following synopses provide a brief background of the 2009 Hunter Fellows:

David Carson-Parker          

David Carson-Parker has made a significant contribution to the Victoria University MA in Creative Writing. He has funded the David Carson-Parker Embassy Prize in Scriptwriting since 2002 and is a dedicated supporter of musical and literary activities and events associated with the University.

Along with Bill Sheat, Mr Carson-Parker was responsible for saving and restoring the Embassy Theatre, providing a permanent home for the Wellington Film Festival which is an important event for students of film.

Mr Carson-Parker is a Governor of the Arts Foundation of New Zealand, Trustee and Treasurer of the Blumhardt Foundation for Decorative Arts and Design, and Trustee and Treasurer of the National Association of Decorative Arts and Design in Wellington.

In addition to a career in politics, Russell Marshall has maintained close links with Victoria University and, as a Chancellor, made a substantial contribution to its governance.

Mr Marshall was a member of the Council elected by the Court of Convocation from the beginning of 1995 until January 2002. During this period, he held the offices of Pro-Chancellor in 1998 and 1999 and Chancellor from January 2000 until January 2002.

He resigned from the Council in order to take up his appointment as the New Zealand High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, but continued to pursue his interest in education policy and maintained strong links with the University, fostering relationships with Victoria friends and alumni, as well as assisting with a number of appointment processes.

Rosemary Bradford  
    

Rosemary Bradford joined the Board of Trustees of the Victoria University Foundation in September 2005 where she remained until her retirement in December 2008.

During this period, Mrs Bradford hosted many Foundation Board meetings and after her retirement became a Friend of the Foundation, continuing to play a key part in the Foundation’s fundraising endeavours, through identifying fundraising opportunities and facilitating approaches.

“The role of volunteers pro-actively using their networks for the benefit of the Foundation is a critical part of successful fundraising and a vital contribution to the University’s strategic direction,” says Professor Walsh.
