London calling Kiwis

A Victoria University lecturer is playing a key role in a major revamp of the London-based Association of Corporate Treasurers’ Associate Membership (AMCT) qualification.

The AMCT qualification is a widely used entrée to jobs in the financial sector and from the end of this year, the Association’s foundation and associate learning programme will be organised in a series of modules, covering a broad spectrum of financial management skills.

Kiwis figure prominently in the author list. Dawn Lorimer, the Director of the University’s Master in Applied Finance Programme, is the lead author for two modules, in financial risk management and financial risk mathematics. Ms Lorimer has extensive professional experience in the Sydney capital markets prior to returning to New Zealand.

Professor Roger Bowden, of the University’s School of Economics & Finance, praised Ms Lorimer’s contribution.

“This is a major project, drawing together best practice risk management techniques. Dawn has pioneered treasury education in New Zealand, and the instrumental, learning-by-doing approach to financial education as a whole. I’m delighted to see recognition of her achievements, even if it is a case of world famous except in New Zealand.”
