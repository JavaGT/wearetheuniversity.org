**Today’s libraries not just about books**

  
Public libraries need to look beyond simply offering books in order to ensure their survival, a Victoria University of Wellington professor says.

Anne Goulding, Professor of Library and Information Management, who will deliver her inaugural professorial lecture on Monday 24 November, will explore some of the significant discussions taking place about the role of public libraries today. This will include how libraries are responding to changes in the political, social, technological and economic environment in which they operate.

Professor Goulding says libraries are important because they are non-commercial spaces, usually in the centre of a community, that are open to everybody and offer an opportunity for self-education. They also provide information that helps people make decisions about their lives.

“With cuts to public spending in many areas, libraries are feeling under pressure to demonstrate their value, and I am currently conducting research in this sphere. I don’t believe measuring how many people walk in the door and how many books are issued tells the full story—it’s those stories about the person who did a CV writing workshop at the library and got out appropriate books that helped them get a job that demonstrate the difference libraries make to people’s lives.”

Professor Goulding says there is currently a move towards libraries becoming community hubs that offer public information, in addition to the usual library services. Offering free internet services also enables people from all walks of life to engage with digital technology.

“With the Government wanting the public to increase use of its online services, it’s essential that a free space is available where members of the public can receive assistance to access these services,” says Professor Goulding. “I think it’s important to emphasise the role libraries can play in achieving government priorities.”

She rejects the perception in some circles that the internet has subsumed the need for library services. “Most librarians see the digital age as an opportunity to extend their services.”

For instance, she says eBooks enable libraries to connect with new audiences. Libraries are also able use digital channels such as Twitter, Facebook and blogs to engage more closely with the community. In addition, archival information such as photos, letters and newspaper articles is now more accessible through digitisation.

Ideally, says Professor Goulding, libraries should be treated as ‘community living rooms’.

“The libraries of today aren’t strictly quiet, bookish spaces—many of them offer zones where talking is welcome. They also facilitate community bonding through hosting community groups and story-time sessions for children.

“It’s important that libraries are spaces where everybody feels comfortable.”
