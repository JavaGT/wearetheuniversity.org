**Victoria Theatre students use Wilde’s words to explore real passion**

A moon like a mad woman, a biblical beauty and a half-insane prophet; this production has all 300-level Victoria University theatre students ever dreamed of.

This June they will take their audience on a journey exploring the boundaries of love, desire and temptation, with their production of _Salomé_, the ancient biblical story of the Princess of Judea and the death of John the Baptist, reinterpreted by Oscar Wilde.

From the era of symbolism and Art Nouveau, this stylistic and beautiful drama tells the story of a woman who dared to be everything her society most desired and feared.

King Herod is hosting a banquet, and the beautiful Princess Salomé has fled to the terrace. But she cannot escape his lustful eyes, and, veiled like the moon in a violent sky, Salomé is forced to dance. But the moon is not tamed so easily, and from her damaged pride dreadful consequences ensue…

In _Salomé_, Wilde’s feelings towards the constraints of the oppressive society in which he lived are brought to the fore. Wilde uses the setting of biblical Judea to mirror his world of Victorian England and under the direction of course coordinator Anna Kamaralli and design coordinator Jim Davenport, the students are able view Salomé’s story through modern eyes.

300-level practical courses are the highlight of the Victoria theatre student’s undergraduate degree. This production is a collaboration of the THEA301 ‘Company’ and THEA324 ‘The Scenographic Imagination’ courses, with every element, save the directing, produced by the students. The production uses the entirety of the Studio 77 theatre space, and fills it with original soundscapes and projections.
