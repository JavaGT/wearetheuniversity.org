Facilities management function streamlined at Vic
=================================================

**Wednesday, 1 March 2000, 4:30 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

The staff structure and functions of Victoria University’s Facilities Management has been streamlined following a review of the group.

Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Sharp, says staff were told last Wednesday that 12 positions in the Facilities Management Group have been disestablished while six new positions will be created.

Staff affected by the move will have the opportunity to apply for the new positions.

The review of the Facilities Management structure follows the outsourcing of the grounds maintenance and building maintenance services at Victoria.

Professor Sharp says a reduced staff structure within Facilities Management is a logical consequence of moving to contracted services.

“As services become outsourced there are fewer management and administrative functions performed internally. For example, a contractor now handles the purchasing of grounds and building supplies, a function once carried out by Facilities Management staff.

“Further efficiencies are gained by reducing layers of management and grouping similar remaining functions together.”

In December last year Facilities Management Group managers were briefed in the first stage of consultation around a proposed new structure.

Facilities Management staff had until 28 January this year to make submissions on the proposed structure.

Professor Sharp says it is anticipated the change process toward the new Facilities Management structure will take up to three months to complete.

Counselling and support services are available for all affected staff.
