Victoria joins Australia NZ School of Govt
==========================================

**Tuesday, 10 September 2002, 4:29 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University has joined top Australian universities and the New Zealand and Australian governments in the formation of the Australia and New Zealand School of Government.

New Zealand Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Helen Clark, announced the involvement of the New Zealand Government and Victoria University at the launch of Victoria University’s new School of Government tonight.

The other members in the Australia and New Zealand School of Government (ANZSG) are the Australian Federal Government, the State Governments of Victoria and Queensland, and is expected to include the Australian National University (Canberra), Griffith University (Queensland), Monash University (Victoria), the University of Melbourne, the University of New South Wales, the University of Queensland, the University of Canberra and the Melbourne Business School.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon said the involvement of four governments and top Australian universities was a recognition that to be globally competitive, both New Zealand and Australia require their senior public servants to operate from a world-class knowledge base with internationally-recognised analytical skills and qualifications.

“We’re delighted to be involved in this latest development in the relationship between New Zealand and Australia. The participation by Victoria University is a recognition of our knowledge and experience, especially within our own newly launched School of Government, as well as Victoria’s more than 60 year history of providing top quality education for public servants and quality independent research and advice.

“Both Australia and New Zealand’s State Sectors, both central and local, have experienced major reforms since the 1980s. Victoria University staff members, both within our new School of Government and elsewhere in the University, have a wealth of in-depth knowledge to share on leading edge state sector policy and research issues.”

Professor McCutcheon said the ANZSG will have a small teaching complement of outstanding Professors based in Melbourne as well as staff drawn from the contributing universities. Half of the academic programme will be offered by ANZSG staff and half by staff from participating universities. New Zealand’s involvement means some Australian students will do part of their studies in New Zealand and staff from the ANZSG will teach some of their courses at Victoria University.
