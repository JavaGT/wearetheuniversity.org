MEDIA RELEASE 2 September 2003

  
City of Campuses

Massive growth in student numbers and a strengthening strategic partnership between the Wellington College of Education and Victoria University of Wellington has the two institutions encircling the city with their four newly-named campuses.

Following a public consultation process, the Councils of the two institutions have agreed on names for four distinct sites where either institution may offer its services to students on sites owned or leased by the other.

“Wellington College of Education and Victoria University are so intertwined that it makes sense to let all our students know that they can access the best facilities possible across four sites,” said Dugald Scott, Principal of the Wellington College of Education.

Sharing timetabling in recognition of the multi-campus environment is the next step in the provision of seamless services to students.

The four Wellington campuses will be formally known as:

Karori – the site of the Wellington College of Education and also host to Victoria’s growing Foundation Studies programme.

Kelburn – the original Victoria site that, from 2004, will house principally those Schools which deliver courses in programmes offered by the Faculty of Humanities & Social Sciences and the Faculty of Science. It is also the location for some courses within the jointly run teacher education programmes taught by the College of Education.

Pipitea – in the newly-named Pipitea suburb, from 2004 this will be the campus on Lambton Quay formed by Rutherford House, Government Buildings and the pedestrian precinct between them; and the Wellington Railway Station facility. This campus houses those Schools that deliver programmes offered by the Faculty of Law, and the Faculty of Commerce & Administration, and the Centre for Continuing Education and Executive Development.

Te Aro – the campus on Vivian Street that houses the Schools of Architecture and Design.

“Victoria’s fulltime students have increased more than 10 percent on the same time last year and the College has shown an increase of 13 percent,” said Professor Stuart McCutcheon, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University.

“Rapid growth means we have worked to expand our facilities and to make them accessible to students in the broadest way possible. The strategic partnership is good for students because it enables both the College and the University to deliver quality services in ways which are convenient for students,” he said.
