Free concert features Maori musical instruments
===============================================

Victoria University's iconic Hunter building will come alive to the strains of traditional Maori musical instruments at the end of July as part of a free concert.

'Haumanu: the voices of traditional Maori instruments' with Richard Nunns, will feature traditional Maori musical instruments in a number of musical settings.

School of Music lecturer, Allan Thomas, says the 28 July concert comes as a celebration of the work with these instruments over several decades, rediscovering their playing technique, their purpose and their musical context. The concert will be part of that journey and recreate the instrument voices in some new situations.

The concert will begin with the flutes in partnership with traditional karakia, but move through various styles of contemporary music - popular, jazz, improvisatory and composed - using a range of outstanding musicians from the Wellington area.

These include: Dan Poynton (piano), Bridget Douglas (flute), Hamish McKeich (bassoon), Moana Maniapoto (singer), Deborah Wai Kapohe (singer), Jeff Henderson (saxophone), Chris O'Connor (percussion), Paul Dyne (bass) and Agus Supriawan (Sudanese musician). The University tohunga Po Temara will initiate the performance.

Allan Thomas says the concert is inspired by the very successful collaboration between British saxophonist Evan Parker and Richard Nunns, which was a highlight of the International Jazz Festival in Wellington last year.

\"Richard is no stranger to a wide variety of musical settings having toured last year with Evan Parker, performed in the recent International Festival of the Arts with Hirini Melbourne, is a member of Moana and the Moahunters, and recently recorded a concert work of Gillian Whitehead with premiere flutist Alexa Still."

Richard Nunns is currently a fellow at Victoria University and is engaged in writing a book about the traditional instruments of the Maori in collaboration with Hirini Melbourne.

Where: Hunter Council Chamber, Victoria University of Wellington  
When: Friday 28 July, 5.30pm - Admission Free
