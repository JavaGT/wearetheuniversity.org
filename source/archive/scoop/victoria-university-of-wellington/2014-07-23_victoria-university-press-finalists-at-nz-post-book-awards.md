Victoria University Press finalists at NZ Post Book Awards

Victoria University Press (VUP) has five books shortlisted for prizes at this year’s New Zealand Post Book Awards in the shortlist announced this morning.

The astrological murder mystery, The Luminaries, by Eleanor Catton and the story of Thomas Hardy’s last days, Max Gate, by Damien Wilkins are two of four fiction finalists. The Luminaries is also a finalist for the Nielsen Booksellers Choice award.

Three VUP titles make up four of the poetry category finalists. Current New Zealand Poet Laureate Vincent O’Sullivan is a finalist in the poetry category with his 2013 release, Us, Then. Two debut poetry collections, Gathering Evidence by Caoilinn Hughes, and Horse With Hat by Marty Smith, are also finalists in the poetry category.

It was announced last week that Horse With Hat was the winner of the Best First Book Award for poetry. Another VUP title, Tough by Amy Head, also took out the Best First Book Award for fiction.

Publisher Fergus Barrowman says he’s delighted for all the authors who have made the shortlist at the awards.

“To have three VUP titles in the poetry category, with two of those titles being debut books, shows what strong poetry our writers are producing.

“We’re also very pleased for Damien and Ellie in the fiction category. Max Gate and The Luminaries are very different novels, but both are exceptional writers and these books deserve recognition and a wide readership.”

Winners of the categories will be announced at the awards ceremony will be held at Te Papa in Wellington on Wednesday 27 August.
