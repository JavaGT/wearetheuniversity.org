Digital disruption: a Wellington case study

Digital disruption: a Wellington case study  

The challenges facing Wellington’s fast-growing digital industry will be explored in an upcoming seminar hosted by Victoria University of Wellington.

The event, titled Digital Disruption: A Wellington Case Study, will bring together staff and students from Victoria’s Schools of Engineering and Computer Science, and Management, with industry experts and practitioners, to delve into what it takes to thrive in the digital age.

Dr Richard Norman, a co-host of the event, is a senior lecturer in Victoria’s School of Management. His research focuses on understanding how people and organisations can adapt to technology change.

“The work environment is changing. Occupations are changing, there are new sectors emerging—such as the cyber security sector, and companies are becoming more agile, with a focus on fast development and fast turnaround,” says Dr Norman.

“What is distinctive about the event is that it will bring together both the people and the technical sides of business. For companies to be successful they really have to be on top of both. We have had a lot of interest in this event from the local digital industry—it’s a good opportunity to share knowledge.”

Dr Stuart Marshall, Head of Victoria’s School of Engineering and Computer Science, says that the event will give students an important opportunity to hear about the industry many of them will be working in.

“We ran a similar event late last year, which was solely for industry. This year we wanted to open it up to students, so we’re running it during class time to make it even more accessible. When students graduate a lot of them will be working in these digitally-focused companies, and this is a valuable opportunity to hear about what the environment is like.”
