AN EXCITING INSIGHT INTO THE  
POWER OF SHAKESPEARE’S WORK

The Tragic Consequences of the Assassination of Julius Caesar as Devised and Presented by Cinna the Poet

Premieres Studio 77, Victoria University  
11 May – 14 May

Theatre students bring new relevance to the work of William Shakespeare through a fascinating, modern exploration of Julius Caesar.

The classic Shakespearean tragedy, Julius Caesar, has been explored and reinterpreted as the base for an exciting new play opening at Studio 77 from 11 May. The Tragic Consequences of the Assassination of Julius Caesar as Devised and Presented by Cinna the Poet is the creation of third year theatre students at Victoria University working closely with Shakespeare’s classic tragedy of tyrannical rebellion.

The play reworks the original Shakespeare text from the point of view of Cinna the Poet, an innocent citizen brutally murdered as a consequence of the action of the men in power. At the heart of the play are the original scenes modified by the actors. The scenes comment on and explore the true nature of the characters that Shakespeare leaves so famously ambiguous.

The combination of a classic work with the in depth investigation into the text makes for an enticing new work. Audience will see Julius Caesar as they never have before, with a level of insight only available in the theatre.

Director Phillip Mann describes the play as exploring “the shady plotting, the idealism and the crowd pleasing rhetoric, as well as the vanity, ambition and ruthlessness which so often accompanies the will to power.”

The Tragic Consequences of the assassination of Julius Caesar has a cast of talented students of theatre, guided and directed by established theatre director Phillip Mann.

Performance Dates and Times: 11 May – 14 May; all shows 7:30pm  
Location: Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace
