MEDIA RELEASE 04 July 2003

  
New Deputy Vice-Chancellor For Victoria University

Victoria University's new Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor David Mackay will be in the hot seat next week.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon today announced that Professor Mackay, currently Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, is to be appointed Deputy Vice Chancellor. He replaces Professor Roy Sharp, who was appointed Vice-Chancellor of Canterbury University earlier this year.

\"Professor Mackay brings to this position a wealth of experience as an academic and as a senior manager and I'm looking forward to working with him in his new role."

As Professor McCutcheon will be on leave next week, Professor Mackay will be acting Vice-Chancellor.

Professor Mackay said he was looking forward to his new position.

"As New Zealand's Capital City University, Victoria has a reputation for combining the best of innovation and tradition. I have a long-term commitment to this University's success and am looking forward to building on this work at a more senior level."

Professor Mackay has been Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences since the beginning of 1995. As Pro Vice-Chancellor and a member of the University's senior management team, Professor Mackay is responsible for ten schools and four research institutes, which between them contain almost 40 per cent of students enrolled at Victoria.

Professor Mackay has had a distinguished academic career, graduating with an Honours degree in History from Victoria before travelling to University College, London, where he completed a PhD in 1970. He returned to Victoria in 1971 to join the Department of History.

Professor Mackay was a Nuffield Fellow in Britain in 1976. Since returning to Victoria he has served three periods of Chairperson of the History Department and two as staff representative on the University Council. Professor Mackay is author of In Wake of Cook and A Place of Exile: The European Settlement of New South Wales.
