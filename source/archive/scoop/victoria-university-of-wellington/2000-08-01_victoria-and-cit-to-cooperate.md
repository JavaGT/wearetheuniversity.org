Victoria and CIT to cooperate
=============================

**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University and the Central Institute of Technology (CIT) are to cooperate on a programme to increase international student numbers.

The Polytechnic Pathways Programme is aimed at providing a bridge between overseas secondary schools and university studies at Victoria.

The two organisations signed an agreement on Friday 28 July which will enable students to complete English language and diploma courses at CIT that will qualify them for university entrance. The students can then transfer to Victoria for degree study.

Victoria and CIT are to undertake joint marketing initiatives in China, Indonesia and Thailand to promote the new programme.

“These countries have a shorter secondary school system than New Zealand does,” Victoria University Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp said. “Until now, this has meant many international students who want to come and study here are unable to get into university.”

“This new programme offers international students a clear pathway for their tertiary studies and makes New Zealand a more attractive destination.”

Professor Sharp said the partnership would be beneficial for both Victoria and CIT.

“International students are a valuable source of income for Victoria and add a great deal to campus life,” Professor Sharp said. “We hope that this programme will increase enrolments even further.”

Professor Sharp said international students were a $500 million dollar-a-year industry that earned New Zealand more in foreign exchange than the wine industry.

Trevor Boyle, Chief Executive of CIT, said the organisations had previously worked on a number of collaborative arrangements and that he welcomed the new initiative. “We’re pleased to join with Victoria in promoting access to tertiary education in the Wellington region for international students,” he said.

“The international students will be hosted at our Heretaunga campus, which has excellent accommodation and study facilities. It will be an ideal preparation for further study in New Zealand.”

“International demand for education in New Zealand is increasing and we are looking forward to further collaborations with Victoria,” Mr Boyle said.

Victoria is to sign a similar agreement with Hawke’s Bay’s Eastern Institute of Technology on Wednesday.

Other partners in the Polytechnic Pathways Programme will include Hutt Valley Polytechnic, Whitireia Community Polytechnic and the Nelson-Marlborough Institute of Technology.
