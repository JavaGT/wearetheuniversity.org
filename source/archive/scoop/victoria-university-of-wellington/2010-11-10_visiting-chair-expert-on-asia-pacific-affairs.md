Visiting Chair expert on Asia-Pacific affairs

 One of the world’s leading scholars on security, political and military issues in the Asia-Pacific region will be based at Victoria University for three months.

As the 2010 holder of the Sir Howard Kippenberger Visiting Chair, Dr Muthiah Alagappa will provide expert assistance to the Centre for Strategic Studies of Victoria’s School of Government in its mission of drawing attention to the big questions concerning the future security environment in the Asia-Pacific region.

“This is an area of enduring and increasing strategic significance for New Zealand, and Muthiah’s wealth of knowledge on the Asia-Pacific region will add tremendous value to the issues we are examining,” says Professor Robert Ayson, Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies, where Dr Alagappa will be based from 16 November 2010 until January 2011.

During his visit, Dr Alagappa will deliver public lectures in Wellington and throughout the country, and will lead a range of research seminars at Victoria and other New Zealand universities.

On the evening of 7 December 2010, he will deliver the annual Kippenberger public lecture in Wellington. His topic will be A Changing Asia-Pacific: Prospects for war, peace and order.

Dr Alagappa is currently Distinguished Senior Fellow at the East-West Center (www.eastwestcenter.org). From 2001 to 2007 he was founding director of the Center’s Washington DC office and prior to that he was director of the integrated research programme in the Center’s headquarters in Honolulu. Dr Alagappa was Senior Fellow at ISIS Malaysia from 1985 to 1989 and a career officer in the Malaysian Armed Forces from 1962 to 1982. He has led numerous multi-year, multinational, collaborative research projects and has published widely in leading university presses and international journals.

Established in 2006, the Sir Howard Kippenberger Visiting Chair honours Major General Sir Howard Kippenberger, KBE, CB, DSO, ED, one of New Zealand’s most distinguished and courageous soldiers, who was also an eminent scholar and strategist. He served as President of the New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association and oversaw the production of 23 volumes of New Zealand official war histories. The Chair was established with funding from the Garfield Weston Foundation in Britain, the New Zealand Defence Force and the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association (Incorporated) through the Victoria University Foundation.
