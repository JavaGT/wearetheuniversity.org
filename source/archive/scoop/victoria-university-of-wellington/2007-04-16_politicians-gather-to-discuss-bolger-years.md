Politicians gather at Victoria to discuss Bolger Years

A conference on the Rt Hon Jim Bolger’s tenure as Prime Minister later this month will play host to a number of distinguished current and former parliamentarians.

The Bolger Years—the Seventh Parliamentary Conference is organised by the Stout Research Centre for New Zealand Studies and the Former Parliamentarians’ Association. Speakers at this event, held on 27 and 28 April, include several current and former MPs from the period, as well as other key players.

They include: the Rt Hon Winston Peters, Minister of Foreign Affairs and leader of New Zealand First; former Finance Ministers Sir William Birch and Ruth Richardson; former President of the Council of Trade Unions Ken Douglas; former Minister of Justice and Minister of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Sir Douglas Graham; former Chairman of the Ngāi Tahu Māori Trust Board Sir Tipene O’Regan; and former Prime Ministers Jim Bolger and Jenny Shipley.

The Bolger Years follows from previous conferences, such as 2004’s The First Term of the Labour Government, and 2002’s Revisiting Muldoon After Gustafson’s Biography.

Professor Margaret Clark, from Victoria’s School of History, Philosophy, Political Science & International Relations, says the Bolger Years are a major part of New Zealand history.

“Jim Bolger presided over the most notable change of electoral system in our history— namely, the change from the ‘first past the post’ system to mixed member proportional (MMP).

“We are privileged to be able to bring so many prominent guests to the conference.”

The conference, held on 27 and 28 April from 9am in the Parliament Buildings on Molesworth Street, is open to the public. Media are welcome to attend.
