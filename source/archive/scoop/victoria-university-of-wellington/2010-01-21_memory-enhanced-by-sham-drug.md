Memory enhanced by ‘sham’ drug

Can a substance with no physiologically active properties affect memory performance?

That’s the basis of research by Victoria University graduate Sophie Parker which focused on how placebos can improve our memories of the past (retrospective memory) and help us remember to do things in the future (prospective memory).

“I was interested in what would happen when people were given an inert substance that they thought had cognitive enhancing properties, and how that might affect the way people monitor information.”

As part of her PhD research, Dr Parker set up three elaborate trials of a placebo cognitive enhancing drug with around 300 first year psychology students.

“We went to great lengths to create a believable story about this so-called drug. We set up a fictional pharmaceutical company, a fake website, a promotional DVD and posters for the sham drug that we called R273, which was actually Vitamin C powder mixed with water,” says Dr Parker.

Participants were then weighed and given the placebo.

“The findings show that people unwittingly acted in ways that improved their memory. They also believed that their memory, responses, concentration and senses were improved by the placebo, as compared to the control group who weren’t given the sham drug and showed no real improvement in either retrospective or prospective memory.”

In order to monitor sources of information about the past, and to remember future tasks and actions, people can either use a monitoring process or they can rely on automatic memory processes, says Dr Parker.

“Typically, the more monitoring people use, the better their memory performance. My research found that the sham cognitive enhancing placebo R273 improves people’s ability to resist misleading suggestions and to perform prospective memory tasks, because it leads them to use more effortful monitoring.”

One application for her research could be in determining the effectiveness of certain ‘smart drugs’.

“People are now using a range of substances aimed at improving memory and responsiveness, from herbal supplements such as ginko biloba to drugs like Ritalin which students in the US are using to stay awake while studying. The research could be applied to find out if these smart drugs actually work or if the placebo effect also contributes to their efficacy.”

Dr Parker is now living in Amsterdam and is hoping to further her research there.
