**A new burst of energy for Victoria’s Solar Decathlon team**

A Kiwi bach powered entirely by the sun’s rays has attracted the attention of New Zealand’s largest state owned electricity generator.

A team of students from Victoria University is designing and building a solar powered house to take part in the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon in Washington DC this October. The team is the first ever from the Southern Hemisphere to be selected for one of the most prestigious and highly anticipated international design competitions.

It was this focus on creating a sustainable net zero energy home that attracted the interest of New Zealand energy company Meridian Energy, who has since come on board as the project’s principle sponsor.

"We’re 100 percent committed to renewables and have demonstrated this with our investments in New Zealand and offshore. With our interest in solar power this project was a natural fit with us," says Guy Waipara, Meridian’s General Manager, External Relations.

“In addition, it’s great for us to be involved in supporting some of New Zealand’s top young talent”.

Meridian has a real interest in sustainable building and led the way with its new Wellington office which is New Zealand's first purpose-built ‘green’ office building.

Architecture student Nick Officer says the Victoria team is delighted to have energy experts from Meridian helping out with the project. “Everyone here is very excited to be working with Meridian not least because the company is just as invested in sustainable, renewable energy and building as we are.”

The newly built solar powered bach will now be known as the Meridian First Light house.

The public will have a chance to view the Meridian First Light house for themselves when it is on display at Frank Kitts Park on the Wellington Waterfront from May 7-24. The student team will also be running public tours to showcase the solar technology used.
