VUP wins industry accolades
===========================

**Tuesday, 7 August 2001, 1:50 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University Press was to the fore at the recent publishing industry and Montana New Zealand Book Awards.

Both sets of awards were presented at the annual Booksellers NZ conference held in Napier last week.

VUP won the “2001 D.W. Thorpe New Zealand Publishing Award”, which is voted for by bookseller members of Bookseller NZ, and were joint winners of the “A.W.Reed Good Publisher Award 2001”. The latter award honours the New Zealand publisher who, following a national survey of published authors, is judged the best and fairest in its working relationships with New Zealand authors, and in the publication and promotion of their books.

“It is extremely satisfying to be recognised by the two principal communities outside of the university with which Victoria University Press deals directly,” VUP publisher Fergus Barrowman said.

VUP’s success continued with the Montana Book Awards, where Parihaka: The Art of Passive Resistance was joint winter (with Michael King’s biography of Janet Frame) of the History and Biography category.

Nineteen Widows Under Ash, by Damien Wilkins, was joint runner-up (with Charlotte Randall’s The Curative) for the Deutz Medal for Fiction.

And Animals Indoors, by Stephanie de Montalk, won the Jessie Mackay Award for Best First Book of Poetry.
