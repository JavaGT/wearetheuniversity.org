Massey and Victoria to Duet

Joint statement by Massey University Vice-Chancellor Professor Judith Kinnear and Victoria University of Wellington Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon.

A new national centre of music excellence in Wellington is likely to be operating next year. A new joint School of Music has been endorsed by the music sector and is being recommended by the two Vice-Chancellors of Massey and Victoria Universities.

Overwhelming support for the proposal was received from external groups, staff and students, following a six-week consultation period. Professors Judith Kinnear and Stuart McCutcheon, Vice-Chancellors of the two universities, say an action plan for the way forward will be recommended to the two university councils.

The two councils will be asked to proceed to form a Joint School of Music that builds on the existing classical and jazz strengths of both schools in musicology, ethnomusicology, performance, composition, and history of music.

Subject to approval by the university councils, the Joint School of Music would be operative from 2004, with joint academic developments and resources to be progressed from that point onwards.

The Vice-Chancellors say the joint School of Music would confirm Wellington’s position as the national leader in music education. The city’s reputation as the cultural centre of New Zealand would be enhanced. Pooling student talent would lead to the development of outstanding orchestras and musical groups, increasing the capacity for professional quality productions.

A stronger relationship could be built with the NZSO and Wellington Sinfonia. “This innovative solution will be great for students, for Wellington and New Zealand,” said Peter Walls, Chief Executive of NZSO.

Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast says such initiatives are a key to realising the success of the city's ‘Creative Wellington—Innovation Capital’ vision. "I'm delighted Massey and Victoria are working together to build a capability in music and music education that will be of national and international significance,” she said.
