New Year heralds changes at Victoria

The New Year marked several historic changes at Victoria University of Wellington.

On January 1, Professor Pat Walsh became the University's seventh Vice-Chancellor after Sir Thomas Hunter was appointed as its first full-time Principal. As well, the merger of the University and the Wellington College of Education came into effect on January 1 while the New Zealand School of Music and a new Pacific Studies Unit were officially established.

Professor Walsh, who had formerly been Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Commerce & Administration and Pro Vice-Chancellor (Research), replaces Professor Stuart McCutcheon who takes up a new role as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Auckland.

Professor Walsh said he was looking forward to taking up his new role.

"The Vice-Chancellor's position is particularly challenging, not only as the University's managerial leader but also its academic leader. As New Zealand's Capital City university, we have a proud record of offering the best of both innovation and tradition from a vibrant community of scholars and students, backed by capable general staff.

"With the University Council late last year signing off a new strategic plan, I'm keen to implement its vision of Victoria being in the top echelon of New Zealand's research-led universities. The Performance-Based Research Fund exercise confirmed Victoria's status as one of New Zealand's top three research universities and we're not about to let that slip. Nor will we step back from our commitment to provide top quality teaching, where undergraduates and postgraduates learn from our top researchers."

The historic merger of Victoria and the College was announced by the Minister of Education, the Hon Trevor Mallard, an alumnus of both institutions, and the Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary Education), the Hon Steve Maharey, on 15 November last year (2004).

The decision sealed the strategic partnership both organisations committed to in 2001. Victoria's first Pro Vice-Chancellor (Education) and the College's last Principal, Professor Dugald Scott, says the merger will allow the enlarged University to focus on delivering research-led teaching that provides a broader academic preparation for students and elevates teacher education to the status it deserves.

Mergers had been discussed many times in the last half-century, he says. From the day Victoria opened its doors in 1899, the two institutions have been strongly linked with the first two Professors of Education also being Principals of the College.

"It seems only fitting that as we take this next exciting step in merging with Victoria, we will also celebrate 125 years of developing great teachers this year.

“Since 2001, the University and the College pursued a shared vision of developing highly competent teachers with the ability to make a positive difference to the lives of the children they teach. We have set the standard for teacher education in New Zealand through our new shared qualifications."

"By merging we are able to provide greater scope and depth to teaching qualifications; widen the range of advice and support for beginning and experienced teachers; and provide greater opportunities for cross-disciplinary, collaborative research that will inform teacher education."

The new University has more than 20,000 students and about 3,000 staff spread across 27 Schools and four campuses and several satellite sites. It includes a new Faculty of Education to oversee the degrees and diplomas awarded by it, and a new College of Education, consisting of four Schools.

They are: the School of Education Studies, headed by Associate Professor Kay Morris Matthews; the School of Primary & Secondary Teacher Education, headed by Linda Tod; the School of Early Childhood Teacher Education, headed by Sue Cherrington; and Te Kura Mâori, headed by Lynette Bradnam.

The New Zealand School of Music was launched at a celebration concert in October last year and combines the strength of Victoria University's School of Music and Massey University's Conservatorium of Music in Wellington and other music programmes. The concert, at the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, included special guest artists and showcased the world-class talents of staff and students.

Interim Director Penny Fenwick says from 1 January, four programmes will be taught jointly by the new School with the remaining music programmes reaccredited as joint programmes by the end of the year. Wellington City Council has also agreed to make the former Jack Ilott Green/Circa Theatre site in Civic Square available to the universities as a site for the School.

"The two universities have applied to the Government's Partnerships for Excellence Fund for financial support to fund the new building and will undertake a major fundraising campaign to build a midsize auditorium suitable for a wide range of music performances. In the meantime the School will operate from the existing two sites while the inaugural Director is expected to be appointed later this year."

The establishment of the Pacific Studies Unit at Victoria University follows a review of Samoan and Pacific Studies last year. Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor David Mackay says the Unit, which has yet to be given a suitable Pacific name, is designed to provide an enhanced focus for Pacific Studies at Victoria.

"In its revised Charter, Victoria committed itself to developing strong relationships with the Pacific community and encouraging positive participation and success of Pacific students and staff. The Unit, and an associated Victoria Pacific Forum, will play a major role in the future development of Pacific programmes and studies."
