Victoria Vice-Chancellor North-Bound

Victoria Vice-Chancellor North-Bound

The Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington, Prof Stuart McCutcheon, has resigned his post in order to take up the Vice-Chancellorship of Auckland University.

Victoria University of Wellington Students Association (VUWSA) president Amanda Hill said that in light of current staff strikes and increases in International fees, students and staff at Victoria had little to be sorry about in his departure.

“Prof McCutcheon has proved divisive among staff and students, justifying the fee increases of 2003 with a statement promising to increase staff salaries. While academic staff have reached agreement with management, general staff have been offered a laughable 2.2% increase” Hill said.

Students had passed a motion of no confidence in McCutcheon, and his effigy was burned during fee setting in 2003.

“Alongside fees, McCutcheon has regularly raised a large surplus, resulting in acclamation from University management” Hill said.

“We await the appointment process at Victoria with interest and hope that our new Vice-Chancellor will prove to be student friendly and aware of the financial difficulties faced by both staff and students in the current environment”.
