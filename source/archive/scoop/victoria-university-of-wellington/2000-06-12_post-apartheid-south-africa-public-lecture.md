Post-Apartheid South Africa - public lecture
============================================

**Monday, 12 June 2000, 12:24 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University is to host a public lecture by the Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture in South Africa's Eastern Cape provincial legislature, Nosimo Balindlela.

Mrs Balindlela's presentation, titled "Post-apartheid South Africa - what has changed?", will be delivered in the Victoria University Hunter Council Chamber (Level 2, Hunter Building) at 6pm on 22 June.

Her New Zealand visit has been organised by Volunteer Service Abroad as part of VSA Week \[June 13 - 19\].

Associate Professor John McKinnon , Director of Development Studies at Victoria University, says it is a real opportunity and privilege to host a visitor like Mrs Balindlela.

"We are very grateful to VSA for making it possible," he says

Balindlela, a former teacher and academic, has worked with VSA in facilitating New Zealand volunteers working in the Eastern Cape's Department of Sports, Art and Culture.

The Eastern Cape is one of the poorest provinces in South Africa with unemployment running at 49 percent and the rural population almost entirely dependent on welfare grants for survival.

Balindlela will be meeting with Government Ministers, NGO leaders, addressing public meetings and VSA branches around the country during her visit.
