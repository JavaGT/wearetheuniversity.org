New academic leaders for Te Kawa a Mâui

Te Kawa a Mâui, Victoria University's School of Mâori Studies, has been given a substantial boost with the appointment of a new Head of School and two academic staff with doctorates.

Peter Adds has been appointed as the new Tumuaki of Te Kawa a Mâui, Victoria University's School of Mâori, Pacific & Samoan Studies.

Mr Adds, who has an MA(Hons) from Auckland University took up his position on January 1. He is also the School's postgraduate co-ordinator and a member of the Board of Studies for the University's Development Studies programme.

Mr Adds, who is of Taranaki's Te Atiawa iwi, is currently completing his PhD on aspects of the tribe's history. Mr Adds is also researching the portrayal of Mâori and Te Ao Mâori in the broadcasting media as well as Mâori Treaty Settlements and the negotiation process.

As well, Dr Danny Keenan, formerly a Lecturer in Massey University's School of History, Philosophy & Politics, as been appointed as Associate Professor and Dr Ocean Mercier has been appointed as Lecturer.

Dr Keenan (Te Atiawa) has a BA(Hons) from Victoria and a PhD from Massey University whilst Dr Mercier (Ngâti Porou) has a BSc(Hons) and a PhD from Victoria. Dr Mercier won the Physics Award in the Inaugural Mâori Excellence Awards in 2002.

Pro Vice-Chancellor (Mâori), Professor Piri Sciascia, said the appointments would further boost Victoria's research and teaching in Mâori Studies.

\"Victoria gained the highest average grade nationally in Mâori knowledge and development with the release of the Government's Performance-Based Research Fund report last year and both the University and School are keen to see that standing further enhanced. The appointment of a new Tumuaki and the addition of two staff with doctorates is a further step in that direction. We're also actively seeking to appoint a full Professor of Mâori Studies to cement that strong academic leadership in place."

Professor Sciasica also thanked Senior Lecturer Te Ripowai Higgins for her service as Head of School since 2002.
