Wonders of wool on the world stage

Wool insulation may be commonplace in New Zealand, but for a team taking a solar powered house to a competition in the US, this novel approach will definitely need explaining.

A team of Victoria University students will be taking part in the US Department of Energy’s prestigious global design competition, the Solar Decathlon, by designing, building and operating an attractive, affordable, net zero energy house, powered entirely from solar energy. 

Kiwi company Eco Insulation, has developed a new wool insulation product to meet the high standards required for the competition.  The house will be insulated by four layers of wool insulation which gives the house nearly three times greater efficiency than the New Zealand building codes require.

Using wool as insulation is vitally unheard of in the US and the team will be working hard to educate those who come to the competition that wool is a safe, durable and healthy alternative.

“This is a great opportunity to show the rest of the world what Kiwis can achieve.  Let’s show them what we’re made of,” says Eco Insulation’s Hamish Holder.

Team member Nick Officer agrees the competition is an excellent opportunity to showcase New Zealand innovation and sustainable options.

“Eco Wool is a great fit for the First Light house, after all what could be a more fitting way to prove New Zealand’s point of difference than using wool insulation.”

The Victoria team, made up of almost 40 students from throughout the university supervised by staff and industry partners who are donating their time to the project, will compete in the 21 day competition during September in Washington DC. 

The New Zealand public will have the chance to see the First Light house in action when it is on display during May at Frank Kitts Park before being shipped to the US.
