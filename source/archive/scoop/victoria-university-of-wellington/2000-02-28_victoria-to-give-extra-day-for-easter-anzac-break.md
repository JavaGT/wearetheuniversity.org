Victoria to give extra day for Easter/ANZAC break
=================================================

**Monday, 28 February 2000, 3:37 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University will give its staff an extra day off this Easter.

Acting Vice-Chancellor Roy Sharp said the University had decided to make Thursday, April 20, a University holiday.

Professor Sharp said the holiday would make up for ANZAC Day falling on Easter Tuesday, a University holiday. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime coincidence,” he said.

April 20 is during a University break, which means that lectures will not be disrupted.

With over 1,200 staff, the University is one of Wellington’s largest employers.
