**Victoria appoints senior leader in digital technologies**

Victoria University of Wellington has appointed Professor Steven Warburton, an internationally respected leader in digital learning and teaching, as its inaugural Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Digital Futures).

Professor Warburton currently heads the Department of Technology Enhanced Learning at the University of Surrey, which has been named University of the Year and University of the Year for Student Experience in the _Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2016_.

Professor Warburton leads the strategic vision for the University of Surrey’s digital learning environment and is the academic lead for technology and education. He has had extensive involvement in the successful implementation of digital projects, such as the development of active learning spaces and lecture capture that have helped lead Surrey to become one of the top universities in the United Kingdom.

Professor Warburton will be the first person to hold the newly-created role of Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Digital Futures) at Victoria and the University’s Provost, Professor Wendy Larner, says he will make an outstanding leader in an area of critical importance to Victoria.

“We are delighted to have someone of Professor Warburton’s calibre joining Victoria and leading a programme of work to achieve the University’s ambitious digital vision.

Professor Larner says digital futures is an area of focus for Victoria with the University committed to playing a lead role in imagining and enabling the possibilities in a digital age.

“Professor Warburton will work closely with the multidisciplinary group we have formed to carry out research into new technologies, understanding the impact and possibilities of a digital future and preparing students to be educated citizens in a digital society.”

Prior to taking up his current role at the University of Surrey in 2012, Professor Warburton was a senior lecturer in Technology Enhanced Learning at the University of London International Programmes and before that, Educational Technology and ICT Manager at King’s College London. He is a regular speaker at European and international conferences and has published extensively in the area of Technology Enhanced Learning and design patterns.

\"I very much look forward to taking up this exciting role, working with colleagues across the institution in developing and realising Victoria's distinctive digital vision for innovation and creativity across the teaching, research and learning domains, and through the digital futures programme, ensuring that Victoria extends its impact, global reach and reputation."

Professor Warburton will take up his new position on Monday 14 November.
