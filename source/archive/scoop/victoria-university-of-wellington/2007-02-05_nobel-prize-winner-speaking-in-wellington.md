Nobel Prize winner speaking in Wellington

Nobel Prize winner speaking in Wellington

Professor Sir Harry Kroto is visiting New Zealand this month as a plenary speaker at AMN-3, the third international conference on advanced materials and nanotechnology organised by the MacDiarmid Institute at Victoria University of Wellington. In addition to presenting his research at the conference, Professor Kroto will give a public lecture.

Thursday 15 February, 6-7:30pm  
Westpac St James Theatre, Wellington

The lecture, Science, Society and Sustainability, will explore numerous aspects of science. What science is, how the media, politicians, the community and commercial agents perceive science and scientists and some of the problems that non-scientists have in understanding science, engineering and technology. Although science has revolutionised our lives, our technologies have started a mindless mass production-driven plundering of the Planet's resources, which may be hurtling us towards disaster. As a priority, the science community must encourage and help society to develop a culture of sustainability.

This free lecture is open to the public although bookings are essential and on a first come, first served basis.  
To book, please email kroto@rsnz.org or call 04 470 5770.
