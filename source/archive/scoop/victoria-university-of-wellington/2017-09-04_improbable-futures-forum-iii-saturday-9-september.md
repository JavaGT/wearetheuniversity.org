**Improbable Futures Forum III  
After Criticism: Writing Now  
Saturday 9 September 4–6pm**  
**Adam Art Gallery, Gate 3, Kelburn Parade**

Please join us as Lana Lopesi, Editor-in-Chief of _The Pantograph Punch_, chairs the final of our three discussion forums organised in association with Adam Art Gallery’s _The Tomorrow People_ exhibition. Lopesi will lead a discussion with artist Hana Pera Aoake, writer Megan Dunn, and author, academic and journalist Max Rashbrooke. In the course of their conversation they will approach the nature of writing now, exploring the forms of writing that are flourishing in the digital domain and in contemporary book publishing. This forum is a partnership with the Cultivating Creative Capital theme at Victoria University.
