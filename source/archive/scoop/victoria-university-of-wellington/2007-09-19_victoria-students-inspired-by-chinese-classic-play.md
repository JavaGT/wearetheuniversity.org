Victoria students inspired by 700-year-old Chinese classic play

Students from Victoria University's School of English, Film, Theatre, & Media Studies are collaborating with Chinese theatre specialist Megan Evans to bring to Wellington audiences the New Zealand premiere of Snow in Sweet Summer.

With text by American playwright Charles Mee, the play is an updated version of the Yuan Dynasty classic by Guan Hanqing.

Ms Evans, who has lived in China for three years studying performance techniques and theatre history at Beijing's National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts and the Central Academy of Drama, says the play combines age-old conventions with contemporary elements. \"With modern music, dance, drama and comedy, the show is clearly relevant in the context of New Zealand, rapidly post-modernising full steam ahead inside a greater Asian context."

In addition to Ms Evans' Chinese study, she has undergone extensive training residencies at the University of Hawai'i and performed leading roles in Beijing Opera English versions. However, it's been no easy task making 700 years of culture relevant to a modern New Zealand audience. "It is the students themselves who have been called to face this challenge and what has resulted is a stylized explosion of modern anxieties, passion and lust framed by a contemporary, student-designed set."

This is a bittersweet tale of love and revenge, with roots tied firmly to a thousand years of Chinese Opera. "Even 300 years before Hamlet learnt the double-edged pleasure of revenge, Snow in Sweet Summer was speaking to Chinese audiences. Poor sweet Dou’E, her filial perfection and devotion to honour muddied and sullied, is murdered amongst the corruption and turbulent excitement of 13th century China.

"We hope it will remind audiences of the darkness of the bitter soul and the preciousness of life."

Snow in Sweet Summer will play at the newly refurbished Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Victoria University, Kelburn. Shows start on Tuesday 2 October, running until Saturday 7 October, at 7.30pm. Tickets are $12 waged and $8 unwaged.
