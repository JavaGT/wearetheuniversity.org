Audacious raid on Auckland University student magazine by rival Victoria University of Wellington

  
Students at Auckland University will get a taste of Wellington’s finest university, courtesy of their own magazine, Craccum.

The cover has been completely high-jacked and turned into Salient, voted New Zealand’s best student magazine two years running.

Collaboration between Victoria University’s Marketing Group, Salient, and the Students’ Association (VUWSA) showed the strength of the Capital City University’s push to recruit Aucklanders to Wellington.

The cover concept for the Craccum-Salient edition depicts a scene from the Mars Attacks horror movie. “\"We have nothing against Aucklanders—some of my best friends live in Auckland. So we really see this as a way to introduce Auckland to Salient," says Emily Braunstein, Salient Editor, "and if Craccum needs a hand with their magazine again, we're always happy to help."

Victoria’s Marketing Manager, Rachel Irving, says that a Senior Liaison Officer would be actively recruiting Auckland school-leavers within the next month. “Our research has shown that many young Aucklanders have never heard of Victoria University of Wellington, so we thought we’d work with our own students to devise a way of breaking through the awareness barrier.”

Jeremy Greenbrook, VUWSA President, welcomed the joint effort. “If someone’s going to be shallow enough to trade away their student magazine, then Victoria University’s staff and students are more than able to fill the breach. Auckland students don’t realise how poorly served they are by their own representatives—if they came to Wellington they’d enjoy a far superior social and academic experience.”
