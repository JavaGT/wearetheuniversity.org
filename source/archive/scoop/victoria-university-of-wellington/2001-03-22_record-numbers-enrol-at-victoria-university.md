Record numbers enrol at Victoria University
===========================================

Victoria University enrolments are at an all-time high with record numbers of students enrolling.

The number of students enrolled after the second week of lectures was 12,760. "This is more than in any first trimester in our 102 year history," said Victoria University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon.

"So far we are experiencing a growth in student numbers of 7.9%, and an overall increase of 6.6% in equivalent fulltime student numbers," said the Vice-Chancellor.

"This is a major vote of confidence in Victoria University," said Professor McCutcheon. "Students are obviously aware of our strong programmes, the calibre of our staff, and the benefits of living in New Zealand's top town."

All areas of the University have experienced growth in fulltime students. Architecture and Design is up 19%, followed by Law at 13%, Science 7%, Commerce and Administration 6%, with Humanities and Social Sciences increasing by 3%.

"We are also seeing heavy demand for our new hostel facilities in the city," Professor McCutcheon said.

The rise in enrolment has the potential to increase income by around 5%. "This is good news for Victoria University as any increase in revenue will offset the overall decline in University funding," said Professor McCutcheon. "This decline is due to the freeze on student fees and the net reduction in real terms of the Government's contribution."

Wellington was also benefiting from the greater number of Victoria University students as they contribute significantly to the City's diverse and vibrant culture, he said.
