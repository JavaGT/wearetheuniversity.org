Top honours for international civil servant and pre-eminent academic

Victoria University of Wellington will confer honorary degrees on Richard Carey, an international civil servant, and Anthony Reid, a prominent historian on Southeast Asia.

Richard Carey has worked for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for nearly 30 years, and since March 2007 has been Director of the OECD’s Development Co-operation Directorate.

Mr Carey has played a leading role in the major initiatives of the last three decades of the OECD’s Development Assistance Committee, which serves to produce better understanding and cooperation between the rich and poor countries of the world.

“Richard has been a major influence in shaping the OECD’s contribution to thinking and practice in the fields of aid and development policies and the evolution of north-south economic relations over this period,” says Professor Pat Walsh, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University.

“With a passionate commitment to effective international co-operation to address the fundamental problems of development and poverty, he is one of Victoria University’s most distinguished graduates.”

Professor Anthony Reid is an eminent academic and writer on Southeast Asia, most famous for his two-volume masterpiece Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce. He was founding director of the Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore and also founding director of the Southeast Asia Center at the University of California Los Angeles.

He is one of New Zealand’s most accomplished and internationally renowned scholars, and seen by many as the world’s pre-eminent Southeast Asian historian. He is one of the very few non-Asians to be awarded one of the Fukuoka Prizes for Asian culture.

“Over the years Professor Reid has played a key role in the development of Southeast Asian History, and Asian studies in general,” says Professor Walsh.

“In addition, under his leadership, the Asia Research Institute in Singapore came to be regarded as one of the finest university research centres on the region.”

Richard Carey will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Commerce at Victoria University’s December graduation in 2009. Anthony Reid will receive the honorary degree of Doctor of Literature in May 2010.
