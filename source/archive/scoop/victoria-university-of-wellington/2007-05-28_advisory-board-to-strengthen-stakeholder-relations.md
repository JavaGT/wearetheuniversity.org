Advisory board to strengthen stakeholder relationships

Leading business and public sector representatives have put their weight behind Victoria University's Faculty of Commerce & Administration as members of its new advisory board.

Those joining the board of 20 members, chaired by John Shewan (Chairman of PriceWaterhouseCoopers NZ) include Sam Morgan (TradeMe CEO), Jane Diplock (Chairman of the NZ Securities Commission) and Garry Muriwai (CEO of the NZ Institute of Chartered Accountants).

Professor Peter Thirkell, Dean of the Faculty of Commerce & Administration, says the board's inaugural  
meeting on 31 May represents the first step towards a deeper relationship between the Faculty and its influential external stakeholders.

"Victoria prides itself on its reputation as a leading provider of high-quality research-led business and economics education and expertise, nationally and in the Asia-Pacific region. The board will provide advice and assistance in maintaining this reputation, and in meeting our objectives to produce graduates ready to contribute their knowledge and skills to the success of the business and public sectors here and internationally," Professor Thirkell says.

"Its members will offer valuable external perspectives and, importantly, will further connect the Faculty with its stakeholders in the business, public and not-for-profit sectors."

Faculty strengths include the internationally-recognised Master of Public Policy, the Master of Applied Finance, and the Master of Business Administration – which celebrated its 21st year in 2005. The International Master of Business Administration is taught in Hong Kong in collaboration with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Of the many qualifications on offer, the Bachelor of Commerce and Administration sees more than 1300 students graduate each year.
