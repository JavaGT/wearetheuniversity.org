**First Light house continues to shine**

An innovative Kiwi bach, designed and built by Victoria University students, has won the New Zealand Institute of Architects International Award.

The First Light house, which is powered entirely by the sun’s rays, was a Victoria University entrant in the prestigious US Solar Decathlon 2011 in Washington DC where it was placed third overall.

The Victoria University team had high scores in many of the Solar Decathlon categories, winning the Engineering contest and gaining first equal in Hot Water and Energy Balance. It was the first ever entry from the Southern Hemisphere.

“Receiving the NZ Institute of Architects International Award marks yet another important milestone for the First Light house, and is a credit to everyone involved,” says Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh.

The First Light house was built in New Zealand, disassembled and shipped to the United States for the competition and then again disassembled and returned to New Zealand, where it has been relocated to Waimarama Beach, Hawkes Bay.

Professor Walsh says the innovative and creative nature of the project demonstrates the strength of the University’s expertise across a wide range of disciplines.

The project team was made up of over 26 students and 12 staff, and supported by a crew of builders and 130 sponsors—including the principal sponsor Meridian Energy.

The house won the 2011 Timber Design Awards Clever Wood Solutions.
