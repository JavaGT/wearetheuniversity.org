Prestigious scholarships for Victoria postgraduate students

Victoria postgraduate students have been awarded four of nine prestigious William Georgetti Scholarships for their research in the fields of philosophy, classics, design and engineering.

Administered by the New Zealand Vice Chancellors’ Committee, the Georgetti Scholarships are awarded to postgraduate research judged to be important to the social, cultural and economic development of New Zealand.

The winning Victoria students are:

Elizabeth Bisley, awarded $40,000 over two years to complete her Masters research into design history during the modern period, at the Royal College of Art in London.

Greta Hawes, awarded $38,200 for one year, to complete her PhD research in classical mythology, reception and Italian mediaeval literature, at the University of Bristol.

Adrian Jongenelen, awarded $30,000 over three years to complete his PhD project to develop a compact, portable, real-time range imaging system, at Victoria University.

Vanessa Schouten, awarded $16,000 over three years to complete her PhD in moral and political philosophy, at Princeton University.

The scholarships were established from the residue of the estate of William Georgetti who died in 1943. In establishing the scholarship fund, Mr Georgetti desired “the best brains available shall receive the benefit of this trust”.

Applications for next year’s William Georgetti Scholarships should be made by 1 March 2008, and details can be found at www.nzvcc.ac.nz.
