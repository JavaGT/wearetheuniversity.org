Three Nobel Laureates to visit Wellington
=========================================

**Tuesday, 17 December 2002, 4:14 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

The IQ average of Wellington will rise a few notches in February when the triumvirate who were awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for discovering and developing conductive polymers will join other international scientists for a conference in Wellington (February 9th-14th 2003) on advanced materials and nanotechnology.

AMN-1, the conference being presented by the Victoria University-hosted MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, has attracted Victoria alumnus Professor Alan MacDiarmid and fellow Nobel Laureates Professors Alan Heeger and Hideki Shirakawa. The three Laureates will also take part in a number of public events to celebrate and promote science (see page 2).

Professor Paul Callaghan, Director of the MacDiarmid Institute and inaugural Alan MacDiarmid Professor of Physical Sciences at Victoria, says that many of tomorrow’s innovative technologies will require new and super efficient materials.

The science focuses on understanding and using innovative materials to create applications including self-sterilising surfaces, non-corrosive paints, new food textures, wear-resistant machinery, next generation DVDs and fibres that match the strength of spider silk.

The MacDiarmid Institute, hosted by Victoria University, in major partnership with the University of Canterbury and Industrial Research Limited was selected as a Government-funded Centre of Research Excellence in March 2002 to study these materials. It has received three-year operational funding of $13.39m and a one-off $9.8m capital grant.

The capital funding injection has allowed the MacDiarmid Institute to purchase some of the most advanced equipment in existence, including a super computer and an electron microscope.

"The Government's selection of the MacDiarmid Institute as a Centre of Research Excellence recognises the fine scientific discoveries made by New Zealand scientists from as far back as Ernest Lord Rutherford, through to science heroes of today including Alan MacDiarmid, Maurice Wilkins and Jeff Tallon. The Institute is excited to be able to continue that work, educating young people and fostering scientific excellence," says Professor Callaghan.

“The fact that Alan MacDiarmid, Alan Heeger and Hideki Shirakawa want to come to New Zealand shows that investment in the MacDiarmid Institute was a far sighted decision. New Zealand is firmly part of the global investigation of new materials with potentially ground-breaking applications."
