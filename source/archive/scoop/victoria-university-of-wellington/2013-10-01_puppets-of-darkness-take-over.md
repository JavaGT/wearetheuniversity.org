Puppets of Darkness Take Over

\"By the pricking of our thumbs..."

This October sees a new adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy of over-weening ambition, Macbeth, brought to the stage by Victoria University of Wellington performance club, Dionysiac. This production focuses strongly on the eponymous character and his wife. Director, and script editor, Neal Barber anchors his production in the way the witches treat the Macbeths are their puppets. "Instead of seeing the witches as bit players who stop by every now and then to make sure the seeds of their prophecies are finding fertile ground, we have the witches constantly watering those seeds to ensure proper flourishing" says Mr Barber of the concept.

Changing the focus allows the production to work with just seven actors. "The first things to go were all the minor characters and sub-plots." Any characters lucky enough to survive Mr Barber's axe are all played by the witches who, quite literally, construct the world in which the Macbeths are immersed. "The action is much more direct with a much larger percentage devoted to watching the Macbeths' relationship unfold rather dallying on irritating sub-plots about the equivocatory powers of wine or that the English are 'liberating' Scotland from a nasty, naughty man." Our actions are not our own when the agents of malevolence control the way we see the world.
