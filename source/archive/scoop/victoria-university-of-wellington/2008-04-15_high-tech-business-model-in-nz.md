High-tech business model in NZ: aspiration or anathema?

Is there such a thing as a high-tech business model in New Zealand? If so, what are the implications for aspiring firms and for policy?

Victoria University Professor in Management, Sally Davenport, will give her inaugural professorial lecture on 22 April—amalgamating some of her historical and new research.

Her lecture will explore the attributes of such a business model and their effect on a firm’s growth. She talks about what firms in emerging high-tech sectors, such as biotechnology and nanotechnology, and even ‘low-tech’ commodity sectors, might learn from this model.

High-tech businesses are those that focus on intellectual property—or ‘know how’—that is then embodied in a product or service.

“Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series provides an opportunity for new professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight to their specialist area of study. It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,” says Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh.

“Professor Davenport is an exceptional researcher and teacher, and we are privileged to have had her expertise at Victoria for more than 15 years,” says Professor Walsh.

A Victoria University alumna, Professor Davenport has combined her interest in science and business since joining Victoria’s staff in 1991. She is the Faculty of Commerce and Administration’s Associate Dean (Graduate Studies & Research), and a principal investigator at the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology.

In 2004 she won a Research Excellence Award from the International Association for the Management of Technology. This was one of 30 awards made to researchers from 15 countries who have published the most in the top research and technology management journals.

The lecture—which is open to media and the general public—will be held in Victoria University’s Hunter Council Chamber on 22 April from 6pm. Access is from Gate One or Two off Kelburn Parade.
