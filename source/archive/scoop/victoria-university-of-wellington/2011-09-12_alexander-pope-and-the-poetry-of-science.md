**Alexander Pope and the poetry of science**

At the dawn of the Scientific Revolution, science was mocked by poets—but there was also reverence and respect, says a Victoria University Professor of English Literature.

In her inaugural Professorial lecture on Tuesday 20 September, Professor Kathryn Walls will examine how the foremost 18th century English poet Alexander Pope used science in his poetry.

In the lecture, titled _“God said, Let Newton Be”: Alexander Pope and the Scientific Revolution_ Professor Walls will explain that Pope, like his contemporary Jonathan Swift, mercilessly satirised scientists.

“They were part of a reactionary movement—science was seen as a fad, an addiction and as a waste of time It didn’t seem to be producing any practical benefits.”

Professor Walls says it is not surprising that poets were opposed to science.

“Poetry plays with words. It delights in paradox and ambiguity. Scientists value precision and clarity—the mentality is utterly different.”

However, Professor Walls believes Pope’s attitude to science was complex.

“Pope attended a series of lectures given by one of Newton’s disciples, and the scientific discoveries of the day clearly influenced his thought.”

The lecture will focus on two of Pope’s most famous poems—and show that while he satirised scientists, he processed their discoveries into metaphors.

Professor Walls says she has always been interested in how and why poetry changes from one century to the next.

“This is why I hit upon the popularisation of science in the early 18th century—I recognised that it explained what was happening to poetic imagery.”

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Professor Walls is an excellent researcher and teacher.

“Professor Walls’ research strengths are particularly evident in her most important publication, the scholarly edition of William Baspoole's _The Pilgrime_, a politically-loaded religious allegory, written on the eve of the English Civil War. But she has published over an unusually wide range of periods and authors.

“Her teaching is exemplary; she is experienced at all levels and the quality of her postgraduate supervision, both in English and in Creative Writing, is particularly noteworthy.”

Professor Walsh says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.

“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,” says Professor Walsh.

Professor Kathryn Walls’ inaugural lecture will be held on Tuesday 20 September at 6pm at Victoria University’s Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Gate 1 or 2, Kelburn Parade, Wellington.

RSVP by Friday 16 September 2011 by emailing rsvp@vuw.ac.nz with ‘Walls’ in the subject line.
