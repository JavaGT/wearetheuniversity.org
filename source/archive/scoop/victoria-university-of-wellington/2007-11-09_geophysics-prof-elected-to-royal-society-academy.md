Geophysics Prof. elected to Royal Society Academy

**Geophysics Professor elected to the Royal Society Academy**

Victoria University Professor Timothy Stern is one of 10 scientists recently elected as a Fellow of the Academy of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

A Professor of Geophysics and Geology, Professor Stern is an internationally recognised for his insights into Earth's structure and processes, derived through the careful and rigorous application of physical principles to the planet.

His research has involved the quantitative modelling of geophysical data, with the broadly based application of physical principles including flexure, rheology, thermal properties, and buoyancy. Two of his most significant discoveries have been the accommodation of plate  
convergence in the lithospheric mantle by down-warping, indicated by a region of anomalously high-seismic-velocity upper mantle material under the central Southern Alps, and the existence of anomalously low seismic velocities associated with raised fluid pressure within the lower crust beneath the western margin of the Southern Alps.

Professor Stern has applied these and developed similar new concepts (such as asymmetric spreading) in studies of the western North Island, the Central Volcanic Region, and the Transantarctic Mountains.

The quality of his work has been acknowledged by his peers through the Hochstetter Lectureship, the New Zealand Geophysics Prize (twice), and frequent invitations to give lectures and to join international collaborative projects.

Professor Marston Conder, President of the Academy of the Royal Society, says election as a Fellow is a mark of high distinction, reflecting many years of dedication, creative thinking, and world-class research and innovation.

The Royal Society now has 340 Fellows and 48 Honorary Fellows. Fellows are involved in providing expert advice, promoting scientific best practice, and disseminating scientific information.
