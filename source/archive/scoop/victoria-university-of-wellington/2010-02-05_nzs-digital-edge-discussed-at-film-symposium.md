New Zealand’s digital edge discussed at film symposium

The digital revolution in cinema and New Zealand’s contribution to it will be discussed at a symposium bringing together film makers and academics in “Wellywood” next Thursday.

The one-day symposium “Cinema in the Digital Age” has been organised by Victoria University’s Film Programme, and will be launched at Park Road Post Production in Miramar on Wednesday 10 February by Weta guru and multiple-Oscar winner Richard Taylor.

The symposium is bringing industry professionals, creative practitioners, scholars and film archivists to Wellington’s Government Buildings on Thursday, and will feature a panel discussion from New Zealand filmmakers Geoff Murphy and Gaylene Preston, and multiple-Oscar winning cinematographer Alex Funke.

The symposium’s keynote speech will be given by world-class scholar in Film and Media Studies Professor Sean Cubitt of the University of Melbourne. Other presenters include Dr Catherine Fowler from Otago University and several academics from Victoria University’s School of English, Film, Theatre and Media Studies.

Event organiser Dr Tim Groves says the film industry has been transformed by the introduction of digital technology.

“This symposium will explore the creative and industrial opportunities and challenges that have emerged as a result, as well as some of the aesthetic and cultural implications of the transition to digital cinema—the most significant development in cinema since the arrival of sound.”

He says the event also provides an opportunity for the Victoria Film Programme to develop and enhance links with the film industry and film culture community.

What: Cinema in the Digital Age

When: Thursday, 11 February 2010, 9am-5.30pm.

Where: Government Buildings, Pipitea Campus, Victoria University of Wellington
