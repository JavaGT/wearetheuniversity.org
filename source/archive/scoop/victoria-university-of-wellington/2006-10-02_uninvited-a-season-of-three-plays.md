Uninvited – a season of three plays

Victoria University of Wellington’s Theatre programme presents this year's fourth and final season of student directed plays. While all three plays, from students in the third-year theatre directing course, are comically entertaining they each deal with different people and issues that are ‘uninvited’.

Feathers will fly in the musical morality play Rooster Rag, written by Michael Hurd. Francesca Emms directs this theatrical event in which we are serenaded by a barn yard of chickens and one very handsome rooster named Chanticleer. Their joyous existence is most dreadfully disturbed however, when Chanticleer has a most terrifying dream. Set in the frivolous 1920s and based on a Chaucer classic, Rooster Rag is a real toe-tapper.

In the absurdist comedy The Bald Soprano, written by Eugene Ionesco, an English dinner party is waiting to happen. Set in "a middle-class English interior on an English evening" two English couples attempt to make conversation. The nonsensical statements combined with "absence of any inner life, the mechanical soullessness of daily routine" make this play a hilariously chaotic exploration of communication. Directed by Stuart Henderson

In The Red Balloon, written by Damian Trasler and directed by Fergus Jack-Hinton, the question, "what do you come to the theatre for?" is asked. Is modern theatre just too weird or is it a break from cinematic reality? One girl and her beautiful but empty red balloon are about to find out.

All three productions will be performed at Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn. Wednesday 11 – Saturday 14 October 2006. Shows start at 7pm each night with tickets $12 waged and $8 unwaged.
