New Head for Marketing & International Business

Associate Professor Val Lindsay has been appointed as the new Head of the School of Marketing & International Business at Victoria University.

Dr Lindsay, who has an MSc in Clinical Biochemistry from Otago University, an MBA from Victoria and a PhD from the University of Warwick in Britain, joined Victoria in January 2004, having previously been Acting Head of Department and Senior Lecturer in international business at the University of Auckland.

She has also worked in senior positions with the Tertiary Education Commission, the Trade Development Board and ICI New Zealand as well as working as a medical research technician in both Britain and New Zealand. She has also acted as a consultant for private, public and not-for-profit organisations on strategic planning and management and international business.

Associate Professor Lindsay is currently the School's Director of International Business Programmes and co-ordinates courses on, and carries out research in, export strategies and organisational development in international business. A major book she co-authored with Professors Robert DeFillippi and Michael Arthur of Suffolk University in the United States, Knowledge at Work, is due to be released this year.

Outgoing Head of School and Acting Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Commerce & Administration, Professor Peter Thirkell, said Associate Professor Lindsay has had a very successful career to this point that is ideally suited to leading the School through the next stage of its development.

\"Associate Professor Lindsay brings many key skills to the position of Head of School. Not only does she have a strong teaching and research background, but she has considerable and varied experience in the private sector, both as a manager and researcher in commerce and the sciences."
