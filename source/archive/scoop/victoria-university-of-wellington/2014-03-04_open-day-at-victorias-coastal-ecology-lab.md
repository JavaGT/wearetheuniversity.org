Wellingtonians have an opportunity to catch a rare glimpse into the life of a marine biologist when Victoria University’s Coastal Ecology Laboratory holds its annual open day this Saturday.

It is the only day this year that the public will be able to visit the state-of-the-art marine research facility located on Wellington’s south coast.

Between 10am and 3pm, visitors will be able to see marine creatures up close, learn about the interesting biology of the marine animals and plants on display, and talk to marine scientists about their research.

Dr Jeff Shima, Director of the Coastal Ecology Laboratory says there will be something for all ages, from interactive displays to touch tanks with marine life.

“It’s a great opportunity for anyone interested in our spectacular coastal and marine environments to come along and find out more about the exciting research taking place in Wellington’s coastal backyard,” he says.

Experts and specialist researchers will be on hand to answer questions, provide information about a range of exhibits and assist with self-guided tours. There will also be a display of the equipment marine researchers use to study sea life.

“Our staff and students do fascinating work and have some amazing stories to tell. For people interested in studying marine biology, our open day is a unique chance to get a glimpse of what life as a marine scientist is like.”
