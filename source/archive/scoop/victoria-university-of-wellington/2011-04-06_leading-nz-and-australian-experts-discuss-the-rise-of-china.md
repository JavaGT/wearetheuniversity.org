Leading NZ and Australian experts discuss the rise of China

The growing impact China is having on New Zealand, Australia and the wider Asia-Pacific region will be discussed by experts from both sides of the Tasman at a special one-day public symposium in Wellington tomorrow.

The event brings together leading New Zealand analysts, officials and commentators with experts from Australian think-tanks including Australia's Lowy Institute for International Policy and the Australian National University's Centre for China in the World and Strategic and Defence Studies Centre. It will be opened by Minister of Foreign Affairs Hon Murray McCully.

"Not too long ago, China was remote from us but has become an everyday part of our lives," says Professor Huang Xiaoming of the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre which is co-hosting the symposium.

China is Australia's largest trading partner and New Zealand's second largest and its influence on trade and investment in the region will be a key theme at the symposium says Professor Huang. Among the speakers will be a representative from Fonterra, which has significant business operations in China.

The symposium will examine China's growing importance in an integrated context. "We need to understand the economic, legal and political implications of the rise of China in our economy, and work out the best approach for both countries."

This means that security policy, domestic affairs and diplomacy will also be under the spotlight at the event.

"China is increasingly playing an active role in the Pacific, in regional forums, and in international issues that affect New Zealand and Australia," says Professor Robert Ayson of Victoria University's Centre for Strategic Studies. "The Asia-Pacific balance is shifting and China's rise is central to that change. How do Australia and New Zealand feel about that?

"We also need to understand how China's rise affects our two countries internally. What are our perceptions of China and what do we want from our relationship with China?"

Professor Huang says having both New Zealand and Australian experts at the symposium makes sense.

"We face similar issues but sometimes respond to them differently and have had different experiences in dealing with China. The symposium will allow us to compare these perspectives and identify the China policy agenda for both countries going forward."

The event, hosted at Victoria University's Hunter Building from 8.30am to 500pm has reached capacity, with more than 150 attending, but media are welcome to attend.
