Enlivening the public face of architecture

The potential for buildings to be as dynamic as the human and environmental systems surrounding them is a potential game changer, according to Victoria University of Wellington Professor Jules Moloney.

In his inaugural professorial lecture on Tuesday 22 October, Professor Jules Moloney will share an alternate way of thinking about architecture by discussing how architecture is as much an art and science of time, as it is a sculptural object.

“There is a gap in the way architecture is experienced and how it is designed, which can be addressed by digital representation and simulation—an aspect of architectural research that continues to inform my study and teaching,” he says.

Professor Moloney uses videogame and mixed reality technology to simulate how architecture operates as sequences of movement. Another research project uses computer algorithms to generate thousands of animations to explore the compositional range of kinetic facades.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Victoria University’s inaugural lecture series is an opportunity for professors to share insights into their specialist areas of study with family, friends, colleagues and the wider community.

“Inaugural lectures are also an excellent way for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,” says Professor Walsh.

Professor Moloney is the Head of Victoria’s School of Architecture. His research and teaching is underpinned by his belief that new technology and techniques facilitate existing modes of practice, and also create new modes of interdisciplinary research.

His PhD research, Designing kinetics for architectural facades, lays the foundations for a new form of architectural composition and was published as a book in 2011 by international publisher Routledge.
