**Victoria appoints new creative writing Director**

Author, poet, playwright, and scriptwriter Damien Wilkins will be the next Director of Victoria’s International Institute of Modern Letters, Professor Deborah Willis, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, has announced.

Currently a Senior Lecturer in the International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML), Mr Wilkins will take up the position when Professor Bill Manhire retires at the end of January 2013.

“I am delighted that Damien will be the next Director of the IIML. We are very fortunate to have such a talented writer and teacher leading the Creative Writing programme into the future,” says Professor Willis.

Mr Wilkins says he is looking forward to beginning his new role. “The IIML is the country's premiere destination for creative writers, with a growing international reputation. I'm thrilled about having the chance to extend the astonishing legacy Bill Manhire has built up over the years.”

Mr Wilkins is the author of nine books, including the novels _The Miserables_, which won the New Zealand Book Award for fiction in 1994, and _Nineteen Widows Under Ash_, which was joint runner up for the Deutz Prize for Fiction in the 2001 Montana New Zealand Book Awards. His novel _The Fainter_ was runner-up for the Montana Medal for Fiction in 2007. In 2008 he was awarded the New Zealand Post Mansfield Prize to travel to Menton, France, where he produced his latest novel _Somebody Loves Us All._  
  
He has scripted numerous works for television, radio and more recently theatre. His television scriptwriting includes work on _Duggan_ and _The Insiders Guide to Happiness_ and his first play, _Drinking Games_, was produced at Circa Theatre in 2008. Mr Wilkins was the founding editor of literary journal _Sport_, and has been an active member of many initiatives to foster creative writing in New Zealand throughout his career.
