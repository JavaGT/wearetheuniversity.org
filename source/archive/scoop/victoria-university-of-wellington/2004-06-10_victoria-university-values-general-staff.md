Victoria University values general staff

Victoria University rejects the claim by the Association of University Staff that the University regards general staff as being worth less than their academic counterparts. The University values the contribution of all staff and this is reflected in the current level of General Staff salaries at rates above the market average both nationally and within the more highly remunerated Wellington labour market. A high level analysis shows that the University pays at or above the market median in most administrative support and secretarial positions and the average salary for General Staff Union Members is approximately $44,500 per annum.

In addition to Union negotiated salary increases General Staff can receive up to $2000 through an annual salary review process based on performance. This means that in 2004 they could get up to $2000 in addition to the offer of 2.5% plus a one-off payment of $350.

“We have sought to maintain this position in the market through the recent offer to general staff of a 2.5 percent pay increase with a one-off $350 payment,” said Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon.

“This offer is made on the basis that I have sought to protect the purchasing power of general staff salaries while remaining the market leader in many employment categories. We are not experiencing significant recruiting problems and this supports our contention that we are paying market rates. Many staff also appreciate the special benefits which derive from working in the University environment including access to part-time study, good crèche and recreational facilities and low cost on-site parking.”

“My offer to academic staff of a 4 percent pay rise was accepted by staff, reflecting a situation where New Zealand is are falling behind salary levels in the UK, Australia, Canada and the US from where we recruit a high proportion of our academic staff.”

“The offers I have made to settle the collective agreements are not intended to be divisive or inequitable. They are, however, intended to use the very limited additional funding we have in the best possible way to meet the needs of both academic and general staff.”

Following strong financial performance in 2001 and 2003, Victoria University provided one-off bonuses to all permanent staff in addition to routine salary rises and the University’s performance pay system.
