Seminar by Angela Davies - 26 June

Former Black Panther party associate Dr Angela Davies is speaking at the Maidment Theatre at Rutherford House in Wellington from 7pm on 26 June. Entry is free.

Born in Alabama in 1944, Angela Davis is an African- American philosopher who was associated with the Black Panther Party in the 1960s and 1970's, as well as the Communist Party of the United States of America. She first achieved nationwide notoriety when she was linked to the murder of the judge Harold Haley during an attempted Black Panther prison break; she fled underground, and was subject to an intense manhunt. After 18 months as a fugitive, she was captured, arrested, tried, and eventually acquitted in one of the most famous trials of recent U.S. history.

Angela Davis is currently Professor of History of Consciousness at the University of California and Presidential Chair at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  
Professor Davis' research interests include: feminism, African American studies, critical theory, popular music culture and social consciousness and the philosophy of punishment (women's prisons).

Her tour is supported by the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at Victoria University.
