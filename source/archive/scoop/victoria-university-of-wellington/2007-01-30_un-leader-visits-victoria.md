UN leader visits Victoria

A United Nations’ Assistant Secretary-General, the Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the Convention on Biodiversity, Dr Ahmed Djoghlaf, is meeting with Victoria University staff this week to discuss the future of the deterioration of the Earth’s environment.

Dr Djoghlaf is visiting New Zealand from Montreal as a Guest of the New Zealand Government from Sunday 28 January to Wednesday 31 January.

Signed by 150 government leaders at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the Convention on Biodiversity is the first global agreement on conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and is part of the United Nations Environment Programme.

Associate Professor Ben Bell, Director of the Centre for Biodiversity & Restoration Ecology in the School of Biological Sciences, will be spending time with Dr Djoghlaf.

“Dr Djoghlaf’s visit will provide an opportunity for us to showcase New Zealand's unique environmental issues, the high level of our endemic indigenous biodiversity and the frameworks we have in place for managing environmental and resource management issues. The Convention on Biodiversity is a major step towards protecting and improving our planet for the future.”

He assumed the position of Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) on January 3, 2006. He was named to his previous position as Assistant Executive Director of UNEP in June 2003, following his success as Director and Coordinator of UNEP's Division of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), where he played a key role for some seven years and successfully raised UNEP’S profile. During his tenure at the GEF, the portfolio grew from 6 projects worth US$ 28 million to 600 projects worth more than US $1 billion implemented in 155 countries.

Throughout his impressive career, Dr. Djoghlaf has increased his extensive knowledge of global environment processes within the UN system and within the CBD process.

His numerous positions at the CBD included Acting Principal Officer on intergovernmental issues and cooperative arrangements at the Secretariat, during which time he was in charge of meetings including the First and Second Conferences of the Parties. In 1994, in his capacity as Special Adviser to the Executive Secretary of CBD, he was responsible for the preparations for the First Conference of the Parties held in Nassau, Bahamas, in December of that year.

Prior to joining the United Nations, Dr. Djoghlaf held a variety of important posts in the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was advisor on environmental issues to the Prime Minister of Algeria and, prior to that, to three Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Algeria.
