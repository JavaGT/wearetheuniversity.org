World’s best doctoral students to study at Victoria

Seven of the world’s top international postgraduate students have been awarded scholarships to study at Victoria University this year.

Selected by an academic panel administered by the Education New Zealand Trust, a further 33 doctoral students will study at the seven other New Zealand universities as part of the New Zealand International Postgraduate Research Scholarships programme.

Announcing the scholarships yesterday, Minister for Tertiary Education, the Hon Dr Michael Cullen said the combined talent of these 40 exceptional doctoral students would be a real ‘brain gain’ for New Zealand.

Victoria University Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor Neil Quigley agrees, saying the arrival of the seven students to Victoria will contribute significantly to the University’s recognised research strengths.

“These students bring an important cross-cultural and international flavour to their research which is of benefit to both the host university and the wider academic research community.

“It will be a privilege to have them studying with us and we look forward to their starting throughout the year.”

The students studying at Victoria come from Canada; Germany (3); Hong Kong; and the USA (2) and will be studying a range of specialities.

Their research interests include: criminal deportees into Samoa and Tonga; Tuatara reproductive ecology; cross-cultural adaptation of international students; patterns of Scottish settler identities in New Zealand; the role of information technology in facilitating inter-organisational transfer; a cultural and linguistic study of Witi Ihimaera’s novel ‘Whale Rider’ and of Nikki Caro’s subsequent film adaptation; and fungal toxins that may have potential for development as therapeutics, including antivirals.

The students are funded under the New Zealand International Doctoral Research Scholarships programme for three years of PhD study.
