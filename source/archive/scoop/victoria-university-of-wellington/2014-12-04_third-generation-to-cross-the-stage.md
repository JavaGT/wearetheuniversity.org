Third generation to cross the stage

**Third generation to cross the stage**

A Victoria University of Wellington graduand will follow in the steps of her mother and grandmother as she walks across the stage to collect a Tohu Māoritanga/Diploma in Māoritanga during graduation next week.

Kuratapirirangi Higgins (Ngāi Tūhoe) had not considered studying the Tohu programme until her mother, Professor Rawinia Higgins—Assistant Vice-Chancellor, Māori Research and Head of School at Victoria’s Te Kawa a Māui—recommended it to her.

“Mum said ‘both your grandmother and I have done it’, but I was initially a bit reluctant.

“It wasn’t because I wasn’t interested in Māori Studies, I just wanted to do something different from my mum and grandmother because I knew people would expect more out of me.

“But the programme has taught me so much, I’ve really enjoyed it.”

Looking back, Kura is pleased she listened to her mum and has enjoyed studying in a place she says has always felt like home—Te Herenga Waka Marae.

When Kura was two she moved to Wellington to live with her grandparents, while her mother was working and finishing her PhD at the University of Otago. Every day after Kōhanga reo and school she would wait at the marae for her grandmother to finish work. Te Ripowai is the Taurima/Manager of Marae Services at Victoria.

When Rawinia joined the staff at Te Kawa a Māui, Kura continued to come to Te Herenga Waka after school so, says Kura, the transition from school to university has been relatively easy.

The perks of having a mother and grandmother on campus when you’re studying aren’t bad either.

“Between both my mum and grandmother, I’ve basically got my own personal library on campus and they know all the right people to talk to when I need help!”

But the expectations can sometimes outweigh the perks—like working hard and also helping out with the dishes and waitressing at the Marae.

Being on campus fulltime has shown Kura how hard both Rawinia and Te Ripowai work. “I admire them and am really proud of all of the work they have done.”

During the one year Tohu Māoritanga diploma, Kura realised she has a passion for languages and culture, helping her to decide to major in Māori Studies and Italian as she works towards a Bachelor of Arts.

Kura says she has become one of the biggest advocates of studying the Tohu Māoritanga, and is recommending her younger cousins now follow in her footsteps.

The Tohu Māoritanga programme is designed to provide students with a foundation in Māori language, culture, and society, as well as giving students the academic study skills required at tertiary-level. It provides a pathway into a Bachelor of Arts and other undergraduate degree programmes.

Both Rawinia and Te Ripowai will be will be on stage as Kura collects her diploma on Wednesday 10 December at 4.30pm.
