PhD Graduates Continue to Shine at Victoria

PhD Graduates Continue to Shine at Victoria

The number of students graduating with a doctorate from Victoria has more than doubled since 1998, with an extra nineteen graduates to reach this level, when they join an elite group of alumni at this week’s graduation ceremonies. (6 & 7 May)

Professor Stuart McCutcheon, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University, is delighted at the range of topics that graduates have covered in the May graduation ceremonies for Victoria in 2004.

“Research is the backbone of our university and the PhD graduates this year have excelled at the highest level of academic achievement. Their research has provided answers and insights into some of the major questions and problems that we all face.”

“This group of students are leading the Government’s vision of a knowledge society and will be highly attractive employees in a global market.”

Many students have worked in collaboration with employers and research organisations around the country to achieve high quality and varied research. Topics vary from cancer research to studies of linguistics, from Antarctic research to agricultural biochemistry investigations, and also extend to topics from Psychology, Sociology, Industrial Relations and Computer Science disciplines.

An outline of PhD research topics is included with this release, which contains the names of those students who have given permission for their details to be released to the media.
