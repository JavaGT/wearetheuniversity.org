Enrol online – save time and win

Fifteen lucky undergraduate students at Victoria University in 2004 could get up to $600 off their fees if they re-enrol online as part of a revamp of the University's enrolment procedures.

All undergraduate students who take the quick and easy option and enrol online for 2004 before 11.59pm on December 10 will go into the draw for 15 grants for the payment of tuition fees for one course, up to a maximum of $600.

As part of the package and to encourage online enrolment, enrolment packs will not be sent to returning undergraduate students unless they request a pack.

Pam Thorburn, Director of Central Student Administration, says Victoria led the way with online enrolment in Wellington when the service was launched in November 2001.

"In the past, enrolling as an undergraduate meant a trip to the Kelburn campus for new students with an element of ‘paper chasing’ required. But online enrolment enables students to enrol anywhere there is a computer with internet access, at anytime of the day or night and at a pace that suits. They can also 'time out' and complete the process later.

"We've also placed a searchable version of our Course Catalogue online so students can hone in on the specific information they need instead of having to leaf their way through almost 200 pages of the printed document to find just the couple of pages they need."

Ms Thorburn says while about a quarter of undergraduate students enrol online, the University wanted to encourage more students to take that option.

"Taking up to $600 off your fees is a worthwhile prize. We want more students to give online enrolment a go because we think they'll be surprised at how quick and easy it is. Our surveys show new students can, on average, complete the process in less than half an hour with returning students taking just 15 minutes on average."

The grants will be credited to student accounts after the free withdrawal period for Trimester 1 2004 as long as the student is still registered in at least one course at this time. Online enrolment is not available for Summer Trimester 2003-4. Winners will be advised by email and letter.

Ms Thorburn says this year the University would not be sending enrolment packs to returning students unless they requested one.

"In the two years since online enrolment was introduced, it has been quickly adopted by today's students, who are well used to using the internet to do everything from buying videos and music to booking travel."

Students who can't enrol online can either visit the Enrolment Office in the Hunter Building to get a pack or email enrolment-enquiries@vuw.ac.nz or call 0800 VICUNI (0800 842 864 and press 1).
