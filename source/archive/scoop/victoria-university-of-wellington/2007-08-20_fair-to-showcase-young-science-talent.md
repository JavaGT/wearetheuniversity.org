Fair to showcase young science talent

Hundreds of young scientists are to showcase their talent at Victoria University in the annual NIWA Wellington Regional Science and Technology Fair, held from 22-25 August.

Around 400 exhibits are expected from Year 7 to Year 13 students, from 44 schools throughout the Wellington and Hutt Valley areas, covering all areas of science and technology.

Dr Gillian Turner, judging co-ordinator and chief judge, says she is looking forward to the event. “It’s always exciting to see the talent coming from these students, and the creative projects they come up with.”

On judging day, 23 August, a team of 24 judges will interview all the students and select the best projects in each of the age classes. In all, over $10,000 worth of prizes are available, donated by a range of businesses and science organisations.

“Victoria's School of Chemical and Physical Sciences is proud to once again host the Wellington Science and Technology Fair. The Laby Building will be abuzz with more than 400 exhibits on display in the laboratories and corridors that are normally the territory of undergraduate students.

\"The Faculty of Science is this year offering two prizes of first year university fees scholarships: one as a major, senior class prize and one for an outstanding and innovative project by a Year 13 student. These are a great way to set students out on science-based careers."

The principal sponsor is NIWA, with other sponsors including the Royal Society, who are donating a premier award and Otago University, who are giving an all-expenses-paid trip to their summer science school. Top prizewinners will also be nominated for places at Genesis Energy’s “Realise the Dream” - a week-long educational forum that showcases the work of Year 7-13 students who have achieved excellence in research or technological practice, to be held in Wellington in December.

“Science & Technology Fairs provide a great chance to students to actively participate in science projects. The enthusiasm is clear to see and the Fairs give an opportunity for students to gain recognition for excellence and innovation.

“Naturally, NIWA hopes that many of the students exhibiting at this year’s fair will take up careers in science. Young scientists and technologists will be vital to maintaining New Zealand’s prosperity and our remarkable environment in future,” says NIWA’s Education Co-ordinator, Dr Julie Hall.

The Fair, held in the Laby Building, Victoria University, is open for public viewing between 9am and 5pm on Friday 24 August and 9am to 12.30pm on Saturday 25 August. Prizegiving is on Saturday 25 August at 1pm in Maclaurin Lecture Theatre 3 at Victoria University.

The details of the main prizewinners, and the first prizewinner in each class will be posted to the fair’s website (www.sciencefair.org.nz) at midday on Friday, 24 August.
