Research looks at partner violence

Māori are twice as likely to be the victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) over a lifetime and over the past 12 months, according to research by Victoria University student Fleur McLaren.

As part of her Master’s thesis, Mrs McLaren looked at the risk factors for IPV victimisation of all New Zealanders over a lifetime and over the past 12 months.

“My research looked at the factors that are strong predictors for IPV victimisation, including ethnicity, employment and socio-economic status,” says Mrs McLaren.

Her thesis analysed complex survey data from the New Zealand National Survey of Crime and Victimisation Survey 2001 (Ministry of Justice).

“The strong predictors for IPV over a lifetime included Māori, people aged 25-29 years, females, solo parents, over-crowded households, those on social welfare benefits, and those divorced and separated.”

For the 12 month prevalence of IPV, strong predictors were those aged 15-24 years, Māori, lower socio economic groups, solo parents with children, those in defacto relationships and those who do not own or rent a house.

“Ethnicity is strongly significant in explaining victimisation even when other variables are factored into the model.”

Mrs McLaren is currently developing her proposal for a PhD in Criminology, and aims to look at how young adults establish intimate dating relationships that are either healthy or characterised by violence.

“This study will be the first to capture New Zealand specific data on the dynamics that exist in young adult intimate relationships and the pathways that lead to a healthy or violent relationship.”
