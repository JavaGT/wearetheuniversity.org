Victoria appoints first Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research)

A newly-established position designed to lead Victoria University of Wellington in its strategic push to increase research revenue and raise its ranking for research quality from third in New Zealand to be among the top two, has been filled by competition and regulation expert, Professor Neil Quigley.

Professor Quigley has worked at Victoria University since 1995 when he was appointed Professor of Monetary Economics & Financial Institutions. In February 1997 he joined the University’s Senior Management Team as Dean of the Faculty of Commerce & Administration.

In February 2001, he was also appointed Pro Vice-Chancellor and line manager for the heads of the University's Schools specialising in business, commerce and management, and became responsible for Victoria International and international issues. In January 2003, Professor Quigley completed his term as Dean but continued as Pro Vice-Chancellor (International).

“I am personally delighted that Victoria’s research strategy will be led by Professor Quigley, whose track record in strategic thinking and implementation has seen Victoria University become the leader in international student recruitment, with innovative strategies of diversification and targeted partnerships now well-developed,” said Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh.

“The position of Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) requires a high-calibre academic leader with proven relationship management skills to take up the challenges of this new role,” said Professor Walsh. “After an international recruitment process it is very pleasing to recognise that leadership from amongst our own senior management team.

“Professor Quigley has maintained a distinguished research record, despite eight years in university management roles,” said Professor Walsh. “It is even more remarkable that he has continued to teach students on the MBA and International MBA programme throughout that period.”

Professor Quigley said he was extremely enthusiastic about the challenge of developing Victoria University's research strategy and to increasing recognition of the high quality research being undertaken across the University.

"Research is fundamental to the mission of universities and to the development of our students' critical thinking skills. A strong commitment to research that meets the highest international standards, to teaching that is informed by and embodies that research, to the development of quality master’s and doctoral programmes, and the application of our research through partners outside the university sector will be critical for Victoria University’s future reputation," said Professor Quigley.

Professor Walsh said Professor Quigley’s knowledge of the University would be a tremendous asset in moving forward with the research strategy and in preparing for the 2006 Performance-Based Research Fund exercise.

The role of Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) complements the existing Deputy Vice-Chancellor role. Professor Quigley will manage the Office of Research & Postgraduate Studies, Chair the University Research Committee, manage the University’s relationship with Victoria Link Limited, and represent Victoria University on the NZ Vice-Chancellors’ Committee’s Research Committee.

Professor Quigley completed a BA and MA (First Class Honours) from the University of Canterbury, and in 1986 received his PhD from the University of Toronto.

He continues to pursue an active research programme on issues relating to regulation, competition policy and industrial organisation in financial services, electricity, telecommunications and other sectors of the economy. He retains an affiliation as Research Associate at the Institute for Policy Analysis, University of Toronto and at the Institute for the Study of Competition & Regulation.

Professor Quigley will take up his new role on 3 October 2005.
