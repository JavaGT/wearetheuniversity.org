University Art Collection Enters Cyberspace

An Internet connection is now all anyone needs to view the work of selected New Zealand artists from the Victoria University Art Collection - with a newly established education resource featuring key artworks from the Collection now online.

The VUW Online Collection Tour has been set up by the University's Adam Art Gallery, which cares for the more than 240 works in Victoria's Collection, which is displayed throughout the University’s campuses.

The Online Collection Tour includes works by Colin McCahon, Doris Lusk, Robyn Kahukiwa, Emily Karaka, Ralph Hotere, Robin White, Gretchen Albrecht, Jacqueline Fahey and Philip Clairmont.

Gallery Director Sophie McIntyre says the Online Collection Tour is designed to provide secondary school students – particularly those from rural schools and centres beyond the Wellington region – with an equal opportunity to work with the University's art collection and related resources.

"We believe these works are an important part of New Zealand's cultural heritage and should be accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live.”

"The artworks and introductory information presented in the Online Collection Tour are particularly relevant for students studying either Bursary Art or Art History. The site is a valuable tool for students working from home or classroom computers.”

"By encouraging students to examine and interpret artworks by important New Zealand artists, the Online Collection Tour aims to develop their knowledge of Modern New Zealand." Sophie McIntyre says as well as offering images and informative texts, the Online Tour encourages students to extend their learning by providing a comprehensive bibliography of New Zealand art books, catalogues and artist focused questions to which students are invited to respond.

"We believe the informative texts, images and straightforward navigation will make the site an appealing and stimulating addition to classroom learning for students, as well as providing teachers with a comprehensive educational resource."
