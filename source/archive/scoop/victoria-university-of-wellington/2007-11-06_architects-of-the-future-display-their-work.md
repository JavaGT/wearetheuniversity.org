Architects of the future display their work

Innovative works from New Zealand’s future building industry professionals will be on display at Victoria University’s Te Aro campus from 8 to 17 November 2007.

The end-of-year exhibition at the University’s School of Architecture will feature projects of final-year students from Architecture, Building Science, Landscape and Interior Architecture programmes. It will also showcase some of the best schemes from students at other stages of their degrees.

On display will be four projects selected to compete in the national Dulux New Zealand Institute of Architects Award for 2007. The designers of these schemes will compete against the best work from New Zealand’s other architecture schools later this month.

Highlights include:

Alain Bruner’s Resurrection of the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA). The project resurrects a redundant NZIA through a contemporary reading of John Ruskin’s Seven Lamps of Architecture.

Sharo Paulo’s Decoration and Architecture: A Rural Experience, a project which uses a rural context to investigate how decoration can be architectural rather than applied, with function as a decorative generator.

Yijing Xu proposes and expresses new visions and possibilities in zoo design with her project of a Monkey Island, a theatre of life exhibiting the complex relationship between human and animal; city and nature.

Diana Chaney’s development of a pilot project between Archives New Zealand and the Wellington City Council, a creation of a reconfiguration of archive such that relationships between the value of both archival and architectural surfaces are determined by contested use, contaminated through the scars and smudges of a multiplicity of use and meaning.

Jun Tsujimoto’s project proposes a Cistercian catholic monastery crossed over with a public bath house in the context of the CBD of Wellington New Zealand. The project makes a contemporary reading of 17th Century Baroque architecture to negotiate the relationship between architecture and contemporary culture.

Matt Randell’s project proposes a way in which to test multiple uses of computer aided design (CAD). The building function and site selection were gathered through Google earth, and then processed through the testing of multiple computer programmes.

Jamie Roberts: Nubukalou Creek, Suva, Fiji. Landform is a medium. How has it been used in the past and how might it be used in the future to manage urban environmental issues in Suva’s coastal environment. The intention of this project was to investigate a relevant integration of landscape architecture with the practices of science, geography, culture and policy based research.

Matthew Pepper: Capturing the Community, Halagigie Point Restoration, Niue, South Pacific. Halagigie Point restoration critically explores four sites and their characteristics as the basis for solutions to Niue’s declining population and loss of cultural identity.

Nick Jones: Patea: the town shut down, Patea, Taranaki, NZ. As part of a revitalising strategy, the project mediates heritage importance and visitor experience with local needs and perspectives. How can the necessary demolition and decontamination of the freezing works inform a non-museological ‘preservation’ and re-use of a site?

Members of the public are invited to visit the exhibition at Victoria University’s School of Architecture, 139, Vivian Street, Wellington. The exhibition is open daily from 10am to 5pm between 8 and 17 November 2007. Entry is free.

Media are invited to the opening of the exhibition on Wednesday 7 November at 6pm at Victoria School of Architecture, 139 Vivian Street, Wellington. Staff and students will be available to talk with the media and there will be a range of photo opportunities.
