**Victoria graduands end the year on a high note**

Nearly 1200 students will begin the festive season by marking the successful completion of their studies at Victoria University of Wellington during graduation ceremonies and a parade in Wellington this week.

A total of 1268 qualifications will be awarded to 1178 students, including 61 PhDs. The students are graduating from the faculties of Commerce; Architecture and Design; Education; Engineering; Humanities and Social Sciences; Law; Science; Toihuarewa and Te Kōkī—New Zealand School of Music.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says being awarded a university degree is an outstanding achievement.

“Graduation is a celebration of excellence. Our graduands have worked hard to attain their qualifications and Victoria is proud of their achievements, as are their family and friends.”

He says Victoria graduates go on to make a valuable contribution to New Zealand’s economy and society.

“Our students graduate with a diverse range of skills and attributes, imbued with a global perspective that is vital for today’s workforce.”

A highlight of this week’s graduation ceremonies will be the awarding of an honorary degree of Doctor of Commerce to distinguished investment banker and business leader Paul Baines.

Below are details of the parade and graduation ceremonies.

**Parade—12 noon, Thursday 12 December**

The traditional street parade of staff and graduands will depart from the Law School in the Government Buildings Historic Reserve on Thursday at noon, and will take around 40 minutes to parade along Lambton Quay and Willis and Mercer Streets to finish in Civic Square, where they will be welcomed by Mayor Celia Wade-Brown.
