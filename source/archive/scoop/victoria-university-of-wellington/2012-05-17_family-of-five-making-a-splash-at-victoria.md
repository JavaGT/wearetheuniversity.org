**Family of five making a splash at Victoria**

National water polo representative Eamon Lui-Fakaotimanava completed a full family circle of Victoria University graduates when his Bachelor of Commerce and Administration degree was conferred yesterday.

Eamon’s sister Ciara graduated from Victoria in 2007, his brother Conor graduated in 2010, and parents Holona and Trish met while studying at Victoria University in the 1970s.

Eamon deferred graduation twice to represent New Zealand in the national men's water polo team, which included playing at the World FINA Water Polo League in China and Japan.

“Throughout my studies, sport played a huge role in my life. Balancing both sport and study helped me build the skills necessary to succeed.

“I am very lucky to have a great crew around me—my family and friends have always supported me in my studies and sporting aspirations,” says Eamon.

“The driving force behind my education has always been my family, especially my parents,” says Eamon. “They have always encouraged us to strive for excellence and I can’t thank them enough for their support over the years.”
