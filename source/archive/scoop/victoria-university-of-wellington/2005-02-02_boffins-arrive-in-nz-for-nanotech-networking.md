Boffins arrive in New Zealand for nanotech networking

A large proportion of the world’s top nanotechnologists and advanced materials scientists are arriving in New Zealand over the next few days to take part in a major international conference organised by the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology.

AMN-2: Second International Conference on Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, from 6-11 February 2005, will see more than 300 scientists converge on Queenstown for five days of lectures, symposia and networking.

Please visit www.elec.canterbury.ac.nz/AMN-2 for more information. Should you wish to attend the conference or interview any of the scientists below, please contact Margaret Brown on 04 463 5950, 021 243 5950 or email margaret.brown@vuw.ac.nz. A photographer is available to take images on request.

Professor Henry (Hank) Smith - Heads a world-leading nanotechnology laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology http://rleweb.mit.edu/rlestaff/p-hsmith.htm. As one of the most prominent leaders in the field of nanofabrication technology, his patents have been widely licensed and publications widely cited.

Professor Lynn Gladden - FRS, OBE. One of the Britain’s leading young women scientists, recently elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society. www.cheng.cam.ac.uk/people/gladden.html

Professor Ann Dowling - Cambridge University engineering Professor who led the British Royal Society report on Nanotechnology (www.raeng.org.uk/policy/reports). More on Professor Dowling: www.eng.cam.ac.uk/~apd1 or www.britishcouncil.org/science-testimonials-ann-dowling.htm.
