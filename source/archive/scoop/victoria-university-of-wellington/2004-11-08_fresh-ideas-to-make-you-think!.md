Fresh ideas to make you THINK!

Exciting works from New Zealand’s next generation of architects and designers will feature in a free exhibition at Victoria University’s Te Aro Campus from 9-21 November 2004.

THINK 04 will showcase the portfolios of final year students from Architecture, Building Science, Landscape Architecture, Interior Architecture and Industrial Design programmes. It will also display some of the best pieces from students at other stages of their degrees.

The exhibition will be launched tonight (Monday 8 November) at an official ceremony which will include the presentation of a number of substantial academic prizes.

THINK 04 will also showcase four projects selected for competition in the national New Zealand Institute of Architects Award for 2004. These students will travel to Auckland to compete against the top work from the UNITEC and Auckland University schools of architecture later this month. The selections are: Hayden French’s polished hotel and museum for Napier’s docklands; Chris Winwood’s noisy sound archive opposite Te Papa; Welf Bowyer’s provocative concept for a fashion design precinct in Te Aro; and Caroline Robertson’s urban recording studio for the K’Rd district of Auckland.

Other highlights of THINK 04 include: Pete Ritchie’s urban landscape which challenges the relationship of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa to its urban context; Alice Cullen’s poignant memorial to the abandoned freezing works in Patea; Sam Spinks’ sensitive revelations of Wellington history using three landscape design interventions along the Terrace; Emma Coop’s exhibition of virtual landscape to define space within a New Zealand winery interior; Joanne Henman’s design for a unique mobile surgery unit; Nicole Ying Ju Chen’s innovative design for the New Zealand Film Archive in a Wellington waterfront heritage building; Models created by Building Design students, Jono Smith, Rachel Ryan, and Stuart Ashdown, using the advanced architectural lighting design software, RayFront. Rory Bladen’s modularised compact urban vehicle. An exploration, by Sarah Adams, of the design potential of cutting-edge free-form manufacturing technologies with an everyday object; a tea cup and saucer. An investigation of future living, undertaken by Industrial Design students, in association with Fisher and Paykel and Creativelab.
