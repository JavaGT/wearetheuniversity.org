Victoria’s accounting research among best in the world

Victoria University’s School of Accounting and Commercial Law (SACL) has been ranked among the best in the world for research quality in an international ranking.

Each year, Bringham Young University in the United States ranks universities throughout the world based upon the research output of accounting staff.

After looking at publications over the past six years, Bringham Young University ranked Victoria number 16 out of over 700 universities in the world for accounting information systems research, 26 for audit research, and 17 for experimental research.

In the more specific fields of experimental accounting systems research and experimental audit research, Victoria University was ranked in the top 10.

“I am delighted to see SACL not only achieving the highest ranking of any university in New Zealand, but also performing so well on a global scale,” says Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Commerce Professor Bob Buckle.

“It benefits our students greatly to have educators equipped with leading edge knowledge in their field.”

The Bringham Young University ranking system examines publications in 11 of the highest-rated and influential accounting journals.

These results follow this year’s Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) Evaluation, which ranked Victoria first among New Zealand universities for research, as well as the 2013 QS World University Rankings which put Victoria in the top 50 for four subjects and the top 150 for eight other subjects.
