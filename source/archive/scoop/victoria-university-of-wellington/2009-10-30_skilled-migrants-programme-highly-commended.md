Skilled Migrants’ Programme wins Highly Commended in national EEO Trust Awards

A programme devised by Victoria University of Wellington to help skilled migrants get work won an EEO Trust Award last night.

The Workplace Communication for Skilled Migrants’ Programme won ‘Highly Commended’ in the Tomorrow’s Workforce Award category of the EEO Trust Work & Life Awards 2009.

In handing out the award one of the programme participants Filipino Rodolfo Divino was quoted: “No one can exactly tell the profound positive impact of this course both mentally and emotionally, except those who were the product of this programme—us.”

The Skilled Migrants’ Programme helps tertiary-educated, experienced immigrants gain workplace experience, develop skills and confidence in job-seeking, and learn communication skills appropriate for New Zealand workplaces.

Participants come from a variety of professional backgrounds including law, accounting, medicine, engineering, finance, banking, information technology and education.

Economic assessments show that the programme returns $98 to the New Zealand economy for every dollar spent.

Programme designer and coordinator Nicky Riddiford said: “The EEO Trust Award is a wonderful recognition of the work done here and with our business and community partners in making a difference for people and the community.

“This programme benefits the migrants and their families, of course. It equally benefits the New Zealand community and workplaces, by ensuring a speedy and positive entry into productive work.”

“The economic benefits are substantial,” said Victoria’s Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, Professor Deborah Willis.

“Cost/benefit analysis shows that the programme returns $98 to the New Zealand economy for every dollar spent. The benefits are so high because they last for a graduate’s whole career. We conservatively estimate a productivity improvement of $30,000 per graduate per year of employment in 2009 values.

“There are also savings in unemployment benefits and participants gain self-esteem in being able to share their professional skills, often in areas where there is a skill shortage.”

The programme relies upon in-class teaching of six weeks, workplace experience of six weeks and mentoring from business people

Internships and mentoring have been strongly supported by the Rotary Club of Wellington and recruitment agency The Johnson Group.

Leigh Johnson, Director of The Johnson Group said: \"As a recruitment agency, we're in an ideal position to help change some of the attitudes that make it so difficult for skilled migrants to find appropriate, meaningful work in New Zealand. The Johnson Group's consultants very much value working on the Skilled Migrant Programme. It's marvellous that our work on placing interns has such a dramatic and positive effect on our clients' lives and careers."

Stephen Brown, President of the Rotary Club of Wellington said: “Our members and some of their partners are huge supporters of this programme because it makes a real and visible difference to people, families and communities. It is a very rewarding two-way street, and so more members sign up each year to become mentors or offer internships. Long may it continue.”

The programme received special commendation from the New Zealand Human Rights Commission in June 2009.
