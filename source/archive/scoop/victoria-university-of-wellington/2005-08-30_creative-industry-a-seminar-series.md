Creative Industry: A Seminar Series

You are invited to attend a series of seminars on CREATIVE INDUSTRY at Victoria University, starting this week:

CREATIVE INDUSTRY: A seminar series organised by the Victoria Management School and the Stout Research Centre When: 4.40-6 pm, Wednesdays, August 31 2005 weekly until 5 October. Where: GBLT4 (second floor, Old Government Buildings, Lambton Quay, opposite Parliament). There is no cost, and registration is not required. During Helen Clark's term as Prime Minister the creative industries have been a major plank of the government's economic/cultural programme. What are they? Do they work? How would we know?

An interdisciplinary seminar series jointly hosted by the Stout Research Centre and the Victoria Management School will critically examine the creative industries, raising questions about definition, relationships, value and effects.

The seminar series will open on August 31 2005 and run weekly until 5 October at Victoria's downtown campus, Room GBLT4 in the Old Government Buildings, Lambton Quay (opposite Parliament Buildings).
