**China’s rise as a global superpower debated**

Some of the world’s leading scholars on China converge on Dunedin next weekend to dissect what the rise of China as a superpower means for New Zealand and the world.  
  
The 45th Otago School of Foreign Policy conference is co-hosted by the University of Otago School of Foreign Policy and the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre, which is based at Victoria University of Wellington.

The event gathers together leading national and international China scholars and New Zealand diplomats, policymakers, business people and members of the public.

Conference speakers will examine how China has brought significant changes to international politics, the world economy, global governance, and regional institutions, and debate whether a new China will fundamentally change the rules of the game in the global system.

Co-director of the conference and Director of the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre Professor Xiaoming Huang of Victoria University says the rise of China has raised many issues.

“Today, China is often seen as a responsible stakeholder in the global system. However there are still concerns about what role it will take in the merging world order and how the country’s growing interests and capacities will shape the way the international system operates.”

New Zealand-China relations are the focus of a roundtable composed of leading Chinese academics and New Zealand figures including Wellington Regional Chamber of Commerce CEO Charles Finny and journalist and analyst Colin James.
