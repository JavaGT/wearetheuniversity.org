Two Wellington Writers in the running for Literature's Richest Prize

Damien Wilkins and Elizabeth Knox, two of New Zealand's most respected and acclaimed novelists, have been nominated for the world's richest literary prize, the 2004 International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award.

Their books "Chemistry" and "Billie's Kiss" respectively, published in this country by Victoria University Press, were released in 2002 in NZ, the UK and the US to critical acclaim and now join other works of "high literary merit" from around the world on the list of eligible titles.

Worth EURO 100 000 (approx NZ$196 000) the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award will be announced in May 2004, following the shortlist announcement in March 2004.

Both the shortlist and the eventual winner are selected by an international panel of judges which changes each year. Previous winners include Australian David Malouf, French writer Michel Houellebecq and Orhan Pamuk, last year's winner from Turkey.

NZ novelist Barbara Anderson's "Swing Around" was nominated for last year's award along with novels by Patricia Grace and Maurice Gee. Please contact Heather McKenzie for more information or visit http://www.impacdublinaward.ie/index.htm
