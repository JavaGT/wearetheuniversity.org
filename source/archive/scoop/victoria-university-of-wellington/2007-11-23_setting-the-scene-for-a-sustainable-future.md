**Setting the scene for a sustainable future**

The integration of environmental education across all classrooms at Pukerua Bay School earned the school first-place in the "Enviroschools" competition and a new solar water heating system.

A presentation from the School will made to delegates at the "Teaching for Sustainability Conference" this afternoon - a three-day national conference for teachers and educators that focuses on sustainability as a key context for the classroom.

Hosted by Victoria academics and Education for Sustainability advisers Pam Williams and Jan Cox, the conference is supported by Genesis Energy and the Teachers Refresher Course Committee.

The competition that asked schools to demonstrate their learning and teaching in sustainable energy, especially in relation to climate change. Pukerua Bay won the solar water heating system, supplied and to be installed by Leap Australasia, and Khandallah School won an energy audit.

One of the conference organisers, Tim Hewitt, says the judges were impressed by the way energy learning was integrated across year levels and through various subjects. It was judged that this "reflected the depth of the student-directed learning and the thorough action planning, including long-term monitoring.

"Genuine student participation in the learning is very strongly evident throughout the application. Inquiry has lead to specific questions generated by the students, and answers that are clearly and appropriately justified".
