From World War II to Wellywood
==============================

From World War II to Wellywood with Writers on Mondays

John Mulgan’s uncensored report on his experiences in World War II and a report on New Zealand women’s difficulties in the film industry make for a thought-provoking start to this year’s Writers on Mondays series, presented by Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).

On 12 July, Victoria University’s first Creative Writing PhD graduate Marian Evans will tackle the barriers faced by women who want to make films in this country, and on 19 July Associate Professor of English Peter Whiteford reveals what writer/soldier John Mulgan (author of Man Alone) wasn’t allowed to say when his memoir Report on Experience was first published in 1947.

Later in the series, writer Paul Millar examines the stifling effect of Kiwi conformity on the career of homosexual writer Bill Pearson, and the state of New Zealand sports writing will be debated in a conversation between sports anthologist Harry Ricketts and journalist Paul Thomas.  

Writers on Mondays will also offer previews of new work from well-loved poet and Victoria University Writer in Residence Jenny Bornholdt, and a host of exciting new literary talent emerging from the IIML. Wellingtonians will also have the chance to hear nine of New Zealand’s best poets in a reading for National Poetry Day which takes place on 30 July.

In September the annual series breaks into song, with a special Thursday evening concert launching Buddhist Rain, an album featuring jazz interpretations of poems by Bill Manhire, composed and performed by Norman Meehan, Hannah Griffin and Colin Hemmingsen.

IIML Director Bill Manhire says he is pleased that many of this year’s sessions step into public as well as private territory.

“Alongside the familiar pulse-takings of human relationships, there are the challenges of the sports field, the gender politics of the film world, and the New Zealand experience in World War II Europe.  
   
“And in addition to well-known, established authors like Jenny Bornholdt, Bill Pearson, and John Mulgan, there are the exciting new voices we’ll be hearing a lot more of over the next few years.”

Writers on Mondays events run from 12.15-1.15pm at The Marae, Level 4, Te Papa except for:
