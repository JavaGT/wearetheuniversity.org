=====================================

**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University has appointed Dr Bob Klepper as the Jade Professor of Electronic Commerce in the School of Information Management.

Prior to joining Victoria, Professor Klepper was a Professor of Computer Management and Information Systems in the School of Business at the Southern Illinois University.

Professor Sid Huff, Head of the School of Information Management, said Professor Klepper's appointment was a sign of ongoing growth for e-commerce at Victoria.

\"Professor Klepper, along with new Associate Professors Hans Lehmann and Stuart Barnes, will greatly boost our e-commerce expertise. The growth in student demand for our information systems and e-commerce courses has been very strong of late."

Professor Klepper's research interests centre on the acquisition and implementation of new technology in organisations and the role that trust and reputation play in fostering business-to-consumer electronic commerce. His electronic business research areas also include overcoming barriers to e-business in developing countries and the role of distance in a networked world.

Professor Klepper, the author of Outsourcing Information Technology, Systems and Services, has acted as a consultant for a number of corporations and public bodies throughout the world. These have included seminars on outsourcing for IBM, an analysis of online data research capabilities for a large public library and advising a Romanian manufacturing firm on information systems planning and the implementation of a quality assurance programme.
