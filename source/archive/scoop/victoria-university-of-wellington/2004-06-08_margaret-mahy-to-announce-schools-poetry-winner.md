Margaret Mahy to announce winner of Bell Gully National Schools Poetry Award

Famed children’s writer Margaret Mahy will present this year’s Bell Gully National Schools Poetry Award, to be announced at Victoria University in August 2004.

Any student in Year 12 and 13 enrolled at a New Zealand secondary school is encouraged to submit a poem. Glenn Colquhoun, recent winner of the International Institute of Modern Letter’s (IIML) Prize in Modern Letters, will judge the competition.

The winner will receive a $500 cash prize; a $500 book grant for their school’s library; a year’s membership to the New Zealand Book Council; and subscriptions to leading literary journals Landfall and Sport. Entries for the award close on 18 June 2004.

“A good poem celebrates the possibilities inherent in words, explores the mysteries and paradoxes of language, and as it does this, connects us to the world with a wonderful and almost mathematical certainty,” says Margaret.

“We need young writers to explore and re-explore the world for us, to enlighten us with their imagery and with their jokes too. This poetry award certainly provides them with the encouragement of recognition and I look forward to reading the prize winning poems.”
