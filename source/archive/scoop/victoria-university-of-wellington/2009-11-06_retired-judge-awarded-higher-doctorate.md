Retired Judge awarded Higher Doctorate  
 

A retired Judge who made a significant impact in the field of law has been awarded a Higher Doctorate from Victoria University.

The Rt Hon Sir Edmund Thomas KNZM QC, was awarded a Doctorate of Laws degree (LLD) in recognition of his contribution to jurisprudence.

“Sir Edmund has made a substantial contribution to legal scholarship and debate,” says Dean of Victoria’s Faculty of Graduate Research, Professor Laurie Bauer.

“The three examiners unanimously agreed that the contribution he has made is original and prestigious, and merits the award of Higher Doctorate.”

A Higher Doctorate is awarded for a substantial body of published work demonstrating excellence in research or creative achievement. The award confirms that the candidate is a distinguished leader in their field.  

The examiners commented on Sir Edmund's international reputation as a leading thinker and writer in matters relating to the judicial process, and the excellence of the scholarship displayed in the works examined.

The core publication submitted in his portfolio of published works for the degree was his book The Judicial Process: Realism, Pragmatism, Practical Reasoning and Principles (Cambridge University Press, 2005). 

The award will be conferred at Victoria’s graduation ceremony in December.
