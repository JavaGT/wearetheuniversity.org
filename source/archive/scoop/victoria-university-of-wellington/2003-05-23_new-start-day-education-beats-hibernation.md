New Start Day – education beats hibernation
===========================================

**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Adults considering tertiary study have the perfect opportunity to experience it first hand, at Victoria University’s New Start Day on Saturday, 31 May.

New Start Day is a free programme designed specifically for adults interested in beginning or returning to university study.

Participants will be introduced to Victoria University staff, talk with other mature students, and hear a mini lecture. Dr Allison Kirkman of the School of Sociology and Social Policy will deliver the lecture from the 100-level ‘Sexuality and Society’ Course, exploring the concept of whether “Sex Sells?”

Student Recruitment and Course Advice staff will also guide prospective students through the course planning and enrolment process.

Victoria University Student Liaison Officer, Rachel Manirakiza, says feedback on New Start Day indicates previous attendees receive encouragement and gain confidence to achieve the goals they set for themselves.

“After some years in the workforce many people are realising the doors a university education will open for them,” she says.

Over the past two years approximately 70 percent of those attending New Start Day have enrolled at Victoria.

For the past three years, mature or adult students have made up approximately 38 percent of Victoria University’s total student population.

Advertising supporting New Start Day focuses on getting a head start on education in winter rather than hibernating and putting study off till summer.

New Start Day runs from 9.30am – 1pm on Saturday, 31 May 2003. Anyone interested in attending should phone 0800 VIC UNI or call (04) 463 5374 or e-mail course-advice@vuw.ac.nz to register.
