**Visionary justice advocate receives Victoria University Honorary Doctorate**

One of the country’s most respected authorities on criminal justice reform and corrections policy, Kim Workman, is being recognised with an honorary doctorate from Victoria University of Wellington.

Kim Workman QSO, of Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa and Rangitaane, has held numerous positions in the criminal justice sector throughout his 57-year career and continues to be the nationwide spokesman for just, humane and effective criminal justice strategies.

Victoria University Chancellor Sir Neville Jordan says Mr Workman is “highly deserving of the honour”.

“Mr Workman’s life-long contribution has had, and continues to have, a profoundly positive and lasting impact on New Zealand’s justice system.”

Mr Workman’s early roles saw him on the front line of the criminal justice system, first as a police officer and later heading the Wellington Police Youth Aid section. He has also held various civil service positions, including at the Office of the Ombudsman, the State Services Commission, the Department of Māori Affairs, the Ministry of Health, and the Department of Justice where he oversaw major reform in the prison service.

Following three decades in the public sector, Mr Workman became the national director of Prison Fellowship New Zealand, co-launched the nationally significant Rethinking Crime and Punishment project, and more recently was involved in establishing Justspeak, a national youth movement advocating positive reform in the criminal justice system.

“He has made a significant contribution to the thinking and practice in relation to criminal justice and public policy,” Sir Neville says.

“From governmental head offices down to a grassroots level, individuals all over the country—prisoners, victims, their families and communities, justice professionals and advocates—have benefited from his intelligent and progressive work.

“He has also been integral to generating national debate on key issues such as rehabilitation, crime reduction, human rights and social justice.

“Throughout his career, Mr Workman has shown incredible passion, vision and persistence. The University is proud to count him as part of its alumni community.”

Mr Workman graduated from Massey University in the 1980s, and completed a Graduate Diploma in Arts, majoring in Religious Studies, at Victoria in 2012. He occasionally returns to Victoria to give lectures.

During his tenure as the University’s 2015 J.D. Stout Fellow, Mr Workman began work on a new book examining the criminal justice system over the past 30 years. _The Criminal Justice System, the State and Māori – From 1985 to the Present_ is scheduled for publication in 2017.

Mr Workman will be admitted to the degree of Doctor of Literature on Thursday 19 May.
