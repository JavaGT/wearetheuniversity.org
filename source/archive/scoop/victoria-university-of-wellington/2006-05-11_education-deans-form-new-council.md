Education deans form new council

A better understanding of education issues and the promotion of clear and innovative views on education and teacher education are the aims of a new council established by universities in New Zealand.

The New Zealand Council of Deans of Education includes representatives from the seven universities with education and teacher education programmes and will be chaired in its first year by Victoria University’s Dean of Education, Professor Dugald Scott.

The Council was first discussed at a conference last year attended by universities involved in teacher education, with a view to establishing ways the universities could take a lead in maintaining and advancing standards in teacher education. The role of universities in teacher education has been raised in the last decade by the merger of four of New Zealand’s Colleges of Education with a neighbouring university, and the impending mergers of the last two.

Professor Scott says the Council expects to provide leadership in teacher education and ongoing teacher development, and encourage the sharing of models of teacher education within New Zealand and internationally.

It will consider rationalising processes related to teacher education programme approvals reviews and quality assurance requirements, and will help build stakeholder relationships within and beyond universities.

Professor Scott says he expects the Council will undertake benchmarking exercises to help evaluate programmes, research activities, resourcing levels, teacher supply, administrative systems and costs, and other relevant academic issues.

“A key driver is a desire to maintain and enhance standards in teacher education. As well, I expect the council to undertake activities such as commissioning research reports and discussion papers on education issues.”

The Council, which will meet formally three times a year in Wellington, will have an annual rotating chairmanship.
