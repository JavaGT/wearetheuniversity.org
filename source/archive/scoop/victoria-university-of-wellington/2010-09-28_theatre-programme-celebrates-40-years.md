PRESS RELEASE

**Victoria University’s Theatre Programme celebrates 40 years…and the Devil’s invited!**

  
As Victoria University’s Theatre Programme celebrates its 40th anniversary this October, the students of THEA 303 ‘Asian Performance Practices’ are excited to present to you, from 5 – 9 October, a fantastically physical interpretation of Mikhael Bulgakov’s underground literary masterpiece, _Master and Margarita_.

Inspired by various Japanese and Chinese performance styles and Vsevolod Meyerhold’s spectacularly scientific biomechanics, the production explores the conflicts and contradictions surrounding religion and censorship in a society where atheism reigns supreme.

Witches, vampires, magic, talking cats, severed heads and a grand ball hosted by the Devil is only a taste of the theatrical extravagance arriving soon at Studio 77. So come along and join us, the devil knows you want to!

  
**What:** _Master and Margarita_ by Mikhael Bulgakov, adapted by Edward Kemp, directed by Megan Evans, performed and designed by the students of THEA 303 with assistance from THEA 220.  
**When:** Tuesday 5 to Saturday 9 October, 7:30 pm  
**Where:** Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn (Gate 10 of Victoria University)  
**Tickets:** $8 unwaged, $15 waged  
**To book:** email theatre@vuw.ac.nz or call 04 463 5359
