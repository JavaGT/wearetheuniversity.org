**Reimagine Tory Street – winning design announced**

A group of three landscape architecture students from Victoria University of Wellington has won the Reimagine Tory Street concept design competition with their project _It’s Tory Time._

Reimagine Tory Street is a partnership between Wellington City Council and the Victoria University of Wellington School of Architecture, exploring new options for temporary installations in lower Tory Street.

Students met with local businesses and residents, and ran a drop-in session at Courtenay Central where shoppers and movie-goers could share their thoughts and ideas. The resulting concepts included everything from swings and hammocks, to performance spaces, and trees made from tension cables.

The winning concept is inspired by lower Tory Street’s history as part of Te Aro Pa, and features a structural pavilion, platform seating, and planting.

“The impact of the Kaikoura earthquake and the proposed Film Museum and Convention Centre present a real opportunity to transform lower Tory Street. We’re exploring temporary design ideas to trial ways of making this street more usable and attractive for the large number of people who use it every day,” says Lambton Ward Councillor Nicola Young.

“Tory Street is one of our oldest streets, in the heart of old Wellington. It’s important to keep it vibrant, especially with Te Aro’s large population increase – so I am really delighted this project has captured the imagination of Wellingtonians”.

Members of the public were asked to vote at the concept exhibition in Courtenay Central or online through the Council Facebook page. More than 2000 people voted over five days, and _It’s Tory Time_ took top place by a significant margin.

Students will work with university staff to develop the concept. Following a technical review by Council officers a final design will be agreed and construction will begin later this year.
