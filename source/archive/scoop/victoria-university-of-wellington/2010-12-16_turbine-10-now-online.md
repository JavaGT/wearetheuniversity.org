Turbine 10 now online

**Turbine 10 now online – a rich chorus of new and established literary voices**

The 2010 issue of literary journal _Turbine_ is now online, featuring new writing from emerging and established writers, with motherhood, earthquakes, and snow emerging as themes in this year’s quietly apocalyptic selection.

_Turbine_ is published once a year by Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) and can be viewed at www.victoria.ac.nz/turbine.

Sixteen of this year’s IIML Masters students have work on display, including this year’s Adam Foundation Prize winner, Rayne Cockburn, with an excerpt from her reading journal offering an insight into how reading great literature feeds the creative process.

Also in this issue are two new poems by, and an interview with, 2010 Victoria University Writer in Residence Jenny Bornholdt, former Poet Laureate, who talks about the poetic quality of children’s writing, and what is meant by the term ‘school of poetry’.

Audio recordings by six poets, including Jenny Bornholdt, 2009 Biggs Prize winner Bill Nelson, and Victoria University Lecturer Anna Jackson, offer the chance to hear poetry come to life.

Two new storm-buffeted but enchanting poems appear from Bernadette Hall, who will be taking up a teaching fellowship at the IIML next year to stand in for senior lecturer Chris Price, who will be spending much of the year in Menton, France as recipient of the 2011 Mansfield Prize.

“The 2010 edition of _Turbine_ is full of award-winning writers, with a startling piece of fiction set in a disquieting theme park from two-time Macmillan Brown Prize winner Cate Palmer, and poetry by no fewer than three previous Adam Prize recipients—Cliff Fell, Lynn Jenner, and Ashleigh Young,” says Chris Price.

\"The issue traverses the high brow and the low. Cliff Fell's work alone ranges from classical Latin love poetry to an examination of Kiwi profanity."
