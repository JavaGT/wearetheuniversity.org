Get in the know at Study at Vic Day 2007

The population of Victoria University's Kelburn Campus will swell by more than 3,500 as students from throughout New Zealand come and sample life at the capital city university.

Study at Vic Day, held on Friday 24 August, offers students, their parents, whānau and teachers the chance to see what Victoria University has to offer as well as the chance to enjoy free lunchtime entertainment from fantastic Wellington band, OdESSA, in the Kelburn Campus Quad.

The lunchtime entertainment is just a small part of what will be happening during the day, which will be attended by about 3,500 visitors from Wellington and further afield.

Victoria’s Kelburn Campus will be the base of the day’s activities with more than 65 information sessions, as well as displays, competitions and the chance to win an iPod. Visitors will also have the opportunity to talk to staff and current students, look around the facilities and attend information sessions to find out what it is like to study the many subjects offered at Victoria for first-year students.

Tours of the Kelburn Campus, home of the Faculties of Humanities & Social Sciences, Science and Engineering, will be offered during the day – as well as tours of the Halls of Residence, the Faculty of Commerce & Administration and Faculty of Law (Pipitea Campus), the Faculty of Education (Karori Campus) and the Faculty of Architecture & Design (Te Aro Campus).
