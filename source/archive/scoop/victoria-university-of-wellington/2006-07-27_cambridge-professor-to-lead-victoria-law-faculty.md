Cambridge Professor to lead Victoria Law Faculty

Eminent expatriate, Professor A.T.H. (Tony) Smith, is to return to New Zealand to lead Victoria University of Wellington’s Faculty of Law and School of Government.

“I am delighted to have recruited someone of the outstanding calibre of Professor Smith to the role of Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Law. In addition, he will take on the role of Pro Vice-Chancellor (Government Relations),” said Professor Pat Walsh, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington.

As Professor of Criminal and Public Laws at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Professor Smith has published extensively in the areas of criminal justice and aspects of public law.

“To enable Professor Smith to complete his own research commitments, I have agreed to a period of research and study leave from October 2006. This means he will take up his appointment early in 2007”, said Professor Walsh.

Professor Smith obtained his Master of Laws with first class honours from the University of Canterbury in 1972, and was admitted as a Barrister and Solicitor of the High Court in 1979. In 1990 he was admitted as Barrister (Middle Temple) in the United Kingdom and in 2000 as Honorary Bencher (Middle Temple). His Doctor of Laws was awarded by Cambridge University in 1999 on the basis of his published works.

Professor Walsh said that Professor Smith is expected to bring a renewed focus on research-led teaching with a strong international dimension.

“One of my ambitions is to enhance Victoria University’s international presence,” said Professor Smith. “This will involve maintaining a strong regional presence but reaching out further to the British and European institutions.”

Keen to return to New Zealand to be closer to family, Professor Smith commented that, “I am greatly looking forward to being back in New Zealand and in the heart of the legal community where I have a number of friends in private practice and on the bench.”

At Cambridge, Professor Smith served as Chairman of the Faculty of Law, fulfilling the role of Dean and he has contributed in a variety of management and committee roles. With a strong background in University administration, Professor Smith will provide leadership for the University’s School of Government and will contribute more broadly across the University as a member of the Senior Management Team.
