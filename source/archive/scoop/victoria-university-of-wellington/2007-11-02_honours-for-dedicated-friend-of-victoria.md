Honours for dedicated friend of Victoria

The exceptional contribution of Don Scott, a longstanding supporter of Victoria University, will be recognised with the presentation of a Hunter Fellowship on 3 December.

The Hunter Fellowships were inaugurated in 2003 to acknowledge the wide variety of contributions made by individuals whose keen support has helped the University achieve a number of its objectives over recent years.

A graduate of Victoria, Mr Scott served on the Victoria University Council from 1999 to 2007, and is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.

Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, said the University wished to acknowledge Mr Scott’s work on behalf of the University. "He has been very generous with his time, and his expertise and experience have been invaluable. He has made a substantial contribution to the University in his eight years as a councillor and Chair of the Audit Committee.

"He has a strong desire to see this University advance, and for this support we thank him. It is our privilege to to honour him with a Hunter Fellowship."

Mr Scott has worked extensively in the accounting profession and business community. A former Chairman of the Wellington Branch of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, he has served on a number of national committees. He has also been Chairman of the New Zealand Committee of the Pacific Basin Economic Council, and Chairman and Managing Partner of KPMG Wellington, where he was a partner for more than 30 years.

The Hunter Fellowship will be presented at a reception to be held in the Council Chamber, Hunter Building, Gate 1, Kelburn Parade at 6pm.
