**MEDIA RELEASE**

**Victoria University Chancellor receives Knighthood**  
  
The incoming Chancellor of Victoria University, Neville Jordan CNZM, has received a Knighthood in the 2015 New Year Honours, for services to business, science and the community.

Sir Neville is a Wellington investor and adviser in science and technology and executive chairman of his company, Endeavour Capital Ltd. He was appointed a member of the Victoria University Council by the Minister for Tertiary Education in 2013, and was recently elected by the Council as Chancellor.

Sir Neville says he is honoured and humbled by the knighthood. “I grew up in a family with no telephone, no car or holidays away and started working in the local freezing works at age 13. This honour is beyond anything I could have dreamed about.

“Receiving the news was totally stunning and I acknowledge all those who have given me encouragement and support throughout the years.”

The Vice-Chancellor of Victoria, Professor Grant Guilford, congratulated Sir Neville and says the University is very proud of his achievement.

“Sir Neville has a long standing connection to Victoria; he studied engineering here early in his career and has taken a keen interest in the development of our capability in engineering and science.

“He is also a champion of the humanities, another of Victoria’s strengths. It was during his term as President of the Royal Society NZ, from 2006 to 2009, that humanities were embraced, in addition to science and technology, as key areas of focus for the Society.”

Professor Guilford says Sir Neville’s skill and experience will be of significant benefit to Victoria. “His Knighthood has been approved by the Queen for services to business, science and the community, all areas in which Victoria is focused on strengthening its engagement.

“As Victoria rolls out its new Strategic Plan, we are very fortunate to have a Chancellor with such an outstanding skill set to help us progress.”

Sir Neville has a background in electronics engineering and is a Distinguished Fellow of the Institution of Professional Engineers of New Zealand. He founded MAS Technology Ltd in 1975, a telecommunications microwave company that he successfully listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

His previous awards and accolades include the Governor-General’s Supreme Award for Exporting and induction into both the New Zealand Hi Tech Hall of Fame and the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame. Sir Neville was also Wellingtonian of the Year in 2012.
