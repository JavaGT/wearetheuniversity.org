**US poet Joy Harjo to bring storytelling magic to Wellington**

Renowned US poet Joy Harjo is being brought to Wellington by Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) this month.

She will lead a masterclass for the IIML’s MA students and give two public presentations.

“Joy Harjo is a brilliant performer whose poetry blends a storytelling tradition with song, and draws from the American tradition of praising the land and the spirit,” says Professor Bill Manhire, Director of the IIML.

“We are excited to be hosting her very first visit to New Zealand—especially as Joy was a student at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop along with the IIML’s founder, Glenn Schaeffer.”

Of Muskogee Creek heritage, Ms Harjo was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Her seven books of poetry, including _How We Became Human-New and Selected Poems, The Woman Who Fell From the Sky,_ and **_She Had Some Horses_** have garnered numerous awards. These include the New Mexico Governor’s Award for Excellence in the Arts; the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Native Writers’ Circle of the Americas; and the William Carlos Williams Award from the Poetry Society of America. _For A Girl Becoming_, a young adult/coming of age book, was released in 2009 and is Ms Harjo’s most recent publication.

She has released four award-winning CDs of original music and in 2009 won a Native American Music Award (NAMMY) for Best Female Artist of the Year for _Winding Through the Milky Way._

She received a Rasmusson: US Artists Fellowship in 2008 and is a founding board member of the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation.
