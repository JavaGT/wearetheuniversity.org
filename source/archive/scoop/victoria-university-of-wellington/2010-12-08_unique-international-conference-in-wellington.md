Exploring how indigenous peoples can harness economic opportunities

The significance and value of indigenous intellectual property is being highlighted at a unique international conference taking place in Wellington this week.

The conference, Trade, intellectual property and the knowledge assets of indigenous peoples: the developmental frontier will explore the links between trade, intellectual property, traditional knowledge assets and the development aspirations of indigenous people.

The New Zealand Centre of International Economic Law (NZCIEL) at Victoria University’s Faculty of Law is hosting the conference together with co-organiser the Australian National University.

Keynote speaker Antony Taubman is currently Director of the Intellectual Property Division of WTO, with responsibility for programmes on intellectual property and genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore, the life sciences and related global issues.

Director of NZCIEL and Professor of Law at Victoria University, Susy Frankel, says: “Knowledge assets have come to play an increasingly important role in global, regional and national markets. For indigenous people, their traditional knowledge is a unique and multidimensional asset. If developmental possibilities are to be realised, new institutional and governance approaches will have to evolve that are responsive to the needs and preferences of indigenous peoples.

“This conference brings together international experts in this field and provides an opportunity for the various parties to talk with each other. So those steeped in indigenous knowledge can discuss legal and business matters. There will be a particular focus on New Zealand, the Pacific Islands and Australia.”

The aim of the conference is to share knowledge, ideas and experience of how markets and trade affect indigenous peoples and ways in which indigenous peoples might harness economic opportunities to benefit and support their unique heritage of knowledge.

Date: 8-10 December 2010 Time: 8.30am-5.00pm Venue: Rutherford House Address: 23 Lambton Quay (northern end)
