MEDIA RELEASE 23 July 2003

  
A View To Tattoo

The traditional art of Polynesian tattooing will be on show in several short films to screen in Porirua and Wellington in August to complement the Tatau/Tattoo Conference at Victoria University.

Four specialist videos focusing on this ancient and fascinating art form will be screened in unique pairings. Each will be followed by an opportunity for questions and discussion, chaired by Teresia Teaiwa, Senior Lecturer in Pacific Studies, and Paul Millar, Senior Lecturer in English

Resurgence in the traditional arts of Polynesian tattooing has been the inspiration for the conference, Tatau/Tattoo: Embodied Art and Cultural Exchange, c.1760-2000, to be held following the screenings from August 21-23.
