Victoria marks Māori Queen’s death

Victoria University is flying the New Zealand flag at half-mast as a mark of respect for Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu.

Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor David Mackay, says the University community is deeply saddened to learn of Dame Te Atairangikaahu’s death.

“Victoria University’s respect and admiration for Dame Te Atairangikaahu was formally recognised in September 1999 when she was presented with a Doctor of Laws degree (Honoris Causa).

“On behalf of the University I’d like to extend our condolences and sympathies to Dame Te Atairangikaahu’s whānau and friends and all those who benefited from her gentle leadership.”
