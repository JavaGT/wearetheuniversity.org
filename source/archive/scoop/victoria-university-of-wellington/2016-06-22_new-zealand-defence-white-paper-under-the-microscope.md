New Zealand Defence White Paper under the microscope

**New Zealand Defence White Paper under the microscope**

Victoria University of Wellington’s Centre for Strategic Studies (CSS) and the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs are hosting a one-day symposium to examine the 2016 New Zealand Defence White Paper.

The Defence White Paper sets out the Government’s defence policy and commits to spending $20 billion on the New Zealand Defence Force over the next fifteen years.

This symposium will bring together academics and experts from across the country and Australia to tackle questions around New Zealand’s security interests in the Pacific, East Asia and Southern Ocean areas, what threats New Zealand faces, who New Zealand will work with to respond to emerging security challenges and the kind of capabilities the New Zealand Government investment could buy.

Victoria Professor of Strategic Studies Robert Ayson says the event is important because "with big decisions on the Government’s future defence capabilities fast approaching, sustained public debate about New Zealand's strategic options is needed more than ever.”

CSS Director AProf David Capie says there is an excellent line-up of speakers for the event including academics from Victoria, Canterbury, Massey and Otago universities. It will open with a discussion of the White Paper from Ministry of Defence Deputy Secretary Tony Lynch and Vice-Chief of the New Zealand Defence Force Kevin Short and will also feature Dr Mark Thomson from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute – an international expert on defence economics.
