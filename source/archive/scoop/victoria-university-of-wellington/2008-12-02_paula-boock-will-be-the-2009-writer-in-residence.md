Paula Boock will be the 2009 Writer in Residence
================================================

Novelist and screen writer Paula Boock will be the 2009 Writer in Residence at Victoria’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).

Ms Boock has worked as an author, publisher and screen writer. Her books have been published in Australia, the UK and USA, and the television drama series she has written for have screened in numerous countries.

Over the last eight years she has worked on a range of television drama projects, and recently formed Lippy Pictures with Donna Malane to produce their television feature film ‘Until Proven Innocent’ and a 13-part children’s time travelling series for TVNZ.

During her residency, Ms Boock intends to return to the page. She plans to complete a novel for adults set in Dunedin in 1929-30.

Director of the IIML, Professor Bill Manhire, says he is delighted the 2009 residency is going to such a multi-talented writer. “We’re delighted that someone with such a range of industry experience – in publishing as well as for the screen – will be joining us,” he says. “But we’re especially excited by the prospect of Paula’s new novel.”

Ms Boock says: “Screenwriting has been my focus for the past eight years by both choice and circumstance, but I’ve increasingly longed for the time to write a novel again. The residency gives me that opportunity as well as the company and support of the unique environment of the IIML. The prospect is exciting and rather terrifying, which I consider the ideal state for productivity.”

Ms Boock is the author of five successful young adult novels including ‘Out Walked Mel’ and ‘Dare Truth or Promise’. ‘Dare Truth or Promise’ not only won the NZ Post Children’s Book of the Year, but was also a finalist for the USA Lambda Award. She is also the author of a book-length essay, ‘On Make-up and  
Her television credits include ‘The Insiders Guide to Love’, ‘bro’Town’, and ‘The Strip’. She won the 2003 AFTA Best Drama Script award for ‘The Strip’ and has several times been a finalist for national Best Script awards.

Previous Writers in Residence at Victoria include Patricia Grace, Maurice Gee, Elizabeth Knox, David Geary, Michael King, Witi Ihimaera, Dave Armstrong, Barbara Anderson and Alistair Te Ariki Campbell.

This position is jointly funded by Victoria University of Wellington and Creative New Zealand.
