**Te reo Māori now part of online sign language dictionary**

Deaf New Zealanders now have access to te reo vocabulary in the Online Dictionary of New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL), thanks to Victoria University’s Deaf Studies Research Unit.

Dr Rachel McKee, Director of Deaf Studies at Victoria and one of the dictionary editors, says the online dictionary is one of the first in the world to feature three languages.  
“To have English, Māori and sign language alongside each other in an online dictionary is quite an advance. Te reo Māori and sign language are official languages of New Zealand, so we are pleased to have been able to bring them together in the dictionary,” says Dr McKee.

The Online Dictionary of NZSL was launched in 2011, and features 4,500 signs alongside English language definitions. Work on including a te reo translation for each entry started in early 2012, and was recently completed.

Dr McKee says the work was funded by Mā te Reo, through the Māori Language Commission, which also checked the translations. A professional Māori translator was employed to provide te reo translation of dictionary entries.

“This is a fantastic resource for all Deaf New Zealanders who want to access Māori vocabulary, as well as for hearing speakers of te reo who want to learn NZSL. Feedback also suggests it will prove useful to Deaf students, their whānau and teachers at Kura Kaupapa or Māori language immersion schools who can now find NZSL examples that correspond with Māori vocabulary.”

Dr McKee says the addition of Māori to the online dictionary is especially welcomed by Māori Deaf people who form a large proportion of the NZSL community, and identify with both Deaf and Māori cultures.

The revised Online Dictionary of NZSL is being launched by the Māori Language Commission Chief Executive, Glenis Philip-Barbara, as part of New Zealand Sign Language Week which runs from 13-19 May.
