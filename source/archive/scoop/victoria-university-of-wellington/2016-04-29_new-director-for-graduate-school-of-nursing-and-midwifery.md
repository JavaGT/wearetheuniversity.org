New Director for Graduate School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health

Dr Kathryn Holloway has been appointed as the new Director of the Graduate School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health at Victoria University of Wellington.

Dr Holloway has been the Dean of the Faculty of Health at Whitireia New Zealand since 2012.

She holds a number of professional roles, which include being a member of the Nursing Council of New Zealand and a member of the expert advisory group to the Minister of Health for the New Zealand Health Strategy Refresh.

In 2014 she represented New Zealand as a nurse leader at a Global Symposium of Advanced Nursing Practice held in the United States.

Dr Holloway, who starts her new role on 4 July, says she is looking forward to using her leadership to contribute to the important work of the Graduate School and the wider University community.

Professor Jennifer Windsor, Victoria University’s Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, announced the appointment and also acknowledged Dr Kathy Nelson as Acting Head of School over the preceding months.

“We will be delighted to welcome Dr Holloway to Victoria University in July. She brings a wealth of expertise and collaborative experiences to foster health and wellbeing in New Zealand communities. We’re privileged to have Kathryn join us.”
