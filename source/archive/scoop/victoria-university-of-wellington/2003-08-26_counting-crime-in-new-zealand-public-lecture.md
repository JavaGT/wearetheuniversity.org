Counting Crime in New Zealand – Public Lecture

Many people assume crime can be counted in much the same way as inches of rainfall or annual births and deaths.

On 3 September, Trevor Bradley - a Lecturer in Criminology at Victoria University - will give a public lecture addressing the very real limitations of our current systems of measuring and counting crime.

“Police statistics are presented and accepted as a reliable and accurate, if somewhat disturbing revelation of the nature and extent of crime committed in New Zealand each year,” he says.

“These statistics are also presented and accepted as a reliable guide to changes in ‘crime rates’ and ‘crime trends’ over time.”

The lecture is aimed at the ‘lay’ public and will provide a much clearer understanding of the processes by which official counts of crime are constructed and provide the tools to read and interpret what the official statistics on crime actually reveal.

Wednesday 3 September, 7pm-9pm  
Lecture Theatre 1, Government Buildings, Lambton Quay, VUW – City  
Fee: $25 ($22)
