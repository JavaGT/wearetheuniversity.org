Victoria's Distinguished Alumni Awards announced

A long-serving high school principal, a lawyer and arts patron, a business leader, a leading scientist, a former Silver Ferns captain, and an internationally renowned humanitarian are the six winners of Victoria University of Wellington's annual Distinguished Alumni Awards.

After a call for nominations earlier this year, Janice Campbell, Dr Robin Congreve, Theresa Gattung, Dr Harry Keys, Bernice Mene, and Ross Mountain were selected to receive the awards.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh said that the awards were inaugurated last year to honour Victoria alumni who show notable achievement in their chosen field.

“Victoria endeavours to instil its graduates with leadership, creative and critical thinking, and communication skills.

\"These six graduates have gone on from their studies at the University to excel in their vastly diverse disciplines and careers. We are delighted to have the opportunity to recognise the valuable contributions they have made in their community, country and internationally."

“The University is proud to recognise these alumni and their achievements.”

The six will be presented with their awards later this year at the Annual Alumni Dinner, a black-tie event held at the Wellington Town Hall on 11 October, principally sponsored by the Wellington City Council and the Dominion Post. Distinguished Alumni Awards are made each year at the dinner.

The following synopses provide a brief insight into the achievements of the six Distinguished Alumni Award winners.
