**New accommodation complex for Victoria students**

Victoria University of Wellington has entered into an agreement for a new hall of residence on The Terrace.

An office block, at 175 The Terrace, is owned by Maurice Clark of Cheops Holdings, and will soon be refurbished by McKee-Fehl Constructors into a state-of-the-art student accommodation complex. Victoria University will lease the premises.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says the development is a welcome addition to Victoria’s suite of accommodation options.

“Students coming to Victoria University from throughout the country and overseas are looking for quality accommodation. Alongside the recent introduction of Boulcott Street Hall and Joan Stevens Hall on the Terrace, we are ensuring this need continues to be met,” says Professor Walsh.

The yet-to-be-named 390 bed accommodation will be a fully catered hall, serving primarily domestic first-year students, and will be open for the 2015 academic year.

Students will be able to apply for the hall online later this year.
