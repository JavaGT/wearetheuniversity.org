=========================================

**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

The Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Massey University, Professor Stuart McCutcheon, has been appointed to the position of Vice-Chancellor at Victoria University, Chancellor Russell Marshall announced today.

Professor McCutcheon and Professor Neil Quigley, Victoria’s Dean of Commerce and Administration, were the final two candidates short-listed from a field of 47 applicants.

The Victoria University Council reached its decision following a special meeting yesterday afternoon (15 August). The Council meeting followed a series of presentations by the two candidates and a formal interview process.

Chancellor Russell Marshall says the international search for and recruitment of a new Vice-Chancellor has been a rigorous and comprehensive exercise and he is very pleased with the outcome.

"The University community has been appraised of our progress every step of the way and feedback sought from them," he says.

"Professor McCutcheon has an outstanding record as a university teacher and researcher as well as in his administrative roles as Assistant Vice-Chancellor Research and Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Massey.

"I trust the news of Professor McCutcheon’s appointment will be welcomed by staff, students and the wider Wellington community.

"Professor McCutcheon will play a prominent role at a time when, perhaps more than ever, the University requires strong leadership and strategies to ensure Victoria retains its high academic reputation and remains a vibrant and stimulating place for people to work and study.

"I look forward to welcoming Professor McCutcheon back to his home city and to working with him," says Mr Marshall.

Professor McCutcheon will take up the role of Vice-Chancellor later this year. Until such time, Professor Roy Sharp will remain as the Acting Vice-Chancellor - a position he has held since January 2000.
