**Victoria launches Master of Professional Accounting**

Victoria University is the first university in New Zealand to offer a Master of Professional Accounting degree (MPA)—which is being officially launched this evening.

“There is a shortage of accounting graduates, both in New Zealand and internationally,” says MPA Director Christopher Cripps from Victoria ’s School of Accounting and Commercial Law.

“Our new Master’s programme fills this gap—and what’s more it welcomes graduates from any discipline, which is ideal for professional people seeking a career change.”

The MPA provides students with the skills and understanding required of accounting professionals, and will provide the opportunity to pursue membership of the New Zealand and international accounting bodies.

“Our academic staff are leaders in the public and private sectors, and with their first-hand knowledge of the industry will equip graduates for leadership roles in the profession,” says Mr Cripps.

Students can study full-time over four trimesters in as little as 16 months, or part-time if desired. There are two intakes each year, November and February/March. Enrolments for the November intake are open now.

The degree will be launched at 5:30 pm this evening on the Mezzanine Floor of Rutherford House, 23 Lambton Quay. To register your attendance, please RSVP to vanessa.borg@vuw.ac.nz or phone (04) 463 5550.
