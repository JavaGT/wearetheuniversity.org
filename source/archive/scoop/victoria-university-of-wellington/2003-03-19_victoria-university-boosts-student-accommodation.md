Victoria University boosts student accommodation
================================================

**Wednesday, 19 March 2003, 4:33 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Three hundred students have found a new "home away from home" in Victoria University's newest hall of residence developed in an innovative private-public partnership.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon will open Stafford House, on The Terrace, tomorrow (March 20) at 4pm when guests will get to tour the students' new central city home.

The latest hall of residence is a partnership between Taradale Investments, which redeveloped the former home of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and then on-sold apartments to private investors.

Professor McCutcheon said the partnership was a classic example of the public and private sectors working together.

"Victoria University focuses on nurturing innovative research and producing top quality graduates. While we have successfully operated halls of residence for more than 70 years, we need to apply our limited capital funding to developing further services and learning facilities for students and staff. We are delighted that the private sector is able to fund the refurbishment of this much-needed accommodation building.

"The relationship with Taradale Investments and Stafford Houses Leases Limited, which manages the building, is a win-win for everyone. Victoria gets student accommodation provided to rigorous standards, students get good quality apartments at a reasonable price and investors get a return on their investment. Victoria is keen to develop similar partnerships with other developers and investors."

Ruth Moorhouse, Director of Student Services at Victoria, said the 301 beds in Stafford House would boost Victoria's student accommodation to 1887 beds. About half of the students living in the building are New Zealand students with the rest from overseas. About a third are first-year students with the rest being undergraduate or postgraduate students.

"There are many benefits to living in a hall of residence. Halls provide security, personal, social and academic support in an environment conducive to learning. Many students in the halls make friends that last a lifetime."

Students pay $130 per room per week plus the cost of electricity and phone. Stafford House has 105 self-contained fully furnished two and three bedroom units.

Victoria enrolled a record 16,624 students in 2002, compared with 15,286 in 2001 and 13,999 in 2000.
