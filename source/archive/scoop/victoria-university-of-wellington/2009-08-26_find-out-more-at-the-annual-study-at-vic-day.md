**Find out more at the annual ‘Study at Vic’ day**

Over 3,500 prospective students from throughout New Zealand will visit Victoria University’s Kelburn campus this week.

On Friday 28 August from 8.30am, students, whānau and teachers will spend the day finding out what Victoria has to offer.

“The ‘Study at Vic’ day is a great opportunity for prospective students to come and sample life at our capital city university,” says Susan Harper, director of Student Recruitment and Course Advice at Victoria University.

“We hold it every year and it always proves to be a popular and worthwhile experience for prospective students from around the country.”

“Visitors will have the opportunity to talk to staff and current students, look around the facilities on offer and attend information sessions to get an insight into first-year study options,” she says.

The Kelburn campus will be the base of the day’s activities with more than 65 information sessions as well as displays and competitions.

There will be tours of all four campuses throughout the day:

• Kelburn campus (Faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences, Science and Engineering)  
• Pipitea campus (Faculties of Commerce and Administration and Law  
• Karori campus (College of Education)  
• Te Aro campus (Faculty of Architecture and Design)

  
There will also be tours of the halls of residence. Free buses will run between the campuses all day.
