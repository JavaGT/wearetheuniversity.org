Victoria signs Argentinean exchange agreement

Victoria University today signed an exchange agreement with Pontifica Universidad Católica Argentina, marking the first exchange agreement between Victoria and an Argentinean tertiary institution.

Victoria’s Pro Vice-Chancellor (International) Professor Roberto Rabel and Universidad Católica Argentina Dean for International Affairs, Carlos Ezcurra, signed the agreement, giving students from both universities a chance to further their studies in a different environment.

Professor Rabel says the exchange is a big step forward for Victoria and Universidad Católica Argentina.

“As well as offering students the chance to study overseas, they have the added benefit of experiencing New Zealand and Argentinean cultures.

“This new agreement is also an opportunity for Victoria University to further strengthen its portfolio of exchange partners in Latin America.”
