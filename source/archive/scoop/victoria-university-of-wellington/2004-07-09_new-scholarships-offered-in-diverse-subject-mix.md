New scholarships offered in diverse mix of subjects

Victoria University is boosting postgraduate research by investing more than $120,000 a year in new strategic research scholarships.

Applications are now open for the Vice-Chancellor’s Strategic Research Scholarships that cover a diverse mix of topics, including bacteria in Antarctic sea ice, family dynamics in stepfamilies, and digital media in New Zealand.

The six scholarships, worth $20,000 per annum and a fees waiver for domestic students, are open for applications from postgraduate students until 16 August.

Funding for the strategic research scholarships has come from the Government’s Performance-Based Research Fund, in which Victoria was recognised as one of the top three research-led universities in New Zealand.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon says a major aim of the scholarships is to continue to strengthen and improve Victoria’s research status.

“A culture of research, and teaching that is informed by it, is at the heart of what makes universities special.

“Some of the scholarship topics we have selected are in research areas we are already very strong in, such as chemistry, so we want to ensure we continue to attract and retain top researchers.

“Secondly, we want to draw students to subject areas that we are currently developing at Victoria, in order to maintain competitiveness in a diverse mix of areas.”

Six candidates will be chosen from applications in the following 16 scholarship topics: Public Law or Public Legal Policy (Law) Identity, Acculturation and Adaptation (Psychology) Total Synthesis of Bioactive Natural Products and their Analogues (Chemistry) Machine Learning (Computer Science) The Role of Bacteria in Antarctic Sea Ice (Biology) Deep-seated Processes near the Alpine Fault (Geology) Conflict over the Development of Natural Resources in the South Pacific (Development Studies) Work, Organisations and Management in the Creative Sector (Management) Family Dynamics in Stepfamilies (Family Policy) The Capital Market Reaction to Mandated Continuous Disclosures by Listed Companies (Accounting) National Art Collections (Art History) Practice Development and Clinical Research in Nursing or Midwifery (Nursing and Midwifery) The Literature of the Pacific Diaspora in New Zealand (New Zealand Studies) Digital Media in New Zealand (Media Studies) Human Rights and Political Theory (Political Science and International Relations) Militant Popular Protestantism in the ‘British World’ (History)
