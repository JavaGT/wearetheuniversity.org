Turbine seeks fresh energy in 2007

The online literary journal Turbine (www.vuw.ac.nz/turbine) is powering up for 2007. The International Institute of Modern Letters at Victoria University is now calling for submissions for the 2007 edition of the journal, which will be launched in December this year.

New fiction, poetry and creative non-fiction are what Turbine runs on. Edited by poet Chris Price, with assistance from students of Creative Writing at the Institute, the journal will continue to present new work by writers associated with the Institute, as well as by the wider New Zealand writing community. Turbine complements established print journals as a fresh way for writers to publish, and aims to reach a diverse local and international audience.

Writers who have appeared in recent issues range from the established (such as former poets laureate Jenny Bornholdt and Elizabeth Smither) to the emerging (including the winners of the recently announced Montana New Zealand Best First Book Awards for fiction and poetry, Rachael King and Airini Beautrais). Turbine also serves to introduce writers who have yet to publish their first books - Mary McCallum’s just-released novel The Blue, for example, was previewed in Turbine in 2006.

Turbine is one of the first places to publish work emerging from the International Institute of Modern Letters, Victoria University’s creative writing engine room, and it offers a look inside the renowned workshops through excerpts from students’ reading journals. But it’s not a closed shop – submissions are accepted from writers throughout New Zealand.

“Turbine began life as in-house journal,” says Professor Bill Manhire, Director of the Institute, “but in the last few years it has become a major literary venue. It’s now one of the first places you go if you want to know what the best New Zealand writers are up to.”

“The other great thing is that it is read right around the planet. The world is suddenly interested in our writers, and Turbine has become a first-choice source for information.”

Submissions of poetry, creative non-fiction and short fiction are encouraged by 23 October 2007. Photographs or other images with literary themes may also be considered.  
For submission guidelines, or to view previous issues, please refer to www.vuw.ac.nz/turbine or email turbine\[at\]vuw.ac.nz.
