Student scholarships support Māori research

Twelve Victoria University students engaged in Māori-related research have secured grants for ongoing study through the Tū Horomata Scholarship scheme.

Six students received a full Tū Horomata scholarship, sharing $75,000 for postgraduate Masters study, while another six shared $30,000 to study at honours or other postgraduate levels.

Announcing the scholarship recipients, Pro Vice-Chancellor (Māori), Professor Piri Sciascia, says scholarship nominations were received from all University faculties.

“The Tū Horomata targeted scholarships are for emerging researchers engaged in topics of relevance to Māori. Tū Horomata translates to pure or excellent - words that describe the intent and desired outcomes of these scholarships,” he says.

“Funding for the scholarships has been derived from the Tertiary Education Commission’s Māori and Pacific Peoples Special Supplementary Grant, designed to help retain and up skill Māori students.”

Professor Sciascia says the scholarships will strategically develop Māori research capacity and acknowledge and support students engaged in kaupapa Māori postgraduate research at Victoria.

The following students were each awarded a full $12,500 Tū Horomata Scholarship.

\- Dianne Parsonage (Commerce and Administration)
