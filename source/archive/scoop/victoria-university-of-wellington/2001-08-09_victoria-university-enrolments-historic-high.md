Victoria University Enrolments Historic High
============================================

Continuing its record number of enrolments recorded earlier this year, Victoria University has enrolled over 1000 more students than at the same time last year. “Our latest projections show that we will be a University of 15,000 students by year end,” said Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon.

“The positive atmosphere amongst both staff and students, the range of exciting course options and the calibre of our academic programmes have all influenced student recruitment favourably,” said Professor McCutcheon.

At the beginning of the second trimester last year, there were 13,522 students, and this year the number is 14,545 (7.5 percent increase). Enrolments are taken all year and the final numbers of students will continue to increase throughout August and again in the Summer School programmes.

Because the total number of students has an effect on the amount of Government funding received, Professor McCutcheon said that the University’s revenue would increase.

“Our enrolments this year are higher than expected resulting in a five percent increase in funding. At the same time we have continued rigorous expenditure control. The net effect is we are now projecting a surplus approaching $3 million,” he said.

“This is great news and should give the entire University community the confidence we need to embark on the implementation of our new Strategic Plan. “

Professor McCutcheon said that a large part of the increase in student numbers has been due to the increase in international students. “We are also aware that the new courses we are offering, such as in design and e-commerce and IT, have had an effect on domestic enrolments. “

The more secure financial position has enabled Victoria University to establish a substantially enhanced University Research Fund. “Investments such as this will continue to assist us in maintaining our international standard for quality teaching and research.”
