Victoria makes new Biomedical Science appointment
=================================================

Victoria University has appointed Dr Paul Teesdale-Spittle as a Senior Lecturer in Pharmacology. Dr Teesdale-Spittle will join Victoria’s School of Biomedical Sciences in July, where he will help teach the new degree programme in Biomedical Science.

Dr Teesdale-Spittle comes to Victoria from De Montford University, Leicester, where he has attracted numerous research grants through his research into cancer and parasite therapy.

Dr John Andrews, Head of the School of Biological Sciences, says Dr Teesdale-Spittle’s work with colleagues in Leicester and Aberystwyth may lead to the development of novel drugs for the treatment of parasite infection.

“His projects also include the development of drugs to selectively inhibit the processing of DNA within cancer cells, and in particular harnessing the conditions of low oxygen availability within regions of solid tumors that are difficult to treat by conventional therapy,” says Dr Andrews.

Dr Teesdale-Spittle has also co-authored a book on biological chemistry, which will be published in October.

He has a BSc (Hons) and PhD from the University of Nottingham, and has spent the last ten years at De Montford University.

There are about 10 academic staff at Victoria University's School of Biological Sciences who teach and conduct research in areas of biomedical science. Current areas of research cover topics such as alcoholism, biochemical toxicology, enzymology, hormone action, ion transport, liver disease, the molecular biology of inherited disease, molecular diagnosis and parasitology.

Victoria offered the Bachelor of Biomedical Science degree for the first time this year.
