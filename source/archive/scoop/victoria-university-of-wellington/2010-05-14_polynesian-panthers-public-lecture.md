**Polynesian Panthers Public Lecture**

Victoria University of Wellington

5.30pm - 6.30pm Friday 14 May 2010

The Polynesian Panther Movement was founded in inner city Auckland in 1971 by a group of Pacific Islanders and a few Maori. The Polynesian Panthers challenged discriminatory practices in issue areas such as unequal pay, unsatisfactory working and housing conditions, education, police harassment, legal rights and prison visits for families. At the time many Pacific Island youth were supporters of Maori political initiatives such as the Land March and Bastion Point occupation and gained skills in political lobbying which they used to raise the profile of Pacific peoples. We are extremely fortunate to have three central figures from the Polynesian Panthers come to speak at Victoria. Will Ilolahia, Tigilau Ness and Miriama Rauhihi-Ness will shed light on the movement, what it set out to challenge, what it sought to achieve, and how it contributed to changing the society that we now live in.

Presented by: Te Kawa a Maui, Va'aomana; Pasifika, Te Kura Maori, Political Science and International Relations Supported by: Victoria International Leadership Programme
