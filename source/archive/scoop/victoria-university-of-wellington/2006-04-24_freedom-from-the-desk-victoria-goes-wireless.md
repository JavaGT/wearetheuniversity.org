Freedom from the desk – Victoria goes wireless

Students studying at Victoria University can break free from their desks thanks to the University’s new WirelessVic network.

Announced today, the completion of the WirelessVic network on the Kelburn, Karori, Pipitea and Te Aro campuses means students and staff with suitable laptops that have an appropriate wireless card will no longer have to plug them into the wall to connect to the Internet.

Throughout all four campuses in Wellington, 189 “hot spots” have been marked with stickers identifying them as wireless areas.

Pro Vice-Chancellor (Information Technology), Professor Warwick Clegg, says the implementation of WirelessVic is part of the University’s IT strategy.

“The new network means staff and students will no longer have to be tied to a desk to be connected to the University’s computer systems while on campus. They’ll be able to access files, the internet and email from many popular locations and collaborate over a coffee at one of our cafes or catch up on the news before a lecture.

“We aim to achieve distinction as New Zealand’s highest quality teaching, research and learning university and if we’re going to achieve that we have to invest in the supporting infrastructure. In addition to the wireless network, we’ve recently completed a $1.7 million upgrade of our server room and we’re investing heavily in new resources for the library.”

Alan Dempster, Director of Information Technology Services, says for a laptop to connect to the network, the device will have to meet minimum technical requirements.

“Because not all laptops will be suitable to connect to the network, our Information Technology Services has set up a website to explain how to connect, the minimum technical requirements and where the hot spots are located.”

Victoria University has been developing its wireless capability since an experimental wireless network provided by Interface, the student computer science club, was set up in June 2003.
