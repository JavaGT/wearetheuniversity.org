**Employers need focus on capability**

Employers need a focus on human capability to ensure their workers are happy and their organisation is productive long term, according to Victoria University research.

Researcher Dr Bryson says that other than legal compliance, there is currently no accepted set of principles guiding employers.

“Management and Human Resource Management practices are largely buffeted along on the tide of ‘best practice’, personal beliefs, or meeting the demands of a business strategy, where the needs of business survival and shareholder prosperity often outweigh other considerations.

“Hence, good managers and supervisors sometimes find themselves in the situation of being ‘custodians of bad practice’.”

Dr Bryson led part of a team which conducted a five-year research project, funded by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology and hosted in the Industrial Relations Centre at Victoria Management School, exploring the conditions that are required to develop optimal human capability in the workplace.

“Human contributions to society are not solely through work, and organisational contributions to society are not solely economic,” says Jane.

“Workers aspire to live lives they have reason to value, that is to be capable humans—not just skill sets for the workplace.”

One component of Dr Bryson’s study involved more than 200 interviews carried out across 30 organisations, which asked participants about the drivers and barriers to being able to develop capability in the workforce.

Results indicated that to develop human capability it was more advantageous to be in a permanent job, which offered more stability and a willingness of employers to invest in development opportunities. It was also more advantageous for organisations to take a long-term view rather than prioritising short-term gain.

“One of the interesting things we found going into factories were those that had, say, invested in literacy and numeracy training for their staff were actually getting much more loyalty and productivity from their staff—so, even though on the face of it these staff are easily replaceable, it still makes sense to invest in their development.”

Dr Bryson’s research includes recommendations on important considerations when designing jobs and work processes to provide good quality jobs and experiences. It also advocates enabling workers to take part in decision making, and creating a workplace environment which encourages development.

A framework for examining the institutional and social structures within and around the workplace was also created, in order to determine whether they facilitate or constrain individuals from achieving their potential. Jane hopes this will stimulate discussion between parties with different interests, particularly unions and employers.

“Through the provision of good quality jobs and work environments, organisations can improve upon their role as capability enhancing institutions in society.”

Dr Bryson is the editor of a book due out in June Beyond Skill: Institutions, Organisations and Individuals, published by Palgrave Macmillan, which features two chapters on her research. The book brings together chapters from a unique combination of leading workplace researchers in New Zealand, Australia and the UK, exploring the conditions that are required to develop optimal human capability in the workplace.
