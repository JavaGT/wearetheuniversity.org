**Hundreds gather in Wellington for Asia-Pacific Model United Nations**

Victoria University will host nearly 400 tertiary students from across Australia, New Zealand and the wider Asia-Pacific region for the 19th Asia-Pacific Model United Nations Conference next week.

This year’s conference takes place from 7-12 July, and is being held in New Zealand for just the second occasion in its history.

The theme for the event is ‘Breaking Barriers’ which will focus on the rapid change taking place across the world, and subsequent breakdown of traditional cultural, gender and technological barriers.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh will welcome students on Sunday evening and they will also hear keynote speeches from John Allen, Chief Executive and of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and former New Zealand Prime Minister, the Hon Sir Geoffrey Palmer.

The 2013 Asia-Pacific Model United Nations Conference (AMUNC) is hosted by Victoria University, in partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the British High Commission, the American Embassy, Wellington City Council, the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, UNICEF New Zealand and the Asia New Zealand Foundation.
