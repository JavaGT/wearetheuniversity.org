**New Writer in Residence for Victoria University**

Victoria University’s 2013 Writer in Residence is well-known New Zealand author Carl Shuker.

Carl completed a Master of Arts at Victoria’s International Institute of Modern Letters in 2001. Since then, he has published two novels: _The Method Actors_ and _The Lazy Boys,_ with _The Method Actors_ winning the 2006 Prize in Modern Letters.

Last year Carl published _Three Novellas for a Novel_, a collection of three novellas, and his new novel _Anti Lebanon_ will come out in the new year.

Damien Wilkins, who will next year replace Professor Bill Manhire as the Director of the International Institute of Modern Letters, is excited about the appointment.

“Carl is one of the most ambitious and adventurous novelists we have. His fearlessness will be a powerful force for our students next year.”

During his time as Writer in Residence, Carl will be focusing on an as-yet untitled new novel, and potentially, a screenplay.

Carl has lived in London since 2006, where he writes, teaches creative writing and works as a freelance editor at the British Medical Journal. He will be moving from London to Wellington with his wife—poet and academic Anna Smaill—and their young daughter, and will take up the position in January.
