Ageing in New Zealand

The ageing workforce, elder care and the living standards of older people are some of the issues to be discussed at a major conference next week, jointly sponsored by Victoria University’s New Zealand Institute for Research on Ageing.

The conference, held on Monday 13 November at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa also marks the 25th anniversary of the New Zealand Association of Gerontology.

Institute Director, Associate Professor Judith Davey, says the conference marks a significant milestone in promoting understanding of research on ageing and its policy implications.

“It will be an opportunity for participants to explore ideas, hear the latest research advances, and to meet others and share experiences.”

Sixteen papers will be presented from a wide range of topics and perspectives related to ageing, including discussions on older workers, elder care and the physical and material wellbeing of older people. There will also be a panel session considering how research and policy can work together to address the challenges of population ageing.

Professor Hal Kendig, of the University of Sydney, will be the keynote speaker.

The Minister for Social Development and Employment, Hon David Benson-Pope, will address the conference at 3.30pm.

The conference will be attended by researchers, policy analysts and advisors, those working in the health sector, and members of the public.
