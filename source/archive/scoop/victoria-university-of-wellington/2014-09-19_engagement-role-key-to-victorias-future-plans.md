**Engagement role key to Victoria’s future plans**

Victoria University of Wellington’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford is delighted to announce the appointment of a new Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Engagement) whose role will be focused on increasing engagement with the University’s communities.

Professor Frazer Allan will take up the role in early 2015. He is currently the head of the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences at Massey University and prior to this, he was the Director of Massey’s Veterinary Teaching Hospital.

“This position is central to the University achieving its ambitious goal of becoming a world leading capital city university and one of the great global-civic universities,” says Professor Guilford.

“Victoria is focused on increasing engagement with our communities of interest and doubling the size of our student population in the next 20 to 30 years, and this role has an important part to play in achieving those goals.”

Professor Allan says he is looking forward to being part of a leadership team that has such clear goals for the future. “Victoria is a quality institution that is looking to cement its place as a globally engaged capital city university and I am very excited to be part of that.”

The office of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Engagement) will have responsibilities spanning alumni and development, communications and marketing, relationship management, Victoria University Press, Adam Art Gallery and the Centre for Lifelong Learning.
