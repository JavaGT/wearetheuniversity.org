Victoria University of Wellington in association with Ericsson Communications Ltd has announced a world-wide search for an innovative and distinguished academic specialist in the field of Communications and Global technology to take up the recently created Ericsson Chair of Communications.

The university signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ericsson in December for sponsorship of the new Chair. The agreement also provides for a generous prize for a top student in the graduate Master of Communications programme and the development of co-operative research into the impact of communications technologies on New Zealand society.

"We are delighted to align ourselves with a leading company in the telecommunications industry and look forward to a very productive relationship with Ericsson that we hope will result in some exciting projects" commented owena Cullen, Head of the School of Communications and Information Management at Victoria.

The agreement includes provision for Ericsson to collaborate on research undertaken by the Professor and students and to promote research into wireless internet communications.

Ericsson’s Managing Director in New Zealand, Goran Olsson, says Ericsson is providing a practical contribution to the communications and information technology industries by contributing to the education of high quality graduates in the field.

"Funding this new position allows us to promote excellence in teaching and research in the area of Communications. This will strengthen the pool of skilled professionals in the field," Mr Olsson says.

Ms Cullen says, "In the meantime we are looking forward to the search which will be a high profile exercise that strengthens contacts with leading professionals around the world and gives a great deal of publicity to Victoria University and to our sponsors Ericsson Communications in an international arena."
