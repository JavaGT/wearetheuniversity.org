Hawaiian architecture students visit Victoria
=============================================

**Friday, 20 June 2003, 9:32 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Eleven architecture students and a staff member from the University of Hawai’i at Manoa will visit Victoria University’s School of Architecture next week in a first for the two universities.

Lecturer in the School of Architecture, Robin Skinner, says the students will participate in a programme between 23 June - 4 July, focusing on Maori and Pacific architecture and culture, including an introduction to bicultural issues in Aotearoa/ New Zealand.

Mr Skinner says the visit starts with a powhiri at Te Herenga Waka Marae and includes a series of talks, Wellington-based activities, visits to marae and historic Maori sites, and study of traditional and contemporary Maori architecture in the lower North Island.

“The visit culminates in a collaborative design project by the Hawaiian and Victoria students and Ngati Toa – extensions to the existing Health Centre at Takapuwahia Marae.

“The final event will see a formal presentation of the design project to Ngati Toa,” he says.

Matariki events will be added to widen the learning experience of participants and increase their appreciation of te reo, tikanga and matauranga Maori.

Maori and Pacific students, including student mentors from the Faculty’s Awhina scheme, and other students and staff from Victoria’s Schools of Architecture and Design will be involved.

The joint initiative follows the February visit of a delegation from the University of Hawai’i, led by the University’s President, Dr Evan Dobelle. The exploration of opportunities for further collaboration and benefits to staff and students was central to that visit to Victoria.
