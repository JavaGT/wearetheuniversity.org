**Valuing Nature: The Economy and the Environment**

**9 and 10 July 2013  
Embassy Theatre, Wellington  
www.valuingnature.org.nz**

The New Zealand Government’s Natural Resources Sector and Victoria University of Wellington, in association with the Sustainable Business Council, are convening a conference to build on the momentum of the June 2012 Transit of Venus Forum.

The conference will explore:  
• society’s reliance on the environment  
• how to estimate the value of nature and factor it into our products and services  
• how positive environmental practice can build market opportunities  
• and how countries build natural capital into national accounts  
•  
The programme examines the economics of the environment and biodiversity at all levels of business and government, and offers four additional workshops with keynote speakers to drill down into the practical detail.

There will be four international leaders as keynote speakers and **Kim Hill** will moderate follow-on panels in which New Zealand experts give a local response to each of their presentations:  
**_Pavan Sukhdev_** - Study Leader for the G8+5 commissioned project on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), author of Corporation 20/20, and Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme.

**_Sir Robert Watson_** - Professor of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia, former Chair of the IPCC, Chief Scientist at the World Bank and NASA’s Office of Mission to Planet Earth, Chair of the Global Agricultural Assessment, and many other significant positions.
