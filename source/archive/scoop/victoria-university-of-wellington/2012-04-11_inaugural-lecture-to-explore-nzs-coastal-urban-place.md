Inaugural lecture to explore New Zealand’s coastal urban places

More development on the waterfronts of New Zealand’s coastal towns could boost our economic growth and provide valuable public spaces for recreation, says Victoria University researcher Professor Diane Brand.

Professor Brand, Dean of the Faculty of Architecture and Design, will explore New Zealand’s relationship with the coast and urban development potential in the land-sea edge at her inaugural professorial lecture at Victoria University on Tuesday 17 April.

“All New Zealanders live within 130km of our 18,000km coastline; the majority of our historically significant cities are ports; and we have an extensive exclusive economic zone. We have an opportunity to extend our development in terms of aquaculture or capturing tidal energy in our urban places too.”

To demonstrate the opportunities where land and sea meet, or in the ‘bluespace’, as Professor Brand refers to the concept, she will create analogies between land and sea.

“We often think of the land and sea as divided and separate. Using places we’re all familiar with, I’ll explore opportunities for crossover by demonstrating how a space could look and has looked in the past. Wellington settler John Plimmer, for example, created the innovative Plimmer’s Ark in the late 1800s—he turned a beached boat into a building that connected to Lambton Quay.”

“There are many examples nationally and internationally that exemplify comfortable development in urban zones in a way that balances environmental considerations. My inaugural lecture will showcase how we can extend and develop these bluespace resources.”

Professor Diane Brand is an architect and academic specialising in urban design, urban history and edge cities. She joined Victoria University in 2008 as Deputy Head of the School of Architecture; she now leads the Faculty as Dean.

Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says Victoria’s inaugural lecture series is an opportunity for professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.

“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors,” says Professor Quigley.
