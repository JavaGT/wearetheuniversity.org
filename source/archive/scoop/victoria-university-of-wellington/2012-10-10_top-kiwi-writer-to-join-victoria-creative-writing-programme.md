**Top Kiwi Writer To Join Victoria’s Creative Writing Programme**

One of New Zealand’s most celebrated contemporary writers, Emily Perkins, is joining Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML).

Taking up a sought-after role to teach creative writing to Master’s students, Emily will replace Damien Wilkins, who will head up the IIML when Professor Bill Manhire retires in January next year.

Damien says that the depth Emily will bring to the role is very impressive. “Emily is a supremely gifted communicator, and has an international reputation as a novelist. She is also a wonderful teacher—so this is very exciting for us, and for our students.”

The IIML’s Master of Arts in Creative Writing is very highly regarded, and applications to take part in the programme are received from aspiring writers all over the world. A maximum of 30 students are accepted each year.

Emily says that she feels honoured to be taking up the position. “Wellington has always had a place in my heart, it’s where I began my writing life and I’m really looking forward to joining this community.”

The role of Senior Lecturer attracted a very strong field of applicants. “Jobs like this very rarely come up, and the calibre of people who applied was incredible,” says Damien.

Emily will take up the role in February next year.

Emily Perkins is the author of four novels, including _The Forrests_ and a collection of short stories, _Not Her Real Name_. She will be moving to Wellington from Auckland with her husband and three children.
