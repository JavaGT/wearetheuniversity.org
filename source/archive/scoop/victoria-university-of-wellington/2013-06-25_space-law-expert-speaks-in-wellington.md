Space law expert speaks in Wellington

A leading international expert on space law will discuss issues such as the legality of space exploration and the increasing commercialisation of space when he delivers a lecture at Victoria University on Friday 5 July.

Dr Chris Newman is a Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of Sunderland in the United Kingdom.

Dr Newman, who is regarded as the United Kingdom’s leading legal expert on space law, crafted the country’s first module in space law. It examines issues relating to the legal aspects of exploring space, both in Lower Earth Orbit, the area between 160 and 2,000 kilometres above the Earth’s surface where most human space flights have taken place, and the area beyond 2,000 kilometres.

He is currently researching military exploitation of space and whether existing criminal law can be applied to issues related to space exploration.

Dr Newman has described space as having “no established norms of law”.

“There are laws in place around launching things into space and also their re-entry but nothing for what happens inbetween.”

The lecture, titled Beyond the Final Frontier: Latest developments in Space Law, is free to attend.

Date: Friday 5 July

Time: 12.30pm  
Venue: Victoria University Pipitea Campus, Old Government Building Lecture Theatre 1, 55 Lambton Quay, Wellington
