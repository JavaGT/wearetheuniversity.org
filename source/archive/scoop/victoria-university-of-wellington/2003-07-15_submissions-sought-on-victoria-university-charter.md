Submissions Sought On Victoria University Charter

Victoria University, New Zealand's Capital City University, is seeking public submissions on its draft Charter.

The charter outlines the University's purpose, distinctive character, governance and management, mission, values, major goals and the composition and responsibilities of its Council.

The University, along with all other tertiary education organisations, is required to develop a new Charter in order to remain eligible for Government funding in 2004 and must be submitted to the Tertiary Education Commission by September 30, 2003.

The proposed Charter has been developed using the criteria provided by the Commission. It is based on the University's existing Charter, approved by Council and the Minister of Education in 2001, which in turn informs the University's 10 year Strategic Plan.

As development of the new Charter requires input of the Victoria University community, a Charter Consultation web page has been established at http:// http://www.vuw.ac.nz/home/about\_victoria/charter.html Copies can also be obtained by calling the University's Information Desk on 04 463 5283.

The University has identified a list of more than 60,000 stakeholders in its community to assist in the Charter consultation process from alumni through to state sector organisations.

A public meeting to discuss the proposed Charter will take place on Tuesday July 29 at 12.30pm in the University's Hunter Council Chamber, Hunter Building, Kelburn Parade. Please RSVP to mailto: mailto:info-desk@vuw.ac.nz or call 04 463 5283.

Submissions can be emailed to mailto: mailto:charter-consultation@vuw.ac.nz or posted to PO Box 600, Wellington, by Monday August 4.
