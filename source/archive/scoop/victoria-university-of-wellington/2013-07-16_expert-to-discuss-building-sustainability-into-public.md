**Expert to discuss building sustainability into public landscapes**

Australian architect Perry Lethlean will visit Victoria University next week to deliver a free public lecture on how cities can incorporate sustainable ideas into urban design.

The lecture, titled _Waterfront work and public infrastructure by building sustainability into public landscapes_ will focus on the role of landscape and nature in shaping the form, quality and character of our cities, and will be followed by a question and answer session.

Mr Lethlean’s experience varies from the preparation of large-scale urban design frameworks and master plans, to the detailed design of urban spaces, master planning and design of tertiary institutions and working with Local and State Government agencies.

He has led the successful implementation of complex landscape and urban projects such as the Geelong Waterfront Redevelopment, Forest Gallery at the Melbourne Museum and the Wynyard Quarter in Auckland.

Before the public lecture, Mr Lethlean will present a Masterclass for Master’s students from Victoria’s Faculty of Architecture and Design about waterfront infrastructure and best practice for a liveable city.

His visit is supported by the New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects Education Foundation.
