MEDIA RELEASE

InternetNZ and Victoria welcome second Cyberlaw Fellow

A leading American practitioner in internet law has been appointed New Zealand’s second Senior Research Fellow in Cyberlaw at Victoria University of Wellington’s School of Law.

Philip Greene, who took up the year-long position at the end of January, is the former Senior Counsel for Internet Technology at the United States Department of Commerce, providing intellectual property counsel to the Department worldwide. He has also advised the White House’s Executive Office of the President on domain name dispute and cybersquatting issues.

While at Victoria, Mr Greene will teach a course entitled ‘The Law and Regulation of Cyberspace’ in Trimester 2, and undertake a major research project.

“It is a tremendous honour to have been appointed to this position, and I am very excited to be here and to be working with Victoria and InternetNZ staff. As someone who has worked in intellectual property law, in general, and Internet law, in particular, I view this fellowship as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I’m confident that my time here in New Zealand will be especially rewarding—but I hope that the year doesn’t fly by too quickly.”

Cyberlaw involves the range of legal issues relating to the internet, and the Fellowship is one of the first in the world. InternetNZ, a not-for-profit organisation fostering co-ordinated and co-operative development of the internet in New Zealand, is providing funding for the Fellowship in a joint project with Victoria, through the Victoria University of Wellington Foundation.

Keith Davidson, InternetNZ’s Executive Director, says the second year of the Fellowship will build on the success of the first.

“We are pleased that Philip has taken up the role. There is a need for greater clarity in the law as it relates to the Internet.”

Professor Tony Smith, Head and Dean of Victoria’s School of Law, says the Cyberlaw Fellow will be a valuable asset to the School during the term of his appointment. “Philip has a vast amount of experience, especially in handling internet domain name disputes. We welcome him to the School, and are looking forward to building our working relationship.”
