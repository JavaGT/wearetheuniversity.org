Inaugural Chair in E-Government arrives at Victoria

Professor Miriam Lips has taken up her position as the inaugural Chair in E-Government at Victoria Univeristy of Wellington. She was formerly a Research Fellow at Oxford University’s Internet Institute and an Associate Professor in the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology & Society at Tilburg University in The Netherlands.

The Chair in E-Government is believed to be only the second such Chair in the world, following the establishment of the Cisco Chair in E-Democracy at Oxford University.

Professor Lips’ appointment follows an extensive international recruitment process involving a number of high-quality candidates. The Chair has been supported by the State Services Commission and Datacom, which are co-sponsoring the position through the Victoria University of Wellington Foundation.

Professor Lips, who holds a PhD and Master of Public Administration degree from Erasmus University Rotterdam, was the Project Leader or Scientific Director or Activity Leader on several major research projects for the European Commission, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research and the British Economic & Social Research Council.

In addition to e-government, Professor Lips’ research and teaching interests include identity management, digital citizenship, personalisation, internet governance, regulation in the information society and public management.
