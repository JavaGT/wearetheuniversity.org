Serial survivors: women’s narratives of surviving rape

Victoria University criminologist Dr Jan Jordan’s latest book explores what it means to survive an experience often described as ‘every woman’s worst nightmare’.

“This book presents the survival stories of 15 women who were all sexually assaulted by the same Auckland serial rapist, Malcolm Rewa. These women hoped that through sharing their experiences they could promote understanding and inspire others on their own survival journeys,” says Dr Jordan.

In 1998 Malcolm Rewa was convicted of the sexual assault of 25 women between 1987 and 1996 and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years in prison without parole.

Dr Jordan’s book Serial Survivors: women’s narratives of surviving rape will be officially launched next week, and is on sale in bookstores now.

Dr Jan Jordan will also present a seminar on this book topic as part of Victoria University’s Criminology Seminar Series. This will be on Thursday 12 June at 4.30pm in the Hunter Council Chamber on Kelburn Parade, Wellington and is open to the public.

She is a senior lecturer in criminology at Victoria University.
