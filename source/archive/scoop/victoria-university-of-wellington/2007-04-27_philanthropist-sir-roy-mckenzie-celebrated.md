MEDIA RELEASE

Philanthropist celebrated

A symposium to celebrate the life of philanthropist Sir Roy McKenzie is being held by the Rotary Club and Victoria University.

Shaping the Future: A symposium to celebrate, record and advance the legacies created by Sir Roy McKenzie will be held on 7 May in the Ilott Theatre in Wellington Town Hall.

Associate Professor Jan Pryor, Director of the Roy McKenzie Centre for the Study of Families, says the event will be a celebration of Sir Roy’s lifetime of achievements.

“The symposium will pay tribute to Sir Roy’s endeavours by providing an opportunity for people whose organisations and careers have been touched by Sir Roy’s ‘manner of giving’.

“Not only did he provide core funding for the Roy McKenzie Centre for the Study of Families but also the establishment of the University Teaching Development Centre. The insight, effort and generosity Sir Roy has shown in choosing and overseeing the courses he supports has had an incredibly valuable impact on New Zealand society.”

Chaired by Retirement Commissioner Diana Crossan, the speakers include Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh, Outward Bound Chief Executive Trevor Taylor, Philanthropy New Zealand Executive Director Robyn Scott, and, by video contribution, founder of the Warehouse and the Tindall Foundation, Stephen Tindall.

Students from the New Zealand School of Music will provide musical breaks during the afternoon, to acknowledge another of Sir Roy’s areas of interest.

Sir Roy, now 84, is a Knight Commander of the British Empire (KBE) and a member of the New Zealand Order of Merit. He is well known for his record of activity in community organisations such as being: the second President and Patron of the Outward Bound Trust of New Zealand; Patron of the New Zealand Foundation for Women’s Refuges; Vice-Patron of the Deaf Institute of New Zealand; and life member and Patron of the New Zealand Society for Music Therapy.

In 2004 Victoria University awarded him an Honorary Doctorate in Commerce. In the same year he was also named the Dominion Post Wellingtonian of the Year.
