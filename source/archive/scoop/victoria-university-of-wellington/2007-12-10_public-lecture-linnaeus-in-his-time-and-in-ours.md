Public Lecture: Linnaeus in his time and in ours
================================================

**Monday, 10 December 2007, 11:41 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Public lecture

  
Linnaeus in his own time and in ours

  
To be given by Emeritus Professor, Bengt Jonsell, Professor Bergianus (of botany)

  
The lecture will examine Linnaeus' heritage today, from his pragmatic and complete sexual system for plant classification and his theoretical and fragmentary natural method, through developments by Adanson, DeCandolle, and Engler, to modern Floras and the new APG angiosperm classification. Early botanists in Australasia, Linnaean disciple Daniel Solander (Cook's first expedition) and Robert Brown, were influential.
