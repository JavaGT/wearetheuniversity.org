Health experts to speak in Auckland

  
Vaccine development and treating unmet medical needs will be discussed at public talks in Auckland this month as part of Victoria University of Wellington’s 2014 Public Lecture Series.

Dr Bridget Stocker, a senior lecturer in Victoria’s School of Chemical and Physical Sciences, will provide an overview of the history of vaccination strategies and discuss why there is still a need for new vaccines.

Dr Stocker is currently supported by a Sir Charles Hercus Research Fellowship and is an adjunct researcher at the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research.

She will be joined by Dr Gavin Painter, a senior principal scientist at the Ferrier Research Institute at Victoria University. The Ferrier Institute uses cutting-edge research methods to develop vaccines and drugs for the treatment of disease.

Dr Painter will provide an overview of current research projects related to new treatments for unmet medical needs. With a New Zealand perspective, he will discuss potent enzyme inhibitors, anti-virals for Ebola and cancer immunotherapy.

The lectures will be presented at Quality Hotel Parnell, 20 Gladstone Road, Parnell, Auckland on Thursday 18 September at 5.30pm. To attend, email rsvp@vuw.ac.nz with ‘Auckland lecture’ in the subject line or phone 04-463 5810 by Monday 15 September.
