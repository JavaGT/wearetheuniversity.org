**Inaugural Chancellor’s Lecture—Professor Sir Paul Callaghan**

New Zealander of the Year and renowned scientist Professor Sir Paul Callaghan will deliver Victoria University’s Inaugural Chancellor’s Lecture next month.

The Victoria professor will give his lecture—_A prosperous 21st century New Zealand: educating for the new 'Tiger Economy’_—at the Wellington Town Hall on Wednesday 14 September.

Drawing upon his excellence in science and wide ranging experience generally, Sir Paul will argue that New Zealand’s decline in prosperity is largely a result of our own choosing and that we have the capacity, simply by thinking and acting differently, to rapidly move ahead.

University Chancellor Ian McKinnon says the lecture promises to be an insightful and stimulating address.

“Professor Callaghan is a world-renowned scientist and someone committed to ensuring New Zealand is able to punch above its weight financially and internationally. I am very pleased that we are able to offer a speaker of his calibre for Victoria University’s Inaugural Chancellor’s Lecture.”

The Chancellor’s Lecture is funded by an anonymous donor though the Victoria University Foundation.
