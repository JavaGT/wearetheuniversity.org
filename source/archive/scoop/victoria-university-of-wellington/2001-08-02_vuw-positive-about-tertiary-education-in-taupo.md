VUW positive about tertiary education in Taupo
==============================================

**Thursday, 2 August 2001, 8:58 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University continues to be interested in exploring alternative models of tertiary education delivery outside the Wellington region.

While it expressed disappointment with the breakdown in the relationship with the Lake Taupo Development Company (LTDC), other options in the Taupo district are being explored.

“We are naturally disappointed with the tone and unilateral nature of the announcement by the LTDC,” said Professor Neil Quigley, Pro Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University.

“We continue to be interested in working with the people and iwi of Taupo to promote tertiary education in that area.

“It is important that organisations like the LTDC are realistic about what is achievable,” he said. “The Ministry of Education has made it clear to both Victoria University and the LTDC, that there are legislative constraints on the approach that can be taken. These constraints mean that we are unable to participate in the development of a University College that is not controlled by Victoria University. These same constraints apply to all publicly-funded universities.”

Professor Quigley said that he had advised the LTDC last week of Victoria University’s commitment to furthering tertiary education opportunities in Taupo. “We are willing to consider alternative approaches to developing a relationship that is mutually beneficial and consistent with our statutory obligations under the Education Act.”
