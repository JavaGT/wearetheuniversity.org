Victoria PhD student wins Young Scientist of the Year

A Victoria University PhD student has been named the 2009 MacDiarmid Young Scientist of the Year for his research removing toxic pollutants from vehicle emissions.

27-year-old John Watt’s studies focus on using infinitesimally small nanoparticles of the precious metal palladium to remove toxic gases from a car’s exhaust system.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, said that Mr Watt’s research was world-leading.

“Our staff and students are immersed in the science capital of New Zealand and are contributing nationally and internationally. John Watt’s work is one example of research excellence that could make a real difference.

“His research could result in a cheap and effective way of removing pollution from our streets. A British company is currently examining how suitably the palladium particles can be used.

“Being awarded the MacDiarmid Young Scientist of the Year is a superb achievement and is a tribute to John’s research and the support of his professors.”

Mr Watt was presented with the 2009 MacDiarmid Young Scientist of the Year Award by the Minister of Research, Science and Technology, the Hon Dr Wayne Mapp, at a function in Auckland on Thursday night.

The awards are named after Victoria University alumnus and Nobel Prize winning scientist, the late Professor Alan MacDiarmid.

Mr Watt has created nano-size palladium particles which achieves much better performance than conventional palladium and are significantly cheaper. Conventional palladium costs up to $11,000 a kilogram, limiting its use.

As well as Mr Watt, Victoria had two other winners in this year’s Young Scientists of the Year Awards, from a total of five finalists.

Kerstin Burridge developed textiles that combine wool with gold to create a real world Golden Fleece. She grew tiny particles of gold on wool which produces textiles ranging in colour from light pink, through to purple, grey and gold.

Professor Walsh said that her study was something that would have great benefits for the New Zealand textile industry.

“Universities add significant economic and intellectual benefits to society and Kerstin’s research reflects this.

“Victoria has a strong research association with Crown Research Institutes and the private sector, and I look forward to Kerstin advancing her work. It could be something we’ll soon see on catwalks around the world.”

Dr Matthew Gerrie’s research looked at innovative techniques that improve the accuracy of eyewitness identification of offenders. He used infrared eye tracking technology to record eye movement patterns, giving insight into how witnesses make decisions.

“Dr Gerrie’s work helps to reduce wrongful convictions based on inaccurate eye witness identifications from police line-ups,”said Professor Walsh.

“His efforts as manager of Innocence Project New Zealand (IPNZ), part of a world-wide organisation that investigates and overturns wrongful convictions, and his research fits well with the University’s aim to be critic and conscience of society. The identification of offenders is an incredibly important area of justice.”
