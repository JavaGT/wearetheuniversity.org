Wired for sound

The auditory possibilities of the Adam Art Gallery are to be explored in Wired for Sound, a night of performances by two established sound practitioners.

Interpreting the Adam Art Gallery’s unique architectural features in terms of acoustics and sound, Wired for Sound, held on 4 August, will immerse audiences in a fluid sonic environment that reflects and articulates the fractured and labyrinthine qualities of the gallery spaces.

Prominent Wellington-based sound artist, Antony Milton, will utilise the individual spaces of the gallery as separate sound boxes for a variety of instruments that he will play centrally, sending leads out from a mixer to a speaker in each room. Milton’s performance will create a dispersed and de-centralized sonic environment that accentuates the acoustic properties of each of the gallery spaces.

By stroking lengths of thin piano wire fastened to the interior walls of the building, Alastair Galbraith, a Dunedin-based experimental musician and artist with a growing international reputation, will transform the Adam Art Gallery into a hollow-bodied musical instrument that sings the myriad resonant frequencies of each of its spaces.

Wired for Sound is the inaugural event for Sound Check, an exhibition and performance series at the Adam Art Gallery that canvases the history of and current directions in sound art in New Zealand.

Wired for Sound takes place on 4 August at the Adam Art Gallery on Victoria University's Kelburn Campus at 7.30pm. Entrance fee is $5.
