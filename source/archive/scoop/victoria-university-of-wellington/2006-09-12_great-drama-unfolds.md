Great Drama Unfolds

Urge + Excess = Drama : three short plays

In three short plays showing at Victoria University’s Studio 77 next week characters are driven to extremes by their wants and urges. They lose control of the situations around them and it is then that great theatre becomes inescapable. Watch the drama unfold in these hilarious eclectic plays.

In Beef Junkies, written by Jonathan Dorf and directed by Ginny Spackman, we meet Cowgirl, who is suffering from withdrawal symptoms from not having her fix of beef. She and Cowboy now wait for the last cow in the world to pass by. It is a world of diminishing resources and few moral inclinations. But Cowboy’s favourite fish, salmon is also threatened. A choice arises - salmon or cow? Who will be left standing when the cow comes home in this dark comedy?

George the Mad Ad-man, written by Peter Bland, is an eccentric New Zealand comedy where George brings home one of his models from work. However dreariness and passion clash as his need for domestic security at home and the sexual glamour of work merge together and the two worlds collide into an exasperating mad illusion. Can George keep his sanity? Directed by Janosch Schimmelschmidt.

Directed by Sophia Cornish, A Tale of Mystery is written by Thomas Holcroft. Count Romaldi seems prepared to use all his power to make the orphaned heiress Selina marry his son. Will Selina’s guardian, Bonamo, give consent while Selina and his own son love each other? And who is Francisco, the kind and sorrowful man of misfortune, who cannot speak and will not name his family or the man who tried to murder him? An intricate melodrama set in the 1920s filled with secrets, twists and betrayal.

All three productions will be performed at Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn from Wednesday 20 – Saturday 23 September 2006. Shows start at 7pm each night with tickets $12 waged and $8 unwaged.
