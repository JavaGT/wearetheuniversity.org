**Victoria University looks to expand campuses**

Victoria University of Wellington is proceeding with development plans for a major new science building on the University’s Kelburn campus, and the redevelopment of Rutherford House in central Wellington.

On the Kelburn campus, construction of a new building will enhance the science precinct at Victoria. The new area will house teaching and research labs for biological science and general teaching facilities.

In addition, the University is proceeding with plans for the construction of an extension to Rutherford House on the University’s Pipitea Campus. This will support the growth aspirations of Victoria’s Business School.

Chancellor Ian McKinnon said the projects, which will cost over $100 million, represented a significant investment in the further development of the University’s facilities to support continuing growth.

“These construction projects are part of the University’s commitment to providing a first-class student experience and maintaining Victoria’s reputation as a leader in teaching and research.

“The Rutherford House extension is focused on developing student spaces to enhance the learning and teaching environment. This work is modelled on the very successful Hub construction which has transformed the University’s Kelburn campus.

"The Council fully supports the strategic campus development plans of the University.

“Continued investment in the University’s facilities ensures we have the capacity and capability to continue to add value to the Wellington economy.”

Vice-Chancellor Professor Grant Guilford says the investment in new facilities will help to ensure the University has the right environment to achieve its strategic goals.

“These plans give an exciting glimpse into the future of Victoria and its place as New Zealand’s globally ranked capital city university.”

Work on both projects is still subject to a variety of approvals, as is consistent with any large capital development initiative, but detailed planning work is continuing.
