Employers seek interpersonal skills in new graduates

Interpersonal skills topped the list of skills/attributes employers look for in new university graduates for the third year in a row, a Victoria University survey has found.

This recent survey of major graduate recruiters conducted by Victoria’s Career Development & Employment Service (VicCareers) continues to illustrate that it is the combination of certain skills and attributes which is the key to employability, says Manager Liz Medford

One hundred and thirteen employers who were recruiting or have recently recruited university graduates responded to the survey.

The top 10 skills/attributes sought after in university graduates by employers are:

1\. Strong Interpersonal Skills  
2\. Strong Verbal Communication Skills  
3\. Strong Written Communication Skills  
4\. Flexible and Adaptable “Can Do” Attitude  
5\. Sound Academic Achievement  
6\. Self-Motivated/Self-Starter  
7\. Team Player  
8\. Energy and Enthusiasm  
9\. Problem Solving Skills  
10\. Analytical and Conceptual Skills

Ms Medford says employers were asked to rank in order of priority 24 skills and attributes they most commonly requested when advertising graduate vacancies. Additional skills and attributes identified by employers included well rounded individuals, social employees that get on well with others, organisational skills and learning agility.

“Government agencies gave more emphasis to academic achievement and strong written communication skills, while the private sector placed a higher value on energy and enthusiasm and commercial awareness.

“Similar surveys carried out internationally placed oral communication and team work skills tops in the survey carried out in Ireland, whilst in Australia the top two skills were interpersonal and communication skills—written and oral—and academic qualifications,” she says.

Ms Medford say despite the ever changing world of work, some things remain constant over time.

“While there has been some change in the order over time, all of the top ten skills and attributes identified in this survey took top billing in similar surveys conducted in 2000 and 2003.”
