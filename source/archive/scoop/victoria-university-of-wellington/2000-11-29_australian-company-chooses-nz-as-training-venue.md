Australian company chooses NZ as training venue
===============================================

Australian communications company Telstra chose New Zealand as the venue for their prestigious management training programme, held during November.

The Telstra Quantum Leap Strategic Management Programme is held every year and is aimed at key young executives. The event was attended by 18 Telstra "high achievers" and was held in Queenstown's Millbrook Resort. Last year the event was held in Hawaii. The company also utilises the course for those employees it has identified as being ready to take the next step in senior management levels.

Their programme was designed and presented by Executive Programmes at Victoria University's Graduate School of Business and Government. Telstra had invited a number of universities, both in Australia and overseas, to present a curriculum on relevant subjects which would fit a global communications and information services company such as Telstra.

According to Telstra's National Programme Manager, Bill Richardson, Victoria University was short listed and ultimately awarded the contract due to the proactive nature of the Graduate School and their demonstrated understanding of the company's needs.

Sessions involved Strategy, Marketing and the Implementation of Electronic Commerce, Company Strategy and Frameworks for Senior Executive Leadership which involved development of a take-away personal leadership plan.

Graduate School Director, Lincoln Gould, said the content of the sessions was based on Australasian research with Telstra specific issues and cases used where possible. "We were aiming to ensure that the course was directly applicable to Telstra as we individually tailor our programmes to the needs of the company or people involved".

"This is an approach similar to the many customised programmes that the Graduate School designs and presents for individual organisations in both the private and public sectors, although this was the first involving an overseas company", he says.
