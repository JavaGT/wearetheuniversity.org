New Human Resources Director for Victoria Uni
=============================================

New Human Resources Director for Victoria University

Victoria University's new Director of Human Resources has a strong background in the tertiary sector.

Annemarie de Castro will join Victoria on June 14 from Massey University in Palmerston North where she has been Director of Human Resources since 1997, having joined the University two years earlier as a Human Resources Adviser. Previously she worked as a human resources manager and consultant in the private sector.

Victoria Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon said Ms de Castro brought considerable experience in both the private and university sectors.

\"People are the most important resource in any organisation and Ms de Castro has a strong track record in managing and leading a diverse group of people spread over four campuses throughout the North Island. Those skills are particularly vital to Victoria as we have moved from a largely single site operation to one spread over several campuses, albeit in the one city."

Ms de Castro said she had enjoyed her time at Massey University but had decided to take the position at Victoria for both personal and professional reasons.

"I've been very challenged and had a great experience at Massey. I will miss the team I've worked with for so long. However, I also felt it was time to make my next career move. I find the tertiary sector particularly stimulating and when the Victoria position became available, I decided to apply. I've met several members of the Human Resources Directorate at Victoria and they're an excellent team and I look forward to working with them."

"There were also strong personal reasons behind the move. Members of my husband's family are based in Wellington and my family is in Blenheim so moving to the Capital allows both of us to be much closer to our families."

As Victoria's Director of Human Resources, Ms de Castro will become a member of the University's senior management team.

Ms de Castro has a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Massey and is a Fellow of the Human Resources Institute of New Zealand.
