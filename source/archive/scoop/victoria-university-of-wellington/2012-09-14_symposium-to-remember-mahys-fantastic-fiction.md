Symposium to remember Mahy’s fantastic fiction

Biographer Tessa Duder, filmmaker Dave Gibson and novelist Elizabeth Knox will feature in a day-long series of talks and discussions being held to remember Margaret Mahy’s literary talent next week.

‘Remembering Margaret Mahy: A Saturday Symposium’ has been organised by Victoria University’s English programme to reflect on Mahy’s work.

The public are invited to attend (registration details are provided below).

The symposium on Saturday 22 September in Wellington will include time for discussion at the end of every panel session. “It will appeal to librarians, teachers, parents and all admirers of Mahy’s work,” Professor of English Kathryn Walls says.

“Mahy’s works address difficult issues. They are also brilliantly crafted—witty, skilled and poetic. To study them is deeply satisfying, as Saturday’s symposium is sure to demonstrate.”

Topics to be discussed on the day include Mahy’s readers for use in primary schools, her contributions to the School Journal, and various aspects of her sophisticated novels for young adults. Writers Eirlys Hunter and James Norcliffe are set to participate, along with academics from Otago, Canterbury, Auckland and Victoria universities.

When: Saturday 22 September, 9am–6pm

Where: Rutherford House Lecture Theatre 2, Pipitea Campus, Bunny Street, Wellington
