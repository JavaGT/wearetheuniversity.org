Maclaurin Lecture Theatre 3, Kelburn Campus, Victoria University

Professor David Stevenson, a world-leading planetary scientist and Victoria University graduate will give a public lecture on Jupiter this week.

Professor Stevenson is the George Van Osdol Professor of Planetary Science at the California Institute of Technology. He is well-known internationally for his research on planetary interiors and the development of the solar system. Recent work includes using data from space probes to investigate solar system planets and their moons. His discoveries include evidence for oceans, beneath an ice cover, on Jupiter’s moons Europa and Callisto.

Professor Stevenson is leading the team that will investigate Jupiter’s interior using data from the billion-dollar Juno space probe mission that will be launched in 2011. He will outline the plans at the lecture at Victoria University's Kelburn Campus on Thursday 9 November at 6pm in Maclaurin Lecture Theatre 3.

A longstanding supporter of Victoria, Professor Stevenson has received many prizes and awards, both for research and teaching. He is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, a Fellow of The Royal Society (London), and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences. The asteroid 5211 Stevenson was named after him. Professor Stevenson received an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Victoria in 2002.
