**Recognition of quality for Victoria Business School**

Victoria Business School has had its EQUIS accreditation confirmed for a further three years, endorsing the School’s high international standing.

EQUIS is the accreditation system of the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) and is one of the accreditations that make up the prestigious ‘Triple Crown’ of international accreditations for Business Schools.

Victoria Business School is among just 60 business schools worldwide that hold the ‘Triple Crown’, which also includes AACSB (Association for the Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business) and AMBA (Association of MBAs).

Professor Bob Buckle, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Commerce at Victoria Business School, says EFMD, the EQUIS awarding body, was impressed by Victoria Business School’s programmes, staff, engagement and strategic development.

“We have demonstrated not only high quality in our teaching, research and engagement activities, but also a high degree of internationalisation.

“Accreditation is the best way to certify the quality of Victoria Business School. This process involves an extensive self-assessment, a visit by an international review team which spends several days interviewing staff from across the School and the University, and external stakeholders, followed by evaluation by an experienced jury.

“Our students and stakeholders can be assured that that they are associated with an institution with high international standards, a significant level of internationalisation, a balance between high academic quality and professional relevance, and that the needs of the corporate and public policy communities are well integrated into our activities.

“Most importantly, students can be assured that they will receive international recognition for their qualifications, which is extremely important in today’s highly interconnected global environment.”

EQUIS is one of the leading international systems of quality assessment, improvement and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business. The fundamental objective of EFMD is to raise the standard of management education worldwide.
