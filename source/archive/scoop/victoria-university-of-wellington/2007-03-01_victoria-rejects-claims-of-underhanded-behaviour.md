Victoria rejects claims of underhanded behaviour

Claims of “underhanded behaviour” by Victoria University in dealing with a proposal to increase some student fees are absolutely absurd, says Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh.

The University has been accused by the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) of using “underhanded tactics to increase student fees”.

In September last year, the Council discussed, in public, a proposal to apply to the Tertiary Education Commission for exemption to raise humanities, social science, education, architecture and law fees by a further five percent in addition to the five percent being applied to all courses in 2007. This was deferred for future consideration and it was due to be discussed at Monday’s Council meeting.

Professor Pat Walsh, Vice-Chancellor, rejected comments by VUWSA President, Geoff Hayward of underhanded tactics.

“These comments are absolutely absurd. I’m surprised Geoff made them considering he was present at Monday’s meeting (26 February) and knows the matter has not yet been voted on.

“The report on this proposal was mistakenly included in the confidential section of the order paper when it should have been in the public section. As soon was this oversight was spotted, the Council immediately moved to defer the matter so it could be considered in public at its March 26 meeting, thus allowing VUWSA time to consult with students. There is nothing underhanded about that.”

The exemption application is being considered because fees at Victoria for courses in humanities, social sciences, education, law, and architecture are significantly lower than at other universities. A fees increase above the maximum is needed to allow Victoria to allocate greater resources to these programmes so they can continue to enhance quality, he said.

“If the application is made and accepted by the Tertiary Education Commission, the extra five percent increase would move towards making it a more level playing field,” says Professor Walsh.
