Happy Hundredth Birthday Hunter!
================================

Happy Hundredth Birthday Hunter!

There might not be a telegram from the Queen, but the 100th birthday party for the Hunter Building on August 27 will befit Victoria University’s oldest and most recognised building.

Victoria University will celebrate the 100th birthday of the building with events on 26 and 27 August, culminating in a birthday party for all those who contributed to saving the building from demolition in the 1970s and 1980s on Friday evening. (27 August)

“In the 1970s, the Hunter Building was evacuated and condemned, cited as an earthquake risk by the city council,” says Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon.

“The University Council’s decision to demolish the building met with public outcry and prompted the formation of the Friends of Hunter Society, who battled successfully to save the original building and first home of the University.”

Many former members of the Society will attend the celebrations in the Hunter Building, and Léone Harkness, former Chairman of the Friends of Hunter Society, will unveil a dedicated plaque to commemorate the contribution of the Society to the University.

A public lecture exploring the life of Tommy Hunter, the first fulltime principal of Victoria University and the namesake of the building, will be delivered by AJW (Tony) Taylor, Emeritus Professor in the School of Psychology on Thursday evening at 6pm. (26 August)
