Students asked to express themselves through poetry

The search is on for the best and most original poems from New Zealand's young writers with the return of the National Schools Poetry Award.

Year 12 and 13 secondary school students are being urged to express themselves, during a time that for some has been one of grief and trauma.

Ten talented writers will win prizes for their poems, including the opportunity to attend a master class with leading New Zealand poets at Victoria University's International Institute of Modern Letters in Wellington on 20 August.

The first prize winner will receive $500 cash, as well as $500 for their school library.

The entry deadline is 15 June 2011, and entry forms, guidelines and writing tips for the Poetry Award are online at www.schoolspoetryaward.co.nz

Prizes include flights and accommodation at the Bolton Hotel for master class attendees living outside of the Wellington region, membership to the New Zealand Book Council and the New Zealand Society of Authors, poetry books from Unity Books in Wellington, and subscriptions to two leading literary journals, Sport and Landfall. The Poetry Award is supported by Creative New Zealand.

The winner and shortlisted poets will be announced on National Poetry Day, 22 July.

Judge for the 2011 Award is New Zealand Poet Laureate and recipient of the Prime Minister's Award for Literary Achievement, Cilla McQueen. The three-time winner of the New Zealand Book Award for Poetry says the Poetry Awards provide a snapshot of New Zealand culture.

"The work of young writers not only reflects their life and times but also allows a privileged glimpse into our future as a nation," she says.

The National Schools Poetry Award is organised by New Zealand's oldest and most prestigious creative writing programme, the International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) at Victoria University.

IIML director Bill Manhire says the Poetry Awards have uncovered some outstanding talent in previous years, and he thinks many young people may use their poetry to express feelings stirred up by the Christchurch earthquake.

"Some astonishing work by young writers has come out of these awards, and we fully expect that to be the case again-perhaps even more in this year of great grief, pain and courage."
