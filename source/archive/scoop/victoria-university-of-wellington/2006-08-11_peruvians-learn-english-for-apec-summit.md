Peruvians learn English for APEC Summit

Victoria University is teaming up with other organisations to offer an English language training programme to Government officials of Peru. This project is being undertaken to assist the Peruvians in organising the 2008 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit. It provides opportunities to improve their English language skills and to liaise with New Zealand experts, including organisers of the 1999 APEC Summit that was held in New Zealand.

The first 16 Government Officials participating in the programme at Victoria University’s English Language Institute have arrived in Wellington and will be here for five months. A second group of 16 Peruvians is expected to arrive for the programme in February 2007.

Victoria Link and the English Language Institute have been contracted by NZAID, New Zealand’s international aid and development agency to manage the delivery of this pilot English language training project for the Peruvians. “The Peruvian Programme is a pilot, modelled on the successful English Language Training for Officials Programme (ELTO) that we have been running for several years”, says Victoria Link Manager Malcolm Menzies.

“This programme will contribute to strengthening government institutions in Peru and links between NZ and Peru”.
