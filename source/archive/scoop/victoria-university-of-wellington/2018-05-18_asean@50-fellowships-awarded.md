The ASEAN@50 Fellowship Programme was announced in August 2017 by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The Fellowships programme is jointly funded by SEA CAPE and MFAT. It aims to contribute to building knowledge and mutual understanding between New Zealand and ASEAN nations as well as strengthening New Zealand's ties with the region.

“The Fellows were selected from thirty eligible applications by a panel of academics and MFAT officials,” says SEA CAPE Director, Professor Siah Hwee Ang, “we are very impressed with the calibre of the candidates, and I trust New Zealand’s academic and business communities that have Southeast Asia interests will benefit from the Fellowship programmes in New Zealand.”

The five ASEAN@50 Fellows will be in New Zealand for a series of seminars and discussions starting from late November 2018.
