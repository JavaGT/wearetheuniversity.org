Make Way For 1000 Vibrant Victoria Graduates
============================================

**Make Way For 1000 Vibrant Victoria Graduates**

More than 1,000 Victoria University students will parade through the streets of Wellington next week to celebrate reaching an educational milestone – graduation.

Victoria's December graduation celebrations start with a street parade at 12 pm on 11 December when the graduands will make their way from the Government Buildings up Lambton Quay to the Civic Square to be welcomed by Mayor Kerry Prendergast.

The first of three ceremonies will commence at the Michael Fowler Centre at 1.30pm, where graduands of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences will cross the stage to be capped with mortarboards symbolising the completion of their degrees, diplomas and certificates.

Two distinguished New Zealanders will be honoured with Honorary Doctorates – internationally renowned poet Fleur Adcock and ornithologist and author Christopher Robertson.

Ms Adcock will deliver a speech to graduands and their families and friends at the first ceremony on Tuesday, and TradeMe founder Sam Morgan is to speak at the afternoon ceremony to graduands of the Faculty of Commerce and Administration. Lou Sanson, CEO of Antarctica New Zealand, will address graduands at the third ceremony on Wednesday.

**Graduation highlights:**  
  
**Second time around:** Glenys Bullivant graduated with a BA in English and History before the  
Michael Fowler Centre was built in 1962, and 45 years later will return to Wellington to graduate for the second time with a Postgraduate Certificate in Archives and Records Management through the School of Library and Information Science. She notes the huge difference in teaching and learning styles, from her first taste of tertiary education in 1959 where she hard-wrote assignments, to her online lectures this year with 'virtual classmates' from  
Whangarei to Invercargill. Her father Rhys was a graduate of Victoria University College in the 1920s. Mrs Bullivant can be contacted at: 021 253 6349
