Study on separated parents

A new study by the Roy McKenzie Centre for the Study of Families at Victoria University is calling for separated parents to share their experiences.

The study aims to investigate the decisions that separating parents make about living arrangements for their children, including how they reach those decisions, and how they work.

Associate Professor Jan Pryor, Director of the Centre, says results of the study will be valuable for organisations and individuals who work with families, as well as government organisations who make policies related to family separations.

\"We are interested in parents who have not been to the Family Court other than for initial counselling sessions. We are wanting to talk to Pākehā, Māori, and Pacific parents, and hope to be able to interview both parents if that is possible."

Dr Pryor says that there is very little New Zealand-based information about how parents make decisions about their children after separation. "Given recent law changes in this regard, it is important to know how and why decisions and plans are made."

The project is starting immediately.
