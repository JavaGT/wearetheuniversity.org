It’s not every day you get the opportunity to explore Antarctica, but Victoria University of Wellington’s first massive open online course (MOOC) will allow anyone, anywhere, to do just that—and for free.

Enrolments are now open for _Antarctica: From Geology to Human History_ on the global edX platform—a nonprofit, open-source technology platform founded by prestigious United States universities Harvard and MIT and governed by universities for universities.

With support from Antarctica New Zealand, Dr Cliff Atkins and Dr Rebecca Priestley filmed lectures on location on Ross Island and in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica.

Together, they explore more than 500 million years of geological history and 250 years of geographical discovery and scientificendeavour on the coldest, driest, windiest continent on Earth.

“It’s not easy to take students to Antarctica, but by filming the lectures on the ice, we can introduce students around the world to this incredible continent,” says Dr Priestley.

Dr Atkins is an Antarctic veteran, having spent 12 seasons on the ice. He introduces students to some of the planet’s most remarkable landscapes—the Dry Valleys, the Transantarctic Mountains and the world’s southernmost volcanic island.

Dr Priestley, a science historian and writer who has written extensively about Antarctica, visits Captain Scott’s huts on Ross Island and interviews conservators from the Antarctic Heritage Trust and scientists and logistics staff working at Scott Base and McMurdo Station.

_Antarctica: From Geology to Human History_ starts on Saturday 15 April. Enroll now, for free, online: https://www.edx.org/course/antarctica-geology-human-history-victoriax-ice101x#
