Victoria University student, Rachel Robertson has won the sixth annual Datacom Systems Scholarship for her achievement in Computer Science.

Rachel was awarded the $3,750 Scholarship in recognition of her high level of academic achievement and her contribution to the life of the School of Mathematical and Computing Sciences, including her work there as a tutor.

Rachel is studying for a conjoint Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Commerce and Administration majoring in Computer Science, Operations Research and Information Systems.

“This Scholarship means a lot to me as it recognises the hard work and effort I have put into my studies”, Rachel said. “It also reduces my financial strain and allows me to make my studies my first priority. I am really thankful to Datacom for this recognition, and their willingness to help those who are trying to enter the industry.”

Rachel has been fascinated by the study of computer science since secondary school, and continues to be stimulated by the challenging environment of a constantly changing subject.

John Gill, Executive Chairman, Datacom Employer Services, says the Scholarship recognises academic achievement in Computer Science as well as excellent personal attributes and attitudes.

Mr Gill said that Rachel epitomizes the contribution that Victoria University is making to the IT industry. Rachel is a gifted student with a real commitment to IT and making a wider contribution to society.

John Hine, Professor of Computer Science at Victoria University, said the School of Mathematical and Computing Sciences truly appreciates the support for its students demonstrated by Datacom.
