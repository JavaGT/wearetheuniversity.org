Victoria graduates recognised as top achievers

Three Victoria University graduates have won funding worth almost $600,000 in the Tertiary Education Commission's Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships announced today.

Matthew French and Jason Varuhas, both studying at the University of Cambridge in Britain, were awarded the two largest grants. Jason was awarded $247,230 and will be looking at 'Damages for human rights breaches', while Matthew was awarded $246,978 for his research on 'The influence of bioclimatic architectural principles in the morphology of contemporary Latin American urban informal settlements'.

Adrian Jongenelen is studying at Victoria, and has been awarded $100,044 to study 'Development of a compact, portable, real-time range imaging system'.

Almost $3 million was awarded to postgraduate students throughout the country in this round of funding.

Victoria's Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor Charles Daugherty, says the announcement of the scholarships shows the level of achievement of Victoria graduates.

"Victoria aims to instil in its students skills of leadership, creative and critical thinking, and communication.

"We're delighted that these students have been recognised by TEC and that they have this opportunity to contribute to the pool of knowledge in their chosen disciplines."
