Study tour explores Paris, Provence and the painters of modern life

People interested in 19th-Century French art have the chance to visit Paris, Normandy and Provence this September, following in the footsteps of artists like Monet and Cezanne.

Spaces are still available for the 20-day study tour exploring how the mid-19th Century transformation of Paris into the city we know today influenced the development of modern art.

Participants will receive help and support from Dr Wendy Joyce who holds a PhD in nineteenth century French studies from Princeton University and has lectured at universities in France, England and Australia.

Beginning with a week in Paris, participants will gain insight into life in Paris more than 100 years ago, visiting monuments, sites and neighbourhoods favoured by the artists and their friends.

This will include architectural features around Paris and works of art in the Musee d’Orsay and Musee Marmottan.

A day-trip to Compiègne gives participants the chance to visit the home of the museum of the Second Empire and the Chateau de Compiegne, and autumn residence of Napoleon III and his empress Eugenie.

On day 11, the tour will move to Giverny to visit the home of Claude Monet and admire the famous gardens that inspired his series of water lily paintings.

“From Giverny, we will continue to the Normandy coast to the village of Etretat with its soaring limestone cliffs that feature in numerous paintings of the era, before heading south to Provence, in the footsteps of Paul Cezanne,” says Dr Joyce.
