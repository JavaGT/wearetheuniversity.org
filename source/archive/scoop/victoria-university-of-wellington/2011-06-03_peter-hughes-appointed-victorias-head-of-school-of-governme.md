### Peter Hughes appointed Victoria’s Head of School of Government

The Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University, Professor Pat Walsh, today announced the appointment of Peter Hughes, current Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development, to Head of Victoria’s School of Government.

“Peter’s public sector experience has been greatly valued as a member of the School of Government’s advisory board, which he has chaired since 2008—and I'm delighted that he has accepted the position as Head of School,” says Professor Walsh.

“Peter has a wealth of knowledge and networks that will be invaluable for strengthening our ties across the public service, parliament, judiciary and private sectors. His extensive leadership experience will also be an asset for ensuring the ongoing success of the School.”

Mr Hughes has been in his current role at the Ministry of Social Development since its establishment in 2001. He has more than 30 years’ experience in the public service, with roles during that time including Chief Executive of Internal Affairs, Chief Executive Officer of the Health Funding Authority, and a Deputy Director-General of Health. Last year he was named ‘Government Department Chief Executive of the Year’ by Trans Tasman magazine.

He studied at Victoria and Massey universities and gained a Masters of Public Administration from Harvard University.

Mr Hughes says he is delighted to accept the role.

"I am at the stage of my career where I want to use my skills and experience to give something back—and as a Victoria University graduate I am also personally committed to the success of the University," he says.

"The School of Government is unique amongst New Zealand universities and I see it as having an absolutely key role in helping to prepare and equip the next generation of public sector leaders in our country and in driving policy change through timely, relevant, quality research.”

Mr Hughes will take up the position on 10 October, 2011 and during his three year term will be a professor at the University.
