Probing the past to explain explosive eruptions

  
A Victoria University of Wellington volcanologist will next week give a talk on the forensics of large-scale volcanic eruptions, following his recent election to Fellowship of the Royal Society in London—one of the highest international honours in science.

Professor Colin Wilson was recognised by the Royal Society for his research into volcanoes and his contribution to the understanding of explosive volcanic activity.

His talk, entitled ‘The forensics of catastrophe’, will explore how he and other volcanologists carry out research on large explosive eruptions.

Erupting volcanoes are described as one of the planet’s great natural sights. However, those in a position to be able to see a large-scale eruption are also in a position of extreme danger. Because of this, much of what we understand about these eruptions is gained from studying the geological ‘products’ of past events.

Professor Wilson will discuss geological forensic science and how insights into large explosive eruptions can be gained from studying rocks in the field and applying analytical techniques down to a microscopic scale.

Professor Wilson, who has been a Professor of Volcanology in the School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences at Victoria University since 2009, recently travelled to London for the Royal Society’s formal admission ceremony.

The Royal Society is a fellowship of many of the world’s most eminent scientists, engineers and technologists. It includes 80 Nobel Laureates and just eight of New Zealand’s current leading scientists.

Where: Lecture Theatre 1, Government Buildings, Pipitea Campus, Victoria University of Wellington  
When: 6pm, Wednesday 26 August

If you would like to attend, please email rsvp@vuw.ac.nz with ‘Wilson’ in the subject line or phone 04-463 6390 by Monday 24 August.
