**Lamp to tour in international exhibition**

Pinokio, the Victoria University-designed animatronic lamp, will feature in the _Digital Revolution_ world touring exhibition alongside big names such as American singer songwriter will.i.am, electronic artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer and digital media artist Aaron Koblin.

Recently back from a trip to Russia for the Robo-Forum exhibition, design student Adam Ben-Dror is taking Pinokio, designed in collaboration with fellow student Shanshan Zhou, to the exhibition opening in London. This exhibition has been described as the most comprehensive presentation of digital creativity ever to be staged in the United Kingdom.

Adam and Shanshan spent three months building two new lamps from scratch, the second of which will be housed at the Barbican Centre, Europe's largest multi-arts and conference venue, from July to September before embarking on the touring exhibition for five years.

Adam says the chance to exhibit at such a large exhibition is significant for both him and Shanshan.

“The opportunities to network with established artists in the new media arts industry is opportune for a design student from New Zealand. I have been following some of these people for a long time. Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, for example, has been a big influence and inspiration for me.

“As designers and artists, this opportunity means recognition and the chance to meet some really inspiring people. Shanshan and I are honoured to be able to have this opportunity at this stage in our careers,” he says.

Originally created as a course project under the supervision of Douglas Easterly, Deputy Head of Victoria’s School of Design, Pinokio has attracted a high level of internet attention, so far clocking nearly one million views on Vimeo (http://vimeo.com/53476316).

Pinokio picked up Gold in the Interactive Category of the 2013 Designers Institute of New Zealand Best Awards, and is now drawing international interest, with the curators of the _Digital Revolution_ exhibition spotting Pinokio online.
