For Immediate Release

Victoria students win University shield second year in a row  
   
Victoria University students were named overall winner of the University Games 2009 last night, amidst cheers from supporters at the TSB Stadium in New Plymouth.

Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) sent a 280-strong team to Taranaki to defend the shield. 

This is the second year in a row that Victoria has won the shield, this year scoring 198 points, ahead of the University of Auckland on 178, and Auckland University of Technology (AUT) on 132 points.

  
"We sent a competitive team to the Taranaki Games," says Jasmine Freemantle, VUWSA President.

"This victory yet again confirms the high level of achievement and participation of Victoria’s students.”

  
Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh extended his congratulations to the team. “I’m extremely proud to see our students achieving not only academically, but on the sports field as well.”

    
The University Games is one of the largest annual multi-sport events in New Zealand.  
   
The Games were held in Taranaki from Tuesday 14 - Friday 17 April, and saw tertiary students from across New Zealand, and some from Australia, compete for the coveted shield.
