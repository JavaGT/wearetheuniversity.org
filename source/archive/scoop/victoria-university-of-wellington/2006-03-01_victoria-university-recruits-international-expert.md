Victoria University recruits international expert

Vietnam War historian and Director of Otago University’s International office, Dr Roberto Rabel, will join Victoria University of Wellington as Pro Vice-Chancellor (International).

“I am delighted to have appointed a research active academic to this important role as a Professor on our senior management team,” said Professor Pat Walsh, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington.

“His extensive experience in leading an International Office, his deep understanding of the academic challenges in the international portfolio and his close connection to our international markets and to Victoria University, made him an outstanding candidate.

“We look forward to Professor Rabel joining us in May.”

Dr Rabel graduated from Victoria University in 1978 with a first class BA(Hons) in history and international politics. He later studied as a Fulbright Scholar at Duke University where he attained his MA in 1980, and PhD in American diplomatic history in 1984.

Dr Rabel has served three times as Director of the Otago Foreign Policy School and teaches an international history course in Otago University’s Master of International Studies programme.

He is author or editor of more than 35 books and articles. His most recent book was a political and diplomatic history of New Zealand’s involvement in the Vietnam War and was officially launched by the Prime Minister, Rt Hon Helen Clark, at Parliament in December 2005.

Dr Rabel said that he was thrilled to be returning to Victoria. “It’s a rare privilege to be able to join the senior management team of one’s home university, especially at a time when Victoria is excelling on so many fronts.”

While cautioning that all New Zealand’s universities are facing real challenges in terms of international recruitment, Dr Rabel said the he intends to build on Victoria International’s highly successful student recruitment programme.

“I intend to work closely with academic staff and students to encourage the pursuit of a wide range of international initiatives, including expansion of student exchange programmes and enhancing Victoria University’s partnerships with leading universities worldwide.”
