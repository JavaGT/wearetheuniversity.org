Victoria University appoints four personal chairs

Four distinguished scholars have demonstrated their high international esteem and have been appointed as professors at Victoria University of Wellington. The appointments, which take place every two years, are a recognition of the international distinction of the Professors in their particular research fields and their meritorious performance in teaching, and other service to the University.

“Appointment to a Personal Chair is not part of the regular promotions process,” said Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon. “It is intended as a special recognition of outstanding scholarly achievement together with meritorious performance in teaching, research and other service to the University.”

International referees make submission on the candidate’s professional contribution to their respective discipline and comment on the regard with which they are held by their colleagues internationally.

“Distinguished service to the wider intellectual community or relevant profession is also taken into account. In each of 1999 and 2001, three appointments were made. This year four new Professors were appointed,” said Professor McCutcheon.
