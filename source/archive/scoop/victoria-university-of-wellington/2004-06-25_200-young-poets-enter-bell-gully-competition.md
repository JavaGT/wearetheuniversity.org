200 budding young poets enter Bell Gully poetry competition

More than 200 poems have been submitted for this year's Bell Gully National Schools Poetry Competition, organised by Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters, and judged by award winning poet Glenn Colquhoun.

Entries have doubled from 2003, and budding poets in Year 12 and 13 at 93 secondary schools from throughout New Zealand are represented.

"We're delighted with this growth in the competition's popularity. It represents an increasing engagement with creative writing in New Zealand classrooms,” says Maggie Callicrate, Chief Executive of Bell Gully.

The winning poet will be announced by children's writer Margaret Mahy at a reception in Wellington in August during the Bell Gully Schools Writing Festival 2004 – a chance for young writers to work with the country's leading writers, poets and screenwriters.

The winner will receive a $500 cash prize; a $500 book grant for their school’s library; a year’s membership to the New Zealand Book Council; and subscriptions to leading literary journals Landfall and Sport.

This is the second year that the International Institute of Modern Letters and law firm Bell Gully have joined forces to stage the award, with support this year from existing partners, the New Zealand Book Council and Book Tokens (NZ) Ltd and new partners, Landfall and Sport.
