**High-powered conference to contemplate China’s future**

Many of the world’s leading experts on China will gather in Wellington next month to discuss where this emerging superpower may be heading with its planned policy reforms.

The one-day conference ‘China at the Crossroads—What the Third Plenum means for China, New Zealand and the world’, hosted by Victoria University of Wellington’s New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre, will contemplate the radical policy reforms that were proposed by the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee at the 2013 Third Plenum.

“China has seen tremendous growth over the past three decades, which has presented New Zealand and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region with extraordinary new opportunities, but also poses important questions about the best way to manage China’s burgeoning influence,” says Peter Harris, Acting Director of the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre.

“A fuller understanding of the economic, political and social policies adopted by China will be vital for anyone engaging with China and the Chinese today.

“Many Chinese commentators are speculating that the Plenum may be as significant as the famous 1978 Plenum that marked the end of the Maoist era and led to a far-reaching reform process that has since transformed China both domestically and internationally. Our conference will take a critical look at China’s proposed reforms.”

The day will include three chaired panel discussions. Topics will range from key domestic policy reforms addressed by the Third Plenum, both in the political and social spheres and with relation to economic and financial affairs, to the implications of Plenum decisions for China’s relations with New Zealand, the Asia Pacific region and the world.
