Runaway Model

Victoria University is on the hunt for the architectural model of the Hunter Building, commissioned in the 1970's. The model is of the original building and its proposed redevelopment on the Kelburn Campus.

In the 1970s, the Hunter Building was evacuated and condemned, cited as an earthquake risk by the city council. The University Council’s decision to demolish the building met with public outcry and prompted the formation of the Friends of Hunter society, who battled successfully to save the original building of the University.

Now, 100 years since the foundation stone was laid, and nearly 10 years since the refurbished building was reopened, Victoria University will celebrate the centenary of its original home in August 2004 with a number of birthday celebrations.

“We’d love to find the model, constructed by Phil Chandler in 1978, and last seen at an exhibition at the Dominion Museum in the early 1990s, to include in the exhibition that we’re putting together of the building’s last 100 years,” says Leone Harkness, Friends of Hunter Founder and Chairman.
