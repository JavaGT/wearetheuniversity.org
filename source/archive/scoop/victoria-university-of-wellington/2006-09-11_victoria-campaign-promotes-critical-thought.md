Victoria campaign promotes critical thought

Victoria University launches its annual brand campaign this month, featuring three new commercials running on television and in cinemas.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor David Mackay, says the campaign, now in its seventh year, will also be supported by online and print advertising and continues to perform well in a competitive market.

“It Makes You Think illustrates how Victoria promotes critical discussion of topical issues of national and global importance,” he says. “For example, one of the ads poses the question, ‘If New Zealand profits, does it really matter where it’s made?’

“This demonstrates to prospective students how Victoria University educates students to think critically and intelligently, rather than telling them what to think.”

Along with the television advertisements, which will be seen in homes from Waikato to Canterbury, and in cinemas, a new website will provide prospective students with an insight into life at Victoria. The website www.lifeatvic.ac.nz features a welcome from Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, and interviews from Victoria students, graduates and lecturers.
