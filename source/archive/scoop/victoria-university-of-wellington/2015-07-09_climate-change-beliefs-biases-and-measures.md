Climate change: beliefs, biases and measures
============================================

**Climate change: beliefs, biases and measures**

Two Victoria University of Wellington academics will this month give a public lecture on aspects of climate change at the Manukau Institute of Technology.

_Climate change: beliefs, biases and measures_ will see Dr Marc Wilson from the School of Psychology and Professor Lionel Carter of the Antarctic Research Centre discuss how people think about the issue of climate change and aspects of the science underpinning the world’s changing climate.

While the majority of climate scientists believe the climate is changing and that human activities are a key contributor, surveys suggest that a proportion of the general public still doubt that this is the case or deny it altogether.

By drawing on key aspects of human psychology, Dr Wilson will explore how people think about the world, and how these views provide foundations and set up biases which influence scientific perspectives, including those on climate change.

Following on from this, Professor Carter will discuss some of the manifestations of climate change, particularly with regard to the oceans.

The oceans make up 71 per cent of the Earth’s surface and scientists show they are playing a major role in sparing the planet from the full force of climate change. In response, however, the oceans themselves are changing.

Professor Carter will explain the consequences of this response and the measures that are being taken to adapt to them.

**Where:** Manukau Institute of Technology Theatre, Newbury Street, Otara, Auckland  
**When:** Wednesday 22 July, 2015 (5.30pm-8pm)
