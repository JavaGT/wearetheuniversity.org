More European opportunities for Victoria students

Victoria's students will benefit from increased international study opportunities as a result of two recent study exchange agreements with leading French and Polish universities, says Pro Vice-Chancellor International Professor Rob Rabel.

The most recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne University will allow Victoria students to spend a semester at one of the oldest and most famous universities in Europe. The agreement was signed by Sorbonne President Professor Pierre-Yves Henin, and Professor Rob Rabel.

The agreement followed an earlier exchange agreement signed between Victoria and the Warsaw School of Economics, one of the best business schools in Europe. The agreement promotes student exchanges and general co-operation between the universities, and was signed by Warsaw School of Economics Rector Adam Budnikowski and by Professor Rabel in the presence of New Zealand Ambassador to Poland Philip Griffiths.

The Warsaw School of Economics was this year ranked by the Financial Times as the third best economics graduate business school in Europe, and the agreement is Victoria's first signed with an Eastern European institution.
