Symposium to explore the science of intimate relationships

Victoria University will host six of the world’s top relationship psychology researchers for a one-day symposium in October.

The Symposium on ‘The Science of Intimate Relationships’ is being organised by Professor Garth Fletcher from Victoria’s School of Psychology, whose book of the same name has recently been published.

The symposium features six renowned American professors: Sarah Hrdy, Jeffry Simpson, Bruce Ellis, Lisa Diamond, Arthur Aron and Thomas Bradbury.

Professor Fletcher says the symposium is a unique opportunity for researchers, students, health professionals and clinicians, who will be able to hear from some of the world’s top intimate relationship academics.

“We have a stellar line up which promises to provide a fascinating and provocative interdisciplinary perspective. The presentations have been designed to focus on cutting-edge research into a wide range of topics including love, attachment, the relationship brain, sexuality, development, the role of evolution and health,” says Professor Fletcher.

Registrations to attend the symposium are now open.
