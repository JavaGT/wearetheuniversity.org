MyVictoria heralds new age for Victoria students, staff

The start of a new academic year today also marks the launch of Victoria University’s new web portal for students and staff, MyVictoria (http://myvictoria.ac.nz)

MyVictoria is an easy-to-use, web-based communication resource that brings to life an environment where anyone with an interest in the University can readily find, and share information. All this takes place within a secure and dynamic environment that each user personalises to reflect their information needs.

MyVictoria enables students and staff to access, initiate or customise all kinds of communication and information, from news channels to virtual communities and discussion boards in support of their university courses, activities, clubs and societies. It will enhance research, teaching and learning by removing administrative obstacles and extending student - lecturer engagement, and peer discussion beyond the classroom and empower staff with timely, role-based access to information relevant to their work.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor David Mackay, said as the University grew and became more complex, it faced increasing challenges in communicating with students, staff, alumni, prospective students and external stakeholders.

“The Internet is now one of the primary means that many audiences, and students in particular, use to get their information about Victoria, our degree and diploma programmes, our processes and structure. Students are increasingly living their lives online.

“While the University has been quick to put information on the Internet, it now needs to take a new step to improve the service it offers by customising that information and supplying it to individuals in a way that meets their needs. MyVictoria is not only a key way to do that but also a significant driver in changing our administrative and academic processes to meet the needs of the 21st Century.”
