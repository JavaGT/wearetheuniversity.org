**Guest UK scriptwriter to teach at International Institute of Modern Letters**

Successful international screenwriter, script adviser and teacher of screenwriting Kelly Marshall will teach the Master of Arts in Scriptwriting course at Victoria’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) next year.

Marshall is taking a year’s leave from her position as Course Leader of the Master of Arts in Screenwriting at the University of the Arts in London.

Ken Duncum, Director of Scriptwriting at the IIML, is delighted that Marshall has been confirmed as his replacement for 2014.

“The depth of her experience in both screenwriting and script development will bring valuable new insights to the course, and an international perspective will provide an exciting resource for the class,” he says.

Working as a writer in both live action and animation, Marshall’s work has been screened on BBC, Nickelodeon, Granada TV, Scottish TV, Carlton TV and Channel 5, and she currently has four original TV and feature film projects in development.

A recent family feature script won four United States screenwriting awards—Overall Winner at the Illinois International Film Festival, Solstice Film Festival, Writer's Place and WriteMovies—and was a finalist in three other competitions.

Marshall has devised and led screenwriting courses in Britain, Europe and Singapore, and also teaches at the SMART Academy of Writing in Kent.

She has served on the judging panel of BAFTA’s 60 Seconds of Fame, the British Animation Awards, Screen South’s Digital Shorts and the New Zealand Writers Guild’s 2010 Script Writer Awards.

**Applications for the 2014 Master of Arts in Scriptwriting close on Monday 18 November. Visit www.victoria.ac.nz/modernletters/study/courses/crew-592**
