New Director for Institute of Policy Studies
============================================

**Tuesday, 21 January 2003, 9:18 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

From academia to the upheaval of East Timor and the politics of the Beehive, the new Director of the Institute of Policy Studies at Victoria University has a unique perspective on policymaking.  
Dr Andrew Ladley has been on leave of absence from Victoria's School of Law since 1999, where he had taught from 1987. He firstly served as Legal Adviser in the United Nations mission in East Timor, and then in New Zealand, as Chief of Staff and Coalition Manager in the Office of former Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Jim Anderton.  
For his work in East Timor, Dr Ladley was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit and received the inaugural Peacebuilders Award of the New Zealand National Commission for UNESCO in the year 2000.  
Dr Ladley has Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Laws degrees from the University of Cape Town and Master of Laws and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from the University of London.  
The Institute of Policy Studies is part of Victoria University's School of Government that was launched by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Helen Clark, in September last year.  
Victoria University Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Matthew Palmer said it was remarkably good fortune that Dr Ladley was available to take over as Institute Director.  
"The Institute of Policy Studies, as major component of the School of Government, will fulfil a key role in meeting the School's vision to be an independent, internationally respected centre for learning, research and professional development in public sector issues and management.  
"Dr Ladley, with both his substantial academic qualifications and achievements and his first hand intimate knowledge of the workings of government from three years in the Beehive, has the skills, knowledge and contacts to ensure that vision is fulfilled."  
Established in 1983, the Institute of Policy Studies exists to promote study, research and discussion of issues of public policy, both foreign and domestic, and to be at the forefront of major themes of policy development. As a link between academic research and public policy, it provides opportunities for independent, detached study and for neutral and informed discussion of issues that are important to New Zealand.
