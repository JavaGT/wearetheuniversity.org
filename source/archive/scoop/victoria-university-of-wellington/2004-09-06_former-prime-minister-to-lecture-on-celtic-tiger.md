MEDIA RELEASE 6 September 2004

Former Prime Minister to lecture on ‘Celtic Tiger’

The Republic of Ireland’s unprecedented economic growth during the 1990s will be explored by former Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Dr Garret FitzGerald, at Victoria University on Wednesday 8 September.

Dr FitzGerald, an internationally respected economist, academic, journalist and former politician, will deliver an address entitled The Celtic Tiger: 8% in 8 Years. He will offer an insider’s perspective of how the Republic of Ireland almost doubled its Gross Domestic Product in the last decade, looking at factors such as European Union membership, low corporate tax rates and investment in education and information technology training.

Dr FitzGerald, who served two periods as Taoiseach between 1981 and 1987, played an instrumental role in preparing Ireland’s economy for the shift from being rural-based and underdeveloped to technology-based and booming.

Head of Victoria’s Irish-Scottish Studies Programme, Dr Brad Patterson, says Dr FitzGerald is regarded as a leading economic and political commentator.

“We’re excited to host such a respected statesman within the world scene. Since he retired from politics, Dr FitzGerald has been in great demand as a speaker, especially within the United States, and is also well-known for his weekly column in The Irish Times, focusing on economic, social and political affairs.

“The lecture will be of great interest to our students and Faculty but also to Wellington’s economists, those working in the public sector, politicians, and all people with links to the Republic of Ireland.”

The Celtic Tiger: 8% in 8 Years will be held on Wednesday 8 September at 6pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, Hunter Building, Gate 1 or 2, Victoria University, Kelburn Parade. Please RSVP to brad.patterson@vuw.ac.nz or 04 463 5132.
