University employment contract negotiations settle
==================================================

**Friday, 25 February 2000, 4:16 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Today’s settlement of collective employment contract negotiations at Victoria University has been welcomed by Acting Vice-Chancellor Roy Sharp.

The settlement represents an average 1.6% wage rise and means an extra $925 p.a. for each general staff member and an extra $800 p.a. for each academic staff member covered by the collective contracts.

The University has also agreed to an increase in parental leave provisions for staff. Staff are now eligible for nine weeks parental leave instead of the previous six weeks.

Professor Sharp said the final stages of the negotiation had been notable for the co-operative tone of the relationship between University management and union negotiators. “This augurs well for a productive and harmonious relationship in the future,” he said.

A number of working parties have been set up to look at issues of concern before the next contract is negotiated. Topics under discussion include academic and general staff workload, academic promotions and merging the academic and general collective employment contracts.

University staff who are currently on individual contracts will have the opportunity to join a collective contract.
