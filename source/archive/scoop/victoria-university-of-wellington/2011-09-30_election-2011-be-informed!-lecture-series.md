Election 2011: Be Informed! lecture series
==========================================

Election 2011: Be Informed! lecture series

A series of lectures by Victoria University political scientists is designed to get people up to speed with the 2011 election and the referendum on MMP.

The in-depth two-hour lectures cover campaigning, national identity, John Key's personality and politics, the media's role in the election and the referendum.

"Many people believe this election is a done deal but the referendum is what I refer to as the 'other' 2011 election-it could have lasting effects for the country," says Professor Nigel Roberts.

An expert on voting systems and an election-night commentator for TVNZ from 1987 until the last election in 2008, Professor Roberts will explore New Zealand's electoral system and the various options that will be presented.

"There's no such thing as a perfect electoral system so it's important to discuss the good points and the bad points-or, if you will, the strong points and the weak points-of a range of voting system options."

Victoria's Community Continuing Education programme is running the lecture series-Election 2011: Be Informed!-every Tuesday evening from 4 October until 1 November.

Door sales are available for each lecture at $30; pre sales $25 or $120 for the series.
