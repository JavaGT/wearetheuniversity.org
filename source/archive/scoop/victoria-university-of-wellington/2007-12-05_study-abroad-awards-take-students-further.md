**Study abroad awards take postgraduate students further**

Victoria postgraduate students have been awarded the greatest number of scholarships of all universities in the latest round of New Zealand Postgraduate Study Abroad Awards.

Funded by Education New Zealand, the awards help top postgraduate students gain short-term access to some of the best educational institutions and opportunities overseas. They also aim to  
raise the international profile and reputation of New Zealand’s universities and increase international education linkages and partnerships.

Victoria Scholarships Manager, Philippa Hay says 22 Masters and Doctoral students received awards up to $10,000 each for projects spanning the sciences, humanities, architecture and commerce. 72 awards were granted in total.

"Victoria students traditionally do quite well in these awards, but this round has been the most successful” .

Ms Hay says this type of funding for postgraduate study is often difficult to obtain and that international travel – to present at conferences, conduct fieldwork, or carry out co-operative research at another institution – is a very important part of postgraduate studies.

Of the 22 students, 14 are from the Faculty of Science, 4 from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, 3 from the Faculty of Commerce and Administration and 1 from the Faculty of Architecture and Design.

Students projects include a critical study of radical Islam in Malaysia, a history of marriage, citizenship and divorce in two British settler societies, seismic anisotrophy as a stress indicator on volcanoes, modelling land-use dynamics and change, urban growth assessment and prediction , and the ecology of coral reef fish in French Polynesia.
