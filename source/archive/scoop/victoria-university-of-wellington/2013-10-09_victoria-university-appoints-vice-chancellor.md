Victoria University appoints Vice-Chancellor

Chancellor Ian McKinnon announced today that the next Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of Victoria University of Wellington will be Professor Grant Guilford.

“Professor Guilford will bring a wealth of leadership experience to Victoria. He is an outstanding academic who has had a highly successful career in research and teaching. The Council of Victoria University believes his experience, knowledge and leadership style are the right mix to continue Victoria’s proud tradition of an institution of excellent academic standing with a world-class reputation,” says Chancellor McKinnon.

Professor Guilford is currently the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Auckland and a member of the Senior Management Team. He has successfully led large and complex academic organisations, beginning with the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences at Massey University and continuing to his current role as Dean of Sciences. The Faculty has approximately 850 staff and 7,500 students, including 1,400 postgraduates. It spans natural and social science disciplines, encompasses a number of professions and has revenues in excess of $180 million.

“Professor Guilford’s passion and drive for excellence make him an excellent choice to follow the current Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, under whose leadership Victoria University has gone from strength to strength.

“The role attracted high-calibre candidates from New Zealand and overseas. I would like to thank all those involved in the process and again extend my appreciation to Vice-Chancellor Professor Walsh for his exceptional leadership over the past nine years.”
