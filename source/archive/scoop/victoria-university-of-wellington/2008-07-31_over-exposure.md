Over Exposure.

Three young Victoria University directors will expose you to another way of life in their energetic, yet darkly sombre productions in early August.

The three plays, Finding the Sun, Banging Cymbal Clanging Gong and Fewer Emergencies are all 30-minutes long, and will be played one after another in the Studio 77 production Over Exposure.

Over Exposure is the first of four seasons of plays to be produced by the Victoria University Theatre programme’s 300 level directing course for 2008. The season sees the directorial debut for all three directors.

“It’s terrifying, yet exciting to know that our works will expose so much of ourselves. I feel I’m walking into a blinding light,” says Rachel Baker, director of Banging Cymbal, Clanging Gong.

Finding the Sun

Sex scandals and intergenerational conflict unfold in the New Zealand premiere of Edward Albee’s Finding the Sun, as we follow four couples around a beach in the new setting of 1960s America, in this comic yet unsettling satire, that Victoria University student and director William Donaldson calls “one of the sexiest plays to ‘come out’ of America!”.

“This production will not only question, but challenge your perceptions on relationships, life and love,” says William.  

Banging Cymbal, Clanging Gong

With sound and fury, a lone Barbarian woman tells her obscene yet beautiful tale, in an interpretation of New Zealand playwright, Jo Randerson’s monologue, Banging Cymbal, Clanging Gong.

“The production questions what it means to be civilised within a lonely world, challenging the smug and complacent. Girls like battles, beer and sex too, so I was immediately wooed by this bizarre misfit and the value of her story,” says the show’s director, Rachel Baker.

Fewer Emergencies

We find that things are improving day by day, with British political playwright, Martin Crimp’s Fewer Emergencies, also a New Zealand premiere, and directed by Victoria University’s Claire O'Loughlin.

Through vigorous storytelling and poignant imagery this ominous black comedy gives a positive outlook on a dark situation. Under the pressure of impending violence theatrical form is twisted and reality and unreality are blurred until both actors and audience are left questioning: are we watching, participating, or orchestrating the emergency?
