Wellington’s inaugural climate change festival

The International Day of Action on Climate Change will kick off in style at the inaugural Wellington Climate Change Festival this Saturday (November 4)

Festival spokesperson Benjamin Gleisner says the event aims to be informal and informative and runs from 11.30am till late at the Paramount Theatre.

“It offers all Wellingtonians an opportunity to get actively involved in the debate surrounding climate change in New Zealand and to learn about carbon neutral daily living. People are free to come and go, listen, absorb and participate in the activities as much as they want.”

The International Day of Action on Climate Change aims to raise awareness of the issue, and calls on world leaders to take urgent and meaningful action. It is timed to coincide with the start of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference in Nairobi on November 6.

The Climate Change Festival, sponsored by Victoria University of Wellington, will include documentary films, information stalls, a climate change science and policy workshop, presentations from key stakeholders and responses from political parties. There will be also be presentations and discussions around what you can do, including an audio link with British researcher, Dave Reay, whose recent book Climate Change Begins at Home inspires people to take individual action on climate change.
