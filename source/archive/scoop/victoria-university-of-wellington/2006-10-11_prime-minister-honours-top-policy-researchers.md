Prime Minister honours top policy researchers

The top scholars in Victoria University’s public policy, public management and strategic studies programmes will receive their prizes from Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Helen Clark, at the School of Government’s fourth anniversary celebrations tonight.

The School of Government was launched by Miss Clark in 2002 and is the home of the University’s public policy, public administration and strategic studies programmes.

The anniversary celebrations will be held in Lecture Theatre 1, Rutherford House, Pipitea Campus, starting at 5.30pm tonight.

Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, said the University appreciated Miss Clark’s ongoing support for the School and its programmes and students.

“In four years, the School has established itself as a leader in public policy analysis and research and New Zealand’s pre-eminent centre for the education of public sector leaders, building on Victoria’s long-standing reputation in this field. The University is proud to be a founding partner, with the New Zealand Government, in the Australia & New Zealand School of Government and to have established a strategic partnership with the States Services Commission to enhance the capability of the New Zealand public sector.”

Miss Clark will present five prizes. The three Prime Minister’s Prizes are for the best all-round academic performance in public policy, public management and strategic studies. The Bernard Galvin Prize is awarded annually to a student in the School who has demonstrated the best application of economic analysis to public policy or public management while the Holmes Prize is awarded for the best research paper or thesis in the Master of Public Policy, Public Management or Strategic Studies programmes.
