US poet Michael Palmer in Wellington

Legendary San Francisco poet Michael Palmer is travelling to Wellington for a master class with poets from Victoria University’s creative writing programme.

While in Wellington, Mr Palmer will give a public presentation at City Gallery. He will read from his work and be in conversation with New Zealand poet Bill Manhire, from Victoria’s International Institute of Modern Letters.

Date: Monday 5 May  
Time: 1.00 – 2.00pm  
Place: City Gallery

He is well known as a translator from French, Russian and Portuguese, and for major collaborations with dancers and artists.

Even more, he is celebrated for his own expressive lyrics. His poems are among the most beautifully written in the last 50 years – both resisting meaning and exploring new ways to bring it into being.

Michael Palmer is associated with a generation of poets which includes Robert Creeley, Robert Duncan, and Clark Coolidge –“poets working in the dark, and at the margins” – and with the LANGUAGE poets.

Michael Palmer: “One of America's most important poets...startlingly lyrical and visceral” —The Harvard Review.
