**Acclaimed international writer visits Wellington**

Scottish writer Janice Galloway will appear in conversation with Emily Perkins in Wellington next week as part of Victoria University’s International Institute of Modern Letters (IIML) _Writers on Mondays_ series at Te Papa.

Ms Galloway is known as one of Britain’s most versatile and gifted writers, celebrated for her novels, short fiction, memoirs, opera libretti and collaborative work with artists.

Her first novel, _The Trick is to Keep Breathing_, is widely regarded as a contemporary Scottish classic. She has received numerous international honours including the MIND Book of the Year, the Saltire Book of the Year Award, and the E.M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Most recently, the second volume of her ‘anti-memoirs’, _All Made Up_, was awarded Scottish Book of the Year.

“Janice Galloway’s memoirs and fiction are one-of-a-kind writing, triumphs of observation, humour and warm intelligence, which give a truly physical reading experience,” says Emily Perkins, a Senior Lecturer at the IIML.

“Her prose glows and crackles, telling stories with a fiery heart. She is a writer of great spirit—her books are playful, tough, and moving. We’re delighted that Wellington audiences will have this opportunity to experience her work in person.”

Ms Galloway’s visit to Wellington is jointly funded by the IIML and the Melbourne Writers’ Festival.

**Writers on Mondays event details**  
**When**: Monday 19 August, 12.15–1.15pm  
**Venue**: Te Marae, 4th Floor, Te Papa
