Appointment process for a new Vice-Chancellor
=============================================

**Monday, 7 August 2000, 1:07 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University's Council has chosen a short list of two candidates to be interviewed for the position of Vice-Chancellor, Chancellor Russell Marshall announced today.

The two candidates are Professor Neil Quigley, currently Dean of the Faculty of Commerce and Administration at Victoria University and Professor Stuart McCutcheon, Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Massey University.

"The interview process will take place at Victoria University during Monday 14 and Tuesday 15 August," says Mr Marshall.

"The candidates will meet with members of the Senior Management Team and members of the University Advisory Group on the morning of Monday 14 August.

"There will also be an opportunity for University staff to hear the candidates at two open fora on Monday 14 August."

Each candidate will give a 30 minute presentation on The Role of the Vice-Chancellor and will answer questions from the floor. The session will be chaired by Emeritus Professor Tim Beaglehole.

The sessions will be video taped and replayed for the benefit of University members who are unable to attend the 'live' sessions.

"Members of the University will be invited to send information, comments and opinions about the shortlisted candidates to the Advisory Group overseeing the appointment process," says Mr Marshall.
