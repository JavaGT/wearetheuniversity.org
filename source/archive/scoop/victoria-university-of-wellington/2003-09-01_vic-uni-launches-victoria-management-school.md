Vic Uni launches Victoria Management School
===========================================

If New Zealand managers want to stand out in the busy marketplace of the world economy, it will be creativity in management that will set them apart.

That's the focus of Victoria University's research and teaching team in the Victoria Management School, to be launched at a breakfast function at Te Papa Tongarewa, the Museum of New Zealand, on Friday September 5.

The Victoria Management School, and the School of Government, were formed last year to enhance the University's reputation as a centre for learning, research and professional development in commerce, administration and public policy.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon said the Victoria Management School had not rushed into its launch.

"The School's academics and researchers wanted to be clear what their strategic direction would be. They've recognised that in the crowded international marketplace for quality managers, the School's students and researchers need to stand apart. They also wanted to recognise Victoria's long standing in management, having established its first MBA degree 20 years ago.

"The School rightly believes that what will set apart the managers of the new millennium will be those with the ability to foster an environment of creativity where new ideas for products or running organisations are allowed to blossom. To that end, the Victoria Management School aims to be recognised as New Zealand's premier centre for creative management scholarship."

Head of School, Dr Brad Jackson, said much had been made of the need for innovation in management.

"But at the heart of innovation is the need to create something out of nothing, to constantly challenge the way we manage organisations and never be satisfied with the status quo. It's a theme the Wellington City Council has recognised in its move to establish the city as New Zealand's creative capital and why we've asked Peter Biggs, managing director of Clemenger BBDO, and the chair of Creative New Zealand, to speak at our breakfast launch."

Dr Jackson said many of the School's 37 academic staff are internationally-recognised leaders in research into management, Mâori business, human resources and industrial relations, and tourism management.

"We've already garnered three major Foundation for Research, Science and Technology grants that are examining new and better ways to manage and organise, and we plan to establish a new centre for Mâori business research. We've also revamped our highly regarded Master of Business Administration degree to meet contemporary business needs and are about to launch our International MBA in Hong Kong later this month. All up, it's an exciting time for the School."

Media are invited to the Breakfast Launch at Te Marae at Te Papa, starting at 7.30am on Friday September 5. For catering purposes, RSVP to Kate Kingston, Victoria Management School, on 04 463 5397.
