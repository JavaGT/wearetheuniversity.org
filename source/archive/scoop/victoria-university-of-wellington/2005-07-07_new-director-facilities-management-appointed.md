New Director, Facilities Management appointed

Victoria University’s new Director, Facilities Management, has wide-ranging experience in managing and operating complex community services and buildings.

Jenny Bentley will take up her new position at Victoria on August 15. As Director, Facilities Management, Ms Bentley will become a member of the University’s Senior Management Team and will report directly to Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh.

Ms Bentley is Director of Community Services at the Upper Hutt City Council and was previously Director of Community Facilities (1995-2004), Director of Corporate Services (1993-95) and Administration Manager (1987-93).

She is responsible for a large team of staff delivering a wide variety of community services in Upper Hutt, reporting to the Council’s Chief Executive. She has managed the Council's community facilities and Civic Buildings for 10 years and has been involved in a number of major projects, including managing the approval, design, construction and operating contract for the Council's Expressions Arts and Entertainment Centre.

Professor Walsh said Ms Bentley brought a wealth of experience to Victoria.

“Ms Bentley has an established track record for successfully completing major community projects as well as overseeing the upkeep of a wide variety of complex community facilities and operating vital community services. With several major capital works projects either recently completed or underway, Ms Bentley will have plenty of opportunity to apply those skills to a new environment.”

In social, economic, cultural and intellectual terms, Victoria is a vital contributor to the Wellington region, so I see the position, with its mix of roles, as a chance to strategically deliver on my passions for excellence and customer service.”
