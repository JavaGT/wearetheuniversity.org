Social and Cultural Studies Welcomes New Head of School

Victoria University gender expert Dr Jenny Neale has been appointed as the new Head of School for the School of Social and Cultural Studies. Her appointment begins on 1 July 2004.

Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of Humanities and Social Sciences, Professor Deborah Willis, welcomed Dr Neale to her new role.

“Dr Neale’s range of experience will be a great asset to the School and will help staff to continue building on the excellent work already in place to draw the diverse discipline areas within the school closer together,” she said.

Dr Neale has worked at Victoria University since 1987, transferring from the private sector where she worked as a research consultant. Since 1992, she has held the position of Programme Director of the MA (Applied) in Social Science Research and has also worked as the Deputy Dean of the Humanities and Social Sciences Faculty since July 2001.

Dr Neale, a former school teacher and graduate of both Massey and Victoria Universities completed her PhD in 1997 from Deakin University in Australia. She specialises in equity and social issues with specific interests in gender and disability issues. Her latest research on the relationships between sisters has been widely acknowledged since publication in April 2004.

Dr Jenny Neale replaces Associate Professor Ian Culpitt who has completed his term as Head of School. The School encompasses the Anthropology, Criminology, Social Policy, Social Research and Sociology programmes at Victoria.
