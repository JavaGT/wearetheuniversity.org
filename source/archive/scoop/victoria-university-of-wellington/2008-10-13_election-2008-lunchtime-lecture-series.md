**Election 2008 – Lunchtime Lecture Series**

Over the next two months Victoria University’s School of Government and the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) will host a series of lunchtime lectures on some of the key issues for the 2008 New Zealand general election.

“The series is an opportunity to delve behind the rhetoric of election year debate and examine the facts, figures and theories on criminal justice, tertiary education funding, the public service and voter behaviour,” says Director of IPS Professor Jonathan Boston.

The free lectures will be held from 12:30-1: 30pm in lecture theatre two, Government Buildings, 15 Lambton Quay on selected Mondays. All are invited to attend.

The lectures are:

· **Tertiary education funding with an election in mind**, ViceChancellor of Victoria University of Wellington Professor Pat Walsh (Monday 13 October).

· **Politics and Punitiveness: overcoming the criminal justice dilemma**, Senior Associate of the Institute of Policy Studies, Kim Workman and commentator Associate Professor of Religious Studies Chris Marshall (Monday 20 October).

· **The State of the State,** Visiting Senior Research Fellow Derek Gill and commentators Ross Tanner, President of the Institute of Public Administration New Zealand and Brenda Pilott, National Secretary of the Public Service Association (Monday 3 November).

· **Assessing the results,** Professor of Political Science Nigel Roberts and commentator Professor Jonathan Boston (Monday 10 November).
