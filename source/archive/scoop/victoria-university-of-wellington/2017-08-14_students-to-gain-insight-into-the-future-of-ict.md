**Students to gain insight into the future of ICT**  
Six Victoria University of Wellington students have won places on a two-week ICT training course in China through Huawei’s Seeds for the Future programme.

Seeds for the Future selects high-achieving students from around the world for an all-expenses trip to the headquarters of global telecommunications company Huawei, to gain practical insights into the future of the ICT industry.

The undergraduate students from Victoria University will travel to Beijing and Shenzhen in China later this month. This is the first cohort of Victoria students to take part in the international programme.

Professor Mengjie Zhang from Victoria’s School of Engineering and Computer Science says the excursion is a fantastic opportunity for the students.

“They’ll get first-hand work experience into the work of a multinational ICT company—learning about the latest technological developments, getting hands-on experience in Huawei’s laboratories, and meeting key people.

“They’ll also experience Chinese history, culture and language, and get to visit historical landmarks. I’m sure the students will find it very useful.

“Victoria University is dedicated to being a leader in imagining and exploring the possibilities of a digital age, and is grateful to Huawei for extending this opportunity.”

Andrew Bowater, Director of Public Affairs at Huawei New Zealand says the company was impressed with Victoria’s students.

“The entrants from Victoria University were high calibre—intelligent and enthusiastic young people. We’re excited to have the six successful applicants take part in the programme. It provides a vital link between classroom learning and the type of real world situations students will face once they enter the workforce.”

The ICT industry is hugely important to Wellington, says the capital’s Deputy Mayor Paul Eagle.

“About 10 percent of Wellingtonians, or 13,000 people, are working in the technology sector. It’s great to see our young talent seize opportunities to explore the industry through programmes like Huawei Seeds for the Future.”

Huawei is the world’s largest telecommunications vendor. Its Seeds for the Future programme launched in 2008, and has since been implemented in 96 countries, giving opportunities to over 30,000 students from 280 universities.

The six Victoria students selected are:

• Valerie Chan, who is studying a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science and Statistics  
• Liam Dennis, who is studying a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Software Engineering, and a Bachelor of Commerce in Economics and Finance  
• Edward Haslam, who is studying a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science  
• Joely Huang, who is studying a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Software Engineering  
• Patrick Lynch, who is studying a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science  
• Patrick Savill, who is studying a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Electronic and Computer Systems Engineering.
