Creating a cultural hub for the Pipitea campus

Creating a cultural hub for the Pipitea campus

  
MEDIA ADVISORY

  
Colin McCahon’s Gate III (1970) – the centrepiece of Victoria University's art collection, which previously hung in the Adam Art Gallery on Victoria's Kelburn Campus – was installed in the foyer of Rutherford House on Victoria's Pipitea Campus on 21 September.

Moving Gate III into the city is part of the gallery’s long-term plan to bring key items from the VUW Collection into greater focus in all the university's campuses, where they will be more accessible to students and the general public. This has become increasingly pressing as Victoria University has expanded across a number of venues since the gallery first took over care of works from the university’s art collection.

The gallery intends to treat the foyer of Rutherford House as an off-site extension of the gallery where other prominent works from the collection will be hung, and temporary works will from time to time be installed. To inaugurate this initiative, an impermanent sound installation is currently being developed by Dugal McKinnon, who is Interim Director of the Lilburn Electroacoustic Music Studios and Programme Leader in Sonic Arts at Victoria University. This will be installed in the foyer in February 2008 to coincide with the International Festival of the Arts and as part of the Adam Art Gallery’s Sound Check sound/art exhibition and performance series.

Making this space into a cultural hub for the city campus will create a significant presence for the Adam Art Gallery in the city, raising its profile as a cultural provider and acting as an important means to attract students and visitors to the gallery.
