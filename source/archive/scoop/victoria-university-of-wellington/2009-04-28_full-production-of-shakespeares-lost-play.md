Full production of Shakespeare’s lost play
==========================================

**Tuesday, 28 April 2009, 11:00 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

  
**First full production of Shakespeare’s lost play to take place in Wellington.**

Think again if you thought world premieres of William Shakespeare plays were a thing of the past.

In May 2009 the lost tragicomedy _The History of Cardenio,_ by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, reconstructed by world renowned Shakespeare scholar Professor Gary Taylor, will be presented by third year Theatre students at Victoria University of Wellington.

Based on Lewis Theobald’s _Double Falsehood,_ an 18th century adaptation of Shakespeare and Fletcher’s now-lost original, Professor Taylor’s work takes us closer than ever before to this little-known play.

“How often do you get to see what one genius (Shakespeare) does with the work of another genius (Cervantes)?” says Professor Taylor. “There’s a reason we talk about live theatre, because it’s only in a full-scale performance like this that Shakespeare’s text really comes alive again.”

Live the experience of a 17th century theatre-goer without traveling through time! Professor David Carnegie’s production reconstructs the staging of a renaissance performance; Studio 77 has been transformed into a Jacobean private playhouse.

Professor Carnegie, the play’s director, says: “Plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries come alive with a special magic when the audience is on all four sides, as at the Globe or Blackfriars, and when the actors acknowledge the presence of the audience”.

A tale of hearts broken and mended, friendships betrayed and rebuilt, sanity lost and found, dukes, shepherds and Don Quixote, joy and misery, laughter and tears, _The History of Cardenio_ will take you on a wild ride through the whole gamut of human emotions.
