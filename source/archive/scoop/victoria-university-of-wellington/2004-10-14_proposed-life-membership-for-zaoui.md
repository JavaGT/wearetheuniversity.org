Proposed Life Membership For Zaoui

Victoria University students have called a Special General Meeting for tomorrow, Friday 15 October, with a motion on the table to give Algerian refugee Ahmed Zaoui life membership of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association, said president Amanda Hill today.

“Any ten members can call an SGM, and there is a strong feeling among students that Zaoui has not received justice in New Zealand” said Hill. “By making him a life member, students wish to show support for Zaoui as the fight continues for his release”.

The Auckland University Students’ Association made Zaoui their honorary spokesperson on Algerian affairs earlier this month.

An SGM must have one hundred people present, and a life membership requires two thirds of the votes. It will occur at 12.45 in the Quad, Kelburn campus of Victoria University. It will coincide with end of term celebrations including music, bouncy boxing and fire eaters.
