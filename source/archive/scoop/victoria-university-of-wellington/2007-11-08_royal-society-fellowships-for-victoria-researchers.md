Royal Society fellowships for Victoria researchers

The awarding of three of four James Cook Research Fellowships to Victoria University researchers reflects the success of Victoria's strategy in recent years to develop science as a distinctive strength of the university.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says the Fellowships, announced today by the Royal Society of New Zealand, are the most prestigious awarded to cutting-edge scientific research.

"This goes to show the value placed on Victoria University research by leading organisations such as the Royal Society, and is a success we look to build on under our new Investment Plan," Professor Walsh says.

Professors Paul Callaghan, Rod Downey and Kenneth McNatty are the latest recipients of the Fellowships that allow researchers to concentrate on their chosen study for two years.

Professor Callaghan's project will focus on New Zealand leadership in magnetic resonance, a physical phenomenon that has numerous applications in medicine and chemistry.

Professor Downey’s project will investigate the recent growth area in fundamental mathematics – the very nature of computation.

Professor McNatty will look at the environmental and nutritional influences on reproductive health – a study that aims to pinpoint the role of environmental contaminants and lifestyle factors on New Zealanders' declining fertility rate.

The Fellows were selected by the James Cook Research Fellowship Selection Committee, chaired by Professor Marston Conder, President of the Academy Council of the Royal Society of New Zealand.
