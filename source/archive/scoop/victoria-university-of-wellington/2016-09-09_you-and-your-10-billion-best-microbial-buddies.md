**You and your 10 billion best microbial buddies**

  
Two leading biomedical researchers, Professor Anne La Flamme from Victoria University of Wellington and Dr Elizabeth Forbes-Blom from the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, will discuss the role of the body’s microbes in shaping our immune system in an upcoming lecture.

Professor La Flamme from Victoria’s School of Biological Sciences has been researching immunology and autoimmunity disorders for two decades.

“The immune system is a vibrant and ever-changing network of specialised cells that protect us against diseases caused by viruses, bacteria and parasites. Every day we are exposed to a wide array of disease-causing organisms but also an even greater number of non-disease-causing organisms,” says Professor La Flamme.

In her talk, Professor La Flamme will discuss the body’s relationship with the larger microbes—worms—and how they can be advantageous to improved health.

In the second talk, Dr Forbes-Blom, who is the Gut Immunology Team Leader at the Malaghan Institute, will delve into some of the other ways immune systems are shaped by our microbes.

“Gut microbes co-evolve in a mutual relationship with their host, and play a significant role in shaping the host’s immune system,” says Dr Forbes-Blom. “This is a lifelong partnership, and understanding how microbes regulate the immune system might hold the key to health and wellbeing.”

The lecture will be followed by a panel discussion.

**When:** 6pm, Wednesday 14 September

**Where:** Maclaurin Lecture Theatre 103 (MCLT103), Gate 3, Kelburn Parade, Victoria University of Wellington

**RSVP:** Before Monday 12 September. Email chrissy.boulton@vuw.ac.nz with ‘microbes’ in the subject line
