New Zealand’s role in a new world order

**New Zealand’s role in a new world order**

A Victoria University Professor says New Zealand is in a unique position to navigate through the next phase of global history as the West finds its dominance challenged by other cultures.

“Modern society was forged by Western cultures of the Enlightenment. However, the Enlightenment has run up against immovable objects in non-Western religions and cultures,” says Professor James Liu of Victoria’s School of Psychology.

“We have entered into an age where no one civilization or nation is capable of dictating unilaterally to others.”

In his inaugural lecture on Tuesday, 28 September, Professor Liu will draw from his award-winning research on history and identity, chart the rise of Asian and Islamic cultures as part of the fabric of “global consciousness”, and map out possible futures for global society.

Professor Liu says New Zealand is well positioned to ride the next wave of global history as western countries face the rise of Asian and Islamic cultures.

“New Zealand is a unique nation where a symbolic biculturalism has seen Māori symbols significantly incorporated into the national consciousness. There are very few nations where an indigenous people who have been colonised have that kind of symbolic status. This gives Kiwis a unique window on the kind of processes that are happening in the world today, but on a much larger scale.”

Professor Liu says that the rise of China as a global power presents considerable challenges to the dominant western way of seeing things.

“The Chinese model of benevolent authoritarianism is in contrast to our western liberal democratic traditions. Yet it has been fundamental to the rapid economic growth of China and other East Asian societies in recent decades.”

Professor Liu says one of the great challenges facing the world today is for these two different cultures to coexist in harmony.

“The only other option is a clash of civilisations—and that is not an option because it effectively means the end of the world as we know it.”

Victoria Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says that Professor Liu is an outstanding teacher and researcher who has applied the study of psychology to critical issues of ethnic and cultural difference in society.

“In addition, he has been instrumental in establishing the Centre for Applied Cross Cultural Research (CACR) at Victoria. This centre is one of the most highly regarded of its kind in the world, and contributes regularly to national debate regarding issues of ethnic diversity and social cohesion in New Zealand.”

As well as being Deputy Director of CACR, Professor Liu is also an executive committee member of the Asian Association of Social Psychology.

Professor Walsh says Victoria’s Inaugural lecture series is an opportunity for new professors to provide the wider community, along with family, friends and colleagues, an insight into their specialist area of study.

“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors.”

**The public lecture is at 6pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Kelburn Parade, at Victoria University’s Kelburn Campus on Tuesday, 28 September. To RSVP, email [rsvp@vuw.ac.nz](mailto:rsvp@vuw.ac.nz?subject=Liu) with ‘Liu’ in the subject line.**
