MEDIA RELEASE 30 June 2003

Post-Iraq: The State Of International Law

The state of international law post the invasion of Iraq and overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime is the focus of the inaugural lecture by Victoria University Professor Campbell McLachlan.

Professor McLachlan, who joined Victoria in April and as Professor of International Law and Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Law, will give his lecture, After Baghdad: Conflict or Coherence in International Law? at the University's School of Law on July 2.

\"I'll take recent events as a spring-board to open up a broader debate about the fragmentation of international law; the ways in which different values in the multilateral system can come into conflict with each other; and what, if anything, we can do about it."

Professor McLachlan, who graduated with a First Class Honours degree in law from Victoria in 1983, returns to his alma mater after a high profile career in law in London.

After graduating, Professor McLachlan headed to Europe where he completed a Diploma cum laude from the Hague Academy of International Law in 1985 and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of London in 1988.

He then practised in the field of international law and was a partner in the firm of Herbert Smith and Head of its International Law Practice Group. He was also a member of the Law Faculty of the University of Cambridge, taught at the University of London and was Joint Honorary Secretary of the British Branch of the International Law Association.
