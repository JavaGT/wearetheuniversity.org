Morgan family give $250,000 to Antarctic Research

$250,000 donation by Morgan family to Antarctic Research Centre

The Morgan Family Charitable Foundation has donated $250,000 to Victoria University’s Antarctic Research Centre (ARC) through the Victoria University Foundation.

Staged over two years, the grant will fund a number of initiatives including a Research Fellowship on Ice Sheets and Sea Level – to improve understanding of how ice sheets are likely to contribute to rising sea levels and the potential effect this could have in the southwest Pacific region.

Victoria graduate Dr Gareth Morgan became involved with the ARC while researching and writing his latest book Poles Apart: beyond the shouting, who’s right about climate change? ARC professors Peter Barrett, Lionel Carter and Dave Lowe were amongst the scientists that played a key role in educating Dr Morgan and fellow author John McCrystal on the relevant issues.

Dr Morgan says his experience as a “juror” in assessing the evidence in the climate change debate made it abundantly clear that good scientific research was critical to ongoing understanding of the global warming issue and its risks. The grant from his family’s charitable foundation will advance the contribution from the internationally-recognised ARC research projects, which focus on understanding Antarctica’s climate history and processes, and their influence on the global climate system, especially on New Zealand and the southwest Pacific region.

Professor Peter Barrett says: “We already have a strong ice modeling group with international connections, so we think enhancing our knowledge of sea level rise as a consequence of ice melt is a logical next step. It is great to have the support of the Morgan family to enable us to take this step.”

Dr Morgan says the project is a natural fit for the family. One of the Morgan Family Charitable Foundation objectives is the funding of research into public policy issues and communication of findings to the public. It identifies public access to well-communicated research as critical to a well-informed public. The ARC also emphasises clear communication of complex science to schools, the public, and policy makers.

“Given the estimates of anthropogenic contributions to climate change remain subject to some uncertainty, and given that policy responses cannot wait until we have absolute certainty, it is imperative that the science continues to narrow it down to minimise the chances of inappropriate and costly policy responses,” says Dr Morgan.

Dr Morgan was recently presented with a Distinguished Alumni Award by Victoria University. These awards were inaugurated three years ago to recognise outstanding achievements by its graduates.
