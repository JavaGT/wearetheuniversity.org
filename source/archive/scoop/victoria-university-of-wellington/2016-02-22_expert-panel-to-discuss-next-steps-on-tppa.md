**Expert panel to discuss next steps on TPPA**

Victoria University experts say it is critical people understand the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA) and will tomorrow (Tuesday 23 February 2016) host a public seminar to promote discussion.

Meredith Kolsky Lewis, Gordon Anderson, Carwyn Jones and Susy Frankel, from the Faculty of Law, will give commentary about the agreement at the seminar from 10am to 12 noon at the Faculty of Law on Lambton Quay, Wellington. There will be opportunity for the audience to comment and ask questions as well.

“There is high public interest in the TPPA and informed discussion is important to ensure people understand what the agreement really means for New Zealand,” says Professor Frankel, Director of the New Zealand Centre of International Economic Law (NZCIEL). “We are expecting lively discussion tomorrow.”

Meredith Kolsky Lewis will discuss the next steps in the ratification process in the United States and prospects for the agreement; Gordon Anderson will talk to the TPPA labour chapter; Carwyn Jones will address the implications of the TPPA for Māori and rights under the Treaty of Waitangi; and Susy Frankel will cover intellectual property issues and their relationship with investment under the new agreement.

Professor Lewis from SUNY Buffalo Law School, Buffalo, New York, is also part of the Victoria Faculty of Law (part-time). She is an internationally renowned scholar of international economic law, with a particular emphasis on international trade law and the World Trade Organization, and has commentated and published extensively about the TPPA.
