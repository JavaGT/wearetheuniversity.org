Marsden funding for New Zealand's best and brightest

Alpine faults, colonial literature, sexuality in the media and anti-cancer enzymes are research topics among 18 Victoria projects awarded just under $6m in the prestigious Marsden funding round.

The total awarded to cutting-edge research at Victoria is up from $4.7m last year to $5.97 in this latest round, a boost that Professor Charles Daugherty, Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research) attributes to the high quality of research across a range of disciplines spanning sciences, the humanities, social sciences and commerce.

"This is one of the most competitive and rigorous rounds of Government funding awarded to projects of the highest calibre," Professor Daugherty says.

"More than half of our researchers invited to submit a full proposal were successful in the final round."

He says the University's up-and-coming researchers did especially well, with nine receiving Marsden Fast-Start grants.

Administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand, the Marsden fund received a $2.25m budget boost from the Government this year, enabling a greater investment in New Zealand’s early career researchers.

The recipients of full Marsden grants distributed over three years are:

\- Professor Kim Sterelny, School of History, Philosophy, Political Science and International Relations: Human uniqueness: a bio-cultural synthesis. $495,000
