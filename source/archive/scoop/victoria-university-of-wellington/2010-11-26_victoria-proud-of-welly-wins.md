**Victoria proud of Welly wins**

Two inspirational science leaders scooped two categories at last night’s Wellys—the Wellingtonian of the Year Awards.

Dr Gillian Turner was awarded the Education category in recognition of her work inspiring generations of young scientists through science fairs, teaching, student advice and outreach at Victoria University

Professor Sir Paul Callaghan won the Science and Technology section for his world-leading work in nuclear magnetic resonance and nanotechnology–“real science that’s having a real impact on the world and New Zealand’s place in it”.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says it is great to see such public recognition of science research and teaching.

“I congratulate both, not only for the win last night but for their years of dedication and hard work for New Zealand’s benefit.”

“Dr Turner has been instrumental in encouraging students to take up science and her passion has captivated new audiences through her popular science book _North Pole South Pole_.”

“Professor Callaghan and the team he leads conduct world-class research in the field of magnetic resonance. It is fitting that a scientist of Professor Callaghan’s standing has been honoured by the city.”

Victoria University will also confer an Honorary Doctorate on Professor Callaghan at its December Graduation.
