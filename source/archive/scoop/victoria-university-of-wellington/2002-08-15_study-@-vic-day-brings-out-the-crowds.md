Study @ Vic Day brings out the crowds
=====================================

**Thursday, 15 August 2002, 12:24 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

Victoria University hums to a different beat as thousands of people attend this year’s Study @ Vic Open Day.  
Last year up to 3500 people – from adults returning to study to secondary school students from Auckland to Christchurch – took the opportunity to check out the University and on Friday 30 August, the campus looks set to be inundated again.  
The reaction was very positive, with those attending really appreciating hearing from current students about studying at Victoria. Comments such as: “Love it - can’t wait to come!” and “This uni is cool” were commonplace.  
And in that funky vein, a highlight of this year’s day will be when up-and-coming Wellington band, Black Seeds, play their hip dub-reggae-ska music at lunchtime in the Quad.  
Study @ Vic Day is a chance for potential students – as well as their whanau, family and friends – to find out what it’s like to study at Victoria University.  
The day starts in the Quad outside the Library at 8.30am where there will be information and free Vic water bottles available.  
There will be tours of the Kelburn and downtown campuses – including a special Café Crawl of Vic’s best eating spots – while lecture sessions running throughout the morning will give potential students the chance to meet lecturers, tutors and support staff and gain an insight into the range of degrees and subjects on offer and the careers they can lead to.  
There will also be heaps of entertainment at lunchtime in the Quad where there will be student clubs to check out and BBQ food.  
The Vic Uni Expo, on the overbridge that crosses Kelburn Parade, will have displays on many of the subjects and services on offer at Victoria. The Expo runs from 9am to 3pm.
