**_Drop The Mic & VUW Present…_**  
  
Fairlie Amusing!  
  
Are you fairlie fed up? Fairlie worried about the world? Living in a fairlie awful flat with fairlie awful flat mates?

Are you a young person with a fairlie unfortunate future, fairlie bad university grades and a fairlie futile sex life?

Well so are we! And we all deserve a night of fairlie good laughs, music and debauchery to round out a fairlie long trimester!

Drop The Mic brings you their latest comedy offering live from Studio 77 on Fairlie Terrace, Fairlie Amusing! A comedy variety show like no other! Featuring fairlie funny sketches and fresh stand-up comedy from young adults with relatable and unique viewpoints aptly delivered with their sharp wits and tongues in their cheeks. You’ll meet some kooky characters along the way like that hilariously hapless dorky girl we all know and an “edgy” try-hard youth pastor who really understands today’s youth and won’t stop saying words like “Rad,” “Epic” or “Massive.” There truly is something for everyone living the life of a young person!

After their hugely successful season of _Mission: Improv-able_, Drop The Mic (THEA 323) returns with a brand-new show created entirely by the students about the ups & downs of being a young adult in 2019. They have been studying with help from guest tutors Thomas LaHood on Clowning, Brynley Stent (_Funny Girls_) on Sketch comedy and Eli Matthewson (_Jono and Ben, The Male Gayz_) on Stand-up comedy. Don’t miss these rising artists and comedians who are set to make a mark on comedy and theatre for years to come.

**WHERE?** Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn, VUW Campus.

**WHEN?** Wednesday 5th June to Saturday 8th June at 7:00 pm.
