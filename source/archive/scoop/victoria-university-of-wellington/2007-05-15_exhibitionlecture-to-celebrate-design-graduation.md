Exhibition and lecture to celebrate design graduation

An exhibition of student work and a public lecture will celebrate graduation by students in the Victoria University’s reconfigured School of Design this week.

Acting Head of the School of Design, Professor Simon Fraser, said the public lecture and exhibition celebrated the success of the School’s graduates, who graduate on Wednesday (16 May) and the School’s transformation into a new entity focused on digital media and industrial design.

“There are compelling reasons for collaboration between these two disciplines. It is an opportunity to act in the spirit of our own award winning Design Led Futures programme, to take the initiative, to reinvent ourselves and reinvent our future.”

Professor Fraser said digital technology was shaping the future of the School.

“Digital technology is our future. Increasingly it is raises questions about what we design, as well as influencing the way we understand design, the way we undertake design, and the way we collaborate and communicate in the act of designing.

“This changing context has not only inspired the unique character of the Digital Media programme, it is also redefining Industrial Design at Victoria and preparing the way for the creation of interaction design collaboration.”

The public lecture will also mark the opening of an exhibition of student work from the School of Design, Designed Futures, which will run until June 1. The exhibition will be open to the public from 9am to 5pm daily Monday to Friday.
