MEDIA ALERT:

  
UK expert to deliver public lecture on employment in the film industry

A UK expert on employment in the creative industries, Professor Keith Randle from the University of Hertfordshire Business School, United Kingdom, is visiting the Victoria Management School next week. During his visit he will give a public lecture about employment in the film industry titled ‘Industry, Insecurity and Inequality: Getting in and Getting on in Film Production’.

Based on studies in the US and UK, Professor Randle will explore the relationship between the structure of the industry and the experience of work in film production.

Work in film is dominated by freelancing and temporary projects. Although barriers to entry to the industry are low, barriers to success are high and there is evidence of marginalisation on the basis of ethnicity, gender and age. Nevertheless, employees in film production report a kind of 'precarious stability' where strategies can be employed to reduce uncertainty and ensure a degree of continuity in employment and career development.

  
Public lecture: ‘Industry, Insecurity and Inequality: Getting in and Getting on in Film Production’

Date: Thursday 11 November

Time: 6-7pm

Location: Government Building Lecture Theatre 3 (GBLT3), 55 Lambton Quay, Wellington
