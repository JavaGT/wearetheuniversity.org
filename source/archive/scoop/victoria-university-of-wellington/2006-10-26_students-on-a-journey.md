Students on a journey

The transition from secondary school to university is often mentally challenging, but a group of Wellington students is preparing to make it a physical challenge as well.

Fifty-eight students from secondary schools participating in Victoria University’s Māori and Pacific Outreach Programme are walking from Heretaunga College in Upper Hutt to the University’s Te Herenga Waka Marae in Kelburn on Saturday 28 October. Covering a distance of 37km, the walk is expected to take most of the day.

The students, from Wainuiomata High, and Naenae, Taita, Heretaunga, Aotea, Porirua and Bishop Viard Colleges, will spend the night on the Marae.

Everard Halbert, from the Outreach Programme, says the walk will be a valuable and challenging experience for the students.

“It is symbolic of the belief that there are many obstacles between secondary school and tertiary education but we believe that they can be overcome by putting one foot in front of another. It’s about putting words into action.

“Victoria has an ongoing commitment to Māori and Pacific students, and an event such as this engages the community. These are communities working hard to support these young people, and further education is one of the keys.”
