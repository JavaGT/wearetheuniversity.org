MEDIA RELEASE

False memories cause unjust convictions

Inaccurate or false memories can put innocent people in jail, according to a Victoria University Professor of Psychology.

Professor Maryanne Garry will discuss the causes and consequences of false memories in her inaugural professorial lecture next Tuesday at Victoria University.

Professor Garry studies how people’s memories become distorted, especially memories from long ago. She is particularly interested in how we remember—and misremember—our lives.

“Memories are active reconstructions. They’re stories we tell ourselves and each other, blending reality and fiction to keep us happy and bond us together,” says Professor Garry.

“But our wrong memories can have devastating effects—ending careers, tearing families apart. This is especially true when people remember entire events that never even happened.”

She says humans tend to remember the gist of events, rather than accurate details.

“There’s a misconception that our brains record all our experiences accurately, like a human version of MySky.”

Professor Garry worked to set up Innocence Project New Zealand, part of a world-wide organisation that investigates and overturns wrongful convictions.

She has received a number of awards over her academic career, including a University Teaching Excellence Award in 2009, and the University Research Excellence Award in 2003. In 2008 she became President of the Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition.

Victoria University Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research, Professor Neil Quigley, says Professor Garry has established an impressive international reputation as an expert on memory.

“Professor Garry’s superb teaching and research show the broad range of her skills. She has contributed much to the debate around witness memory in New Zealand and internationally.”

Professor Quigley says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for new professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.

“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors.”

The public lecture is at 6pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Gate 1 or 2, Kelburn Parade on Tuesday 3 November. The lecture is full although media are welcome to attend.
