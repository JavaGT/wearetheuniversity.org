Victoria University Annual Report, 2008

**Annual Report highlights success of staff and students**

Victoria University of Wellington’s 2007 _Annual Report_ highlights a year of achievements by students, staff and alumni.

ViceChancellor Professor Pat Walsh said the report, recently tabled in Parliament, outlined a range of the University’s successes from scholarships to awards for academic excellence.

“Last year Victoria University continued to be a leading contributor to climate change research in New Zealand. Of note was the appointment of climate scientist Martin Manning as Professor and Research Fellow in Climate Change.

“Staff achievements included three of last year’s prestigious James Cook Research Fellowships being awarded to Victoria University’s scientific researchers – Professors Paul Callaghan, Rod Downey and Ken McNatty.”

Victoria University’s students were awarded for their achievements with more than $1.5 million of the Government’s Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships received by the University’s graduate or postgraduate students. Victoria University graduate Amanda Gilbertson was one of three New Zealand students selected for a Rhodes Scholarship and will study towards a DPhil in anthropology at Oxford University.

The report showed that, excluding the New Zealand School of Music, the University achieved growth in fulltime student numbers of 2.6 per cent to more than 17,000 students.

“I believe this growth reflects a winning combination – a quality university offering an outstanding student learning experience with a central location in New Zealand’s beautiful capital city.” The University’s _Annual Report_ can be viewed online at www.vuw.ac.nz/annualreports
