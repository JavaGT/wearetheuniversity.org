Hard work brings plays to life

Three Victoria University students have been hard at work crafting and shaping a season of short plays to be performed from September 6.

Moment / Gone – three plays now will be the culmination of weeks of intensive directing work for these THEA 304 Directing students. Each has chosen a short play and has been challenged to create fresh and exciting theatre. The season which runs between 6 September and 9 September will work as the major assessment for these students, as they see their visions being brought to life on stage.

The productions themselves are a diverse mix of drama, comedy and the avant-garde, with each exploring aspects of the immediate nature of life.

Time Flies written by David Ives and directed by Sarah Silver is a bright but fleeting comedy that follows two mayflies that must battle with frogs, love, life, death and David Attenborough.

Hypnagogis is a powerful drama written by Ken Hudson and is directed by Jo Bean. The play explores the lives of a number of individuals who are on different drugs. This not is not so much a play about drugs, but rather an intense investigation into the social consequences of lives lived in an altered state.

The final production on the triple-bill is Samuel Beckett’s Act Without Words: I. Beckett’s work has come to be recognised among the finest in avant-garde theatre with Act Without Words: I being no different. This comic mime follows the frustrations of a man stuck on stage with no way off. This challenging production is directed by Kevin Casey.

Student director Sarah Silver says the process is “fun, challenging and tiring, but I’m excited to see my work hit the stage in front of an audience”.

All three productions will be on offer as part of Moment / Gone – three plays now being performed at Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn. Wednesday 6 – Saturday 9 September 2006. Shows start at 7pm each night with tickets $12 waged and $8 unwaged.
