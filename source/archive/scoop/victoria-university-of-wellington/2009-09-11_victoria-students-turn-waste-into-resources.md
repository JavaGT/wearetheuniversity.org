Victoria students turn waste into resources

Victoria University Architecture students will showcase innovative ideas for transforming waste materials at an exhibition next week.

The exhibition, entitled ‘Closing the Loops’, includes work such as a light-emitting water filter made of crushed glass and a soil-enhancing weed mat made of gib board and agricultural waste.

“This is a great opportunity for students who are doing the Sustainable Architecture Course to show the public what they have been working on,” says Lecturer – Sustainable Architecture Maibritt Pedersen Zari.

The exhibition will be opened by the Mayor of Porirua, Her Worship Jenny Brash.

The following prizes and awards will be awarded:

Porirua City Council Award for the Project with the most potential to reduce waste, $500  
Winstone Wallboards are offering a prize for the best project investigating reuse of Gib board, $500  
WasteMINZ has two awards for the best projects of $250 each.  
   
There will also be a presentation of the Benson-Cooper Awards (www.benson-cooper.com) for sustainability (12 awards with 16 recipients). Contenders for awards this year include a proposal to regenerate derelict harbour-side land, innovative methods of recycling waste from the Wellington waterfront and a concept for baches using integrated solar technologies.
