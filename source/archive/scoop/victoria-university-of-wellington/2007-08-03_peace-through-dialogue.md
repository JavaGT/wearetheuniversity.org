Peace through dialogue

Peace through dialogue

Professor Paul Morris, Director of Religious Studies, has been awarded the Interfaith Gold Medal for Peace through Dialogue by the International Council of Christians and Jews.

The medal acknowledges Professor Morris' pioneering work in teaching Jewish-Christian relations, and more than 20 years of activity in promoting dialogue, nationally and internationally.

He arranged for 16 New Zealand students, from Christian, Jewish and Muslim faiths, to attend the Council's annual conference this month. These students, from Victoria and Otago Universities, have joined with Australian students to start an Abrahamic Forum to bring students from the three faiths together to learn about their religions and to work together on collaborative projects.
