**Experts discuss improving governance for a better future**

Victoria University of Wellington’s Institute for Governance and Policy Studies is bringing together a range of experts for a one-day symposium at Parliament, to discuss how societies can exercise good governance not merely for today, but for future generations.

The Improving Intergenerational Governance symposium is asking tough questions around how, in a world dominated by short-term pressures, we can incentivise governing bodies and public institutions to tackle the serious, long-term challenges that threaten the environment and our livelihoods.

Public Policy Professor Jonathan Boston, from Victoria’s School of Government says too often our democratic political systems favour short-term interests at the expense of long-term interests.

“We need to take a serious look at this presentist bias and examine how we can improve our governing systems to ensure future interests are adequately safeguarded.

“Improving intergenerational governance is critical if we have any hope of passing onto the next generation, a world that is inclusive, safe and sustainable.”

The symposium is sponsored by the Deputy Prime Minister Hon Paula Bennett and includes panel sessions and presentations from local and international researchers and senior public servants including Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet chief executive Andrew Kibblewhite.

**When:** 8.45am – 5.30pm, Thursday 23 March

**Where:** Banquet Hall  
Parliament Buildings  
Wellington  
**Cost:** free

**RSVP:** register by Tuesday 21 March, spaces are limited.
