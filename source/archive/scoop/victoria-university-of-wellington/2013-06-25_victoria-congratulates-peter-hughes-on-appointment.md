Victoria congratulates Peter Hughes on appointment

Victoria University has congratulated Professor Peter Hughes, Head of Victoria’s School of Government, on his appointment as Chief Executive and Secretary of Education for the Ministry of Education.

Professor Hughes has been in an acting role at the Ministry since February this year.

Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University, Professor Pat Walsh, says Professor Hughes has made a significant contribution to Victoria’s School of Government and the University as a whole.

“Peter set the strategic direction for the School of Government and developed a programme of work to support it, which is currently being implemented. He has played an important role in creating a unique facility, which has an active research programme, and is contributing to many areas of public policy development.

“We wish him well in his new role and look forward to working with him in the future.”
