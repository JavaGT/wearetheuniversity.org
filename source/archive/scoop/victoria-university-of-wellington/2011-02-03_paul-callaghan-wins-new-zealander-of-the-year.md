**Paul Callaghan wins New Zealander of the Year**

Victoria University is immensely proud of Professor Sir Paul Callaghan who was awarded the New Zealander of the Year honour last night. The award recognises an individual who has made an outstanding contribution to the well being of the nation.

Professor Callaghan received the award for his commitment in connecting science, technology and business for the positive economic development of New Zealand.

The honour tops off a superb 12 months for Professor Callaghan who also received a 2010 Wellingtonian of the Year Award, led the team that won the 2010 Prime Minister’s Science Prize and was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Victoria University.

Professor Pat Walsh, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria, says that Professor Callaghan’s award is richly deserved.

“He is one of the nation’s most distinguished scientists and a world-leader in his field, but more than that, he has contributed so much to public debate and discussion of science and the potential it has to transform New Zealand.

“Despite battling with cancer, he is truly living the words of advice he passed on to graduates at Victoria’s December graduation: ‘To live each day as though it were our last, and at the same time, to live as though we will live forever’.”
