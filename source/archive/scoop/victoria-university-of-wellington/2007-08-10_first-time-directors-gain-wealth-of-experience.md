First-Time Directors Gain Wealth of Experience

Three Victoria University theatre students have been hard at work shaping their creative visions for the stage to be performed from 15 August.

Alienated is a selection of three short plays, directed by THEA304 Directing students. This is the first of four seasons in which theatre students will create innovative and exciting theatre. The season which runs between 15 and 18 August will work as the major assessment for these students as they experience the challenge and anticipation of seeing their work being brought to life on stage.

As part of the course, students have the chance to be mentored by a professional theatre director. These three students are lucky enough to have guidance from Jacqui Coats, who among many projects, has directed for opera, worked as assistant director for the NBR NZ Opera and co-directed two successful summer Shakespeare seasons.

Jacqui says, "I always enjoy working with the directing students as I find their ideas and their enthusiam inspiring. This year's students are no exception - they are full of talent and drive." Through Jacqui, the first time directors have access to professional advice and suggestions to enhance their creative work.

Student director Adrianne Roberts says, "the wealth of experience and knowledge that Jacqui brings to the process is invaluable."

The three plays in Alienated range in style from drama to comedy to the avant-garde. Each play explores aspects of miscommunication, isolation or characters on the edge.

Have You Met Our Rabbit? by Michael Stevens and directed by Adrianne Roberts tells the entertaining, comical, physical action story of the communication struggle between a middle aged mother, and a rabbit that could do with a good clean.

Tom Stoppard’s Another Moon Called Earth, directed by Edward Watson, is, like many Stoppard works, a combination of philosophical ideas with verbal wit and visual humour.

Krapp’s Last Tape by Samuel Beckett, directed by Sophie Head, is often cited as Beckett's most autobiographical work. Created by one of the masters of 20th Century avant-garde theatre, this play delivers an exquisitely minimalist exploration of the human condition.

All three of these productions will be on offer in Alienated, being performed at Studio 77, 77 Fairlie Terrace, Kelburn from Wednesday 15 August to Saturday 18 August. Shows start at 7pm each night with tickets $12 waged and $8 unwaged.
