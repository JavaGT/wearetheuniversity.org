Understanding our Shaky Isles

One of New Zealand’s top earthquake researchers will explain what earthquakes and volcanoes can tell us about the Earth’s composition in her inaugural professorial lecture next Tuesday.

“Earthquakes and volcanoes can be devastating natural disasters, but they can also be used to learn the composition of the Earth and how it moves at great depths,” says Professor Savage.

Professor Savage, from Victoria University’s Faculty of Science, will present an overview of her work on earthquake seismology, and explain how it can be used for forecasting earthquakes and eruptions and to examine how the Earth’s tectonic plates move and deform.

“New technology has allowed us to see what is going on inside the Earth—until recently we didn’t really know how the Earth was moving beneath its surface. Now we have more understanding, which will allow us to do a better job at predicting volcanic eruptions.”

She says the research is particularly relevant to New Zealanders, who live in one of the world’s most seismically active countries. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake in the South Island on July 16 is the largest in the world so far in 2009 and the largest in New Zealand since the magnitude 7.8 Napier earthquake of 1931.

While Professor Savage’s research has created greater understanding of earthquake occurrence, she says people can do more to be prepared for the “big one”.

“If you feel an earthquake there’s about a one in 20 chance there will be another of the same size or bigger in the next five days. My advice to people when there is an earthquake is to use it as a wakeup call—there could be a bigger one coming very soon. Be prepared.”

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Professor Savage has established an outstanding reputation as a geophysicist, and as a teacher in Victoria’s School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences.

“Through her research into seismic wave propagation and how it varies with direction (seismic anisotropy) Professor Savage is increasing our understanding of how the earth moves and deforms.

“In addition, five of her students have been awarded prizes for best student presentations at international and New Zealand conferences.”

Since her arrival at Victoria University in 1995 Professor Savage has conducted major research collaborations with colleagues at Victoria and GNS Science, and internationally at Yale, the University of Leeds, the University of Colorado, the University of Montpellier in France and recently in Kyoto and Tokyo Universities in Japan.

The public lecture is at 6pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Gate 1 or 2, Kelburn Parade on Tuesday 15 September. To RSVP, email rsvp@vuw.ac.nz with ‘Savage’ in the subject line.
