**Top geological researcher to highlight the human impact on Earth**

A leading geologist and Antarctic climate researcher from the University of Cambridge will deliver two free public lectures at Victoria University of Wellington this week.

Dr Colin Summerhayes, Emeritus Associate at the Scott Polar Research Institute and a Victoria alumnus, will shed light on two key issues of climate change during his visit to Wellington.

In his first lecture, Dr Summerhayes will examine the changes in the Earth’s temperature, based on findings in his latest book _Earth’s Climate Evolution_.

He will discuss how changes in CO2 levels—like those of today—can cause temperature changes. He will give evidence from samples of sediment and ice that demonstrate periods of warming or cooling, and highlight the need for mankind to be cautious about putting more CO2 into the atmosphere.

Dr Summerhayes’ second talk will examine the evidence showing that Earth has entered a new geological epoch called the ‘Anthropocene’.

The research, co-authored by Dr Summerhayes and published in international journal _Science_ last week, explores how human impact on Earth has fundamentally changed the planet’s geological make-up.

He will outline the ground breaking study, which demonstrates how accelerating technology and growth in population and consumption from the 1950s onwards builds a strong case for the new epoch to be formally declared.
