**A bird’s eye view of solar innovation**

A virtual walk-through of New Zealand’s entry to the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2011 showcasing solar innovation has been unveiled.

A team from Victoria University is building a totally solar powered Kiwi bach as their entry into the U.S. based competition. Today is the public’s first chance to see what the house, called First Light, will look like and how it will work ahead of the final product being on display in Wellington in April before it is shipped to the U.S. for the competition.

The Solar Decathlon competition challenges student teams to design, build and operate an attractive, affordable, net zero energy house, powered entirely from solar energy. The Victoria University team will be one of 20 teams competing and is the only entry ever from the Southern Hemisphere to reach the finals.

Led by Victoria’s School of Architecture, the team is made up of almost 40 students from throughout the university, all supervised by staff and industry partners who are donating their time to the project.

The public will have the chance to see the technology in action at Wellington waterfront when the First Light House is on display for three weeks during April at Frank Kitts Park.
