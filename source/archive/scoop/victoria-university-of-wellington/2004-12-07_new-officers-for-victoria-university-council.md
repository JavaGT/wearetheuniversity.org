New officers for Victoria University Council

The Council of Victoria University of Wellington has today appointed two new officers to lead it in the New Year.

The Council today appointed Emeritus Professor Tim Beaglehole as Chancellor and Ian McKinnon as Pro Chancellor, effective from 1 January 2005.

The Chancellor chairs the University Council, has a casting vote on tied issues and is responsible for providing leadership to Council in the execution of its governance responsibilities. As the University's ceremonial head, the Chancellor also presides at graduation ceremonies and, on behalf the Council, confers degrees. The Pro Chancellor is the Council's deputy chairperson and deputises for the Chancellor when required.

Professor Beaglehole, who has a Master of Arts degrees from the University of New Zealand and Cambridge University and a PhD from Cambridge, has had a long association with Victoria University as a student and member of the staff. He was a staff representative on the Victoria University Council, 1968-71 and 1982, and since 1999, has been a representative of alumni on the Council.

Professor Beaglehole was formerly a staff member of the former History Department, Warden of Weir House, Dean of Arts, and Deputy Vice-Chancellor and is a life member of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association. For over thirty years he was responsible for building the University’s collection of works of art. He was a Harkness Fellow at Harvard, 1965-66, and taught at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, 1978.
