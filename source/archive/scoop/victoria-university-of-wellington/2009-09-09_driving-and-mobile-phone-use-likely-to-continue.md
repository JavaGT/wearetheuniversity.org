Driving and mobile phone use likely to continue

Driving and mobile phone use likely to continue despite law change

Many drivers from countries which have banned using a handheld mobile phone while driving are still ignoring the law.

At least 50 countries have introduced some form of legislation against the use of mobile phones by drivers, but a review of the literature and various reports by Victoria University’s School of Information Management has found that many drivers from these countries are still using their phones, despite recurring media reports about the fatal and often horrific accidents that can occur.

“Research shows people are four times more at risk of having an accident while using a mobile phone, no matter whether the use is for texting or a conversation, or whether a hand-held or hands-free phone is used—yet people are still doing it,” says Senior Lecturer Dr Val Hooper.

“Given that legislation against using a handheld mobile phone whilst driving will become effective in New Zealand on 1 November 2009, it’s important to understand why many people may be tempted to flout the law as is happening elsewhere in the world. One life lost is one life too many.”

A research team consisting of Dr Val Hooper from Victoria’s School of Information Management and Dr Janet Carruthers from the School of Marketing and International Business is examining individuals’ attitudes toward the use of mobile phones while driving.

“Many drivers think that hands-free mobile conversations are just as safe as talking to passengers in the car,” says Dr Hooper.

“However, the emotional distraction of the driver is one of the main reasons why phone conversations while driving are so dangerous. That’s why even hands-free conversations can cause accidents—because the person at the other end of the phone can’t see the driving conditions and hazards the driver may be dealing with at the same time.”

The research project explores the underlying reasons for people continuing to drive and use a mobile phone simultaneously, and determine whether there is a difference in attitude toward texting and talking, and between hands free and hand held phone use. It will also seek to understand what it would take to take change people’s behaviour. 

Dr Hooper further notes that there have been issues overseas regarding the liability of companies when they issue their employees with mobile phones and expect them to be contactable at any time during the working day.

“Several serious accidents have occurred when employees have been doing company business on their mobile phones while driving, and costly court cases and settlements have resulted. Our research project will also be exploring companies’ approaches to the use of mobile phones for business by their staff members and whether they have any policies in place guiding the use of these phones while driving.”

The project team expects to have further results about attitudes by the end of the year.
