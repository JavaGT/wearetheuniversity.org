**Big Day In explores the meaning of life**

Academics from Victoria University’s Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences are opening their minds to Wellingtonians for a _Big Day In_ thinking about life.

Loosely and light-heartedly structured around the theme of births, deaths and marriages—whānautanga, matenga, mārenatanga—the _Big Day In_ will take place on Saturday 7 September in and around Victoria’s Hub on Kelburn Parade.

Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences Professor Deborah Willis says the _Big Day In_ is a free event and everyone is welcome.

“It’s a chance to explore some of the things that make us human, celebrate the breadth and depth of the humanities and social sciences, and enjoy the wisdom and wit of some of our leading academics.”

Talks range from Laurie Bauer and Paul Warren exploring the birth of language, through to Emily Perkins, Jean Anderson and Tim Groves delving into crime, death and violence in film and literature.

There will be live music and entertainment from the New Zealand School of Music and Pasifika singers, student films streaming in the Hub and a ‘Town versus Gown’ quiz to end the day.

**What:** Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences _Big Day In_  
**When:** Saturday 7 September, 10am–3pm  
**Where:** The Hub, Kelburn Parade (entry through vicbooks or via Gate 3)  
**Cost:** Free

The full programme is available at www.victoria.ac.nz/home/viclife/events. Spaces for each talk will be limited by the capacity of each venue and will therefore be on a first-in basis.

**RSVP by Wednesday 4 September. Email rsvp@vuw.ac.nz with ‘FHSS Big Day In’ in the subject line.**
