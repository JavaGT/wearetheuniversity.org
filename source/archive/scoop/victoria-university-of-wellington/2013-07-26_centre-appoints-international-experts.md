Centre appoints international experts

Victoria University’s Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research has established a new International Advisory Board.

Centre Co-Director Professor Colleen Ward says the five new members appointed to the Board will allow the Centre to expand its international research programme.

“The five researchers all have outstanding reputations for research excellence in their field of expertise, which creates exciting new opportunities for collaboration.”

The five members are:

Professor Ara Norenzayan (University of British Columbia, Canada);  
Professor Cigdem Kagitcibasi (Koç University, Turkey);  
Professor Fons van de Vijver (Tilburg University, the Netherlands);  
Professor Judith Gibbons (Saint Louis University, USA); and  
Professor Susumu Yamaguchi (University of Tokyo, Japan).

Each Board member will visit New Zealand during their three year term and participate in public events to present their latest research.

“As multiculturalism becomes a reality in today’s ethnically diverse societies, and New Zealand continues to become culturally, ethnically, linguistically and religiously diverse, these conversations become increasingly important,” says Professor Ward.

The Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research was established in 2004, and is based in the School of Psychology at Victoria University.

The Centre responds to the challenges of globalisation, migration, intergroup relations and cultural diversity through research and policy advice.
