Peter Hughes appointed as chair of advisory board

The ViceChancellor of Victoria University of Wellington, Professor Pat Walsh, today announced the appointment of Peter Hughes, Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development, as chair of the School of Government’s advisory board.

The board, which advises the School on its research and engagement activities, is comprised of senior figures from the public sector and business, and senior academics from universities in New Zealand and Australia.

“As a widely respected chief executive of a major Ministry, Mr Hughes will bring a wealth of experience to the role. I am delighted he has accepted this position and I look forward to working with him to further strengthen the ties between the School of Government and the public sector,” Professor Pat Walsh says.

Mr Hughes has been in his current role at the Ministry of Social Development since its establishment in 2001. He has more than 20 years experience in the public service during which he has been Secretary for Internal Affairs, the Chief Executive of the Health Funding Authority, and a Deputy DirectorGeneral of Health.

He studied at Victoria and Massey universities and gained a Masters of Public Administration from Harvard University.

Head of the School of Government, Professor Terry Stokes, says the board provides an important link between the School and its major stakeholders. “This appointment signifies the continuing importance of the close relationships the School of Government has in Wellington."

Mr Hughes replaces former chair Dr Alan Bollard, Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand who led the board since its inception in 2002.
