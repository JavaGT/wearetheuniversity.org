**Distinguished alumni to be honoured**

Some of New Zealand’s most influential leaders, thinkers and creative talent will be honoured with a Distinguished Alumni Award from Victoria University of Wellington.

The University will present awards in April 2011 to six alumni who have made an outstanding contribution in their field. They are film director Taika Waititi, professional accountant John Shewan, artist Piera McArthur, lawyer Sir Thomas Gault, entrepreneur Rod Drury and former Wellington mayor Kerry Prendergast.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says the recipients illustrate the high calibre of Victoria’s alumni and the University is proud to be celebrating their achievements.

“These people have made an exceptional contribution to their various disciplines and professions and to New Zealand as a whole,” says Professor Walsh.

“The awards illustrate the steps to success that Victoria graduates undertake and all the winners portray the qualities that we aim to instil, including leadership, critical and creative thinking and a commitment to excellence.”

Victoria has presented Distinguished Alumni Awards since 2006, introducing the accolades as a way of recognising and honouring the contribution made by its graduates.
