Their Honours do the honours

The Faculty of Law at Victoria University of Wellington has a proud record of its alumni achieving high office in the public service, the academy and the judiciary.

Its current judicial alumni have clubbed together and paid for an honours board for the Law Students’ Society (LSS) which records the results of the law competitions run by the LSS. It is named in honour of George Barton QC, an alumnus and former professor at the Faculty and considered the “father” of the profession in Wellington.

An unveiling ceremony was held recently and many judges, students and academic staff attended.

“The judges have been wonderfully generous and we are most thankful for their support,” says LSS President, Myles Snaddon. “Many of the judges were students who excelled at mooting, witness examination, client interview or negotiation and they understand the important role these competitions play in developing students’ skills.”

The Dean of Law at Victoria, Professor Tony Smith, says: “What is pleasing about this gift is its illustration of the warmth of relationships within our legal community. There is a constant interaction between the judiciary, the Law School and the profession which is to everyone’s benefit.

“Another illustration is that many judges give their time to judge the competitions which the honours board commemorates.”

The wooden board is made of a mix of Fijian kauri and New Zealand kauri. It has been made by the Centre for Fine Woodworking in Nelson.
