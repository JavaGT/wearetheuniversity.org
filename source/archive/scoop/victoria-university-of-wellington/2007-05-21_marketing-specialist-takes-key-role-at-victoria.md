Communications & marketing specialist takes key role at Victoria

Respected communications and marketing specialist Helen Morgan-Banda has been appointed to a new strategic role as Victoria University’s Director, Communications & Marketing,

Ms Morgan-Banda, who has previously been Communications Manager for the Prime Minister’s Office, Head of Communications & Government Relations for New Zealand Lotteries, and Director Marketing & Communications for New Zealand Police, will start at Victoria on June 5.

In this new role, that brings the University’s Public Affairs and Marketing teams together into a new Directorate, Ms Morgan-Banda will be responsible for Victoria’s advertising, corporate and recruitment publications, internal and external communication, media relations, alumni relations, event management and website management, including the MyVictoria web portal.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor David Mackay, said Ms Morgan-Banda’s wide experience and knowledge would be invaluable as the University worked through the challenges posed by the Government’s changes to tertiary funding.

“Helen is a highly experienced communications and marketing professional with strategic experience across both public and private sectors.

“In a capped funding environment where the Government wants to enhance student retention, we need to carefully manage enrolments. As well, Victoria has set itself a strategic objective of significantly increasing the proportion of postgraduate students to enhance its culture as a research-intensive university. Helen’s experience in communications and marketing will be vital as Victoria traverses this complex terrain.

Ms Morgan-Banda said she was delighted to accept the role.
