Louise Nicholas fronts film screening of her story
==================================================

**Louise Nicholas fronts film screening of her story**

Louise Nicholas will attend and speak at a Victoria University of Wellington screening of the film that depicts her allegations of rape and sexual abuse by police officers when she was a teenager.

_Consent: The Louise Nicholas Story_ will be shown at Victoria on Monday 15 September with Louise Nicholas speaking and answering questions after the screening.

Gerard Hoffman, Manager of Student Counselling at Victoria, says the University is privileged to have Louise attend the film screening.

“Victoria is hosting this event because we wanted to give our staff, students and the public an opportunity to hear Louise tell her story in person,” says Mr Hoffman.

Dr Cathy Stephenson is a GP with Victoria’s Student Health Services and also works as a forensic medical examiner for the Sexual Assault Assessment and Treatment Service in Wellington. Dr Stephenson says: “Thousands of New Zealanders every year are affected by sexual assault and abuse. It is imperative that it is talked about as it is only through discussion and awareness that we can develop a culture of respect that condemns sexual violence.”

Louise Nicholas was named New Zealander of the Year in 2007. Her experiences led to a Commission of Inquiry into Police Conduct, headed by distinguished public servant Dame Margaret Bazley, which resulted in institutional change taking place within New Zealand Police.

Louise now assists police with teaching senior officers how to work with rape victims. She is also a National Sexual Violence Survivor Advocate with Rape Prevention Education.
