Fair Trade Bazaar – VUW Students celebrate change through Fair Trade!

Victoria University’s Student Union Building will be buzzing with activity from 11am-3pm on Monday, May 5th with the Fair Trade Bazaar. The event will kick off Fair Trade Fortnight 2008.

The event is set to be packed with informative and interactive stalls, Fair Trade products and live world music. The bazaar will give students and the wider community an opportunity a chance to come try Fair Trade products, meet local Fair Trade businesses and see what Fair Trade is all about.

This event is being organised by members of Victoria University Club, Just Action.

“We want to showcase to students the difference that Fair Trade has made to over a million small farmers and producers around the world. With Fair Trade, students can buy a huge range of products such as shoes, t-shirts, chocolate, coffee, fruit and crafts and know that the producers received a fair price under good working conditions which promote community development.”

says Caleb Gordon, Co-leader of Just Action.

The Bazaar is also about celebrating Fair Trade, hence the live music, entertainment and dancing.”

says Just Action Secretary Sarah Wood.

The Bazaar will also feature stalls from Just Action, Greens@Vic, Victoria University environmental group Gecko, the Latin American Solidarity Committee and more, to give information and encourage debate on wider issues of International Trade Justice.
