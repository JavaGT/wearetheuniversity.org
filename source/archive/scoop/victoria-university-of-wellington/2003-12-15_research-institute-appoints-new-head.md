Research institute appoints new head

The New Zealand Institute for the Study of Competition and Regulation (ISCR) at Victoria University of Wellington has appointed Professor Glenn Boyle as its new executive director.

He takes up this position in his capacity as a newly appointed professor at Victoria University.

Professor Boyle is currently Professor of Finance at the University of Otago's School of Business.

He will replace current executive director Professor Lewis Evans who has held the position since the establishment of ISCR in February 1998. Professor Evans will continue his association with the Institute on a part-time basis.

Professor Boyle is a 44 year old New Zealander with distinguished academic credentials.

ISCR chairman Adrian Orr says Professor Boyle’s appointment consolidates the Institute’s work between business and academia.

“Professor Boyle will further develop the research base of the Institute which aims to build a better understanding of the New Zealand economy, its institutions, and its domestic and international markets,” he said.

“Professor Boyle’s strong background in finance will see a broadening and strengthening of the Institute in the areas of banking and finance.”

The new executive director will take up the position on 1 March 2004.
