**Organisations can benefit from student skills**

Wellington employers have the chance to give their operation an edge by using the critical thinking and creative problem solving skills of Bachelor of Arts (BA) students from Victoria University of Wellington.

A programme being introduced at Victoria will see talented BA students gaining course-credit as well as real-world experience by working voluntarily for up to 100 hours for employers in the capital city.

“There are benefits for both the student and the employer,” says BA Internship Coordinator Carine Stewart. “Students get a good grasp of how their skills can be applied and employers understand the value a Bachelor of Arts graduate can add to their business.”

The new initiative will be piloted shortly, with a group of students undertaking a voluntary placement in November and December this year.  The full course will be offered at second and third year level in 2014.

The course includes a taught component where students will have an opportunity to reflect on, share and discuss what they have learned in the workplace.

Carine says the internship programme is part of a drive at Victoria University to highlight the capability of BA graduates.

“Employers are increasingly telling us they want to hire graduates who can communicate well, problem solve, think creatively and independently, work collaboratively and take a lead in engagement for the business. Those are all skills students gain while studying for a BA.”

She says for students, the programme is an excellent way of making connections. “They will begin to develop a network of contacts in potential career areas.”

Carine says the University is partnering with a range of organisations including government departments, research and training agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and private businesses.

**Organisations interested in signing up for the programme should contact Carine Stewart, BA Internship Coordinator on 04 463 5527 or** **carine.stewart@vuw.ac.nz**

**Students wanting to join the programme can find out more at**  www.victoria.ac.nz/ba-internships **and have until 1 November to enrol for the pilot programme and until 10 December to enrol for the 2014 courses.**
