Things that make you go “Oh”

**Things that make you go “Oh”**  
  
A Victoria University health sociologist says that understanding the importance of one small word could help improve outcomes in the health system.

Professor Kevin Dew, programme director of Sociology and Social Policy at Victoria University, has researched interactions between doctor and patients, and believes that by understanding “oh” moments and other features of these interactions, improvements could be made in the health system.

“Small details can be very informative in terms of interaction—the word “oh” can signify the patient has received major news. It is a transformative moment.”

He cites the example of a patient entering the consultation believing they are healthy, but then being informed that they have a life-threatening illness.

In his inaugural professorial lecture on 27 April, Professor Dew will discuss the “oh” moments in sociology, and how they represent a shift to a new understanding He will illustrate these moments using examples from his own research into the sociology of health and illness.

“Sociological research is transformative. Through sociological research we deepen our understanding of social processes, but research also changes the researchers themselves,” says Professor Dew.

Much of his research involves detailed analysis of doctor/patient consultations, and the use of the word “oh” can signify a huge change in the patient’s perceptions.

Professor Dew, who has extensive experience working with health researchers and health professionals in the Department of Public Health and the Department of Primary Health Care and General Practice at the Wellington School of Medicine, says analysis of such interactions can have benefits for the health system. He has worked with health professionals to improve communication with patients, and deliver better services.

“One of the main reasons for complaints to the Health and Disability Commission relates to problems of miscommunication in health consultations. By closely observing interactions we can see that what could be classed as miscommunication between patients and health professionals is not an uncommon occurrence.”

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Professor Dew, who was appointed as Professor of Sociology at Victoria in 2008, has established an outstanding reputation within his area of study

“His list of publications is extensive, and in addition to several research grants, in 2007 he was awarded the Inaugural Scholarship Award for contributions to New Zealand sociology by the Sociological Association of Aotearoa New Zealand. His inaugural lecture promises to be an insightful look into the area of health and illness sociology.”

Professor Walsh says Victoria’s Inaugural Lecture series is an opportunity for new professors to provide family, friends, colleagues and the wider community with an insight into their specialist area of study.

“It is also an opportunity for the University to celebrate and acknowledge our valued professors.”

**The public lecture is at 6pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, Level 2, Hunter Building, Kelburn Parade, at Victoria University’s Kelburn Campus on Tuesday 27 April. To RSVP, email rsvp@vuw.ac.nz with ‘Dew’ in the subject line.**
