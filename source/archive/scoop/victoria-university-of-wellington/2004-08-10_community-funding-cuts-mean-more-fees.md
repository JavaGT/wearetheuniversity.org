Community Funding Cuts Mean More Fees For Students

The slashing of community education funding to Victoria University means students will pay more for learning support services in 2005, said Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association President Amanda Hill today.

“The budget blow-out created by some irresponsible institutions has resulted in a panicked decision by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) to severely cut funding to Victoria University”, said Hill. “The biggest loser will be Student Learning Support Services, and this shortfall will be made up by adding another $15 per student to their Student Services Levy”.

Student Learning Support operate workshops and peer support networks, with about 60% of students using their services being international students who often require a high amount of support. Currently demand for many of these services exceeds the supply.

“It is bad enough that Government refuse to address student debt, but the TEC is seeking to increase it even more. Our students should not be punished so severely for the inadequacies of the Ministry of Education or the TEC” Hill said today.
