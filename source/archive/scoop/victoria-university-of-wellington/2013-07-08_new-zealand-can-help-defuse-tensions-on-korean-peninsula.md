**New Zealand can help defuse tensions on Korean Peninsula**

A Victoria University academic warns that unless other countries, including New Zealand, contribute to helping North Korea to help itself, the Korean Peninsula is likely to face further conflict.

In his discussion paper ‘Tensions on the Korean Peninsula: Implications for New Zealand’, Regional Security Fellow Paul Sinclair, from Victoria University’s Centre for Strategic Studies, examines recent developments on the Korean Peninsula, including the responses of China and the United States, and considers what this may mean for New Zealand.

Among Mr Sinclair’s suggestions for resolving the conflict, are a call to resume the Six Party Talks (a process hosted by China, which aims to end North Korea’s nuclear programme through negotiations involving China, the United States, South and North Korea, Japan and Russia), setting aside the nuclear issue for the time being and using the talks to examine ways of helping North Korea rebuild its economy.

“This could be achieved through carefully targeted investment and economic assistance—and we could play a part by sharing our agricultural expertise,” says Mr Sinclair.

“It is in New Zealand’s best interests to help prevent the, hopefully unlikely, event of war erupting again on the peninsula, given our heavy reliance on north-east Asian economies.”

He also suggests re-shaping the Six Party Talks into a north-east Asian security dialogue.

“This is a concept much discussed but never developed, but encouraging North Korea to participate in such a dialogue would give it a stake in attempts to resolve strategic issues.

“That would require a sea change in approach on the part of North Korea, but I believe it could be persuaded to see merit in participation.”

New Zealand has had a close relationship with South Korea since the Korean War, where New Zealand offered a commitment of defence personnel that, on a per capita basis, exceeded Australia.

The Centre for Strategic Studies Discussion Paper series is designed to give a forum for scholars and specialists working on issues related directly to New Zealand’s security in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.
