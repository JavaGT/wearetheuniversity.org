Public talk to discuss what’s best for our bodies

Leading psychology and biology experts from Victoria University of Wellington will be visiting Nelson as part of the University’s 2015 Public Lecture Series, presenting their perspectives on how modern science can inform health-related issues.

Professor Bart Ellenbroek from Victoria’s School of Psychology will discuss the current crisis in the pharmaceutical industry.

Pharmaceutical companies are spending more and more on developing new drugs, yet success rates have steadily declined over the last two decades. As a result, many companies have focused their attention away from complex disorders.

Professor Ellenbroek will explore the reasons for this crisis, why we should care and how we could improve the drug research success, especially in psychiatry.

He will be joined by Dr David Ackerley from the School of Biological Sciences, who will give a talk on therapeutic applications of genes.

Dr Ackerley will discuss how genes can be applied in the diagnosis and treatment of inheritable diseases and cancers, how these new types of therapies are trialled and some ethical and practical issues around gene patents.

Where: Rutherford Hotel, 27 Nile Street West, Nelson

When: Wednesday 17 June at 5.30pm

To attend this free talk email rsvp@vuw.ac.nz with ‘Nelson Lecture’ in the subject line or phone 04-463 5791 by Monday 15 June.
