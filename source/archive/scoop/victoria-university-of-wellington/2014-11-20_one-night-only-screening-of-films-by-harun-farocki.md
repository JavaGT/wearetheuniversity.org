One-night-only screening of films by Harun Farocki
==================================================

**Special one-night-only screening of films by legendary media artist Harun Farocki**

A one-night-only screening of three films by the late Harun Farocki, a German media artist, critic, editor and curator, will be shown at the Light House Cinema Cuba next Wednesday 26 November.

The Adam Art Gallery, in association with Goethe-Institut New Zealand, will present three significant film works: _Inextinguishable Fire_ (1969), _Serious Games I-IV_ (2009-10) and _Parallel I-IV_ (2012-14) to honour Farocki’s lifework, and as an accompaniment to Simon Denny’s exhibition _The Personal Effects of Kim Dotcom_.

Farocki, who passed away in July 2014, is widely regarded as one of the most insightful artists of our time. His films and installations analyse the power of the image to inform, instruct, persuade and propagandise.

“Viewers will appreciate how both artists work at the interface between technological developments and image production, documenting the very real political consequences that extend from viewing the world as a simulation,” says Adam Art Gallery director, Christina Barton.

This screening has been curated by Laura Preston, Adam Art Gallery’s Curator-at-Large. It is supported by Light House Cinema Cuba and Goethe-Institut New Zealand.
