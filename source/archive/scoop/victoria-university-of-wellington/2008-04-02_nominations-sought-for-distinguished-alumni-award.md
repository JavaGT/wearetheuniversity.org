Nominations sought for Distinguished Alumni Award

Victoria University of Wellington is calling for nominations for the annual Distinguished Alumni Awards that honour graduates who have reached the heights of success in their profession, communities or nation.

Nominees must hold a degree or diploma from Victoria University or the former Wellington College of Education. Nominations close on the 30 April 2008.

ViceChancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, says nominations can span success in any field—professional, political, voluntary, creative, sporting or social.

“Particular attention will be paid to nominees who epitomise the attributes of a Victoria University graduate—creative and critical thinking, leadership and communication skills”.

People who wish to make a nomination can contact the Alumni Relations Office on (04) 463 6700 or by emailing alumni@vuw.ac.nz. More information about the awards, including the nomination form, is available on the University’s website www.vuw.ac.nz/alumni.

Reaching a great height deserves a great celebration. The awards will be presented at a blacktie event—the Annual Alumni Dinner—in the Wellington Town Hall on 9 October.

Past recipients of the awards include Theresa Gattung, Bernice Mene, Dr Robin Congreve, John Allen, Jeremy Coney and Joe Williams.
