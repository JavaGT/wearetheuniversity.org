MEDIA RELEASE

Victoria engineering programme given green light

Victoria University’s innovative Bachelor of Engineering is all set to start next year with the new programme gaining necessary approval.

The Committee on University Academic Programmes (CUAP), part of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellor’s Committee, approved the new programme at its meeting last week.

From 2007, students will be able to enrol in Victoria’s new BE programme that offers four specialisations, with majors in electronic, software, network and computer system engineering.

Pro Vice-Chancellor (Information Technology), Professor Warwick Clegg, says the programme was developed as a response to the demand from employers for top quality information technology graduates.

“Information technology, from the internet to robotics, is transforming the international economy. Electronic and computer-based systems are increasingly contributing to our creativity, communications, entertainment and economic well-being. The leaders in this new world will be those nations with the people who have the knowledge and skills to harness its potential.

“New Zealand, however, has a critical shortage of graduates in these fields. Not a week goes by when IT media does not carry stories quoting industry leaders calling for graduates with information technology skills and knowledge.

“Victoria has heard that call and in response we’ve introduced a four-year Bachelor of Engineering that focuses on the design and implementation of real-world systems, and gives an essential grounding in business and management skills.”

Professor Clegg says the programme builds on the experience the University has in delivering science and technology programmes supported by research and top quality teaching, but the BE programme will have a distinct professional engineering ethos and structure.

“As part of the degree students undertake a work placement in a relevant industry. This, along with a group project in the third year and an industry-driven project in the fourth year, gives real-life experience with practical aspects of engineering design and development.”

The new degree will lead to a wide range of careers including electronics, robot design, systems development, hardware development, programming, systems management, and research, he says.

“Graduates of the Bachelor of Engineering will have the skills and knowledge to design practical, efficient, economic and sustainable solutions to real world problems. Like all Victoria graduates they will have leadership skills, think critically and creatively and will communicate well.”

High-achieving students will be awarded the degree with Honours, enabling direct entry to Master’s or PhD study.
