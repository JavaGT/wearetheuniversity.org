**Candidates for Prize in Modern Letters announced**

Six emerging New Zealand writers have been short-listed for the $65,000 Prize in Modern Letters, and the winner will be announced next March during the New Zealand Post Writers and Readers Week.

One of the world's wealthiest literary awards, the biennial Prize in Modern Letters is sponsored by United States business leader and arts philanthropist Glenn Schaeffer.

The shortlisted writers are: Michele Amas, David Beach, Mary McCallum, Jo Randerson, Anna Sanderson and Louise Wareham Leonard.

Professor Bill Manhire, director of the International Institute of Modern Letters at Victoria University, says he is delighted by the range of writers to have made it this far.

“There are two novelists, two poets, a short story writer, and an essayist. And they’re all writers who venture beyond familiar territory. To borrow Janet Frame’s phrase, they’re travelling ‘far from the road labelled Scenic Drive’."

Broadcaster, editor and writer Elizabeth Alley, Dominion Post Books Editor Guy Somerset, and novelist and academic Damien Wilkins were on the short-listing panel this year and New York literary editor, Brigid Hughes (The Paris Review, A Public Space) will judge the winner.

**Michele Amas** is well-known for her distinguished career as an actor, and is currently starring in the main-bill play _Home Land_ at Circa Theatre. She is nominated for her first collection of poetry, _After the Dance_.

**David Beach** works as a mail sorter for New Zealand Post, and is nominated for his first book, _Abandoned Novel_, that – despite its title – is a collection of 60 sonnets.

**Mary McCallum** has worked as a television and radio broadcaster. She is nominated for _The Blue_, a whaling novel set on Arapawa Island in 1938. An early draft of _The Blue_ won her the NZ Society of Authors’ Lillian Ida Smith Award 2003/4.

**Jo Randerson** is best-known as an actor and theatre worker. She has been Burns Fellow at the University of Otago, and in 1997 she received the Sunday Star Times Bruce Mason Award for playwriting. She is nominated for her short story collections, _The Spit Children_ and _The Keys to Hell_.

**Anna Sanderson** has a background in photography, the visual arts, and English literature. She was co-founder of the art criticism journal _Monica._ She is nominated for _Brainpark_ - a collection of reflective and incisive personal essays.

**Louise Wareham Leonard** is nominated for her two short novels: _Since You Ask_ and _Miss Me a Lot of_. She grew up in Wellington, Sydney and New York City and was educated at Columbia College in New York and at Victoria University of Wellington. She is a book reviewer and teacher living between New Zealand and Australia.
