All those wishing to remember the remarkable life of Sir Paul and his contribution to science and this country are welcome to come and watch the webcast, which is being broadcast at the Council Chamber in the Hunter Building, and the Hunter Lounge in the Student Union Building.

The doors open at 12.30pm, with the funeral service starting at 1pm.

If people would like to watch the funeral from a private computer, the web stream will be available from 12.30pm at http://www.r2.co.nz/20120328/

The Council Chamber and Hunter Lounge are located at Victoria University’s Kelburn campus on Kelburn Parade, Wellington. Maps are available here http://www.victoria.ac.nz/home/about/maps/campus\_kelburn.aspx.
