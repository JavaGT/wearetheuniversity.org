Music and fun at Study at Vic Day 2005

From the four corners of New Zealand, thousands of prospective students will descend on Victoria University to get a taste of campus life during the University’s annual open day on Friday 19 August.

Study at Vic Day offers students, their parents, whânau and teachers the chance to see what Victoria University has to offer as well as the chance to enjoy free lunchtime entertainment from fantastic Wellington band, the Phoenix Foundation, in the Kelburn Campus Quad.

The lunchtime entertainment is just a small part of what will be happening during the day, which will be attended by about 3,000 visitors from Wellington and further a field.

Victoria’s Kelburn Campus will be the base of the day’s activities with a series of information sessions, displays, competitions and the chance to win an iPod. Visitors will also have the opportunity to talk to staff and current students, look around the facilities and find out what it is like to study the many subjects offered at Victoria for first year students.

Tours of the Kelburn Campus, home of the Faculty of Humanities & Social Sciences and the Faculty of Science, will be offered during the day – as well as tours of the Halls of Residence, the Faculty of Commerce & Administration and Faculty of Law (Pipitea Campus), the Faculty of Education (Karori Campus) and the Faculty of Architecture & Design (Te Aro Campus). Free buses will run between campuses during the day.
