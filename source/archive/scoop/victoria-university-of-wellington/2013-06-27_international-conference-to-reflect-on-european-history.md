**International conference to reflect on European history**

Some of the world’s leading academics on European history will gather in Wellington next week to reflect on cohesion and division in Europe from the 18th to the 21st centuries.

They will be attending the Australasian Association for European History’s 23rd biennial conference at Victoria University from 2-5 July.

Speakers include Professor Joanna Bourke, internationally-esteemed scholar of British and European history from Birkbeck University of London, who will discuss the modern European commitment to human rights; Professor Peter McPhee from the University of Melbourne, who will explore the increasingly aggressive assertions of ethnic identity and exclusiveness that have been emerging in Europe since 2008; and Geoff Eley from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, who will focus on democratic political development in 19th and 20th century Europe.

The conference is supported by Victoria University, the University of Western Australia, the University of Otago and the EUC Network.
