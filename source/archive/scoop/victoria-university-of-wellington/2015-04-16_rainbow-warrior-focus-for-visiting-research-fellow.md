Rainbow Warrior Focus for Visiting Research Fellow

**Bilateral Arbitration Treaty And Rainbow Warrior Focus for Visiting Research Fellow**

A proposed bilateral arbitration treaty and the 30th anniversary of the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior will be the focus of a visit from world leading international arbitrator and litigator Gary Born next month.

Mr Born has been awarded the New Zealand Centre of International Economic Law’s (NZCIEL) Inaugural Senior Visiting Research Fellowship for 2015 and will visit New Zealand from 1 to 9 May.

While in New Zealand, Mr Born will discuss his recent initiative—a Bilateral Arbitration Treaty regime—with government representatives and businesses. This is aimed at addressing the adverse consequences that some businesses are facing because of the structure of the international litigation system, which is often time-consuming, expensive and inefficient.

He will also give a number of public lectures, co-hosted by Victoria University of Wellington, including a panel discussion on the Rainbow Warrior, 30 years since its sinking. Mr Born acted as counsel for Greenpeace in the _Greenpeace v France_ arbitration, which concluded with an award of damages in favour of Greenpeace. Other panellists include Dr Gerard Curry (counsel for Alain Mafart and Dominique Prieur), Sir Kenneth Keith, Bill Mansfield, Sir Geoffrey Palmer and Dr Penelope Ridings.

Professor Susy Frankel, Director of the NZCIEL, said the Centre’s inaugural fellowship recognised the significant contribution Mr Born has made to international commercial arbitration and litigation.

“It's a wonderful opportunity for those interested in international dispute resolution to hear from someone of Mr Born’s calibre—and to consider his insights from the New Zealand perspective.”
