Academic appointed to UN standby mediation team

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in conjunction with Victoria University ’s School of Government, today congratulated Dr Andrew Ladley on his appointment to the position of Senior Expert Mediator in the newly created Standby Team of mediation experts at the United Nations.

One of a six ­person team of international experts, Dr Ladley will provide independent advice on constitutional and electoral matters to alleviate the risk of conflict. Other members of the team include experts in transitional justice, power sharing, military forces and wealth sharing. Administered by the Norwegian Refugee Council, with the assistance of the Norwegian government, the team will be deployed by the UN for immediate service, wherever and whenever its services are required.

Head of the University ’s School of Government, Professor Terry Stokes, says Dr Ladley ’s appointment reflects his wealth of knowledge on conflict resolution, constitutions, state building, conflict resolution and peace building. “These are areas in which Andrew taugh

t, researched and practised at Victoria and particularly in the School of Government. This has been of great value for our students, and reflects the high esteem in which that work, and his expertise, is held by the international community and the New Zealand government.

“This appointment is also an example of the practical way the School of Government not only teaches and researches, but works with governments to assist or improve aspects of governance,” Professor Stokes says.

The team of experts begins work immediately for 12 months. Dr Ladley recently completed a five ­year term as Director of Victoria University ’s Institute of Policy Studies. Prior to that, he was Chief of Staff and Coalition Manager in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand. He joined the Faculty of Law at Victoria in 1987 and has served with the UN in Cambodia, East Timor and Jamaica. He has also worked for the Commonwealth in South  
Africa and Gambia, and with Amnesty International in Bosnia and Hercegovina.

When not called for duty, Dr Ladley will be based in Wellington at the School of Government.

Professor Jonathan Boston has been appointed as Acting Director of the Institute of Policy Studies. Issued by Victoria University of Wellington Communications & Marketing,
