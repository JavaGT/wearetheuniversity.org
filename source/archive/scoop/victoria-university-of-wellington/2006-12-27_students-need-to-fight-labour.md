Students need to fight Labour, not kiss their arse

In 2006 Students have failed to challenge this government over its failure to address student funding problems. Although student debt is higher than it’s ever been student leaders spend more time lobbying and kissing up to Labour than standing up to them. This is particularly the case with NZUSA (the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations).

“In 2006 our NZUSA presidents kept telling us we’d appear greedy if we put demands on the government”, says Nick Kelly 2006 VUWSA President. “NZUSA and many student leaders are becoming far too cosy with Labour politicians, and in 2006 this compromised their ability to stand up for students”.

“Interest free loans are a pretty small concession by this Labour government. However many student leaders have bent over backwards to praise the government for it” says Nick. “NZUSA is acting like an affiliate to the Labour Party, and a pretty ineffective one at that”

“The only way students’ will win the fight against fees and under funding is by standing up, not sucking up to the government”.
