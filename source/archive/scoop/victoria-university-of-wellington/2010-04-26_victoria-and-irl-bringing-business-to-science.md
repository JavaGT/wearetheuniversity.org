**Victoria and IRL bringing business to science**

Victoria University and Industrial Research Limited (IRL) are working to foster entrepreneurial and commercial skills among New Zealand’s emerging scientists.

IRL has established PhD scholarships at Victoria which will help ensure that the next generation of scientists can commercialise their research and help lift New Zealand’s economic performance and prosperity.

Professor Pat Walsh, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University, says the initiative builds on the existing collaboration between the two organisations.

“Victoria has an excellent, collaborative relationship with IRL and these scholarships strengthen that mutually beneficial partnership.

“Both Victoria and IRL have close links with other science organisations in Wellington. Here, we’re at the heart of science in New Zealand.”

The IRL PhD Scholarships in Science or Business at Victoria University will assist postgraduate students in Victoria’s Faculties of Science, Engineering and in the Faculty of Commerce and Administration, namely the Victoria Management School.

There will initially be four scholarships each worth $25,000 a year for up to three years. Recipients will work on a thesis of direct relevance to one or several of IRL’s research programmes.

The scholarships were established through the Victoria University Foundation.

Shaun Coffey, IRL Chief Executive, says collaboration between universities and crown research institutes can provide synergies for both organisations.

“IRL strives to transform scientific endeavour into commercial outcomes that support New Zealand industry. Through these scholarships Victoria University’s acknowledged expertise in both science and business will assist us in our mission.”

Last year Victoria and IRL signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the supervision of postgraduate students.

The collaboration will assist students with research in areas such as carbohydrate chemistry, high temperature superconductors, energy and materials, engineering and applied physics, integrated bioactive technologies, measurement standards, nanotechnology and photonics.
