**Support builds for Kiwi solar bach**

National and international groups are getting behind a student led team from Victoria University who will take a solar powered Kiwi bach to the United States.

The team will build and operate the house next year in Washington D.C. as they compete in the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon. The team is one of 20 competing and is the only entry from the Southern Hemisphere ever to reach the finals.

“We are really grateful for the offers of assistance we have had so far, including free accommodation thanks to a former US Navy commissary officer with fond memories of New Zealand,” says team member Nick Officer.

Joe Manelski approached the team and offered the use of his four storied mansion to house the entire project team during their time in the US.

“Joe remembers New Zealand well from his 1959 visit to Christchurch on the way to Antarctica with the US Navy, stocking food for his ship’s half-year missions,” says Nick.

The high profile international competition is held on the National Mall, near the White House in the US capital. Student teams compete fiercely to design, build and operate a solar-powered house that is cost effective, energy efficient, and well-designed.

The teams spend almost two years creating the houses, which are put through a series of 10 contests to evaluate their aesthetics and measure their performance. The drama and excitement grows throughout the 21-day event in October 2011 until finally a winner is found.

The New Zealand team, FirstLight, is led by four Victoria postgraduate students Anna Farrow, Ben Jagersma, Nick Officer and Eli Nuttall.

“We want to build a house that incorporates the best that technology has to offer while remaining simple, open, attractive and easy to live in. The design is a modern take on the classic Kiwi bach and represents our way of life,” says Eli Nuttall.

The team hope to raise awareness around renewable and solar energy and present it as a strong alternative for New Zealanders.

Kiwi expats have lent a hand to help forge links with universities from the US and Canada. American University in Washington D.C. has offered support so the team will have friendly faces to make them feel welcome while they are far from home.

Fanshawe College from Ontario, Canada will help with construction in both New Zealand and the US with staff and students offering to travel to help with the initial build in Wellington, and then joining the team to construct the house on the Mall. The high-tech bach will be built in Wellington next year for display before being dismantled and shipped to the competition.

A number of individuals and businesses in New Zealand have also given their time and expertise. Industry experts from a variety of fields have offered their advice, which has been invaluable for the students involved.

“We’ve been overwhelmed by the support we have received from these extremely passionate Kiwis; we’ve learnt so much already," says team member Ben Jagersma.

FirstLight wants to showcase the best New Zealand has to offer with their entry and are aiming to fill the house with New Zealand products and appliances.

“So far a number of companies have been very supportive and the team are hoping that the entire house can be supplied by donations of products,” says Anna Farrow.
