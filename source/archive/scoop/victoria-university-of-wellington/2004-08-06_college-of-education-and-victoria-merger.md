Wellington College of Education and Victoria University of Wellington welcome merger consultation

The future shape of teacher education is likely to be influenced by merger between the Wellington College of Education and Victoria University of Wellington. Both institutions have a commitment to a shared vision of teacher education that is connected to subject knowledge, teaching practice and teaching research.

“Our vision is to develop highly competent teachers with a commitment to lifelong learning and the ability to make a positive difference to the lives of the people they teach,” said Wellington College of Education Principal, Dugald Scott.

“Underlying the proposal to merge is a belief that twenty-first century teacher education and support programmes ought to be knowledge-rich and this is achievable within a University environment,” said Mr Scott.

The Minister of Education, the Hon Trevor Mallard, is seeking public input on the proposed merger that, if approved by the Minister, is intended to take effect from 1 January 2005. Implementation would involve disestablishment of the Wellington College of Education and incorporation into Victoria University of Wellington.

Both institutions had sought the advice of their respective Academic Boards with both Boards strongly supporting the merger. The College Council agreed to a merger on 25 May, and the University Council passed a similar resolution on 26 May.

“Victoria University and the College have worked together in partnership for more than 100 years. It is time now to ensure long-term stability by protecting and further developing what has been achieved through our current strategic alliance,” said Professor Stuart McCutcheon, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington.

“A merger offers much-needed security and sustainability with appropriate structures for teacher education and support, and will foster education programmes and services grounded in research that is directly applicable to teaching and teachers,” he said.

Under the merger proposal Victoria University would establish a College of Education consisting of Schools and a Faculty of Education to oversee the academic programmes taught by the Schools. The current Karori Campus will be retained as one of the University’s four campuses.
