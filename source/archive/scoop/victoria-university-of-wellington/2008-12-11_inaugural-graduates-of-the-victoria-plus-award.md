Inaugural graduates of the Victoria Plus Award

Students at Victoria University can now enrich their formal qualifications and develop their social responsibility, leadership and employability skills by joining the Victoria Plus Award programme.

Tonight the first 18 graduates of the programme, which has attracted more than 400 student registrations, will be presented with their award certificates.

The Victoria Plus Award was offered from February 2008 to recognise those students who make a significant contribution to the volunteer and student support work within the University and local Wellington community. Students commit to completing volunteer and student support work, extra-curricular activities, participating in workshops, networking and completing written reflections in the extra-curricular programme.

Victoria Plus Award graduate Andrew Pickering says joining the programme was a rewarding experience that also improved his employment opportunities when he finished his studies.

\"Through volunteering I have learnt that many organisations rely on the support of volunteers, and that work can be motivated by rewards such as shared sense of achievement. A small sacrifice of personal time can have many positive benefits be it the provision of a much needed service for a disadvantaged sector of the community, or the opportunity for a not-for-profit organisation to be financially self-sustainable."

Mr Pickering fulfilled much of the service component of the award as a Residential Adviser in two Halls of Residence. He also volunteered at the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary and as a driver for Victoria University's Disability Support Services.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says the programme is an opportunity for Victoria University students to develop the desired graduate attributes of leadership and communication skills and creative and critical thinking outside of an academic environment.

Victoria University offers two extra-curricular leadership development programmes to all domestic and international students. The Victoria International Leadership Programme is an academically-oriented programme with a focus on global issues, cross-cultural communication, sustainability and international leadership skills.

"These programmes recognise the work many students already do to build their leadership and community-service skills while studying at Victoria, and will provide additional opportunities for students to learn from leaders in Wellington and abroad," says Professor Pat Walsh.
