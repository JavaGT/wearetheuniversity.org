Cynthia Enloe is Research Professor in the Department of International Development, Community, and Environment and Women's Studies at Clark University. Her feminist teaching and research has focused on how women’s labor is made cheap in globalised factories, how women’s emotional and physical labor is used to support governments’ war-waging policies, and how many women have tried to resist both of those efforts. Author of twelve books including Bananas, Beaches and Bases: Making Feminist Sense of International Politics (2000), Maneuvers: The International Politics of Militarizing Women’s Lives (2004), and Globalization and Militarism: Feminists Make the Link (2007), her new book Nimo’s War, Emma’s War: Making Feminist Sense of the Iraq War is forthcoming in spring, 2010.

  
Proudly presented by the Programme in Pacific Studies in Va’aoman Pasifika  
in partnership with the Programme in Political Science and International Relations, and in association with Peace Movement Aotearoa and the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom. Please RSVP to Diana Felagai, tel (04) 463 5830 or email diana.felagai@vuw.ac.nz
