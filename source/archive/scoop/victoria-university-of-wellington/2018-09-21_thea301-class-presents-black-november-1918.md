THEA301 Class presents Black November 1918
==========================================

Victoria University of Wellington’s THEA301 Class presents  
_Black November 1918_  
  
On the 100 year anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic that plagued New Zealand, THEA 301 and director Kerryn Palmer present: _Black November 1918_. Following the end of World War One and in the wake of celebrating our soldiers return - New Zealand was confronted with the most lethal disease outbreak we have ever seen, an estimated 9000 New Zealanders died in two months.

“_Flicking through old family photos, I found a haunting photo of my Grandfather and his 8 siblings. Their parents had died within two days of each other at the height of the 1918 influenza pandemic. The more I began talking and reading about what had happened to my family, the more I realised that many people didn’t even know that New Zealand had experienced such a catastrophic event. An event that brought the country to its knees.” -_ Director Kerryn Palmer  
  
Black November 1918 has been influenced by family stories, verbatim accounts, the 2013 STAB production Pandemic at BATS Theatre, and detailed research by the company. The promenade-style devised performance delves into the homes and lives of ordinary Wellingtonians affected by the flu. It confronts the audience with the potential impact a modern day flu pandemic would have on 2018 New Zealand.

“_Most of the soldiers died lonely deaths on foreign battlefields, but the flu was fought here at home, in every town and in at least half of all households. This was a crucible of shared experience for a young nation. It should not be forgotten, in case something similar ever happens again.”_ - Dr. Geoffrey Rice. _Black November - The 1918 Influenza Pandemic In New Zealand_
