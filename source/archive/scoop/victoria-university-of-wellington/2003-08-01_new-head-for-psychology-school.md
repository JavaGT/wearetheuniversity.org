New Head For Psychology School

Professor Susan Schenk is to head Victoria University's School of Psychology for the next three years.

Professor Schenk is an expert in drug abuse, her research having examined the effects of cocaine, ecstasy and other amphetamines.

Before joining Victoria in February 2001, Professor Schenk was a Professor in the Psychology Department at Texas A&M University in the United States. Prior to joining Texas A&M in 1987, she worked at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, as a Lecturer and Assistant Professor of Psychology.

A Canadian, Professor Schenk has a BSc from McGill University in Montreal, an MS and a PhD from Concordia.

Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Science, Professor David Bibby, welcomed Professor Schenk's appointment.

\"Professor Schenk has a world-class reputation for her research and has in a short time attracted substantial grant income, both from within New Zealand and internationally. I am confident she will continue the School's proud tradition of promoting excellence in teaching and research."

Professor Schenk said the School had significant strengths and she was keen to provide continued leadership to staff and students.

"Staff in all areas of psychology at Victoria have strong research programmes while the School initiated the establishment of one applied research centre, the McKenzie Centre for the Study of Families and is working on another in cross-cultural psychology.

"We have also recently recruited new staff with expertise in forensic and clinical psychology. The School has a large number of undergraduate and postgraduate students and our staff members are committed to ensuring that they receive a top-notch education.

"We are proud of the fact that our graduates have been very successful in a fairly competitive job market and that our work to promote and encourage biculturalism and to increase the number of Maori and Pacific students, has also borne fruit."

Professor Schenk replaces Professor Colleen Ward who completed her term on August 1.
