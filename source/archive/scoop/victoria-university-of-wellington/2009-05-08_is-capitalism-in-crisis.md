MEDIA RELEASE  
8 May 2009

Is capitalism in crisis?

The future of capitalism will be debated by prominent speakers at Victoria University next week.

Organised by the Victoria University Debating Society and sponsored by Victoria University, the debate, open to the pubic, will tackle the big questions raised by the recession.

Arguing that capitalism is in crisis will be Green MP Catherine Delahunty, whose affirmative team-mates are Jackson Wood (editor of Victoria’s Salient magazine) and Workers’ Party Member Don Franks.

They will be faced by a line-up of Roger Kerr (Director of the New Zealand Business Roundtable), economist Phil Barry (of Taylor Duignan Barry Ltd) and champion student debater Stephen Whittington.

Victoria University Debating Society spokeswoman Emily Bruce says the topic is highly relevant.

“Questioning the effect of capitalism on both individuals and society as a whole in light of the recession is engaging and relevant for everyone—as is considering its future.”

The debate is the first in the society’s 2009 public debate season. Last year successful debates considered the existence of God, the possibility of education vouchers in schools and culminated in a pre-election political clash.

The Victoria University of Wellington Debating Society, founded in 1899, is the most successful debating society in New Zealand and ranked as the 19th best in the world. It currently holds the New Zealand Impromptu, Prepared, and British Parliamentary debating titles, and was a semi-finalist at last year’s World Debating Championships.

What: Debate - That Capitalism is in Crisis.  
When: Monday 11 May, 6:30pm  
Where: Lecture Theatre One, Rutherford House, Pipitea Campus, Victoria University  
Entry: Gold coin donation. There will be refreshments after the debate.
