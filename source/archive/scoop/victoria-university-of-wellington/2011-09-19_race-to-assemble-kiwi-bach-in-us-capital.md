Race to assemble Kiwi bach in US capital

Victoria University students are putting the finishing touches on their solar powered bach in Washington DC today as they compete in the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon 2011.

The Victoria University team is the first finalist ever from the Southern Hemisphere in a prestigious and highly anticipated international competition The Solar Decathlon challenges university teams from around the world to design, build and operate solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient and attractive.

Teams have been working 24 hour days for the past five days on the National Mall’s West Potomac Park and are racing against the clock to have their houses finished by 7pm on September 20 (11am September 21 - NZ time).

The Victoria team is a long way from their support network at home but they were joined by a group of students and staff from Fanshawe College in London, Ontario. The Canadian group travelled down to DC to lend a hand with the assembly of the house and provide a North American insight.

The team’s entry – the Meridian First Light house – was assembled on Wellington’s waterfront earlier this year to a fantastic public response. The team, led by students from Victoria’s School of Architecture say the practice run in New Zealand gave them a real edge.

Team member Nick officer says: “It’s been incredibly hard work over here but having done it once before has been a huge help, the team is working well together to get things done quickly.”

There have been a few major differences between the build in NZ and the US mostly due to the competition itself.

“The biggest difference of course is we now have 18 other teams building their houses around us. The first few days were tricky with trucks lined up to come on site but now there is a real community feeling amongst the teams with tools and materials are shared when needed.”

After assembly is complete the US public will see what makes New Zealand unique when they tour through the Meridian First Light house inspired by the classic Kiwi bach.
