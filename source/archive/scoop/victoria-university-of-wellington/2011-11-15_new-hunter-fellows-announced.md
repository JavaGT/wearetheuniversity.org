**New Hunter Fellows announced**

Victoria University has announced its two latest Hunter Fellows, who will be recognised in a ceremony in Victoria’s iconic Hunter Building this month.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says he is delighted that the University has the opportunity to recognise the valuable contributions made by John Greenwood and Pae Ruha.

“Hunter Fellows are people who have made a substantial contribution to advancing Victoria University’s strategic directions and interests,” says Professor Walsh.

The Hunter Fellowships will be presented at a ceremony in the Hunter Council Chamber at Victoria on 21 November.

The Hunter Fellowship Award was instituted by the Victoria University Council in 2003.
