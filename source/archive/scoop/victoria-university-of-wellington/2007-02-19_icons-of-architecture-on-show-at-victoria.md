Icons of architecture on show at Victoria

Wellingtonians will be able to gain a unique overview of the icons of early modern architecture at an exhibition to be held at Victoria University’s Te Aro Campus this week.

The exhibition, Neues Bauen International 1927/2002, is presented by Germany’s Institute for Cultural Relations in co-operation with the Goethe-Institut of Wellington and Victoria University’s Faculty of Architecture & Design.

Media are invited to the opening function at 6pm on Wednesday 21 February at the University’s Te Aro Campus, Vivian St, Wellington, with the exhibition opening to the public at 9am on Thursday 22 February.

Head of the School of Architecture, Professor Gordon Holden, said the exhibition provided a fascinating insight in the work of the founders of modern architecture.

“Neues Bauen International 1927/2002 is based on an exhibition that originally showed in Stuttgart in Germany in 1927 and then toured through 17 European cities. Architects such as Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, J.J.P. Oud and Frank Lloyd Wright played pivotal roles in radically shifting the focus of architecture and the influence of their modernist work and designs can still be felt in modern urban landscapes.”

Professor Holden said a highlight of the opening would be a guest lecture by the exhibition curator, Professor Karin Kirsch, of the Technical University of Stuttgart.

“Seventy-five years after the first exhibition, Professor Kirsch’s exhibition shows us vividly how these architects and their buildings have retained their significance in architectural history and it will be fascinating to hear first hand his views on how they are seen today and how their work was viewed in the early 20th Century.”

Media are welcome to attend the exhibition opening: 6pm, Wednesday 21 February 2007, Victoria University, Te Aro Campus, Vivian St.
