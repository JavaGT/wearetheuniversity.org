Chancellor re-elected at Victoria University

Ian McKinnon, QSO, JP, was re-elected Chancellor of Victoria University for 2013 at a meeting of the University Council held on 3 December. Mr McKinnon has held the office since 2010.

Mr McKinnon was elected to the University Council in 2003, and held the office of Pro-Chancellor from 2005 to 2009. He is currently a Wellington City Councillor and Deputy Mayor.

He has worked in the independent school sector and has experience in governance roles, including chair of the Wellington College of Education leading to its merger with Victoria University in 2005 and chair of The Correspondence School Board of Trustees.

Mr McKinnon completed a BCom in Economics at Victoria University in 1966, having also spent two terms on the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association (VUWSA) Executive, and held the role of Men's Vice President in 1966.

Graeme Mitchell is the newly elected Pro-Chancellor for 2013, his first term. Mr Mitchell has been a member of Council since 2009 and is currently the convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee. He is a chartered accountant, recently retired from Deloitte, Wellington where he was an Audit and Assurance Partner for over 28 years. Mr Mitchell completed his tertiary education in economics at Stirling University, Scotland, and has lived in Wellington for more than 30 years.

Victoria’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says Ian and Graeme’s leadership will be invaluable as Victoria University continues to focus on providing top quality educational outcomes for its students. “New Zealand’s tertiary sector continues to be a challenging environment in which to operate and I am delighted to be able to continue working with Ian and Graeme as we set Victoria’s strategic direction.”

Mr McKinnon thanked outgoing Pro-Chancellor Helen Sutch for her years of service. Ms Sutch was in the role for three terms, during which she chaired one of the major committees of Council while also serving on other committees.

The Chancellor is also the ceremonial head of the University presiding over occasions such as Graduation. The Chancellor is elected at the Council’s December meeting and holds office for one year but is eligible for re-election. The Pro-Chancellor is the Deputy Chair of the Council.
