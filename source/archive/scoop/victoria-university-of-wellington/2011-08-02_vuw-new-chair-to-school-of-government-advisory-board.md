**Victoria University appoints new Chair to School of Government Advisory Board**

Professor Pat Walsh, Vice-Chancellor of Victoria University, is delighted to announce the appointment of Dr Paul Reynolds as Chair of Victoria’s School of Government Advisory Board.

Dr Reynolds is currently Chief Executive of the Ministry for the Environment.

“Dr Reynold’s experience and leadership in the public sector will be a tremendous asset to the Board,” says Professor Walsh.

Dr Reynolds joined the Ministry for the Environment as its Chief Executive in July, 2008. Prior to that he worked at the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (1998-2002) as Chief Policy Adviser and then, from 2002-2008, led the Policy Group at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

Before arriving in Wellington, Dr Reynolds had a scientific research career, first with the then Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and then with the Crown Research Institute, HortResearch. He holds a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of Otago.

Dr Reynolds will chair his first advisory board meeting on 4 August.

The role of the advisory board is to guide the strategic direction of the School to help it meet its stated commitments to both the public sector and the University. Advisory Board members are drawn from the University, other academic institutions and government agencies.

The previous Chair was Peter Hughes, Chief Executive of the Ministry of Social Development, who will be taking up the role of Head of the School of Government on 10 October.
