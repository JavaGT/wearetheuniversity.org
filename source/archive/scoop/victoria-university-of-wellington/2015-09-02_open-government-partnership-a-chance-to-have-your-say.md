Open Government Partnership: A chance to have your say

• Meeting to comment on New Zealand’s Action Plan

• 14 September 2015, noon

• Victoria University Law School, Moot room, 3rd Floor, Old Government Buildings, 15 Lambton Quay, Wellington

As you might know, the New Zealand government has signed up to the Open Government Partnership, a forum of countries working to promote government that is open, accountable and responsive to citizens.

Last year, the New Zealand government issued its first OGP Action Plan for 2014-2016. It sets out commitments by the NZ government aimed at improving our systems of integrity, transparency, participation and accountability over the ensuing two years.

Wellington barrister and law lecturer Steven Price is the New Zealand researcher for the IRM, the agency responsible for assessing New Zealand’s performance under the OGP. He is convening a meeting at lunchtime on 14 September 2015 to provide an opportunity for those interested in the OGP to comment on New Zealand’s Action Plan. Do you support it? Could it be improved? Has there been proper consultation? Has the plan been put into action in the past year? What has been achieved? Is it making a difference? Might it be done better next time? How?
