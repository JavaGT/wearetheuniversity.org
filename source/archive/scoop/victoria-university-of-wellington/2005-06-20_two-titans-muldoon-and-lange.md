MEDIA RELEASE

Two Titans: Muldoon and Lange

The leadership of the two prime ministers who dominated New Zealand’s political landscape in the 1970s and 80s are profiled in Victoria University researcher Dr Jon Johansson’s new book, Two Titans: Muldoon, Lange & Leadership.

The book, published by Dunmore Publishing, will be launched by New Zealand First leader, the Rt Hon Winston Peters, at Wellington’s Unity Books on Thursday June 23 at 6pm.

In Two Titans, Dr Johansson, a Lecturer in the Political Science and International Relations Programme at Victoria, examines a tumultuous period of New Zealand politics. He analyses the strengths and weaknesses of both the Rt Hon Sir Robert Muldoon and the Rt Hon David Lange, including an insightful exploration of each man’s character, while drawing valuable leadership lessons that have significant relevance for contemporary New Zealand politics.

“Two Titans also addresses important questions about what political leadership is, why it matters, and explores the type of leadership required from New Zealand’s current leaders to improve the quality of society’s decisions about their own and the country’s future,” Dr Johansson says.

While the Two Titans is Dr Johansson’s first book, he has also this year, edited and published a special edition of the journal Political Science dedicated solely to political leadership studies.
