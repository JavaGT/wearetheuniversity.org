**Victoria rejects Monckton complaint**

3 May 2013

Victoria University has rejected allegations made against three of its academic staff by prominent British climate change sceptic, Viscount Monckton.

Victoria’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says an investigation into the complaint, lodged last month against Professor Jonathan Boston, Dr James Renwick and Professor David Frame, has found Viscount Monckton’s allegations were not substantiated.

Professor Walsh says the investigation was carried out by a senior University professor with expertise in science and in University processes and policy.

“The matter is now closed and no further action will be taken,” says Professor Walsh.

He says the investigator took a range of factors into account. That included the University’s role as critic and conscience of society and academic freedom, under which academic staff are expected to speak publicly on matters in their area of expertise, even if their opinions are controversial or unpopular.

“I want to state clearly that I have faith in these academic staff. By speaking publicly in their field of expertise, they were doing exactly what we expect.”
