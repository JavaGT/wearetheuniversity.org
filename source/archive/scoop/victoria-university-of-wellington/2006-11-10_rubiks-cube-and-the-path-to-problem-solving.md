Rubik’s Cube and the summertime path to problem-solving

A problem-solving course to be run by a visiting American professor in Victoria University’s Summer Trimester could be just the ticket for those who have always been frustrated by that 1980s icon, the Rubik’s Cube.

The course will be run by Professor Edwin Meyer, who is visiting Victoria from Baldwin Wallace College in Ohio, from December 4 to 17. Professor Meyer, who is based in Victoria’s School of Chemical & Physical Sciences, has a PhD in physics and has taught problem-solving at the postgraduate level for several years.

The course is one of a host of courses run by Victoria University in the Summer Trimester which runs from 13 November 2006 to February 2007. Summer Trimester courses are offered by all of the University’s six faculties: Architecture & Design; Commerce & Administration; Education, Humanities & Social Sciences; Law; and Science.

Professor Meyer said the course was unique and a lot of fun for participants.

“It requires no prerequisites in mathematics or science. While this involves logical thought and critical thinking, it is also a lot of fun.

“As a part of the course, students learn how to solve the Rubik's Cube and they’ll be able to do so in less than five minutes. This is not only fun and rewarding, but it also gives students the ability to see and think in three-dimensions. Also, students will work individually and in groups to tackle problems in areas such as managing risk and recognising patterns.”

Professor Meyer said the course would benefit people from all age groups.

“As well as postgraduate students, I’ve also taught this course with talented high school teenagers and they had a great time. Everyone needs to exercise their mind and this is a great opportunity to do so. It will particularly appeal to those who love to solve games and puzzles.”
