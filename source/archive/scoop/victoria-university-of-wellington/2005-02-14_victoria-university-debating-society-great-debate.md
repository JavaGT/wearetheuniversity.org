Victoria University Debating Society Great Debate

Victoria University Debating Society’s ‘Great Debate’ will this year take place on Tuesday, February 22 at 6.30pm in the Memorial Theatre at Victoria University.

The event is part of the university’s Orientation festival.

The topic for this year’s debate is:

‘That we don’t know how lucky we are’

Speaking will be Marian Hobbs (MP for Wellington Central and Government Minister), Deborah Coddington (Act List MP), two well-known local comedians, and two personalities from ‘Kiwi FM’ radio station.

With such an impressive line-up of speakers, the debate is sure to be extremely funny, interesting and thought-provoking.

The Great Debate, the major annual fundraiser for the Victoria University Debating Society, is always a great night out.

Tickets are $8 for members of the debating society, and $10 for non-members. They may be purchased from Orientation ticket offices at Victoria University, or at the Memorial Theatre on the night.

Details: Tuesday, February 22 Memorial Theatre, Victoria University 6.30pm.
