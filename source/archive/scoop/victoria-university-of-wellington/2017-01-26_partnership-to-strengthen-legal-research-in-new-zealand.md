Partnership to strengthen legal research in New Zealand

Victoria University of Wellington’s Faculty of Law and Thomson Reuters have announced a new partnership to support and promote the Faculty’s leading legal research.

The partnership will support authors from the Faculty of Law who are contributing to the A to Z of New Zealand Law—a comprehensive series of topic-based texts by New Zealand’s leading legal minds.

Building upon the well-established research scholarship programme developed a number of years ago by Victoria University’s Scholarship office, Thomson Reuters will, for two years, part-fund scholarships for students to provide research assistance to those authors.

Victoria’s Faculty of Law is the number one ranked law school in the country for research quality, in the most recent PBRF (Performance Based Research Fund) evaluation.

Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean of Law Professor Mark Hickford says the partnership will leverage the Faculty’s powerful culture of research to help provide timely, accessible research for academic and professional audiences.

“The mutually reliant nature of legal research and publishing means that the more closely we can work together, the more efficient the process and outcomes for both.

“We continue to meet rapidly evolving needs—both in terms of supporting theoretical legal research, and in the provision of practical teaching and reference resources for the profession.”

Ian McIntosh, Thomson Reuter’s Commercial Manager—Product Development, says the innovative partnership with Victoria’s Faculty of Law is the first of its kind for Thomson Reuters New Zealand.

“We see it as a true collaboration designed to produce mutually beneficial outcomes both now and in the future for Victoria’s Faculty of Law and Thomson Reuters.”

The first recipients of the new Thomson Reuters Victoria University Legal Research Scholarships are Eru Kapa-King and Kahu Haimona, who will provide assistance to Dr Carwyn Jones in support of Te Ākinga: The Māori Dimension of New Zealand Law; and Katie Alexander, who will assist Dr Grant Morris who is working on Mediation in New Zealand. Both are scheduled to be published this year.
