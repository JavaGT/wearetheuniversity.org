### Finding consensus following the crisis

The world is cautiously emerging from a global recession, which has led to a new and genuine scrutiny of the international economic system. An international conference in Wellington on 7-8 July 2011, “Enhancing Stability in the International Economic Order”, will analyse the past two decades and work towards generating a consensus about a way forward for international economic relations.

The NZCIEL (New Zealand Centre of International Economic Law) is hosting the multidisciplinary conference, which brings together scholars, businesspeople, policy makers and researchers.

“The focus will be on generating innovative ideas to tackle issues that have emerged from the global economic recession,” says NZCIEL Director, Professor Susy Frankel of Victoria University’s Faculty of Law.

“The programme also looks at specific responses to crises of different kinds, including financial and environmental and will evaluate the response of the international community.”

Keynote speakers are Professor David A. Wirth of the faculty of Boston College Law School and Sean Hughes, Chief Executive of the Financial Markets Authority, who has 20 years international experience in securities and capital markets, surveillance and enforcement functions (see attached brochure for more information).

“It is hoped that in addition to scholarly discussions, the conference will provide guidance for policymakers, practitioners, regulators and adjudicators,” says Associate Professor Alberto Costi, “and that it contributes to the development of a more equitable and ethical economic order.”
