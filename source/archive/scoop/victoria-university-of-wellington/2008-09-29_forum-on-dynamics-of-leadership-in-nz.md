About the forum  
Brad Jackson, Professor of Leadership at The University of Auckland Business School, chairs a discussion with Brigid Carroll, Jon Johansson and Paul Morris about the dynamics of leadership in the increasingly media-driven, success-oriented environment that we have come to know as the democratic nation state. Using The Subject Now exhibition as a catalyst, and timed to coincide with the lead-up to the 2008 general elections, this discussion will think through the dynamics that produce leaders bringing together a range of key thinkers from different disciplines to discuss this topical question. The forum ties in with the last week of the Adam Art Gallery’s current exhibitions.

Speaker biographies  
Brigid Carroll is a Senior Lecturer in Leadership and Organisation Studies in the Department of Management and International Business, and both a Leadership Design/ Development Facilitator and a Senior Research Fellow for Excelerator, The NZ Leadership Institute.

The Subject Now exhibition and forum series  
The Subject Now exhibition brings together nine artists working in various locations who pose new and compelling questions about the nature of the human subject under present conditions. Working mainly with photography and video these artists recognise the ever-present role of these media today, and offer a timely set of responses that map the terrain of contemporary experience for viewers to negotiate.  
Te Mata: The Ethnological Portrait and The Subject Now close this Sunday 5 October. The Subject Now forum series expands on the artistic, theoretical and political implications of the exhibition, to broaden the discussion of what it means to be a ‘subject now’. The forums bring together a range of commentators working in different fields to debate key issues shaping our social, cultural, political and technological landscapes.
