Students offered online fee payment system
==========================================

**Press Release: [Victoria University of Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_of_Wellington)**

  
You can pay for a multitude of products from airline tickets to new clothes online – now Victoria University students can pay for their course fees through the Internet.

Since February, the more than 15,000 students at Victoria have been able to use the Student Records facility on the University's student portal, studentVUW (www.studentvuw.vuw.ac.nz) to check their timetable, courses, grades, account details as well as allowing them to update their address, telephone and email details.

Last week a new feature was added giving all enrolled students the ability to pay for their fees online using their credit card.

Pam Thorburn, Director of Central Student Administration, said a pilot of the new service had been a success.

\"The ability to pay fees is particularly useful for students who are not on the Kelburn campus, and those wanting to make payment outside normal business hours. The new feature is a logical extension of Victoria's move two years ago to allow students to enrol through the Internet and our ongoing commitment to be responsive to student needs."
