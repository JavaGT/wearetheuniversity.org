Nominations sought for distinguished alumni

Victoria University of Wellington is calling for nominations for its Distinguished Alumni Awards, which recognise outstanding contributions by graduates of the University.

The Distinguished Alumni Awards will be made for the first time at the inaugural Annual Alumni Dinner in October.

Vice-Chancellor, Professor Pat Walsh, says the awards honour alumni who have made outstanding contributions through their different achievements to their professions, communities, or country.

“The awards are expected to span all professional, political, voluntary, creative, sporting and social domains.

“The selection panel will pay particular attention to nominees who epitomise the attributes of a Victoria University graduate – creative and critical thinking, leadership, and communication skills,” he says.

Nominees must hold a degree or diploma from Victoria University or the former Wellington College of Education which merged with Victoria University in 2005.

Nominations close on 30 April 2006. People wishing to make a nomination can contact the Alumni Relations Office on (04) 463 6700 or by email to alumni@vuw.ac.nz for more information or a nomination form. Details and the nomination form are also available on the University’s website www.vuw.ac.nz/alumni

Nominees and their partners will be invited to attend the Annual Alumni Dinner at the Wellington Town Hall on Thursday 12 October 2006, where the awards will be presented.
