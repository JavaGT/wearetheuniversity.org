International enrolments flourish at Victoria

Victoria University’s international student numbers have increased by 54 percent compared to the same time last year.

At the same time, domestic students have expressed confidence in Victoria by increasing at a rate above the national average.

As at 1 August 2003, 661 more international equivalent fulltime students (EFTS) are studying at Victoria compared to 1 August 2002. This contributes to a record total of 1,885 international EFTS.

For the same period, domestic EFTS have risen 5.3 percent, up from 11,252 to 11,850.

The overall student headcount has grown by 11.66 percent, from 15,637 at 1 August last year to 17,461, representing an overall EFTS increase of 10.3 percent.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon says the rise in international student numbers is in keeping with the University’s strategic international marketing approach and predicted outcomes.

“Our strong international reputation means Victoria’s international student numbers have not been curtailed by SARS, the rising Kiwi dollar and the threat of international terrorism,” he says.

“Victoria prides itself on providing quality education in a supportive environment and we are steadily building on a reputation as the destination of choice among international students.

“These latest enrolment figures are testament to the high-quality academic programmes and pastoral care services we provide to international students in keeping with our early compliance with the Ministry of Education’s Code of Practice.”

Professor McCutcheon says it is equally pleasing to see domestic EFTS increasing above the national average, characterised by static or declining domestic enrolments elsewhere.

“This trend indicates Victoria is an attractive study option for a growing number of New Zealand students in a highly competitive tertiary market. The dynamic atmosphere of our Capital City University is increasingly valued.”

Within defined areas of study at Victoria, EFTS increases are particularly strong within Humanities (up 12.8 percent); and Commerce & Administration, (up 7.3 percent).
