**Victoria University debaters beat Oxford and Cambridge to take world title**

Capping off an extraordinary year of success, Victoria University debaters Sebastian Templeton and Richard D’Ath have taken on the world and won.

Yesterday the pair took top honours at the World Universities Peace Invitational Debate in Malaysia, beating Oxford, Cambridge and Ateneo de Manila universities in the final.

Each year top debaters from 30 international universities are invited to take part in this prestigious competition in the lead-up to Christmas.

“Both Seb and Richard have had an outstanding year and with this result have proved they are at the top of their game, not only in New Zealand but on the world stage. I congratulate them both on their spectacular success,” Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh said.

Earlier in the year the Victoria Debating team won the Australasian Intervarsity Debating Championship title in South Korea, and took out the New Zealand competition the Joynt Scroll for a sixth consecutive year.

The team will now head to Manila, where 1,400 participants from more than 70 nations are expected to compete in the World Debating Championship.
