**Conference to highlight labour, employment and work issues**

An upcoming conference supported by Victoria University of Wellington and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will reflect on key issues in the current labour, employment and work environment in New Zealand.

More than 50 research papers will be presented, some of which will be presented in five ‘focus’ sessions on: migration and the labour market; understanding insecure work; changing demography of the labour market; the ageing workforce; and women in the labour market.

Other topics include changes in occupational structure, renewing unions, the living wage, safety at work, labour market catchment trends, nurse migration and student employment in the care sector.

Keynote speakers are Professor David Fergusson from the University of Otago, Christchurch and Professor Garry Barrett from the University of Sydney. Professor Fergusson will discuss findings from the Christchurch Health and Development Study that shows being unemployed when young has implications all the way through life and Professor Barrett will talk about the experiences of older people when they retire based on an analysis of the effects of changes to the Australian Age Pension.
