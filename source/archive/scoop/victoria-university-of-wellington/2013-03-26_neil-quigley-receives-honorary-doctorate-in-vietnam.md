**Victoria’s Neil Quigley Receives Honorary Doctorate In Vietnam**

Victoria University’s Professor Neil Quigley has been awarded a prestigious honorary degree by the University of Economics in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This honour recognises Professor Quigley’s commitment to education in Vietnam and relations between the two countries.

The internationally-respected economist and Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) at Victoria University of Wellington received an Honorary Doctor of Economics degree in Vietnam on 23 March.

Professor Quigley pioneered the development of tertiary education relationships between New Zealand and Vietnam, developing a number of joint programmes between Victoria University and institutions in Vietnam.

Most importantly, he was the founder of Victoria University’s joint venture campus with the University of Economics in Ho Chi Minh City under which hundreds of students have transferred to Wellington to complete Victoria’s Bachelor of Commerce degree.

The Victoria campus at the University of Economics in Ho Chi Minh City is one of New Zealand’s most successful offshore education initiatives. It is the foundation on which Victoria has built the largest number of Vietnamese student enrolments of any New Zealand university.

Professor Quigley held an appointment at Victoria University from 1985 to 1992, and was appointed Professor of Monetary Economics and Financial Institutions a decade later, in 1995. He has served as Executive Dean of what is now the Victoria Business School, Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Resources), Pro Vice-Chancellor of both the business school and the University’s international division, before taking up his current role as Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) in 2005.

Professor Quigley also serves as a Director of the Reserve Bank, the New Zealand Qualifications Authority, and a number of University companies.

He received the Government of Vietnam Medal for Promoting Peace and Friendship Between Nations in 2006 and chairs the New Zealand–Vietnam Friendship Association.
