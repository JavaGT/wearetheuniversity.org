Victoria University scores well in international ranking system

Victoria University is continuing its success in university rankings, being named one of the top 50 universities in the world in four subjects.

The 2013 QS World University Rankings rank Victoria at number 19 in Law. Other subjects in which Victoria is in the top 50 are Politics and International Relations (41), English Language and Literature (44) and Psychology (49).

Victoria was also ranked in the top 150 in the world in eight other subjects: Modern Languages, Philosophy, Computer Science and Information Systems, Earth and Marine Sciences, Geography, Communications and Media Studies, Education and Economics and Econometrics.

The QS World University Rankings cover the world’s top 700 universities and ratings are based on a range of measures including peer review, citation rates and employer surveys.

The results follow the recent Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) Evaluation, which ranked Victoria first among New Zealand universities for research.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says the QS World University Rankings are further external confirmation of the calibre of research and teaching at Victoria.

“The various ranking systems use different measures and different methodology but the overall message is consistent: Victoria is a university of high international standing.”
