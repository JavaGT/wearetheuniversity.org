Two Honorary Doctorates will be conferred to musician Richard Nunns and distinguished lawyer Emeritus Professor David Mullan. Richard Nunns, a leading performer and teacher in the revitalisation of traditional Māori musical instruments, will receive a Doctorate of Music and David Mullan will receive a Doctorate of Law.

A first for digital media major

Family trio

It will be a family affair for Jeff, William and Henrietta Hunkin who graduate together, all with Bachelor of Arts degrees, on 10 December 2008. The trio, who also share a talent for barbershop singing, will be watched by proud parents Ane Hunkin and senior lecturer in Victoria University’s Va’aomanu Pasifika Galumalemana Hunkin.  
Husband and wife team

Mariana and Atene (Anthony) Andrews graduate this December with a BA in Criminology and Psychology and MBA respectively. Mariana (Ngati Whatua/Nga Puhi) and Atene (Ngati Porou) are both keen to contribute to the development of Māori in New Zealand—Mariana through Honours study and then community work and Atene in the Department of Labour. Atene also says Mariana’s graduation is far more special than his as it was her time to advance her own academic and career interests after a raising a family of three and a marriage of 25 years. “She represents that significant gender and generation who have often foregone their own careers for the benefit of their partner in life.”

MBA mum

  
Mother and soontobe MBA graduate Amy Allison was warned an MBA would change your life, but hers changed more than most. She graduates on Tuesday 9 December five and a half years on and three children later, after also working fulltime during most of her studies. She says spending 24 months pregnant with all day morning sickness honed her ability to write assignments and study while lying down. She’s looking forward to her children Munro (5), Fergus (4) and Maisie (2) seeing her graduate next week.

. Media releases on a selection of PhD thesis topics will be issued this week. If the graduation parade is cancelled due to wet weather, notification will be given on Newstalk ZB from 11am on the morning of the parade.
