Victoria students win Top Doctoral Scholarships

Victoria University staff and students have awarded six prestigious Bright Futures Top Doctoral Scholarships worth almost $1 million in the latest round of awards from the Government-funded scheme.

Forty-seven students nationwide received Bright Futures Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships in the December 2005 round to study either at a New Zealand or overseas university. About $6 million was distributed in this round, which is administered by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC).

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research), Professor Neil Quigley, said the scholarships recognise and reward the best postgraduate students and ensure they have the support they need to undertake research.

“One of Victoria’s key strategic objectives is to substantially increase the proportion of postgraduate students in the next decade and so success in external scholarship rounds is critical to achieving that goal. Increasing the number of postgraduate students not only further enhances our research culture but also the University’s revenue through the Performance-Based Research Fund.”

Three students received Bright Futures Top Achiever Doctoral Scholarships to study at Victoria University. The scholarships are worth more than $265,000 in total. They were received by:

\- Julia de Bres, a student in the School of Linguistics & Applied Language Studies, holds a BA(Hons) and Graduate Diploma of Arts from Victoria. She plans to research the promotion of positive attitudes towards the Māori language among non-Māori in New Zealand.
