Despite earthquakes and hurricanes preceding their arrival, the New Zealand team competing in the US Department of Energy Solar Decathlon will soon build their Kiwi bach just a stone’s throw from the White House.

The first contingent of the Victoria University team arrived in Washington DC to begin pre-assembly of the house earlier this month, delayed slightly due to an unscheduled stopover in Los Angeles after hurricane warnings for the East Coast of the US. Just a week earlier the area, not known for tremors, was rocked by a 5.8 magnitude quake.

Team member Nick Officer says, “Once the wind died down we managed to get to DC and worked hard to make up time and get back on track.”

The Victoria University team is the first finalist ever from the Southern Hemisphere in the prestigious international competition. The Solar Decathlon challenges university teams from around the world to design, build and operate solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient and attractive.

The team’s entry—the Meridian First Light house—was assembled on Wellington’s waterfront earlier this year to a fantastic public response. More than 20,000 people toured through the house during the 18-day opening period.

That practice run in Wellington will now pay off for the team, led by students from Victoria’s School of Architecture. Starting from 11pm on September 13 (3pm on 14 September NZ time) the team will work in shifts to fully assemble their solar powered house in just six and a half days.

“It’s going to be hard work but if our Kiwi bach can withstand an earthquake and hurricane in the space of two weeks, it should be able to stand up to the 21 day competition. Here’s hoping for good weather,” says Nick.

After assembly, the New Zealand team will be showing their house on the National Mall’s West Potomac Park where they will compete in a series of ten contests against university teams from the US, Canada, China and Belgium. The winner of the competition will be announced on 1 October.
