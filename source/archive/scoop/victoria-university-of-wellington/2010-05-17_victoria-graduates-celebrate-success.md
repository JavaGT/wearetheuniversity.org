Victoria graduates celebrate success

**Victoria graduates celebrate success**  
  
Almost 2000 students will celebrate successfully completing their Victoria University studies at this week’s graduation processions and ceremonies.

Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says graduation is worth celebrating as getting a degree from Victoria is the result of hard work and dedication.

“Victoria has an established reputation both in New Zealand and internationally for academic excellence and the calibre of its research and postgraduate study—getting a degree is not just a matter of turning up to class.

“We strive to produce graduates with skills in communication, creativity and critical thinking, and leadership who will make a valuable contribution to the New Zealand economy and society.”

Professor Walsh says that the week of graduation not only adds vibrancy to the capital city—it also boosts the local economy.

“A number of family members and friends come from out of town to attend the parade and ceremonies, florists are kept busy putting together congratulatory bunches of flowers, and restaurants and bars are overflowing as people go out to celebrate afterwards.”

Thirty-two PhDs will be granted, along with approximately 2100 degrees, diplomas and certificates.

Honorary Doctorates will be granted to two of Victoria’s outstanding alumni, chemist Professor Martin Banwell, and Professor Anthony Reid, an historian of Southeast Asia.

The traditional street parades of staff and graduands will depart from the Law School in the Government Buildings Historic Reserve on Wednesday and Thursday at noon, and will take around 40 minutes to parade along Lambton Quay and Willis and Mercer Streets to finish in Civic Square, where they will be welcomed by Mayor Kerry Prendergast.

The first of five ceremonies will begin at the Michael Fowler Centre on Tuesday 18 May at 6pm for students graduating from the Faculties of Architecture and Design and Science.
