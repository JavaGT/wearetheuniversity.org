Scholarships fund to address student hardship
=============================================

Victoria University is launching a scholarships fund to help students with high academic potential who are financially disadvantaged.

A recent study at Victoria University found that 69% of Victoria’s students had financial difficulties and 42% believed the time they spent in paid employment had a negative impact on their grades.

Maori students were particularly hard hit, with 73% having financial difficulties and more than half (52%) believing their grades were being hurt by the time they spent in paid work.

“The scholarships fund will help top students complete their degrees without suffering the distractions and emotional distress caused by extreme financial need,” says Tricia Walbridge, Executive Director of the Victoria University Foundation.

Ms Walbridge says the scholarships fund is looking to raise $150,000. “The dollar value of each scholarship will depend on the amount of money we raise,” she says. “The money will go directly to students.”

The scholarships will be offered at undergraduate level from 2001. Students will need to maintain a high grade average to retain their scholarships from year to year.

The Victoria University Foundation is writing to all Victoria graduates this week, asking for donations to the fund. People interested in making a donation should contact the Foundation on 04 463 5109.

The Foundation is a registered charitable trust governed by an independent Board of Trustees. All donations qualify for a charitable gift taxation rebate.
