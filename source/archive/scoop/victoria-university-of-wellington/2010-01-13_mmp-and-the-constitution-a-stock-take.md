MEDIA RELEASE  
13 January 2010

A Constitutional Stock-take: MMP and the Constitution

This country’s MMP electoral system is soon to be subject to a binding referendum. A recently published journal from Victoria University’s New Zealand Centre for Public Law provides timely assistance to the public and analysts of New Zealand’s political landscape on the performance of MMP.

The journal, a special issue of the New Zealand Journal of Public and International Law, is a compilation of papers presented at a conference ("MMP and the Constitution: 15 years past; 15 years forward") held at Victoria's Law School just before the last election.

"The conference was really a constitutional stock-take," says Dean Knight, Senior Lecturer, conference organiser and joint editor of the journal. "In the journal, experts review the effect of MMP on our nation's constitutional fabric and assess the likely constitutional challenges that MMP presents in the next 15 years."

The journal issue includes analysis from New Zealand’s constitutional and political experts about the effect of MMP on the parliamentary process, political parties and the operation of the executive. United Kingdom and European experts provide comparative perspectives on proportional representation generally.

“The public is soon to be invited to evaluate MMP and decide on its preferred electoral system,” says Dean Knight. “It is hoped the analysis in this journal will assist people making that evaluation.”

“The type of electoral system we use to elect our politicians of fundamental importance to the constitutional balance. It is important people have access to robust and considered analysis so they can make an informed choice in the referendum.”

The journal is available for purchase from the Victoria Law Faculty for $60.
