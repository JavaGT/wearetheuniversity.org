__Times Higher Education_ magazine today publishes the 2013 edition of its annual _Times Higher Education_ 100 Under 50 ranking – a bespoke evaluation of the world’s top 100 universities under 50 years of age.

The ranking provides a fresh perspective by examining the new breed of global universities – those that have managed to join the world’s best in a matter of decades rather than centuries, and which have the potential to become future global leaders.

The list also shows us which nations may challenge the US and the UK as future higher education powerhouses, and Australia seems well placed on current evidence.  
The 2013 _THE_ 100 Under 50 uses the same comprehensive list of 13 performance indicators that underpin the prestigious _THE_ World University Rankings, but employs a specially recalibrated methodology (developed in consultation with experts) to better capture the characteristics of young institutions.  
The ranking is once again headed by South Korea’s Pohang University of Science and Technology (Postech), while its national rival, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), draws closer to the top by moving from 5th to 3rd.  
Switzerland’s École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne retains second place, while the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology falls from 3rd to 4th. The University of California, Irvine is 5th, down from 4th last year.

The top 10 includes representatives of eight countries: new to the list are the Netherlands’ Maastricht University (6th) and Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University (8th). France’s Université Pierre et Marie Curie is ninth (down from 6th) and is joined by Université Paris-Sud in 10th.

Unlike the _Times Higher Education_ World University Rankings, which examine institutional performance irrespective of history and heritage, the 100 Under 50 is designed to be dynamic and forward-looking, so only universities founded in 1963 or later are listed.

As with last year, the UK has more institutions in the top 100 list than any other nation. However, its figure of 18 institutions is down two year on year. The UK’s 2012 tally of three top 10 universities has fallen to just one.

In terms of national strength, Australia follows the UK with 13 institutions (down from 14 last year). While it loses two from the list (Edith Cowan University and RMIT University), it gains one: Murdoch University (founded in 1973) takes joint 57th place after submitting data for the first time in 2012-13.

Australia’s top-ranked institution, the Queensland University of Technology, jumps from 40th last year to joint 26th. The University of South Australia is another to show significant improvement, rising from 65th to 48th.

New Zealand has two representatives, both founded in 1964: the University of Waikato (46th) and Massey University (81st).

While it dominates the traditional university rankings, the US has only eight institutions in the top 100 and most of them are losing ground. Canada has four institutions on the list, all established in the 1960s. They are headed by the University of Victoria in joint 20th place.

Overall, 28 countries/regions feature in the list, compared with 30 last year.

Australia & New Zealand’s neighbours in Asia again make an impressive showing in the under-50 rankings, with eight countries in the continent represented (although there is no place for mainland China or India).

The top Asian nation in terms of numbers is Taiwan, which has five representatives, led by National Sun Yat-Sen University in 37th spot (down from joint 30th last year).

Hong Kong stands out: not only are all four of its representatives in the top 40, but it also boasts some of the youngest institutions in the ranking. Its top performer, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, in fourth place overall, was founded in 1991. The City University of Hong Kong (18th) was established in 1984, while Hong Kong Polytechnic University (joint 34th) gained its university title as recently as 1994.

South Korea may have only two representatives in the top 100, but with Postech taking first place and KAIST rising from fifth to third, the nation is attracting a lot of international attention. Singapore, although with only a single representative in the ranking (Nanyang Technological University in 8th), is also an exciting prospect.

Japan has one player, the University of Tsukuba, which falls from 39th to joint 49th.

The _Times Higher Education_ 100 Under 50 is part of the portfolio of university ranking systems that have established _THE_ as the world’s most respected and widely referenced provider of comparative university performance data.

Comments

Phil Baty, editor of the _Times Higher Education_ Rankings, said:  
“These new figures are really exciting. They disrupt the settled higher education hierarchies. They show clearly that new powers in global higher education and research are emerging.

“The traditional elite cannot afford to coast on centuries of history and tradition, or rely too heavily on reputation – there is a new breed of dynamic universities emerging quickly and visibly to challenge for their crowns. Some of these younger institutions have proven that with the right focus and support, they can establish themselves as serious global forces in years rather than generations, and already compete with and even eclipse their ancient rivals. Others show signs of massive potential.

“The _THE_ 100 Under 50 rankings also serve as a warning to Western governments that enjoy great economic returns from established, world-leading higher education systems without investing in the future: through investment, innovation and strategic vision, East Asian nations have been able to build world-class institutions quickly – and many more nations are following suit. These rankings prove that the competition for future world dominance in higher education and research is wide open.”

Country by country quotes  
All quotes by Phil Baty, editor, _Times Higher Education_ Rankings

Australia  
“This ranking is good news for Australia. Only the UK has more representatives in the top 100 list than the country, which beats the likes of the US and France. Australian universities did very well in the 2012-13 World University Rankings, but this list shows the true strength of its system – it includes representatives from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and shows that it is not just Australia’s traditional elite that can compete on the world stage.  
“But there are warning signs for Australia, too: it has no institutions in the top 20 and two representatives have dropped out of the top 100 this year. Meanwhile, a number of East Asian institutions have consolidated their positions.  
“Many nations are focusing on building world-class institutions, backed with serious investment, so Australia’s recently confirmed funding cuts should be viewed with concern.”

New Zealand  
“The 130-year-old University of Auckland is New Zealand’s only top 200 player in the overall World University Rankings, so the presence of two institutions in the 100 Under 50 is good news and a sign of future potential.  
“But while it offers encouragement, the ranking should also serve as a warning: it is full of younger and higher-placed institutions from developing economies that have focused resources on building world-class universities. The competition is only going to intensify as more nations and institutions join the race.”
