_Times Higher Education_ magazine today publishes its prestigious 2013-14 World University Rankings. It was another strong year in general for East Asian nations.  
The California Institute of Technology retains its place at the top for the third consecutive year, with Harvard University regaining second place (up from fourth), a position shared with the UK’s University of Oxford. Stanford University slips from joint second to fourth.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (fifth), Princeton University (sixth), the University of Cambridge (seventh), University of California, Berkeley (up one place to eighth), the University of Chicago (up one place to ninth) and Imperial College London (down two places to 10th) complete the top 10.

The _Times Higher Education_ World University Rankings are the most comprehensive, carefully calibrated and highly respected global league tables, using 13 separate performance indicators to examine a university’s strengths against all its core missions – teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. The rankings are powered by Thomson Reuters, which independently collects, analyses and verifies the data.

Japan solidified its position as Asia’s number one nation in the rankings, with a total of five top-200 universities. South Korea has four top 200 institutions, while Hong Kong lost a top 200 institution (City University of Hong Kong) and now has only three representatives.

Japan’s University of Tokyo maintains its status as Asia’s number one and moves up four places to 23rd. The National University of Singapore holds on to second place in the region, moving from 29th to 26th and overtaking Australia’s University of Melbourne in the process.

South Korea’s Seoul National University moves into the top 50 for the first time (44th), followed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (up from 68th to 56th).

Peking University in China creeps up one place to 45th, while its close rival, Tsinghua University, rises two places to joint 50th.

Thailand’s only top-400 representative, King Mongkut’s University of Technology rose from the 351-400 group into the 301-350 band.

The University of Hong Kong is one of the few leading East Asian institutions not to improve its position, falling eight places to 43rd. However, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (57th) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (joint 109th) both make significant gains.

India increased its representation in the overall rankings, although none reached the top 200 list. India has five universities in the group of universities ranked between 200th and 400th. It was led by Panjab University, which made the 226th to 250th group.

Australia lost a top 200 institution with the University of Adelaide slipping out of contention, leaving seven representatives in the list. Of these, four have fallen, with the country’s number one, Melbourne, dropping out of the world top 30 and down to third place in the Asia-Pacific region.

New Zealand’s only top 200 representative, University of Auckland, dropped from 161st last year to 164th.

The US continues to dominate, taking seven of the top 10 places. This year it has 77 institutions in the rankings – one more than in 2012-13. It seems to have largely arrested signs of decline in recent years: of its top 200 institutions, 40 have risen up the tables, 33 have fallen and four have retained their position.

Europe has generally fared badly this year. While the UK’s number one, Oxford, holds on to second place in the table, almost across the board the continent’s top institutions lose ground: ETH Zürich ¬- Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich, the world number one outside the US and the UK, slips two places to 14th; Germany’s University of Munich falls out of the top 50; and it is a similar tale of woe for Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Austria.

Scandinavia is an exception to the trend, with its top institutions strengthening their positions.

The UK remains Europe’s strongest representative, with 31 universities in the top 200. The Netherlands has 12 players, followed by Germany with 10 (down from 11 last year), France with eight, Switzerland with seven and Belgium with five (one more than last year).

**Key facts**

• There are 26 countries in the world top 200 list – two more than last year thanks to Turkey, Spain and Norway rejoining the group (Brazil drops out)  
• The highest-ranked institution outside the US and the UK is Switzerland’s ETH Zürich ¬- Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich, which slips two places to 14th  
• Asia’s number one is the University of Tokyo, rising four places to 23rd  
• After the US and the UK, the Netherlands is the next best represented nation (12 institutions), but its number one, Leiden University, makes it only to 67th  
• France has eight representatives  
• Belgium has five top 200 institutions  
• Switzerland has seven players, maintaining its numbers from 2012-13  
• Germany has 10 universities in the top 200 (one fewer than last year). Its highest-ranked player, Munich, has fallen out of the top 50  
• The Republic of Ireland has just two top 200 institutions – and neither make the top 100  
• Japan has five representatives, more than any other Asian nation. After worrying signs of decline, most improved their positions this year  
• Of the so-called “Bric” economies, Brazil, Russia and India are not represented in the top 200  
• The Middle East is represented in the list by Turkey and Israel. The latter now has two players, down one from last year  
• Saudi Arabia and Iran have no top 200 institutions (although both are represented in the 200-400 group)  
• Eight countries now have only one top 200 representative – Austria, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan and Turkey  
• Africa has only a single representative: Cape Town (joint 126th)  
• New Zealand’s sole representative, Auckland, loses ground  
•  
**Comments**

Phil Baty, the editor of _Times Higher Education_ Rankings, said:

“The power shift from West to East is not as dramatic this year as the US and the UK have both managed to arrest alarming falls at the national level. But the trend is continuing: the vast majority of continental Europe’s leading institutions have slipped, while those leading the East Asian nations have for the most part risen yet again.

“More Asian institutions are nipping at the heels of the best in the West, increasingly occupying world top 50 places and showing no signs of letting up.”
