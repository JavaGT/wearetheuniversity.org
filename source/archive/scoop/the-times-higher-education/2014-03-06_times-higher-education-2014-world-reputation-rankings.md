A strong global reputation is essential to university success, allowing institutions to attract staff, students, business investment, research partners and benefactions in a highly competitive world market.

The 2014 rankings have again highlighted an elite group of six US and UK “super-brands” that stands head and shoulders above the rest: Harvard University in first place, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in second, Stanford University third, the University of Cambridge fourth, the University of Oxford fifth and the University of California, Berkeley sixth.

But the US has strengthened its grip on the tables: Stanford’s rise of three places from sixth last year pushes Oxford and Cambridge down a place each. And the California Institute of Technology’s rise (up two places to ninth) displaces the University of Tokyo from the top 10, the first time it has failed to secure a spot since the reputation rankings were established in 2011.

Overall, the US is the undisputed superpower when it comes to university brands, and it is gaining in strength. It takes the top three places, eight of the top 10 (up from seven last year) and 46 of the top 100 (up from 43 in 2013). Of those 46 institutions, only 14 have lost ground.

In the Asia-Pacific region, Australia loses ground. It now has five top 100 representatives, down from six in 2013: Monash University, which scraped in last year, loses out after a small drop in performance. Only one Australian institution, the University of Melbourne (down four places to joint 43rd), remains in the top 50 compared with three last year, although the country’s performance has remained largely stable since the survey began in 2011.

Asia’s strongest performer by a distance is Japan, with five top 100 representatives. While its flagship, Tokyo, exits the top 10, its peers do better: Kyoto University makes the top 20, Osaka University enters the top 50 and the Tokyo Institute of Technology rises from 61-70 to 51-60.

China and the special administrative region of Hong Kong have had a mixed year. China’s top institution, Tsinghua University, slips one place to 36th, while Peking University climbs four places to 41st. While Hong Kong’s highest-placed representative, Hong KongUniversity, falls from 36th to joint 43rd, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology rises a band to 51-60, edging closer to the top 50 after starting in the 91-100 band in 2011.

South Korea has done well this year, gaining an extra representative, Yonsei University, which jumps straight into the 81-90 band. Meanwhile, the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology moves from 61-70 to 51-60 while the country’s flagship, SeoulNational University, becomes Asia’s biggest riser, leaping from 41st to 26th.

The National University of Singapore continues its steady year-on-year progress, rising from 27th in the first exercise in 2011 to 21st this year. Meanwhile, Singapore’s other player, Nanyang Technological University, slips into the 91-100 band.

Taiwan’s sole representative, National Taiwan University, maintains its place in the 51-60 band.

After the US, the UK has the most top 100 representatives: 10, up from nine last year. However, its overall showing has worsened since 2011, when it had 12 representatives. The data also reveal a worrying polarisation between the “golden triangle” (London,Oxford and Cambridge) and the rest of the UK.

In representative terms, the US and the UK are followed by Germany, which gains a top 100 entrant, RWTH Aachen University (joining the 91-100 group), giving it six institutions in the rankings. Germany’s fortunes contrast dramatically with France’s. Two French institutions fall out of the top 100 (Université Paris_\-_Sud and École Polytechnique), leaving the country with just two representatives.

Russia, meanwhile, loses its foothold in the top 50: its only representative, Lomonosov Moscow State University, falls into the 51-60 band.

In total, 20 countries are represented.  
The World Reputation Rankings are part of the portfolio of league tables that has established _Times Higher Education_ as the most respected provider of comparative global higher education performance data. They are based on a global invitation-only opinion poll carried out by Ipsos MediaCT for _Times Higher Education_’s rankings data supplier, Thomson Reuters. The poll has attracted 58,117 responses from more than 150 countries in four annual rounds. The 2014 results are based on 10,536 responses from published senior academics who reported an average of 18 years working in higher education.

Research by international student recruitment agency IDP has shown that a university’s “reputation/ranking” is the single most important consideration for students choosing study destinations, above fees and even course content (http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2012-13/world-ranking/analysis/name-is-the-game).

A separate study by the World 100 Reputation Network has found that institutional reputation is the number one factor for international academics changing jobs (http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=419275).

**Key facts**  
• There are 20 countries represented in the world top 100 reputation list  
• Five make the top 20: the US, the UK, Japan, Canada and Switzerland  
• Only the US and the UK make the top 10  
• The highest-ranking university outside the UK and the US is Japan’s University of Tokyo (11th, down two places)  
• Six London universities in the top 100, more than any other city in the world  
• South Korea’s Seoul National University is Asia’s biggest riser, up 15 places to 26th, but it remains only fourth in the region  
• King’s College London is Europe’s biggest riser – up from 61-70 to joint 43rd  
• India does not have a single representative in the tables  
• Brazil’s University of São Paulo is the sole South American presence (81-90 band)  
• A number of institutions’ standing does not match their excellence, with reputation rankings much lower than their positions in the more objective World University Rankings. They include: UC Santa Barbara (33rd in the WUR 2013-14, 61-70 in the reputation rankings); Brown University (joint 52nd in the WUR, 81-90 by reputation); and the University of Queensland (joint 63rd in the WUR, 81-90 by reputation)  
• The Republic of Ireland is not represented  
• Three institutions seem to be enjoying a reputational “halo effect”, included in the tables but failing to make the top 200 of the World University Rankings: Moscow State, Middle East Technical and São Paulo  
•  
**Comments**

**Phil Baty, editor _of Times Higher Education_ Rankings, says:**  
  
“A university’s reputation for academic excellence is absolutely vital to its success: it drives student and faculty recruitment, international research partnerships, and helps to attract philanthropy and industrial investment. And while reputation is based on subjective opinion, in this case it is the informed, expert opinion of those in the know: experienced scholars from around the world.

“The annual _Times Higher Education_ World Reputation Rankings, based now on responses from almost 60,000 carefully selected and statistically representative academics, have become a closely watched and vital indicator of the fortunes of global university brands.”

**Bahram Bekhradnia, president of the UK’s Higher Education Policy Institute, says:**

“While reputation surveys do not tell you anything objective about quality, they nevertheless do reflect visibility and awareness by others of a university’s activities: academics are likely to be more aware of those with whom they’ve recently collaborated, those with recent relevant articles and those presenting at conferences. So a reputation survey such as this is likely to be a harbinger of things to come and a predictor of subsequent trends.”

Methodology key facts

• The World Reputation Rankings are based on the results of the Academic Reputation Survey carried out by Ipsos MediaCT for Thomson Reuters, data supplier to the _Times Higher Education_ rankings. The 2014 World Reputation Rankings are based on 10,536 responses from 133 countries to the survey distributed in March-May 2013.  
• The survey is available in 10 languages and is distributed based on United Nations data to ensure that it accurately reflects the global distribution of scholars. _Times Higher Education_ does not allow volunteers to take part in the survey and accepts no nominations from institutions or any third party.  
• The poll asks academics to nominate no more than 15 of the best institutions in their narrow field of expertise, based on their experience and knowledge, making it a rigorous global measure of academic prestige.  
• For the 2014 table, some 30 per cent of responses were from the Americas, 34 per cent from Europe, 26 per cent from Asia Pacific and 9 per cent from the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia (figures rounded).  
• Twenty-two per cent of respondents hail from engineering and technology, 22 per cent from the social sciences, 18 per cent from the physical sciences, 16 per cent from clinical subjects, 13 per cent from the life sciences and 9 per cent from the arts and humanities.
