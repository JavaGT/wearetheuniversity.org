Great Race Media Conference
===========================

**Press Release: [Waikato University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Waikato_University)**

Great Race media conference

A pre-race media conference involving the Oxford University (UK) and Waikato University rowing crews is being held next Friday 5 September ahead of the Great Race on the Waikato River in Hamilton on Sunday 7 September.

Both the Oxford and Waikato crews will be present along with race organisers.

A pre-race weigh-in of the crews will provide a good photo/filming opportunity.

Tens of thousands of people are expected to turn out to watch the race, which will also be screened live on TV One.

The media conference will be held at 10am on Friday 5 September inside the Post Restaurant at the Sky Riverside casino in Victoria St, Hamilton.

The format will be an introduction by event organisers, followed by the weigh-in, then an open question session and further time for photo opportunities.

The Gallagher Boathouse 8s Great Race, presented in association with Hamilton City City Council, is an annual event that began last year when Waikato beat Cambridge University from the UK.
