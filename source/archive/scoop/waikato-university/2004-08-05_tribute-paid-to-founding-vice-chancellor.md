WAIKATO UNIVERSITY PAYS TRIBUTE TO FOUNDING VICE-CHANCELLOR

Professor Bryan Gould, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Waikato, said today that the whole university would mourn the passing of its Foundation Vice-Chancellor, Sir Don Llewellyn, who died yesterday.

"The university has lost a true friend and a towering figure in its history and development.

"If anyone could claim to be uniquely important in the establishment and success of the university it was Don.

"The value of his contribution extended well beyond the university but it was his work as our first Vice-Chancellor which always remained close to his heart. We will miss him."
