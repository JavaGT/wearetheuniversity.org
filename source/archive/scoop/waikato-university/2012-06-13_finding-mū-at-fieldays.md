**Finding Mū at Fieldays**

University of Waikato graduation mascot Mū will be hiding at Fieldays this year.

The cuddly Friesian cow, appropriately dressed in red band gumboots and flannel, will be among the crowds at the National Agricultural Fieldays, and those who can guess where Mū is, and correctly answer a few rural-related questions, will be in to win.

On Wednesday and Thursday morning a photo of Mū hiding at Fieldays will be posted on the University of Waikato Facebook and twitter pages, with a trivia question relating to Fieldays.

Waikato University staff will be waiting with Mū on Friday morning, and the first person to find them, correctly guess Mū’s weekly locations and answer the trivia questions from the previous days wins a $20 Momento voucher.

People are encouraged to join in the hunt for Mū on twitter and Facebook and post their guesses of where Mū is throughout Fieldays.

To join in and help find Mū follow us on Facebook and twitter.
