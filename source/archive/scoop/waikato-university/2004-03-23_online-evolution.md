Online evolution

An A-to-Z of the sometimes controversial subject of evolution is being made available from today on a new Waikato University website.

The site is aimed primarily at providing expert support and quality material for New Zealand's science teachers.

The Evolution for Teaching website is on: http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/evolution/index.shtml

The website has been developed over eight months by a group of staff from the School of Science and Technology.

"We've created the site in response to issues raised with us by teachers and as a result of our own research into the gaps in the sites that were already available," says the team's leader, biological sciences lecturer Alison Campbell.

"The new site stands apart from existing material available on the web in that it specifically focuses on evolution and related geological concepts from a New Zealand perspective, with New Zealand examples and links to the New Zealand senior school curriculum. It's already received very favourable comment from teachers, university staff and bodies such as NZ Skeptics."

The content will be reviewed annually so that the site remains accurate and relevant.

On Friday 26 March from 5.30pm-8.30pm, the department of biological sciences will host a launch of the website at the university for interested biology and science teachers.
