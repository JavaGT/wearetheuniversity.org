International fees protest this Friday
======================================

**Thursday, 3 June 2004, 1:43 pm**  
**Press Release: [Waikato University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Waikato_University)**

International fees protest this Friday at Waikato University

Waikato University students will be protesting against fee increases for international students and calling on the University to stop treating international students like cash cows.

“International students cannot afford to face fee increases and if the University wants to keep attracting International students here, they cannot afford to raise fees either,” said Sandy Pushpamangalam, Waikato Student Union (WSU) President.

“The only solution is to freeze international students fees for 2005 and introduce Grand-parenting of international student fees in the future”.

The protest will start at 1pm on Friday 4 June at the Banks at Waikato University and will include an appearance from a young cow to show the University that its students are not cash cows.
