Top Waikato Line-Up At Nz University Blues Awards

Waikato University athletes will be picking up a record number of New Zealand University Blues at this year's awards ceremony on Friday 30 July at Parliament.

Waikato will have 10 athletes and coaches getting a NZ University Blue, the highest number in one year for the university. Waikato is equal with Massey in having the highest number of people getting an award this year.

Rowers head the Waikato University list of NZ University Blues recipients with Caroline Evers-Swindell, George Bridgewater, Paula Twining and coach Steve Wills getting awards. Caroline and George are competing at the Athens Olympics.

Other Athens Olympians getting a Blue are cyclist Peter Latham and shooter Nadine Stanton.

The remaining Waikato Blues winners are Dean Armstrong (indoor hockey), Peter Longdill (canoeing), Leanna du Plooy (netball) and sports administrator/coach Rod Laurence (hockey).
