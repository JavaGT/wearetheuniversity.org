Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Praises Michael King's Contribution To New Zealand

The death of historian Michael King is a "devastating loss" for New Zealand, says Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould.

Dr King was appointed to a senior research fellowship at the university in 2002. He was in the process of writing a history of Waikato University, due to be launched early next year as part of the university's 40th anniversary celebrations.

"Our sympathies are with his family. Michael was New Zealand's premier historian and a hugely significant figure in developing New Zealand's national identity. His recent Penguin History of New Zealand was a tour-de-force," says Professor Gould.

Dr King graduated from Waikato University with a Master of Arts in 1968. In 1977 he returned to the university to complete a doctorate.

"His death is a huge loss to New Zealand and the university. He was a valued friend to many of our staff," says Professor Gould.
