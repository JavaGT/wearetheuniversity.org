**Ten subjects ranked in top 200**

Ten subjects taught at the University of Waikato have been recognised as among the best in the world.

The subjects have been ranked in the top 200 in the world by rankings organisation Quacquarelli Symonds (QS).

Last year the university had five subjects ranked in the top 150 but the latest rankings now have 10 in the top 200 and another, modern languages, in the top 250.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says the subjects are from a range of Faculties and highlight the breadth of quality education on offer.

“We work hard to ensure the subjects we teach, we teach very well,” he says.

Having twice as many subjects ranked as last year shows the ongoing commitment of staff to constantly improve on what they do, he says.

Professor Quigley says many of the ranked subjects are among the most popular at the University and students will be encouraged to know the education they are receiving is world class.

The ten subjects ranked in the top 200 are:

\- Law  
\-  
\- Education  
\-  
\- Economics and Econometrics  
\-  
\- Computer Science and Information Systems
