University and Wintec join forces

Waikato University and Wintec have signed an agreement which will further enhance learning and research in the region and will see the complementary delivery of some programmes.

The university and Wintec, (the Waikato Institute of Technology), recently formalised the agreement which aims to provide even better learning and research options - and to ensure the Waikato’s two leading academic institutions can quickly and effectively respond to the needs of the region.

Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford and Wintec chief executive Mark Flowers said universities and polytechnics had distinctive but complementary contributions to make to the delivery of quality tertiary education.

“By working together our two institutions can maximise the benefits to students, businesses and the wider Hamilton and Waikato communities,” Prof Crawford said.

Mr Flowers said the partnership would see complementary programme planning as well as support of each other’s distinct programmes.

“A closer strategic working relationship would include a shared view on sector issues and could include collaborative planning. This would mean that while there would still be choices available to students, the agreement would reduce duplication and in fact probably provide wider options.”

A steering committee - the Waikato Tertiary Education Executive Committee - comprising both Prof Crawford and Mr Flowers, senior staff from the two institutions, stakeholder representatives and a Hamilton City Mayoral appointee, will drive the educational and research alliance. Initial focus will be on land-based industries and the health sector, building on both organisations’ current and planned provision in those areas.

Said Prof Crawford: “Given our location at the centre of New Zealand’s farming, research and science heartland, it makes sense to jointly enhance the contribution to those industries in the first instance.”

Waikato University and Wintec plan to work closely with Waikato’s research-based industries and organisations, and councils to build overall capability in the region by identifying needs and responding through teaching and research.

Mr Flowers said the partnership was very much for the Waikato. “Our focus will be on contributing to the region’s wealth and economic sustainability, as well as social and cultural development.”

The steering committee will be established before the end of May. It’s estimated that an agreed joint plan around land-based industries and health will start within the next two or three months.
