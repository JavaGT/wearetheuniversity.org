First footsteps in new relationship

A collaboration between Waikato University’s Centre for Continuing Education and a Mâori community organisation will be used as a template to enhance relationships between the University and the iwi members of Te Rôpû Manukura, Tainui and the wider Mâori community.

The University’s pro vice-chancellor (academic) Peggy Koopman-Boyden and Rau Awaawa Trust today signed a memorandum of understanding for He Tû Hononga, a Mâori community initiative that provides University-sponsored education programmes for kaumâtua, their whânau and the Frankton/Dinsdale community in Hamilton.

The collaboration is in line with the Government’s tertiary education strategy and funding has been secured by the University to support and resource the educational programmes.

The Trust will continue to provide a number of nil-fee programmes from their premises, Te Puna o Te Ora, including training and employment opportunities, advocacy, information assistance, and social support. Programmes aim to foster Mâori development, self-determination and self-sufficiency within a community development framework.

The University’s pro vice-chancellor Mâori Tamati Reedy says the pilot programme plays an integral role in developing sustainable pathways for Mâori into higher education.

“We see this as a realistic way of providing learning opportunities to Te Ropu Manukura who have a large geographical spread. Further developments will hopefully see us utilising more community centres to reach Mâori and provide them with chances to further their education”.
