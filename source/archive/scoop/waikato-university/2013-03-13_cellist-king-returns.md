**Cellist King Returns**  
  
Top Waikato University music graduate and Hillary Medalist Edward King returns from cello studies in Germany to perform at the lunchtime recital series on Wednesday 20 March.

Held in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts at the University of Waikato, Edward will be performing with his former teacher and mentor James Tennant and pianist Katherine Austin.

“We will be performing works by Boccherini, Beethoven, Martinů and Farr, a mix of pieces from the Lutostawski competition, and from another international competition I am entering in May this year”.

Edward is looking forward to teaming up with Tennant and Austin again and says it will be great to perform with them where it all began.

The feeling is reciprocal, and Tennant has been keeping a close eye on Edwards’s progress and successes since he left Waikato.

“It will be a great pleasure and opportunity to collaborate with this returning star and to witness first hand his development,” says Tennant.

Edward recently competed in the Witold Lutostawski International Cello Competition in Warsaw, where he won third prize overall, and received a special prize for best performance of _Sacher Variation_, a solo composition of Lutostawski’s.

Of his studies at the Leopold Mozart Centre in Augsburg, Germany, Edward says he loves that the program encourages individuality as a musician and the standard of cellists he is studying amongst is extremely high.

He is set to graduate with a master of music in July this year and says there are a number of options he is considering.

“I definitely want to stay in Germany, and will potentially look at further study in Berlin or Munich. Ultimately though, I see myself building a career around a variety of solo performance, chamber music, orchestral performance and chamber music”

Edward is also part of the Leonari trio, a talented young trio comprised of Hilary Hayes, (violin), Edward King (cello), Maria Mo (piano), all Waikato university Graduates who successfully toured the UK last year after the group won the Pettman/Royal Overseas league International Scholarship.

The lunchtime recital series is held in the Concert Chamber at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, every Wednesday at 1pm and is open to the public. A $5 donation gains entry to see Edward perform on Wednesday 20 March.
