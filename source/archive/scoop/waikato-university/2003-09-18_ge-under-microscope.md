GE under microscope

The ethics of the highly contentious subject of genetic engineering will be addressed at a public seminar at Waikato University next Thursday 25 September.

The seminar will also be video-conferenced via the Coronet network to the Coromandel region.

Waikato researchers Alastair Gunn and Kelly Tudhope, who have both written and presented widely on genetic engineering, will lead the seminar, which is expected to feature lively debate on aspects of GE.

“Cultural and spiritual concerns around GE are often overlooked and many of these are unique to this country. People have strong opinions on this subject. We want to look at those aspects which in some cases have been overshadowed by the health and economic issues,” says associate professor Gunn.

With the moratorium on field release of GE plants and animals to be lifted next month, a good turnout is expected.

The two-hour seminar starts at 7pm in room SG02 at Waikato University. It is free to students, $10 for the waged, $5 unwaged.
