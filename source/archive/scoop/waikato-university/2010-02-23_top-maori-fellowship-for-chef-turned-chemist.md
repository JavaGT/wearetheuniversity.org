**Top Maori fellowship for Waikato University chef-turned-chemist**

A Northland chemistry student at the University of Waikato has won a top fellowship worth $34,500 over two years.

The Te Tipu Putaiao Fellowship will allow Sam Pachal, who’s of Ngaiterangi descent, to begin Masters-level research on ways to add value to the titanium by-products of iron sand mining.

Up to 20 TTP Fellowships are offered by the Foundation for Science, Research and Technology each year with the aim of strengthening Maori knowledge, people and resources.

Pachal will be working with the Maori-owned Taharoa mine site, south of Kawhia.

The former Whangarei Boys High student nearly turned his back on science after dropping out of university and training as a chef. He worked in restaurants for two and half years before returning to complete his science degree at Waikato.
