University takes classroom to the Chiefs

The University of Waikato has taken the classroom ‘out on the road’ in an initiative to give the Chiefs rugby players a career pathway once their professional playing days are over.

The Super 14 franchise players have signed up with the University for a certificate in management, which is being taught in weekly three-hour sessions at the Waikato Stadium.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the collaboration with the Chiefs is a high profile example of how the university is taking a flexible approach to the provision of education.

“Our primary goal is to educate people, and with the Chiefs we’re working with individuals and organising a programme that suits their lifestyles rather than expecting them to fit in with us.”

Chiefs Captain Steven Bates says what they do after rugby is a genuine concern for a lot of players. So he’s pleased the Chiefs management has taken the step to assist players for when their careers move into a new phase.

Greg Smith, the Chiefs professional development manager, is a fan of tertiary education, and hopes the initiative will give the players confidence to go on to further university study.

“These guys acquire considerable skills as rugby players – they learn to analyse, strategise, develop human resource skills and become proficient communicators. It’s a natural step to take all those skills and transplant them into a business environment.”

The Chiefs players are currently tackling the first of eight papers, Introduction to Management. Other papers from management, law and sport will be offered over a two year period.
