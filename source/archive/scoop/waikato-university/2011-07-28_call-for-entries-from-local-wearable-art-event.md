### Call for Entries From Local Wearable Art Event

ReStyle’s annual wearable arts fashion show makes a call for entries as the closing date for the competition draws near on August 10.

ReStyle encourages the community to create unique high fashion and artistic pieces to walk the runway that are made solely from recycled goods and waste materials. As a not-for-profit charitable trust, ReStyle relies on its valued sponsors to run the annual event in Hamilton, such as The Body Shop.

“This years show is going to be unlike any other ReStyle event,” says Event Co-Manager Laura McClennan. “We have introduced a new stage set up and theme to the show, and have come up with a collection of what we hope to be inspiring categories for ReStyle contestants to enter, such as Goin Gaga, Mad Hatter and our signature Avant Garabge,” says Miss McClennan.

ReStyle is entering its 11th year, and with a new organizing committee, the show hopes to compete with the likes of WOW, New Zealand’s most well known wearable arts competition, and also build a more high-fashion and artistic image.

Kylie Barugh, ReStyle Co-Manager, would like to see Hamilton’s young designers step up to the challenge and enter the competition.

“We get a lot of entries from school students, which is fantastic, but it would really help ReStyle to grow if we could secure a higher number of design students or those with a real passion or experience in fashion design. Some of our past winners have gone on to be very successful in the fashion industry, meaning ReStyle provides a great opportunity to build designers skills and confidence, as well as simply being a really fun and exciting experience to be part of” says Miss Barugh.

ReStyle 2011 is set to grace the stage at the Founders Theatre on September 10. Entry forms are available from The Body Shop or from www.restylehamilton.co.nz
