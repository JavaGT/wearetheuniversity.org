MEMORIAL CELEBRATION OF LIFE OF MICHAEL KING

Waikato University will hold a memorial celebration of the life of historian Michael King, who died tragically in a recent motor accident along with his wife Maria Jungowska.

The event, featuring readings of Dr King's work and music, will be held in the Gallagher Concert Chamber, WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts, at noon on Wednesday 5 May.

Members of the public are welcome to attend.

Dr King had a long association with the university, was awarded an honorary doctorate in 2002 and was a Waikato senior research fellow at the time of his death.

Waikato University's Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould said Dr King was a valued friend and colleague who is sorely missed.

\"Our event next week will give all of us at the university an opportunity to celebrate Michael as a person, as a colleague and as a New Zealander who made a huge contribution to the intellectual and spiritual life of this country."
