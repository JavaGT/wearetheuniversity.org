**Waikato University to host Dr Joe and the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry**

Are cows more trustworthy than chemists?

This question will be answered at the 2011 New Zealand Institute of Chemistry conference being held at the University of Waikato this month.

Among the academic and industrial chemists coming to the conference from around the world, will be keynote speaker Dr Joe Schwarcz, Director of McGill University’s Office for Science and Society.

Dr Joe, as he is known to his fans and students, is well known for his informative and entertaining public lectures, as well as his best-selling books and Discovery Channel series, and will deliver his plenary speech _Are Cows more trustworthy than Chemists?_ on November 29.

The inspiration for the topic comes from a Time Magazine article about the merits of conventional and organic produce which featured a curious quote from a professor of nutrition education at Columbia University. When asked if she preferred butter or margarine, she replied, “I would rather trust a cow than a chemist”.

“Unfortunately such negative comments about chemistry are not unusual these days as the lay press often focuses on ‘toxic chemicals’ in our air, water, food and even in our blood,” says Dr Joe, who wrote the best-selling book Brain Fuel.

“The truth is that chemicals are neither safe nor dangerous. There are safe ways to use chemicals and dangerous ways to use chemicals. The International Year of Chemistry is an especially appropriate time to try to build a dike of scientific reality to stem the rising time of chemophobia.”

Conference convenor Dr Michele Prinsep said the University of Waikato was a perfect place to host the conference.

“We are especially fortunate to be hosting the conference in the International Year of Chemistry. With Hamilton having the highest number of scientists per capita of any city in New Zealand and Waikato being ranked the top university in the country for Chemistry research, it is especially apt to be doing so.”

The conference starts on November 27 and during its five days covers analytical and environmental, industrial and material, inorganic and organometallic, organic, physical, biological and educational chemistry among its many topics.

During the conference there will be a variety of local and international presentations, covering all areas of chemistry and related scientific pursuits.
