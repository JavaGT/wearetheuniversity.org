Waikato Management School first in New Zealand to join UN-backed initiative

The University of Waikato Management School has become the first New Zealand business school -- and one of the first one hundred worldwide -- to sign up to a global initiative to promote corporate responsibility and sustainability in business education.

The Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) initiative aims to develop a global engagement platform for academic institutions and is backed by the United Nations Global Compact.

Professor Juliet Roper, Waikato Management School’s associate dean for sustainability, says signing up to the PRME is a significant milestone marking the School’s commitment to teaching and practising sustainability.

“It’s important to us to be part of this initiative,” she said. “By being part of it, we’re endorsing it, and confirming that our mission, strategy and core competencies of teaching and research align with the principles of PRME.

“It means we will continue to include corporate responsibility and sustainability issues in curriculum development and will encourage leadership that advances responsible business practices.”

The Principles of Responsible Management Education was officially launched in July last year with a secretariat established in the UN Global Compact Office. The organisation is currently establishing several working groups to advance its cause, and a global forum is being held at UN headquarters in New York in December.

The six PRME principles are purpose, values, method, research, partnership and dialogue all geared to promote understanding of globally responsible leadership and to develop its practice.

Waikato is the only New Zealand university involved in the initiative, joining La Trobe and Griffith from Australia.
