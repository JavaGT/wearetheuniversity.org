Law Lecturer Wins Prize In US Writing Contest

Anna Kingsbury, a senior lecturer in Waikato University's School of Law, has won a prize of US$1,000 in the 2003 New York State Bar Association Intellectual Property Law Section annual writing contest.

The prize was awarded for an article on United States intellectual property law written while on study leave at New York University Law School in 2002-3, during which time Anna Kingsbury completed a graduate degree in trade regulation, concentrating on intellectual property law and antitrust law.

Her winning article was entitled Market Definition in Intellectual Property Law: Should Intellectual Property Courts Use an Antitrust Approach to Market Definition? The article argued that courts in intellectual property cases should adopt the approach to market definition used in antitrust cases, and that the effect of not using an antitrust approach was in many cases to unjustifiably extend the level of protection provided to intellectual property rights holders.

The article is to be published in the Winter 2003 issue of Marquette University Intellectual Property Law Review. It will also be reprinted in the New York State Bar Association Intellectual Property Law Section's professional newsletter.

Anna Kingsbury has also been asked to attend the association's annual meeting in New York City.
