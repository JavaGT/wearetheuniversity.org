Lecture to look at marine biological invasions

**Enemy at my port! Lecture to look at marine biological invasions**

Humans have greatly influenced the distribution of marine species worldwide which has had significant effects.

Marine biological invasions are at the centre of University of Waikato biologist Professor Chad Hewitt’s Inaugural Professional Lecture this month.

During the lecture Professor Hewitt will consider and discuss how we can prevent further human-mediated re-distribution of marine species and what controls can be put in place.

“I’ll discuss the global context of marine introductions, including our understanding of how species arrive in new locations, the scale of introductions, and the biosecurity frameworks we can put in place to prevent new invasions,” says Professor Hewitt.

“Fundamentally it’s about understanding the biology and ecology of species, the mechanisms of movement - vector ecology, and which interventions work.

“Embedded within that is good governance; in New Zealand and Australia we operate under a risk management framework. Risk management critically relies on good science with feedback: how the science feeds into policy, and how the policy informs what science is needed.”

Professor Hewitt’s research portfolio revolves around the role humans play in changing the natural world, particularly in marine systems, and how natural science can influence management and policy. His research has primarily focused on how humans have transferred species around the globe, the consequences of those movements in ecological and evolutionary contexts, and the ways that we can predict, prevent and/or mitigate the impacts of these novel species.

Professor Hewitt is the Head of the School of Science at the University of Waikato, responsible for the academic leadership in bringing together the disciplines of Biology, Chemistry and Earth & Ocean Sciences into a single academic unit within the Faculty of Science and Engineering. Building on the existing teaching and research strengths of the three departments he will lead the further development of a world class research and teaching portfolio.

Inaugural Professorial Lectures are free and open to the public and are the University of Waikato’s way of introducing new professors and their research to the wider community. Professor Hewitt’s lecture Marine biosecurity: Understanding marine biological invasions and risk in a changing world is on Tuesday 21 July from 6pm at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts. The Opus Bar open from 5pm.
