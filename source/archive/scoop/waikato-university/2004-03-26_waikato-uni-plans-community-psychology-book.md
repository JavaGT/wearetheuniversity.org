Waikato Uni Plans Community Psychology Book

Staff associated with the Community Psychology programme at the University of Waikato are planning to write a textbook which will update present accounts of Community Psychology and explore local and emerging approaches specific to Aotearoa New Zealand. As staff in the only graduate programme in Community Psychology in Aotearoa New Zealand we wish to produce this book in collaboration with colleagues around the region.

As part of our preparation for this book we are consulting with a broad range of psychologists, public health professionals and people working in allied disciplines as we believe this book could provide an invaluable resource for many practitioners and teachers. We are interested in your feedback about the potential relevance of a Community Psychology book that is grounded in Aotearoa New Zealand knowledges and practice.

If you would like further information about Community Psychology or about the programmes we offer, please click on the link to go to the Community Psychology programme webpage.

We have compiled an online survey to gather feedback about our ideas which will take about 5 minutes to complete. Your participation in this survey would be greatly appreciated. Please click on the link below to complete the survey.

The web address for the survey is: http://psychology.waikato.ac.nz/surveys/Commpsych/survey.htm
