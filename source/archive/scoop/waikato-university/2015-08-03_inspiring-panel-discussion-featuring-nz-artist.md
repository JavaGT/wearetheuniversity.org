==============================================

**Inspiring Panel Discussion to Feature Renowned New Zealand Artists**

An inspiring panel discussion among renowned New Zealand creative experts will take place in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts this month.

The on-stage conversation _'Creative Confluences: Merging art practices and inter-disciplinary collaborations_' will be led by Julianne Pierce, Chair of the Emerging and Experimental Arts Strategy Panel of the Australia Council and Creative Producer of the Adelaide Fringe Festival.

The panel will also consist of renowned New Zealand artists, academics and cultural innovators – Lisa Reihana, Deborah Lawler-Dormer and Jennifer Gillam.

Taking place on Thursday 13 August at 7pm, the event follows on from the launch of Reuben Paterson’s exhibition. It aims to bring together diverse communities and individuals in order to expand their interest in multidisciplinary interactions and cross-disciplinary processes.

“Scientific and social research can be difficult processes to explain. Personal relationships between researchers and artists can highlight the generosity of spirit and emotional journeys that might be hidden behind the word ‘research,’” says event organiser Dr Isabelle Delmotte. Dr Delmotte is a lecturer within the Screen and Media Studies programme at the University of Waikato.

“Creative endeavours are often prompted by anecdotes, community concerns, personal events or people’s sense of place and identity. _‘Creative Confluences_’ will highlight the way ‘small life matters’ generate unexpected innovative collaborations between disciplines and attract different audiences,” she says.

**_'Creative Confluences: Merging art practices and inter-disciplinary collaborations_’ is a free event and open to the general public. It is sponsored by the University of Waikato’s Cultural Committee.**
