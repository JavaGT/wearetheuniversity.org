**Waikato University enrolments as at March 6**

The number of Equivalent Full-Time Students at Waikato University at the start of A Semester is 1.5% up on the same time last year.

By March 5, the university had 7,887 Ministry-funded (ie domestic) EFTS, up 1% on the same time last year.

Full cost international student EFTS are up 6.4% on the same time last year at 746 EFTS. Students from nearly 80 countries are studying at Waikato University; the top five nations are China, Saudi Arabia, India, Japan and USA.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says that as expected, the greatest demand for places is in the university’s three largest faculties - Management, Education and Arts and Social Sciences.

All universities must work to a maximum of 103% of their Ministry-funded EFTS target and Waikato University finished 2011 on 99.6% of its target. This year’s target agreed between the university and the Tertiary Education Commission is 8550 Ministry-funded EFTS.

Final enrolment figures will be available in late March.
