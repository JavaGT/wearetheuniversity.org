Waikato University awards NZ's largest university scholarships scheme

Media Release

23 May 2005

Over 450 first-year students at Waikato University have been awarded Tearaway Waikato University Scholarships this year, each worth $3000.

Totalling over $1 million dollars, the Tearaway Scholarships are the single biggest university scholarship scheme offered in New Zealand. Scholars may use the $3000 towards their course fees or accommodation at the university's halls of residence. The scholarships are offered with generous support of Tearaway Magazine, a national magazine distributed through high schools.

The Tearaway Scholarships are the successor to the University's 40th Anniversary Scholarships for A and B Bursary students. Since the introduction of NCEA Level 3, the University has raised its scholarship criteria. They are now awarded to students who achieve a standard partway between an A and B Bursary. Despite the more stringent award criteria this year, the number of recipients has remained high.

This year's scholars have come from throughout the North Island to study at Waikato University.

\"We are really pleased that these scholarships are proving so popular with high school students", says Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford. "They support our commitment to accessibility, while at the same time rewarding excellence."

First year law student Angela Kellow is one of the scholarship recipients. "The Tearaway Scholarship has been a huge help. It helped pay for my accommodation at Bryant Hall, which has made moving from Whangamata to Hamilton so much easier. It gave my friends and me an extra incentive to study for NCEA exams last year, which has paid off," she says.

The scholarships were marked by a special function hosted by Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford at the university’s Academy of Performing Arts on Monday 4 April. Jenny May Coffin, a former Silver Fern and University of Waikato student, was the guest speaker.

To receive a scholarship students need 60 credits or more at NCEA Level 3 or 4; in no more than four NZQA approved subjects; with at least 14 credits in each subject; and gain University Entrance. Students must also be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident and enrol in a full-time full-year programme at the University of Waikato.

The University intends to offer the Scholarships again to students who do well in NCEA and enrol at Waikato University in 2006. Students sitting non-NCEA qualifications such as Cambridge International Examinations can also apply.
