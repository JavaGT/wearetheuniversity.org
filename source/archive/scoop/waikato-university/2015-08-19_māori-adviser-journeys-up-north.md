**Māori adviser journeys up north**

Senior Future Student Adviser Māori Alonzo Mason will embark on a hikoi this month to promote tertiary study to Māori students. He will be working with recruitment staff from other universities to talk about tertiary study options in Northland secondary schools.

Hikoi translates to journey and Alonzo’s journey sees him visiting up to three schools a day with staff from AUT, Massey University, and the University of Auckland, delivering presentations to school students in a collaborative approach.

From Monday 24 August to Friday 27 August, the group will visit Northland College, Okaihau College, TKKM O Kaikohe, Opononi Area School, Broadwood Area School, Kaitaia College, Abundant Life, Te Rangi Aniwaniwa, Taipa Bay Area School, Whangāroa College, and Kerikeri High School.

Alonzo says working with other universities in recruitment is uncommon but he believes this approach aligns best with Māori culture and practice.

“It’s best to work together when recruiting Māori students because it’s not about which university they choose but rather that they are aware of all their study options,” he says.

Alonzo will be the only male in the team and will speak on behalf of the recruitment group at pōwhiri and other welcoming ceremonies the schools hold.

In September, Alonzo will return to several of the Northland schools to provide one-on-one consultations and help prospective students plan their courses.

“It will be a good opportunity to sit down with the students and help them make decisions about future study,” he says.
