A Celebration of Màori Academic Excellence

The University of Waikato is will again host the National Màori Academic Excellence Awards, to be held on Friday 2nd December at the Kingsgate Hotel, Te Rapa - Hamilton.

The criterion for the award is the conferment of a Doctoral qualification from any New Zealand tertiary institution within the period 31 July 2004 to 31 July 2005. This year, 27 award recipients have been confirmed with representation from Auckland, Canterbury, Massey, Otago, Victoria, and Waikato Universities.

"On the 2nd December, we will be celebrating the recent achievements of twenty seven PhD graduates from across all New Zealand Universities. The recipients of 2005 contribute to the body of knowledge across a diverse range of disciplines, from Màori language and education, to whakapapa and kaitiakitanga, through to sleep apnoea and the chemical aspect of saponin bioactivity," said Prof. Tamati Reedy, University of Waikato Pro-Vice Chancellor (Màori).

"Suffice to say, Màori academics are making hugely significant contributions to the growth and development of our nation."

The Awards evening is supported by major sponsors the Tertiary Education Commission, Waikato Raupatu Lands Trust, NIWA, Te Ohu Kaimoana, Te Puni Kòkiri and Te Taura Whiri i te Reo. It provides an opportunity for the tertiary sector to come together in recognition of the growing profile of Màori academic excellence.

To support the occasion, high profile Mäori musicians and performers will provide the evening's entertainment. The event will be a highlight of the Mäori academic calendar, and with the numbers of Màori enrolling and graduating at PhD level continuing to increase, the trend of recognition and celebration looks set to continue well into the future.
