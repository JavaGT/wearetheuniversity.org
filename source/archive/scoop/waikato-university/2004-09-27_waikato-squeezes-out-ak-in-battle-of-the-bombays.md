Waikato Squeezes Out Auckland In Battle Of The Bombays

The annual Battle of the Bombays sporting clash between Waikato University and Auckland University produced a tight result this year, with Waikato squeezing out Auckland just 7-5 in the overall number of wins.

The contest involved traditional New Zealand sports, but also some newer ones such as lacrosse and inline hockey.

Waikato has tended to dominate the Battle of the Bombays since its formation in 1989 but Auckland put on a very competitive showing this year.

Waikato won the netball, the men's and women's volleyball, mixed touch rugby, rowing, rock climbing and inline hockey, while Auckland took out the soccer, lacrosse, ultimate, and the men's and women's basketball. The men's touch rugby was drawn, while the tennis was rained off.

\"Auckland definitely brought down a stronger team this year," says Amy Corstophine of Waikato University's Campus Services. "It meant there was a much closer result than we've seen in some years. I think we can look forward to another tough contest in 2005."
