**Waikato University cricketers prepare for Vice-Chancellor’s 2012 Cricket Challenge**

The annual University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor’s Cricket Challenge against Northern Districts Māori takes place later this month.

This year the annual match will be a Twenty 20 between an invitational University of Waikato XI and the Northern Districts Māori side, and will be played on the test wicket at Seddon Park on 22 March.

The University of Waikato team, called the VC XI, will include a number of Sir Edmund Hillary scholars and regional cricket representatives.

Waikato University’s High Performance Manager Greg O’Carroll, who helped organise the game with the assistance of Northern Districts Cricket, says the match is a chance to establish the tradition of the VC Cricket Challenge and foster emerging talent at the university and for Northern Districts Māori.

“This event is a really good fixture on the university and Northern Districts social calendar. It gives talented players from both sides an opportunity to shine, in what is a semi-serious exhibition match.

“Last year the VC XI proved to be too good, winning pretty comfortably. The T20 format to be used this year will hopefully mean that the game is likely to be a lot tighter.”

The Waikato team are Hillary Scholars Kier Bettley, Mattie Thomas, Brett Sorrenson, Ben Hyde and Tommy Clout who are joined by fellow students Mike Dodunski, Jake Bezzant, Mitch McCann, Jared MacDonald, Steve Martin and Henry Cooper.

The match also serves as a warm up for Northern Districts Māori, who go on to play a New Zealand Croatian XI as well as a New Zealand Cricket Players’ Association Masters team.

The match begins at 10am on 22 March.
