Waikato University Remains Open To Talks With AUT

Waikato University’s Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould says he remains open to holding further discussions with the Auckland University of Technology (AUT) about a closer relationship.

The two institutions announced earlier this year that they were exploring closer integration. However, AUT’s council has today announced that it has decided not to proceed with discussions at this stage, appoint a new Vice-Chancellor, and then ask her or him to look at whether to renew dialogue with Waikato.

“Waikato continues to believe that there could be very significant potential benefits in a closer relationship with AUT,” says Professor Gould. “Waikato saw a closer link with AUT as being one means of achieving its strategic goals, which include the prospect of a new and more comprehensive form of university provision. It was always up to AUT to decide whether to proceed with the approach they made to us.”

In the meantime, Waikato University:  
\- Remains in discussions with the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic regarding an integrated relationship in Tauranga.  
\- Is awaiting developments regarding a proposal to establish a campus in Taupo.  
\- Is awaiting advice from Manukau City Council regarding the possibility of operating a campus in Manukau.

“Waikato University will continue to actively explore options that will help expand the range of educational services it offers, either alone or in partnership with other providers,” says Professor Gould.
