Business Rescue

Justice Peter Blanchard of the Supreme Court recently gave the Harkness Henry Lecture at the Waikato law School. His theme was ‘Approaches to Business Rehabilitation.’ He reviewed US chapter XI, the UK Enterprise Act and the Australian Voluntary Administration System. Justice Blanchard indicated his support for the Australian system which is to be introduced in a new Insolvency Bill, “New Zealand has waited a long time for such an obvious reform.” Law Dean, Professor John Farrar commented “The success of voluntary administration in New Zealand would depend on the attitude of the Inland Revenue towards the new procedure.”

Harkness Henry and Co, a prominent Hamilton law firm and member of the LAWLINK Group, and the Waikato Law School jointly sponsor this annual public lecture. Past lectures have been delivered by such distinguished speakers as the Rt Hon. Sir Robin Cooke, Dame Silvia Cartwright PCNZM, DBE and Rt Hon Sian Elias.
