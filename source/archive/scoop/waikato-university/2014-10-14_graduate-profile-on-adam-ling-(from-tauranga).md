**Flexibility around study made Waikato a perfect choice**

Juggling study with his sport has been a challenge, but rower Adam Ling says with helpful lecturers and timetable flexibility, he was able to make the most of both his sporting and academic opportunities while at Waikato University.

Adam will graduate at Claudelands Events Centre in Hamilton on 22 October with a Bachelor of Business Analysis, majoring in accounting.

Originally from the UK, Adam has lived in New Zealand since he was five, spending most of that time in Tauranga. He attended secondary school at Aquinas College, and finished his last year at Tauranga Boys’ College. He says he chose to study at Waikato because of its proximity to Lake Karapiro, the centre for elite rowing in New Zealand.

“I’m in the New Zealand rowing team which means I needed to study in the Waikato area. The university was the best option for me, plus I’d visited it many times while at high school and felt at home there.”

He says some of the highlights of his time at Waikato were attending the Gallagher Great Race and Waikato University Rowing Club social events as they “were great fun and a good way to meet new people”.

Adam has received the Prime Minister’s Scholarship for the last two years, a scholarship that paid his fees and gave him a living allowance, and this year he received a Blues Award for rowing. The Blue recognises regional or national excellence in sport or the performing arts, and is one of the university’s strongest traditions, dating back to 1971.

After graduation, Adam plans to continue with rowing and has an eye on selection for the Rio Olympics in 2016.

“This coming up year is all about qualifying for me, so the next two years will be quite full on. But I am also on the look-out for part-time graduate roles so I can start my charted accountancy programme.”
