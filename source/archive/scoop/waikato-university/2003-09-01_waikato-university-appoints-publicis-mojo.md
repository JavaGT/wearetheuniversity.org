Waikato University Appoints Publicis Mojo

Following a four-way competitive pitch, PublicisMojo's holistic approach beat Whybin TBWA to win the contract to promote Waikato University...please see release below for further information.

PublicisMojo Group team leader, Simon Morgan says, "We won the account based on the strength of some great creative work and our ability to approach the brief holistically.

"We responded to the brief with an integrated, creative campaign that we believe will connect with students, and make a huge difference to Waikato University."

Waikato University's Marketing Director, Stephen Knightly, says, "The PublicisMojo Group proved they understand our core target market and the strengths of Waikato. They presented a great creative idea that works across both advertising and direct marketing."

"The campaign will communicate Waikato University's strengths and achievements, but in a way that appeals to high-school leavers. We'll also focus on telling the benefits of living in the Waikato region generally."
