Computer-Human Interaction conference comes to New Zealand

For the first time in the eight-year history of the event, the Asia Pacific Computer-Human Interaction (APCHI) 2004 conference will be held in New Zealand.

Hosted by the Waikato University Computer Science department, APCHI 2004 will run from 29 June to 2 July 2004 in Rotorua and is the sixth biennial gathering of Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) experts in the region.

CHI research focuses on the human side of computing. Researchers and practitioners look at ways to reduce frustration and confusion often associated with technology by making sure interactive systems - ranging from desktop computers to mobile phones and DVD players - support user needs.

Conference Chair and senior computer science lecturer at Waikato University, Dr Matt Jones, says previous APCHI conferences had been held in Singapore, Sydney, Beijing and Japan.

"Major international companies like Nokia, Microsoft and Intel take usability very seriously and New Zealand businesses are also starting to become quite active in this field,” says Dr Jones.

“The APCHI conference will be an excellent opportunity for the world to see Kiwi innovation as well as enabling local organisations to get a wider perspective on the opportunities”.

The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research group at Waikato University will be taking the opportunity to introduce overseas visitors to a bit of Kiwi creativity, with current projects including photo and map browsing tools for handheld computers and mobile phones.

APCHI is considered to be the key usability and interaction design conference in the Asia Pacific region. The four-day conference will focus on emerging new technologies such as handheld devices and wearable computers, as well as looking at designing-in ease of use.

Dr Jones also expects there to be discussion of how human creativity and emotion can be incorporated into computer system development.

Keynote speakers already confirmed include Professor Don Norman and Dr Susan Dray, both from the USA (see attached biographies). Dr Jones expects to confirm more speakers over the coming months.
