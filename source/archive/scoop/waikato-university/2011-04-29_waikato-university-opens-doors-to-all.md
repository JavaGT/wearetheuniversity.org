### Waikato University opens doors to all

More than 3500 secondary school students from Auckland, Northland, Bay of Plenty, Hawkes Bay, Gisborne and Taranaki will be joined by members of the general public when the University of Waikato opens the doors on May 13.

The annual University of Waikato Hamilton campus Open Day is designed to showcase the qualifications, academic excellence, student support, facilities and lifestyle the university offers students and features a range of mini lectures and tours of the laboratories, grounds and halls.

Mini lectures include ‘Working @ Google’, ‘What is Computer Graphic Design’, ‘Can Machines Think?’, ‘Taming of the Shrink’, ‘Making things work: opportunities in Engineering’, ‘Fun with Statistics…Probably’, ‘Wikipedia: The world’s largest Knowledge Base’ and more.

Prospective students will have the opportunity to talk to staff and current students about qualifications, entry requirements and the scholarships available.

The day which runs from 9am to 2pm aims to give prospective students a taste of life at Waikato University.

Nearly 300 students from some Hawkes Bay and Northland schools will stay at the Ngaruawahia Christian Camp the night before and students from Gisborne Boys’ High School will stay on the campus marae.

All members of public are welcome to attend.

For more information call 0800 WAIKATO or go to www.waikato.ac.nz where an Open Day programme is available.
