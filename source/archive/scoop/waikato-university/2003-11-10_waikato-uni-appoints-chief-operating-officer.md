Waikato University appoints Chief Operating Officer

Waikato University has announced the appointment of Geoff Balme as its new Chief Operating Officer.

Mr Balme succeeds Andrew Simpson who left earlier this year to work in Canada.

Geoff Balme has been a partner in the independent Hamilton consulting and accounting firm of Beattie Rickman since 1992 and has been acting Chief Financial Officer for the University for the past few months.

The Chief Operating Officer at Waikato University has management responsibility for Facilities Management, Financial Services, Information Technology Services, Library, Management Information, Procurement and Risk Assurance. The Chief Operating Officer is also the Chief Financial Officer of the university.

Mr Balme will begin in his new position from 19 January 2004.

Announcing the appointment today, Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould said the University is pleased to welcome Geoff as part of the permanent team.

“Geoff has a formidable reputation for his strategic, planning and financial acumen amongst his clients and his work in helping them lift their financial and operational performance. He has the professional and personal skills the University requires in this role to take us into our next stage of development.

“But he is also renowned in this region for his commitment to Hamilton and the Waikato which will play a very important part in the development of our University.

“For example, he prepared the initial business case that secured $2 million from Government for Innovation Park – a concept which the University has strongly supported.”

Professor Gould said that Mr Balme is widely respected for his community interests and involvement and for his participation, both local and national, in sports administration and events. He was Chef de Mission for the New Zealand team at the last two Winter Olympic Games and has been actively involved in local activities such as the 1995 Davis Cup, the New Zealand College Games and the development of the Gallagher Hockey Centre.

“Geoff’s professional knowledge, experience and commitment are ideally suited to the role as the University continues to build its place in the community and the links between us,” Professor Gould said.
