Media Release

Two of the four New Zealand Association for Research in Education (NZARE) awards for excellence presented at its 2003 conference have been taken out by Waikato School of Education staff.

Professor Russell Bishop has been awarded the Te Tohu Tawhiti Award recognising significant contribution to Maori education.

Prof Bishop is widely published and his research experience is in collaborative storying in Maori contexts, including “Te Kotahitanga: the experiences of Year 9 and Year 10 Students in mainstream classrooms” for which he has recently secured a further $1.8M in research funding. Russell Bishop is foundation Professor and Assistant Dean for Maori Education at the Waikato University.

Recipient of the McKenzie Award for significant contribution to educational research over an extended period, Professor Sue Middleton’s research focuses on how educators and policymakers shape educational environments in New Zealand and other countries.

Prof. Middleton’s special interest in women’s lives in education and the educational ideas they have developed is reflected in several current books.

In 2002 the McKenzie Award was presented to School of Education colleague, Professor Ted Glynn.
