Old Rivals To Battle It Out In Mooting Final

Hamilton's Hillcrest High School and Tauranga Girls' College will again contest the final of the increasingly popular Waikato University School of Law secondary schools mooting competition.

The event will be held in the High Court, Bridge St, Hamilton at 6pm on Thursday 3 June.

Mooting pits teams against each other in debates on points of law, similar to those argued in appeal cases in the courts.

Tauranga Girls' won the final last year but a mooter from Hillcrest won the best individual mooter award. Now the old rivals will square off again this year.

Twenty-seven teams contested this year's competition compared to 25 last year.

\"Mooting provides an interesting introduction to the law and gives students an insight into some of the skills required by lawyers. Our competition also gives secondary teachers a way of introducing students to legal issues," says the School of Law's coordinator of competitions Christina ter Haar. "The standard of competition this year has been much higher as schools have more experience after previous years."
