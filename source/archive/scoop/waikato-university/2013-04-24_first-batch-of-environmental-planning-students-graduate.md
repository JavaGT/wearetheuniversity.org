Media Release:

**First Batch Of Waikato Environmental Planning Students Graduate**

After being introduced as a new qualification at the Faculty of Arts and Social Science at Waikato University in 2011, the first group of students have graduated from the Bachelor of Environmental Planning degree.

The graduation ceremony for the Environmental Planning students was held at the Claudelands Arena on Thursday 18 April.

Most of the new graduates have already secured jobs of a range of descriptions; Abbie Fowler had a short time job hunting before landing her position as Resource Officer in the Infrastructure Programme for Waikato Regional Council.

“I sat my last test at university, and then four days later I started at Waikato Regional Council after doing an internship there the previous summer. Basically, my job entails doing compliance monitoring and making recommendations on resource consents predominately for municipal water takes and wastewater discharges.”
