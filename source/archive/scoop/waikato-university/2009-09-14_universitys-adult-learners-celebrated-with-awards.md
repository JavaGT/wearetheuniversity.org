University’s adult learners celebrated with awards

A music composition student, a trainee teacher and a video maker are among this year’s winners of the University of Waikato Vice Chancellor’s Adult Learners Awards.

First offered in 2001, the awards are intended to encourage more adults to access learning opportunities and to celebrate the efforts, achievements and contributions of adult learners.

Jennifer Spark, Jenny McPherson, Pippa Russell and Ruth Smith received awards of $1,000 each at a ceremony last week (Adult Learners Week) hosted by the Director of the University’s Pathways College, Professor Brian Findsen.

Prof Findsen said mature-age students are an asset to tertiary education institutions. “Universities benefit from having older students amongst school leavers because mature students enrich the teaching-learning environment. Typically they bring extensive life experience which astute teachers can link to the curriculum; they have a more developed sense of self and a very strong motivation to achieve.”

All award winners have maintained very high academic standards in their studies, while juggling work and family commitments.

Jennifer Spark has overcome challenging health issues to return to full-time music study, and has this year been awarded a prestigious Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship as well as a scholarship from Arts Waikato.

Mother of three Jenny McPherson is combining teacher training with a degree in English – and holds down a part-time job as a teaching assistant for special needs students, while playing an active role in her community.

A single parent with four children, Pippa Russell is studying full-time for a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in both Screen & Media and Religious Studies, as well as juggling part-time work for GreenUp. She also finds time to volunteer in the local arts community, and has had her video work publicly exhibited.

Ruth Smith (Ngati Kahungunu) left school after failing to get good enough grades to go on to university. This year, she’s achieved A grades in two Masters level papers as part of a Postgraduate Diploma, majoring in Strategic Management. A single mother of two, Ruth also works part-time as a mentor to Maori students, and is currently undertaking research on role of support among Maori students.

The University of Waikato has more than 4,880 adult learners, defined as students over the age of 25, who make up 38% of the student body.
