Enrolments Up At Waikato As New System Works Well

Overall enrolments at Waikato University are 988 or 11% better than the same time last year, according to interim figures. Domestic student enrolments are 245 or 3% more, while international enrolments are 743 or 47% ahead.

The figures for 1 March 2004 compared with 3 March 2003 reflect a much more efficient enrolment system that has processed student study applications far faster.

The latest statistics also reflect the early confirmed retention of a large group of international students who started studies in B semester last year, as well as international students from the Language Institute and Foundation Studies moving into degree programmes.

“An extremely pleasing feature of our enrolments this year has been the efficiency of our new SAS-e enrolment system using a Jade platform,” says Dr Wendy Craig, director of student and academic services. “Combined with a great effort from enrolment staff, it means we’ve been able to offer students a much more user-friendly application processing service. >From a systems perspective, this enrolment period has been the most efficient ever.

“Nearly 700 students were enrolled each day last week, completing a variety of processes including selecting papers, getting enrolment agreements, paying fees and getting their student ID cards.

“While many students enrolled by mail and our website, those who did come to enrol in person, both new and returning students, commented on the easy, friendly process.”

Wendy Craig says another very pleasing aspect of the figures to date has been the extra number of A&B Bursary students enrolling at Waikato this year. Already there is a 10% increase in the number of students who attained an A or B Bursary in 2003.

“All eligible students will receive one of the Mercury Energy – Waikato University 40th Anniversary Scholarships worth $3000 for an A bursary and $2000 for a B Bursary. It’s good to know our one-off initiative to celebrate our anniversary will benefit a wide number of students this year,” says Wendy Craig.
