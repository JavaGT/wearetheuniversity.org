Packed Memorial Occasion For Sir Don Llewellyn

PACKED MEMORIAL OCCASION FOR SIR DON LLEWELLYN

Hundreds of people packed out a memorial occasion for the University of Waikato's founding Vice-Chancellor Sir Don Llewellyn today.

Sir Don, who was also instrumental in the establishment of NZ Fieldays, died just over a fortnight ago.

Friends, family and colleagues paid tribute to "a great man".

Waikato's current Vice-Chancellor Professor Bryan Gould said: "Don was a creator. He was an inspirer. And he remained a living force in the life of this university to the end of his days."

He noted that the last he saw of Sir Don was when he drove off in his car with the licence plate VCONE. "That is how Don saw himself and that's how we will remember him."

His friend and former colleague Emeritus Professor John McCraw said Sir Don had always been determined that Waikato University would be "no ivory tower".

Prof McCraw said Sir Don was "scrupulously honest but not above a little deviousness, especially when dealing with officials" and "a dignified English gentleman who we shall miss greatly".

A moving aspect of the occasion was the participation of his grandchildren, who all read poems and played music in tribute to Sir Don.
