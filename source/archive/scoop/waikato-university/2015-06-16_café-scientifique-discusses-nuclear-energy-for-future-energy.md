**Café Scientifique discusses nuclear energy for future energy requirements**

Nuclear engineer Dr Hanno van der Merwe will lead a discussion about New Zealand’s nuclear energy needs for future energy requirements at the next Café Scientifique in Tauranga. The presentation discusses the basic principles behind nuclear power generation, its operational and safety issues and what options exist today. Dr Van de Merwe will also talk about how employing nuclear energy requires a huge commitment by the public and their government to all aspects of the nuclear energy cycle.

Dr Van der Merwe works for Ballance Agri-Nutrients in Mount Maunganui and is responsible for developing new industrial and agricultural chemical products. He is a former nuclear scientist and holds a PhD in physics and degrees in chemistry and engineering.
