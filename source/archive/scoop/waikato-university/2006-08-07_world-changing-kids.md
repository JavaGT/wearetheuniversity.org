World changing kids

“We need to nurture those who will change the world,” Waikato University School of Education Associate Professor Roger Moltzen says.

Speaking at the conclusion of a three-day conference about education for gifted and talented children, Dr Moltzen said research showed it was important to support and challenge gifted children - “those who have the ability to change the world, not just run it, those who will be innovators”.

“We need to allow our gifted and talented students to be ‘obsessives’. Let’s stop trying to make them ‘well rounded’ people.”

Dr Moltzen said he firmly believed New Zealand had the best teachers in the world, but it was important not to be complacent.

It was also important to be aware that a significant number of high achieving adults showed no indication of their talents as young children, he said.

“We must be open minded because children can show special talents as they develop. Research also shows that the highly intelligent with the greatest persistence will achieve more than those with the highest intelligence but with less persistence.”

The Ministry of Education sponsored “National Gifted and Talented Conference” was held in Wellington, Thursday 3 August to Saturday 5 August. It attracted a large audience of more than 700 people from around New Zealand, including teachers, parents, researchers, academics, counsellors and psychologists.
