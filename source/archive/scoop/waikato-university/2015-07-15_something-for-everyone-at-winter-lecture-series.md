Something for everyone at Winter Lecture Series

**Something for everyone at Winter Lecture Series**

From discussing the quality of our water to things we never knew about the Tron – there’s something for everyone at this year’s Winter Lecture Series.

**An annual event**  
The University of Waikato Winter Lecture Series is held every Wednesday evening in August and is designed to bring together experts and advocates from around the community to spark discussion and debate. Each lecture is free and open to the public.

**Familiar faces on board**  
This year’s series opens with TV presenter and friend of the university, Te Radar, who presents a series of interesting facts in “Things You Never Knew About the Waikato,” on August 5. Watch Radar’s video here.

The University of Waikato’s professor of environmental planning Iain White hosts a panel debate on August 12, with two opposing sides discussing water quality and whether we need to be worrying about our water in the future. The panel features Green MP Catherine Delahunty, Māori and indigenous legal issues expert Associate Professor Linda Te Aho and economist Dr Dan Marsh versus agricultural commentator Professor Jacqueline Rowarth and representatives from the farming industry. The debate will explore both sides of the argument and the audience will pick a winner at the end.

Comedian and columnist Raybon Kan leads a panel of researchers and experts, including diversity acceptance advocate Anjum Rahman, indigenous population expert Dr Tahu Kukutai and Māori issues expert Dr Leonie Pihama who ask “Is New Zealand Really a Multicultural Society” on August 19.

The series finishes on a light-hearted note on August 26 with comedian Jan Maree who will discuss the merits of living in The Tron with a panel of proud Hamiltonians in “An Ode To Hamilton”. The panel includes heavy metal musician Paul “The Axeman” Martin, The Hamilton Mafia Project, spaces and places researcher Professor Robyn Longhurst, and several people who have made Hamilton their home after living abroad.

**Connecting with the community**  
The University of Waikato’s Professor Neil Quigley says he’s looking forward to attending his first winter lecture series as Vice-Chancellor.

“Connecting with our community is at the heart of what we do. Sharing our knowledge, research and expertise helps break down the barrier that is sometimes seen to exist between universities and the general public, and I see the Winter Lecture Series as something that helps us do that – and do it well.”

**Free and open to the public**  
This year’s series takes place at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts and the Hamilton City Council Civic Reception Lounge. For more information, visit the Winter Lecture Series website.
