Postgraduate Engineering And Technology Conference
==================================================

**Wednesday, 29 August 2001, 12:40 am**  
**Press Release: [Waikato University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Waikato_University)**

Postgraduate Engineering and Technology students gather in Hamilton tomorrow for the 8th New Zealand Engineering and Technology Postgraduate Conference.

The gathering gives young scientists the chance to present their research findings to other students and to experienced academic scientists.

A series of 20-minute sessions will see the presentation of a diverse range of topics in materials and process engineering, technology management and innovation, environment and energy, electronics control and computing, and bioproducts processing.

Topics include an “investigation of night-time heat loss from residential fenestration” – that’s heat-loss through windows to the uninitiated - the optimisation of baffle use in waste stabilisation ponds, and the effect of growth conditions on the production of kawakawa essential oil.

A web site giving conference details and links to abstracts is on-line at http://mape.waikato.ac.nz/nzetc2001/conferenceschedule.html

The conference will occur over two days, on 30-31 August.
