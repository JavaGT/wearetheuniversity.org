**Corporate bullying in East Asia in three minutes**  
  
A PhD student studying corporate bullying and governance issues in East Asian businesses has won this year’s University of Waikato Thesis in Three competition.

Azilawati Banchit, who’s from Malaysia and studying at Waikato Management School, beat nine other finalists in the event held at Hamilton’s Clarence Street Theatre on October 27. She is studying mergers and acquisitions in the region over a decade and the impact it has on people and business.

The doctoral students each had three minutes to outline their theses before judges and a full theatre, and their presentations were judged on their ability to effectively communicate their research to a general audience using a single slide.

Azilawati Banchit won $5000 in research funds for her first placing. Second placing and winner of the people’s choice award was Computer Science student Michael Walmsley who is developing an interactive computer program that helps people learn a foreign language. He used Te Reo Maori as his example to outline the three stages of his learning program and won a total of $3000 to put towards his research.

Other topics included sports and ethics, banking and small business, translating sacred texts from and into Te Reo Maori, science education, loss of language, sport and ethics, dog training, predicting seizures, and the role of justice in democracy.
