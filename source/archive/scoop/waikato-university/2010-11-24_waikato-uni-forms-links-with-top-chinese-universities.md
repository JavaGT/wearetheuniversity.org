Waikato Uni Forms links with top Chinese universities
=====================================================

**Waikato Uni students to benefit from links with top Chinese universities**  

Students at the University of Waikato now have the opportunity to study at two of China’s leading universities, thanks to new agreements signed during a recent visit to China by Waikato’s Chancellor Rt Hon Jim Bolger and Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford.

Renmin University in Beijing is one of China’s top 10 universities; Shanghai-based Tongji University regularly ranks within the top 25. Both are among the 39 leading Chinese universities officially designated as recipients of additional government funding aimed at creating world-class universities for research.

Professor Crawford says the new partnership agreements are a clear indication of Waikato University’s growing international profile.

“We aim to forge partnerships with a small number of top international universities,” he says. “Renmin and Tongji universities are both excellent international institutions that choose their partners carefully.”

“These new links offer us exciting opportunities for collaborative research, and will give New Zealand students that come to Waikato direct opportunities to establish relationships with future leaders in China, and around the world.”

Waikato undergraduate students will have the opportunity to spend a semester or year at the two institutions where courses are taught in English, and students at Renmin are able to study at Waikato under the Study Abroad or Student Exchange programmes.

Preliminary discussions are also underway to allow students to complete a qualification where the degree certificate may be awarded by each institution – a dual degree.

Waikato’s Pro Vice-Chancellor International, Associate Professor Ed Weymes, says the signing of the two agreements is a clear signal that the University of Waikato is a world-class university. “Universities ranked in the top 20 of Chinese universities are selective in identifying international partners, picking only those with solid international relations.

“These are sought-after agreements,” Dr Weymes says.

Waikato University’s new agreement with Renmin University will see a strengthening of links in management studies. Renmin recently hosted the Waikato MBA international visit, and has appointed Dr Weymes as a visiting professor.

“The new agreement builds on a relationship with Waikato Management School that has been developing over the past two years,” said Dr Weymes, who has more than 30 years experience in the Chinese student market.

“While China remains New Zealand’s third largest market, it is also the fastest growing export market for New Zealand, so it is imperative that our graduates have an understanding of the country and its customs. In today’s global market, students who can demonstrate international experience will have a significant advantage in the employment market.”

The new link with Tongji University will initially focus on law. Again the agreement provides for collaboration between staff at the two universities and encourages students to consider studying at the other institution. The two universities may look at a formal Student Exchange programme in the future.

Meanwhile Waikato and Tongji are looking to explore the potential for a joint degree at Masters level in environmental law.

Originally a medical and engineering school, Tongji hosts the Institute of Environment for Sustainable Development in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme. Like Waikato, the Institute has a strong research focus on water quality and both universities anticipate the development of collaborative research partnerships
