Honorary Doctorate For Ngàti Porou Leader
=========================================

Honorary Doctorate for Ngàti Porou leader

Ngàti Porou leader Apirana Mahuika is to receive an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Waikato, as part of the university's 40th Anniversary celebrations. The Doctorate will be conferred at 10.30am on Saturday 31 July at the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts at the University of Waikato.

The Honorary Doctorate recognises Apirana Mahuika's contribution to positive race relations in Aotearoa, knowledge of tikanga and his leadership of Ngàti Porou and Màoridom in general.

Apirana has been instrumental in developing links between the East Coast region and tertiary education, particularly with the University of Waikato. In 1987 he became a Research Fellow at the Centre for Màori Studies and Research with the late Sir Robert Mahuta. He holds a Masters of Arts degree from the University of Sydney and has also taught at Victoria and Massey Universities.

He was a founding member and now Chairperson of Te Ròpþ Manukura, which represents the 16 Iwi working with Waikato University to promote higher education throughout the central North Island.

Apirana has been Chairperson of Te Rþnanga o Ngàti Porou since its founding in 1987. He also chairs the Wànanga o Ngàti Porou which has recently joined the University of Waikato in a formal arrangement for adult education in the Ngàti Porou region.

The New Zealand Police recognised his work in race relations and in prisons by naming a training wing at the Porirua Police College after him.

Apirana's oratory skills in both Màori and English are widely acknowledged. These were tempered by his preparation as an Anglican priest, a role he combines more ecumenically today with his widespread duties as an Iwi leader.
