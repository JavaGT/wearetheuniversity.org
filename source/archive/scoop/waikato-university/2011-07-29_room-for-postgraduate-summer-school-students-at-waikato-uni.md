**Room for postgraduate, Summer School students at Waikato University**  

Waikato University says it still has room for research postgraduate students and people wanting to enrol for Summer School at the end of the year.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says a variety of papers are being offered during T Semester in November and December - the first of two Summer Schools the university runs. Papers available include Accounting 101, Macroeconomics and the Global Economy, Te Reo Maori – pre advanced, and Immigration and Refugee Law.

At the end of July, the number of Equivalent Full-Time Students (EFTS) at Waikato University is up on the same time last year. The university has 8,647 Ministry-funded (ie domestic) EFTS, up 1.7% on the same time last year. B Semester has already started but enrolments from research postgraduate students and for T Semester are still being taken from undergraduate and graduate students.

Professor Crawford says the university has achieved 99% of its target at this stage. The university and the Tertiary Education Commission agreed last year that the university’s Ministry-Funded EFTS target for 2011 would be 8694 EFTS (303 EFTS higher than its funded 2010 target).

All universities must work to a maximum of 103% of their Ministry-funded EFTS target and Waikato University finished 2010 on 102% of its target. The university estimates it will end 2011 on 100-101% of its target. A year ago, the University of Waikato was forced to decline undergraduate applications for the rest of the 2010 academic year in order to stay within the agreed target of domestic student numbers.

Professor Crawford says the comprehensive approach to managing enrolment has ensured the university still has room for enrolments.

Meanwhile, the University continues to work to support students affected by the Christchurch earthquake. By the end of July it had enrolled 53 students who had initially planned to study at Canterbury University this year and had two more students on an exchange programme from Canterbury University.
