**Kīngitanga Day Details Announced**

Prominent Māori academics, lawyers, historians and esteemed kaumātua will discussion the place of the Treaty of Waitangi in a constitution for Aotearoa during Kīngitanga Day at the University of Waikato.

On Wednesday 16 May the university will celebrate Kīngitanga Day – an annual celebration of the university’s distinctive heritage, history and relationships.

The university’s Te Kotahi Research Institute will host prominent guest speakers including Sir Tipene O’Regan, Dame Claudia Orange, Dr Huirangi Waikerepuru, Moana Jackson and Linda Te Aho for a symposium discussing the status and place of the Treaty of Waitangi in a constitution for Aotearoa, being held at 1.10pm.

Throughout the day presentations and seminars take place at the university’s many faculties with topics ranging from an overview of growing up in the Kīngitanga movement, to a traditional Māori instrument showcase, a look at Māori science and an exhibit of Māori visual culture and art, among many others.

The University of Waikato has had strong connections with the Kīngitanga and Tainui since the university was founded in 1964 and it is this distinctive relationship that the university honors each year through Kīngitanga Day.

The day starts at 9am and all activities are free and open to the public.
