STUDENTS TO BATTLE IT OUT OVER BUSINESS

Some of the best budding business brains in the country go head-to-head this Saturday 10 July as the Waikato Management School hosts the second annual New Zealand Business Case Competition at Waikato University in Hamilton.

Teams of four students from Waikato Management School and Auckland, AUT, Massey, Otago and Victoria universities will all be given a 'mystery' business case to deal with on Saturday morning.

Each team has only six hours to read and analyse the case, and then prepare a presentation for judging by an expert panel of businesspeople and academics. Presentations start at 4pm in building PWC at the Waikato Management School.

\"The competition gives students hands on experience at dealing with real life business issues," says Waikato Management School lecturer Stephen Bowden. "Waikato is working in partnership with Otago University to develop this competition, given the value it adds to students who will help make up the next generation of New Zealand's business leaders. The contest is based in large part on our school's own internal case competition."

The Waikato team consists of Jessica Cameron, Katie Olsen, Jeremy Pak and Jonathon Peart. They've been training hard, with numerous practice sessions under competition conditions.

Sponsors include Telecom, Meridian Energy and Gallagher Group. The winning team gets $2000 and mobile phones.

The judges include:

\* Kelly Moore, general manager consumer and small business services, Telecom New Zealand

\* Alan Seay, principal, communications and external relations, Meridian Energy

\* Daniel Oh, regional business analyst for Accor NZ & Fiji

\* Dr Paul Knott, department of management, University of Canterbury

\* Professor Armand Gilinsky, Sonoma State University, USA
