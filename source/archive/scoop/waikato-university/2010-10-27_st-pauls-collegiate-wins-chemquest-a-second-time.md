**St Paul’s Collegiate wins ChemQuest second year running**  

  
St Paul’s Collegiate School has taken out the top prize for the second year running at the Waikato University ChemQuest. The school also won second place.

First place went to Andrew McPherson, Evan Wilson and Chang Zhai from the St Paul’s team called ‘Team’. The students were awarded the James and Wells trophy, $150 and a gold medal each.

The annual chemistry quiz gives Year 12 chemistry students the chance to put their chemistry knowledge to the test in a pop quiz-style challenge. The after-school event was held at the University of Waikato on October 20 and was attended by almost 200 students, made up of 66 teams of three.

St Paul’s Collegiate School also won second place in the contest. The team ‘Corrosive Carnage’ consisting of Lucien Nabbs, Mikey Hodge and James Kennedy, won $90 for their team and a silver medal each.

Third place was awarded to Hamilton Boys’ High School team ‘The Pros’: Bill Xu, Axton Pitt and Harry Yoon.

"I think ChemQuest is one of the highlights of the year - for both the organisers and the participants - and it's great to see students travelling from all over the region to participate," says event organiser Professor Bill Henderson.

ChemQuest is sponsored by the University of Waikato’s Faculty of Science and Engineering, James & Wells Intellectual Property and Hill Laboratories.
