Professor of Maori Sustainable Enterprise

Waikato University’s outgoing Pro Vice-Chancellor Maori, Tamati Reedy has been appointed Professor of Maori Sustainable Enterprise at Waikato Management School.

It’s a new appointment and part of Professor Reedy’s job will be developing programmes and research that will lead to more Maori successfully setting up in business.

“It’s a five year plan at this stage,” says Management School dean Professor Mike Pratt. “We’ve had experience already of indigenising programmes to meet student need and this can be further developed in our graduate and undergraduate qualifications. At the same time we have a research agenda, and the third stage we envisage is the setting of up innovation parks or incubators for sustainable Maori business.”

Tamati Reedy is looking forward to the challenge, which he’s taken up instead of retirement. “We have to invest more in our human capital. It’s a great opportunity to build a solid foundation for Maori business development,” he says.
