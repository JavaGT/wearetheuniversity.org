New manager of WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts has strong academic and community background in Waikato

The new manager of the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts at Waikato University, Jeremy Bell, has a strong background in developing drama studies at the university and in community theatre in Hamilton.

Jeremy has been on staff at Waikato for 13 years after time as a professional theatre director in London, including stints at the Young Vic and the Royal Shakespeare Company.

He was the university’s first lecturer in drama studies who had a practical background in professional theatre and he helped develop Waikato’s drama teaching programme.

At the same time, he has been actively involved in directing theatre at Hamilton’s Compact Theatre.

From the mid-1990s, he was also involved in developing the concept of the Performing Arts Academy as a top-class facility for the arts in Hamilton.

“Hamilton’s really lucky to have this great venue and I want to see the Academy filled with arts activities and events 24 hours a day if possible,” says Jeremy.
