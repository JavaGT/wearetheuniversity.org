**Waikato Management School initiates Executive in Residence role**  
  
**Former Hamilton International Airport CEO Chris Doak has been appointed to the position of Executive In Residence at the University of Waikato Management School.**  
  
Management School Dean Professor Frank Scrimgeour says that the University identified an opportunity to engage more with the business sector in areas of growing importance for the region, and this has created the impetus for the Executive in Residence role.

“The Executive in Residence by name and by nature has a goal of facilitating greater engagement with the business sector, and in particular seeks to provide resource for the development of a strategy in Supply Chain Management, Transportation, and Logistics,” said Professor Scrimgeour.

“Given the importance of the greater Waikato region’s freight flows, the significance of proposed inland freight and logistics hubs, and Government target to double export income by 2025, the commencement of a strategy around the further development of a Supply Chain Management, Transportation, and Logistics service centre of excellence made long term sense for a growing sector, the region, and the University,” he said.

Mr Doak says that it was exciting to be offered such a role within the University and hoped his experience in the business sector would help open doors when partnerships for the Centre of Excellence were on the table.

A number of internal and external reviews have already identified potential structures for a Service Centre of Excellence that are inclusive to industry involvement and other learning facilities both in New Zealand and overseas.

Mr Doak suggested that collaboration between the University, other learning facilities, and industry could provide the potential for greater efficiencies for funding research and applied learning outcomes on real industry projects of importance.

“The development of a Supply Chain and Logistics initiative for the University and for business could lead to a significant service centre and applied learning facility driven by interdisciplinary teams addressing real-industry problems,” he said.

As part of the role, Mr Doak, who spent seven years at the airport, will be lecturing stage two students in Supply Chain Management and Logistics, and assisting with research outcomes associated with the Institute of Business Research, headed by Associate Professor Stuart Locke.

Before becoming Airport CEO Chris spent nine years working at WEL Energy Group (now WEL Networks) the last four years as general manager growth and development and has previous experience in manufacturing, energy, telecommunications, property, tourism, and airport sectors.

The appointment is for a six month contract period in which time Mr Doak plans to make significant progress on outcomes.
