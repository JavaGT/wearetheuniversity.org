Biology students to swarm Waikato campus for WEB Days

A swarm of some 650 7th form biology students is set to visit Waikato University's campus next Tuesday 8 June and Wednesday 9 June.

Students from Hamilton and as far afield as Tauranga, Te Puke, Te Kauwhata and Taupo will be taking part in the university's two WEB (Waikato Experience of Biology) Days.

They'll have a chance to do activities such as carrying out DNA extraction, studying the skulls of human ancestors and attending lectures on genetics and biotechnology.

The WEB Days were set up in response to requests from teachers keen to give students access to the information and resources available at the university.

"We are really keen to work with schools in this way," says biological sciences lecturer Alison Campbell. "It gives students a great chance to look at the facilities and teaching available at Waikato."
