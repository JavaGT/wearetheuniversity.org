**Fun run and walk series returns to campus**

Runners and walkers can look forward to the return of the Campus 5km Fun Run and Walk which kicks off 6 October and runs till 15 December.

Earlier in the year, the University partnered with local running club Hamilton City Hawks to host the event which saw more than 300 participants take part.

Andrew Wark, President of the Hamilton City Hawks Running Club, says he was impressed with the turnout from the event earlier in the year, and looks forward to the start of the next series.

“We had a great turnout when we launched the series in February, and considering it was the first time we held something like this on campus, it gave us a promising outlook on further campus runs,” he says.

This time, the University and the Hawks are teaming up with UniRec, the University’s on campus gym, to collaboratively run the event.

Tina Pentecost, Centre Manager for UniRec, says the event is a good fit for business.

“The campus run aligns well with the initiatives we have, including staff and student wellness, and bringing people onto campus. It’s also a great lead in to other events coming up, particularly Round the Bridges.

“We’re looking forward to being a part of this event, and we look forward to seeing more participants coming into the fold,” she says.

Starting Monday 6 October and running through to 15 December, the 5km course will take place on and around the University’s campus, starting and finishing on the Village Green.

Hamilton runners and walkers will be familiar with other Hawks runs. During daylight saving the club organises the Eastside Tavern 5k along the Waikato River on Tuesdays and the Smith and McKenzie run in Chartwell on Wednesdays.

Registration for each event is from 5.00pm each Monday, 6 October to 15 December, with a race start time of 6.00pm for runners, and walkers starting between 5pm and 6pm. A $6 entry fee gains entrance to the event and a glass of beer, cider or a non-alcoholic drink at Momento Lakes at the end. Spot prizes are awarded each evening. All age groups are welcome.

The Campus 5km Fun Run and Walk is in association with the Hamilton City Hawks running club, UniRec, Momento Café and Good George.
