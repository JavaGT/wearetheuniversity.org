Media Release

Online learning Mâori language trial

Waikato University is to trial a Mâori language version of its ClassForum online learning software, which supports students doing degrees online.

The pilot scheme during semester A will see the new Mâori version tested by students enrolled in the postgraduate diploma in interpreting and translating Mâori.

Significant portions of ClassForum have been translated into Mâori for the pilot, says computer sciences lecturer Te Taka Keegan, who was part of the team that developed the Mâori version.

“The trail will give us an opportunity to assess the long-term benefits of people being able to use Mâori in an e-learning environment. It’s another step forward in making e-learning even more accessible for Mâori students and staff.”
