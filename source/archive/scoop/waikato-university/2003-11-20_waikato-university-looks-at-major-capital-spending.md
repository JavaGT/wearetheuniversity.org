Waikato University Looks At Major Capital Spending

Waikato University plans to invest nearly $70 million over the next five years on improvements to its Hamilton campus, including up to $57 million on new facilities, a $2.5 million revamp of the way the campus looks and works, and $7.1 million on upgrading existing facilities and other ongoing work.

“As we approach our 40th year, Waikato University can look forward to the future with confidence,” says Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould.

“We have taken our place in the forefront of New Zealand universities and we enjoy an excellent reputation around the world.

Our plans for further development will allow us to build on these achievements.

“Our capital programme will ensure that Waikato University continues to provide modern, first-class facilities that will meet the needs of our domestic and international students, as well as provide an attractive place for staff to work,” Professor Gould says.

“The goal is to create an even more user-friendly and vibrant campus, and to help the University better serve students, staff and the Hamilton community.”

Some of the bigger projects include proposals to: Spend up to $15 million for additional space for Waikato Management School facilities and other users.

Spend up to $13 million for a new building housing a number of schools and other university activities. Use $10 million for a new Information Commons, to provide centralised study and computer services to students. Also, $2.5 million is already committed for next year for new engineering accommodation.

Meanwhile, the University is also currently assessing a variety of recommendations from urban design consultants to enable the campus and its facilities to work even better for students, staff and the community. Up to $2.5 million is budgeted for this work over the next five years.

“The proposals include making it easier for people to find their way around, improving pedestrian routes and creating a significant new social gathering area near the Library,” says Professor Gould.

“A larger marae area, more eating facilities and improved bus services to and from campus are also being considered.

“We are working hard to ensure that the University’s financial performance over the next few years enables us to undertake these exciting projects and to invest in what promises to be a dynamic future for the University.”
