Former Prime Minister elected Chancellor of Waikato University

The University of Waikato Council has elected the Right Hon. Jim Bolger, ONZ, as Chancellor.

Mr Bolger, who was Prime Minister of New Zealand from October 1990 to December 1997, has been appointed for an initial term of one year.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford said the appointment of Jim Bolger as Chancellor was a historic moment for the University of Waikato.

‘By taking up this role, Jim brings new national and international dimensions to the university at a time when universities must benchmark themselves against the best in the world so we can serve New Zealand effectively,’; Professor Crawford said.

‘His leadership qualities and international standing will make him an excellent ambassador for the university.’

Professor Crawford took the opportunity also to thank the outgoing Chancellor, Mr John Jackman, for his significant contribution to the University since his election in 2005.

‘Mr Jackman has been active in securing Mr Bolger as the new Chancellor. He has done an outstanding job for Waikato and on behalf of the University and Council members I would like to extend a warm vote of thanks,’ he said.

Mr Jackman who has served on the University Council for more than six years, as one of four Ministerial appointees, joined the Vice-Chancellor in welcoming Mr Bolger’s election.

‘We have been talking to Mr Bolger for some time about taking a leadership role at the University and I am delighted that he has accepted the Chancellorship. I am looking forward to working with him during the transition period.’
