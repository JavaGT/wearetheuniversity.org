ATTORNEY-GENERAL TO PARTICIPATE IN SEMINARS ON RESOURCE OWNERSHIP AND ELECTRICITY

Attorney-General and Treaty Negotiations Minister Margaret Wilson is to participate in a series of high-level Waikato University School of Law seminars on resource ownership and access, and the electricity sector.

Former Finance Minister David Caygill, the current chair of the electricity sector’s Grid Security Committee, is another participant in the seminars, which will feature a national and international line-up of experts in Hamilton, Auckland and Wellington.

“The seminars will be addressing issues concerning matters of key national importance,” says the School of Law’s dean Scott Davidson. “We hope the seminars will provide an important forum for exchanging and developing ideas for the future.”

The first seminar in Hamilton on 2 October at the Novotel Tainui beginning at 4.30pm will first discuss the future of the electricity sector and then look at Maori claims to petroleum resources.

Issues to be covered include international trends in terms of resource claims and indigenous ownership issues, as well as how future electricity sector developments should be controlled and managed.

Speakers and panel members in Hamilton include Margaret Wilson, David Caygill, chief legal advisor for the Ministry of Economic Development Roger Palairet, Victoria University law lecturer Andrew Erueti, Waikato University law professor Barry Barton and Waikato University lecturer Craig Coxhead.
