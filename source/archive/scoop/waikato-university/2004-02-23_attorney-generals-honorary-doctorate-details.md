Attorney-General’s honorary doctorate details

Parliament’s Legislative Council Chamber will be the venue for the ceremony conferring a Waikato University honorary doctorate on the Attorney-General Margaret Wilson on Tuesday 2 March at 6pm.

Margaret Wilson was the founding dean of the university’s School of Law and the awarding of the honorary doctorate will be a highlight of Waikato’s 40th anniversary celebrations.

The award recognizes Margaret Wilson’s outstanding contribution to the teaching of law and the development of a uniquely New Zealand jurisprudence.

The award was announced last month by Waikato University’s Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould who said that Margaret Wilson had been consistently active in the community, working especially for the furtherance of social justice.

“In short, Margaret Wilson exemplifies the type of major contribution Waikato University, through its alumni, students, staff and ex-staff, makes to the Waikato region and New Zealand,” Professor Gould said.

A university dinner on Friday 12 March at 6pm in the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts will give the university community in Hamilton an opportunity to celebrate the doctorate with Margaret Wilson.

At the dinner, she will deliver the annual Vice-Chancellor’s Lecture, giving ‘some observations on the evolution of New Zealand’s constitution’.

Seating for the lecture is limited and tickets are required. Contact Janice Lapwood 07 838 4446 or email: foundation@waikato.ac.nz.
