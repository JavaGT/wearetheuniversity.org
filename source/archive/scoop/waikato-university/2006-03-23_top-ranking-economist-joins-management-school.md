MEDIA RELEASE

Top-ranking economist joins Waikato Management School  
23 March 2006

Dr John Gibson has been appointed professor of economics at the University of Waikato Management School. He returns to the School after a year at the University of Canterbury.

A prolific researcher in microeconomics, Dr Gibson is the highest-ranked New Zealand economist in a league table of 30 star performers in the field from Australian and New Zealand universities. He was placed 2nd in the Macquarie University rankings for research contributions between 1996 and 2002.

Dr Gibson has carried out extensive research on household savings for retirement, and is a co-author (with Grant Scobie and Trinh Le) of a new book Household Wealth in New Zealand, written for the Institute of Policy Studies. The book reports evidence critical of arguments that New Zealand households are not saving adequately for retirement.

Dr Gibson is also currently a Senior Research Associate at the Motu Economic and Public Policy Research Trust. His other research interests include poverty measurement, where he is a member of an expert group advising the United Nations Statistical Division, the design and analysis of household survey data, and economic development, especially in China and other Asian and Pacific economies.

He is currently working on two research projects funded by the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund – a two-year project assessing the accuracy of surveys that rely on long-term recall by their participants and a four-year project looking at the health and wealth effects of migration.
