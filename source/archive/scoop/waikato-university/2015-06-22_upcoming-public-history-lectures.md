**Upcoming Public History Lectures**

Our History Programme and Historical Research Unit, in conjunction with the Waikato Museum, are proud to present a series of free public History lectures featuring guest speakers from New Zealand and overseas. Topics covered will include New Zealand environmental history, art history, animals and culture and the formation of transpacific indigenous networks.

The first lecture features **Dr Jemma Field** who has taught at the universities of Auckland and Sydney. Dr Field will deliver a talk titled ‘_Art, History and Culture: The Changing Visual Persona of Anna of Denmark, 1603-1619_’ on Thursday, June 25. The second will be delivered by the prestigious US scholar, **Harriet Ritvo**, who is Arthur J. Conner Professor of History at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her talk, titled _'Wanting the Wild: People, Animals and Culture in the Long 19th Century_' is on Thursday, July 2.  
Both lectures run from 5.30pm in the Museum Lecture Theatre (Waikato Museum, 1 Grantham Street, Hamilton). They are free and open to the public.
