Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme looks for local talent

The call is out for New Zealand’s up-and-coming sports and arts stars to apply for the 2006 Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme at the University of Waikato.

Successful applicants will be in good company, joining the likes of Silver Fern Laura Langman, World Champion rower Juliette Haigh, and composer Jeremy Mayall, who’s Symphony No.1 was recently selected to be played by the NZ Symphony Orchestra. They will join an elite group of students who receive a full fees scholarship for their study, personalised academic support, high performance coaching and personal development opportunities.

Programme Manager, Nicola Clayden, said the scholarship programme aims to enable professional growth in each student’s specialist area, as well as continuing all-round development in a supportive environment. “This is a unique programme that emphasises achievement and balanced development in some of New Zealand’s most talented all-rounders.”

“The Hillary Programme is an investment in our future leaders, giving them the skills they need to excel and helping to create networks that will further develop their future careers,” said Clayden.

Such networks already include partnerships between the Hillary Programme and over 20 sporting and arts organisations, including Rowing NZ, Arts Waikato, Waikato Rugby Union and Netball Waikato, among many others, as well as close relationships with businesses and local Government.
