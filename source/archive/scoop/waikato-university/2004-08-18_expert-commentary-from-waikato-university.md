Expert Commentary From Waikato University

If you're writing a story on algal blooms you'd want to talk to Waikato University's Professor David Hamilton. If it's a piece on population and social trends you'd contact demographer Prof Ian Pool. Prof Mike Pratt would be the visionary you need in sustainable business.

These are just a few examples of the top commentators available in Waikato University's Experts File, now available online at www.waikato.ac.nz/experts/

Waikato University has hundreds of experts in a wide range of fields. In the Tertiary Education Commission's Performance-Based Research Fund report (the assessment of university research), Waikato was ranked first or first equal in 25% of its subject areas, and in the top four in half.

Waikato University's researchers were ranked first or first equal in:  
\* accounting and finance  
\* chemistry  
\* computer science and information technology  
\* communications and media studies  
\* mathematics  
\* management, human resources, industrial relations, international business and other business  
\* molecular, cellular and whole organism biology

We also have notable strengths in education, New Zealand law and social sciences.
