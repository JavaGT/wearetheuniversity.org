University welcomes International Students

More than 200 students from North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Pacific have begun arriving in Hamilton to begin their studies at Waikato University. To help these students settle in to their new life on campus and in the New Zealand the university's International Centre is hosting an Orientation Fair on Thursday 14 July at the Academy of Performing Arts on campus.

Seminars throughout the day cover legal, safety, health and driving issues.

As well as facing the challenge of academic study, international students also face the challenge of adapting to a new culture. A key focus for the event is to help international students establish links with Hamilton's community, and various local community groups and services will have information booths and displays at the fair.

University of Waikato International Director, Lynette Muter, said that by inviting the community groups to participate in the Fair, new international students will be better equipped to access services as well as being encouraged to become involved in activities that build a sense of belonging and ownership.

The students begin B Semester classes on Monday 18 July.
