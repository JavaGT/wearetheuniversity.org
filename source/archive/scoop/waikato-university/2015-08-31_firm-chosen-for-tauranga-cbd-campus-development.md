**Project management firm chosen for Tauranga CBD campus development**

Greenstone Group, a project management company with offices in Hamilton and Tauranga, has been chosen to project-manage the design and build of the Tauranga tertiary campus development.

The University of Waikato-led campus will open in the Tauranga CBD by 2020 and will be shared with the three other parties in the Bay of Plenty Tertiary Education Partnership: Bay of Plenty Polytechnic, Te Wānanga o Awanuiārangi, and Waiariki Institute of Technology. The University is leading the tertiary campus development on behalf of the partnership.

The University conducted a Request for Proposal through the Government Electronic Tender System (GETS) which attracted nine proposals; three were selected for interviews following a rigorous evaluation process.

Greenstone Group will start work at the beginning of September and will be responsible for developing and managing a master programme that takes the project from design through to completion. They will employ the consultants and architects for the project, with the process to find architects beginning immediately. Greenstone Group will also work with the University of Waikato on community engagement throughout the project.

The University’s Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Alister Jones, says this is an exciting time in the process to build a central-city campus. “Greenstone Group was chosen from a range of very highly qualified project management companies. Among the many tertiary projects they’ve worked on is the current campus development with the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic and we are looking forward to working with them on this city development.”

Professor Jones says the appointment of Greenstone Group, happening alongside the recruitment of an Academic Director for the new campus, is an important milestone for the campus development. “The region has been very supportive of the University and the tertiary partnership to create this campus. It’s important we recognise the vital input and significant contributions of land and funding to enable this campus to become a reality.”

Robert Dol, regional director for Greenstone Group, says the company is incredibly excited by the vision of the Tauranga CBD campus project and the significant contribution it will make to the economic, urban and tertiary landscape in Tauranga city and the wider region. “We are absolutely committed to making the project a success for the University of Waikato and the various stakeholders,” he says.

The University of Waikato Council endorsed the Heads of Agreement contract in May between the University, the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, Tauranga City Council, and the Tauranga Energy Consumer Trust. The parties have agreed on the conditions under which the regional contributions towards the project - land from Tauranga City Council; $15 million from the Bay of Plenty Regional Council; the $15 million from the Tauranga Energy Consumer Trust - are to be provided. Other work continues such as finalising funding and lease agreements.

The Tauranga CBD campus will enhance the existing network of tertiary campuses in the region. The University-led facility will provide purpose-built space for leading academics and researchers, postgraduate and undergraduate students, and for industry and community collaborations and commercialisation activities.

The new campus in Durham St is expected to open to students in 2020. It will focus on programmes that relate to areas of regional activity, including marine, ICT and logistics. Further courses will be developed over time to support areas of economic and industry need in the Bay of Plenty.
