**University a proud supporter of Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori**

Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato (the University of Waikato) is once again supporting Te Wiki o te Reo Māori – Māori Language Week.

The theme for this year is Whāngaihia Te Reo ki ngā Mātua – nurture the language in parents so that it may grow.

Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori, Professor Linda Smith, says Māori Language Week is an opportunity for staff and students, from beginners to fluent speakers, to embrace and use the language.

“Our culture is strong at Waikato and we continually strive to provide culturally rich and diverse experiences for staff and students. Don’t be afraid to give te reo a go. Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori provides an opportunity for everyone to try and say a few words without feeling whakamā (embarrassed).”

The University has a strong history in language revitalisation, and teaching and research excellence in te reo Māori. To celebrate Te Wiki o te Reo Māori, which runs from from 27 July – 2 August, the University will host a number of activities on campus for staff, students and the wider community.

During the week there will be a word hunt competition for staff and students, and a staff Dress Your Space competition encouraging staff to label their reception areas, tea rooms and hallways with kupu (Māori words).

There will also be three presentations that are free and open to the public. Professor Pou Temara’s presentation is called Imagine, and is on Monday 27 July from 12-2pm in room 1.01 in S Block.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley will speak on language and culture on Tuesday 28 July from 12-2pm at Waikato Management School, room MSB.1.05.

The third presentation is by the Honorable Te Ururoa Flavell on Friday 31 July, from 3pm-4pm in room 1.05 in S Block.
