Is New Zealand really a multicultural society?
==============================================

**Is New Zealand really a multicultural society?**

According to the 2013 Census, New Zealand has more ethnicities than there are countries in the world. We’re a country made up of Māori, European, Chinese, Indian, Samoan, Filipino (and many more) ethnic groups. Many of us think New Zealand has a great quality of life, but how do our migrants feel? What does it actually mean to be a multicultural society?

**Exploring the issues at the Winter Lecture Series**

These questions will be explored on August 19 \[date corrected\], 6-7pm, as part of the University of Waikato’s Winter Lecture Series. Held at the Hamilton City Council Civic Reception Lounge in Garden Place, experts and advocates will get together to debate the issues in a panel discussion led by comedian and columnist Raybon Kan.

Joining Mr Kan on the panel will be Māori issues expert Associate Professor Leonie Pihama, diversity acceptance advocate Anjum Rahman, indigenous population expert Dr Tahu Kukutai and international student adviser from the University of Waikato, Huy Vu.

**Accepting diversity**

Anjum Rahman, a University of Waikato graduate and the first Muslim woman to run for parliament (she ran for Labour in 2014) says that for her, multiculturalism is about first accepting the notion of diversity and embracing what makes each of us different.

“I think that in recognising and valuing diversity we’re saying that, actually, we do have a lot of common values as human beings and we’re just respecting that people do things differently.

“There is space for shared common values among people of different cultures - the work we have is in getting to that space,” she says.

Anjum immigrated with her parents to Hamilton from India, via Canada, when she was five. She remembers her schooling as difficult, finding it hard to “fit in” with the Māori and Pakeha kids. “I was the only Muslim child at school, and it was pretty clear I was different to everyone else. The Māori kids and the Pakeha kids played in their own groups – I didn’t really fit in with either of them.

“I think now, children are crossing those cultural barriers on their own at school and the more it happens, over time, the better we’ll get at recognising and accepting diversity.”

**Covering the viewpoints**

Other aspects of the topic that will be addressed include New Zealand’s multicultural make-up in the future, issues of cultural appropriation and the notion of “multiculturalism” itself.

**Winter Lecture Series**

Free and open to the public, Waikato’s Winter Lecture Series is designed to bring together experts and advocates from around the community to get people thinking about issues that affect us all.

The final lecture in the series, An Ode To Hamilton, takes place on 26 August, 6-7pm, at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts.
