Waikato University Proves Itself The Quiet Achiever

Waikato University has proved itself the quiet achiever in the Performance-Based Research Fund results, scoring top in 25% of its subject areas, top four in just under half and attracting an extra $1.3 million (3%) in research funding.

"We were second only to Auckland in the number of firsts we scored," says Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould. "I'm extremely pleased that the overall quality of our research has been explicitly recognized and rewarded financially in the PBRF exercise.

"It's all the more satisfying that our overall placing of a close fifth in research quality was achieved despite the fact that we have been merged with a teachers' college for some time, and staff at that college did not traditionally do a lot of research.

"Auckland and Otago are in the process of merging with teachers' colleges so it will be interesting to see what effect that has on their performance under PBRF in future."

Waikato University was first in:  
\* Pure and Applied Mathematics, score 5.7 \* Chemistry, 5.1 \* Computer Science, Information Technology and Information Sciences, 4.7 \* Molecular, Cellular and Whole Organism Biology, 4.2 \* Communications, Journalism and Media Studies, 3.8 \* Management, Human Resources, Industrial Relations, International Business and Other Business, 3.4 \* Accounting and Finance. 2.8

"Taken together these scores show we have the top computing and mathematics school and the top management school in the country for research performance," says Professor Gould.
