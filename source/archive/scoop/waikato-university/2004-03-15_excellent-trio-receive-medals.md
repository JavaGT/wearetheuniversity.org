Excellent Trio Receive Medals

Three Waikato University staff have received Vice-Chancellor's medals for excellence in teaching in 2003, the first year that many people have received the award since it was instituted in 1998.

Senior psychology lecturer Thomas Kalliath, management communications senior lecturer Debashish Munshi and law Professor Peter Spiller will be awarded their medals at a ceremony in the university's WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts on Monday 22 March.

The awards are designed to recognize the importance Waikato University places on quality teaching and the significant contribution to learning made by teachers with a focus on excellence.

Human resources development advisor Mike Bell says each of the 2003 winners "displayed excellence in their teaching with a good philosophical basis and constant self-evaluation to improve their skills and knowledge".

Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould said of the recipients: "I think they are all extremely meritorious in differing ways."
