Transforming Education Through Personalised Learning

Transforming education by focusing on the learner will be the key theme of upcoming educational conference to be held in Hamilton and in Christchurch in June.

The University of Waikato Education Leadership Centre will host the conference, which will consist of a series of workshops that draw upon international perspectives that are aimed at developing genuine equity and excellence in schools.

The workshops are designed to support primary and secondary schools in personalising learning and will consist of four key themes: deep learning, deep experience, deep support and deep leadership. Participants are encouraged to bring their senior leadership teams and participate in diagnostic activities and planning exercises based on their school context.

International Networking for Educational Transformation (iNet) New Zealand will also be launched at the event. iNet originates from the United Kingdom and is a leading-edge school-based international collaboration whereby members can share innovation, knowledge and best practice with other schools around the world.

The keynote speakers at the education event include Professor David Hargreaves, Sue Williamson, Kai Vacher and Emma Sims from the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT). Associate Professor Jan Robertson from the Educational Leadership Centre at the University of Waikato will also speak. Jan is an expert in Leadership Coaching. SSAT is a leading national body for secondary education in England and the forefront of the transformation of education worldwide.
