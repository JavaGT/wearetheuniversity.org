NZ Appeal Court President To Speak At Waikato University

The president of the New Zealand Court of Appeal Justice Noel Anderson will discuss 'The Appearance of Justice' when he delivers the 2004 Harkness Henry Lecture at Waikato University on Thursday 9 September at 7pm

The lecture will explore issues relating to apparent bias, the methods of assignment of judges at first instance, the composition of appellate benches, judicial independence, open courts and freedom of expression versus assurances of a fair trial.

Justice Anderson was admitted to the bar in 1967 and appointed Queen's Counsel in 1986. In 1987 he became a High Court judge and a permanent appointee to the Court of Appeal in 2001. He became president of the Court of Appeal at the start of this year.

There is no charge for attending the lecture. Which will be held in the university's S block, signposted from gate 5 in Hillcrest Rd, Hamilton. Further information is available from www.waikato.ac.nz/law
