Waikato University aims to boost light alloy exports

Researchers from Waikato University's department of materials and process engineering have been granted $1.35 million over four years for research aimed at boosting exports of light alloy products.

\"We will help industry develop high value, light alloy products with superior properties that can be exported into global niche markets," says the team's leader Professor Thomas Neitzert. "We'll also aim to broaden the number of materials and technology professionals working in the light alloys sector. The aim is to define and prototype new transformations from raw metal to products for the light alloy industry in New Zealand."

Waikato's research, funded by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology, will be aided by Auckland University and the Auckland University of Technology, as well as a number of leading light metal manufacturers.

"The project spans the fields of aluminium, magnesium and titanium alloy optimisation and dynamic thermal treatment, surface treatment and finishing, casting and extrusion operations," says Professor Neitzert. "Our work will also examine the powder metallurgical synthesis and shaping of titanium components for specialised uses based on inventions made by Waikato University researcher Dr Deliang Zhang."
