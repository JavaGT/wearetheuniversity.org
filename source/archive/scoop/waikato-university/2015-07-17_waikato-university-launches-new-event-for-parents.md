**Waikato University launches new event for parents**

The University of Waikato is hosting its first parent information sessions in Hamilton and Tauranga to inform parents about what to expect when their children begin tertiary study.

With half the year gone already, parents of children in their final year of secondary school are full of questions about tertiary study and how to help their children transition successfully into university.

Group Manager Future Students Catherine Downes says the information sessions will give parents an opportunity to ask questions and receive guidance for making their child’s transition a smooth one.

“We want to reassure parents that once their son or daughter starts studying at the University of Waikato they will be well looked-after, especially those students who are moving away from home for the first time,” says Catherine.

The inaugural events will include talks from various University and faculty staff who will share information about student support services, study costs, scholarships, the application process and the difference between school and university.

The Hamilton sessions take place on Wednesday 22 July and Thursday 30 July from 5.30pm-7pm in S Block on the Hamilton Campus. The Tauranga session is on Thursday 20 August from 7pm-8.30pm at the ASB Arena, ASB Park Stadium.
