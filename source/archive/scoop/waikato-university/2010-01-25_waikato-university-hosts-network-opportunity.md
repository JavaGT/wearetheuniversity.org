Waikato University hosts network opportunity
============================================

**Waikato University hosts network opportunity**

Top computer network techies from North America and Australasia are among the invited speakers to a conference being hosted by Waikato University’s WAND computer network research group and its spin-off company Rurallink this week \[January 27-29\].

It’s the third time Waikato University has hosted the annual conference of the New Zealand Network Operators Group (NZNOG) conference, which provides a forum for technical staff at ISPs across New Zealand. About 140 attendees are expected for the mix of workshops, presentations and talks by invited international speakers.

Speakers include Geoff Huston of APNIC, which allocates internet addresses in the Asia-Pacific region; Bill Norton, a world expert on ISP peering (connecting) and former chair of the North American Network Operators Group (NANOG), and Philip Smith of Cisco, who’s an expert on routing protocols.

The talks will cover network-related topics ranging from network security and the migration of video traffic from traditional channels into an emerging “video internet ecosystem”, to how to build a data centre for under a million dollars and how to build a cheap router using open-source software.

Dr Gordon Paynter of the National Library of New Zealand will also talk about the Library’s upcoming ‘web harvest’ as part of its responsibility for preserving the nation’s social and cultural history, not only in the form of books, newspapers and photographs but also websites, blogs and videos. Scheduled for April, the web harvest will be only the second the Library has attempted.
