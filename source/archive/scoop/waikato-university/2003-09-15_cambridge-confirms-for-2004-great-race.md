Cambridge Confirms For 2004 Great Race

Cambridge Confirms For 2004 Great Race

Britain’s Cambridge University has confirmed it will return to Hamilton next year for another shot at the Gallagher Boathouse 8s Great Race against Waikato University.

Cambridge lost the inaugural contest for the Harry Mahon Memorial Trophy in 2002 and on 7 September 2003 their arch-rivals Oxford University also failed to triumph over Waikato.

“Cambridge has indicated it’ll be bringing out a very strong crew to take us on next year, so it’s already shaping as another great contest,” says Rob Hamill from Great Race organisers Boathouse Events. “However, the ultimate goal for us is to secure the return of Cambridge and Oxford for three years apiece.” The announcement of Cambridge’s confirmation follows news that the immediate future of the annual Great Race is secure with sponsors Waikato University, Gallagher Group and Scottwood Group recommitting for another two years and Perry Foundation for another one year.

Waikato skipper James Fitzgerald says he’s looking forward to being part of the Great Race again next year and he expects many of this year’s squad to be available again.

However, coxswain Rachel Goudie, who played a key role in the 7 September victory against Oxford, will not return due to the eligibility rules for squad members, which only allow Waikato University graduates to compete in the event in the year that they graduate. Goudie will continue her studies at AUT for a Bachelor of Health Science (physiotheraphy).
