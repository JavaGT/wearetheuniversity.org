Waikato University welcomes Aussie students

**Waikato University welcomes Aussie students**

Australian students are now eligible to apply for school leaver scholarships at the University of Waikato.

Secondary school students who pass the Australian equivalent of NCEA Level 3 with Merit or Excellence and enrol at Waikato will automatically receive a Merit scholarship worth $3000 or Excellence scholarship worth $5000.

Making these scholarships available to school leavers in Australia is one way the University of Waikato plans to build its market in Australia, says Group Manager Future Students, Catherine Downes.

“Australian citizens and permanent residents already pay domestic tuition fees at all New Zealand universities but they don’t qualify for the Student Loan or Student Allowance,” she says. “These entrance scholarships will help to get them started.”

There is an unlimited number of scholarships available and to apply students just need to send a copy of their academic transcript to info@waiakto.ac.nz once they’ve enrolled.

Future Student Advisor Cynthia McNabb attended several career expos in Sydney last month and says the response from students there was positive.

“Government funding of Australian universities is going down and loan interest rates are creeping up so many students are considering other options,” says Cynthia. “There are many Kiwis who have grown up in Australia and interested in coming back to New Zealand to study.”

New Zealand citizens who currently reside in Australia are also eligible to apply for a student loan or allowance through Study Link.

Students entering their first year of university study will need to have completed Year 12 with an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) or Qld OP score that satisfies the New Zealand education admission requirements. Further scholarship regulations here.
