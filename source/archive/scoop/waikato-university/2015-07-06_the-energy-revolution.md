The energy revolution
=====================

**The energy revolution**

The age of fossil fuels is coming to an end. Global warming from their burning is undeniable. But when will tomorrow begin?

Keith Gordon from the University of Otago, and Massey University’s Luke Liu will discuss these issues and more at Café Scientifique in Tauranga on 20 July.

Will there be a long transition period, with a mish-mash of renewables while we learn to harness the sun’s energy efficiently, as plants have been doing for 3.5 billion years? Is there even enough sunlight striking the Earth to supply the increasing energy demands of 6-9 billion humans?

Nuclear energy may be the only realistic alternative for some countries but it’s not an option for a nuclear-averse country like New Zealand, with a small population and large land area split in two. Can our renewable energy sources satisfy the extra load of a wholesale conversion to electric vehicles? Or would it be simpler just to filter the CO2 out of vehicle and other emissions instead?

What are the options likely to mean for more remote centres like Nelson, Napier, Whanganui, Tauranga, and oil and gas-producing New Plymouth?

The MACDIARMID INSTITUTE is supporting regional development with this series of public talks, organised in association with Café Scientifique, Tauranga.

Date/Time: Monday 20 July. Doors are open from 6.30pm for a 7.00pm start.  
Venue: The Tauranga Yacht and Power Boat Club, 90 Keith Allen Drive, Sulphur Point, Tauranga.  
Cost: Entry is $5.00 and refreshments are provided.
