Ex-120kg prop now an 85kg high performance manager

Ex-Rotorua Boys High and Waikato under-19 rugby prop Glenn Barry was once a beefy 120kg.

Now, at a more slimline 85kg and competing in triathlons, Glenn has taken over as Waikato University's new high performance manager.

"I'm responsible for helping the university's elite sportspeople perform well at both their studies and their sports. We have a range of top athletes here, including Olympians, and my job is to help them achieve their best.

"Waikato University has a really strong commitment to helping top sportspeople perform while they're studying."

The Evers-Swindell twins, and other Athens Olympians, rowers George Bridgwater and Nathan Twaddle, shooter Nadine Stanton and cyclist Peter Latham are current or recent Waikato University students.

Glenn is well-qualified for his job. After leaving Rotorua, he obtained a degree in sport and leisure studies from Waikato. He's currently doing some post-graduate studies in the specialty area of prescribing exercise.

He mainly used exercise himself to shed the weight he needed to so that he could compete in his new found love of triathlons.

"It's a real buzz. My aim now is to compete in next year's New Zealand Ironman."
