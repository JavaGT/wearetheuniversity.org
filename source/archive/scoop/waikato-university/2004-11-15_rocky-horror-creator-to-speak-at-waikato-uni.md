Rocky Horror Creator To Speak At Waikato University

Richard O'Brien, creator of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, will give a guest lecture about his career on stage, TV and film at Waikato University on Monday 22 November At 7pm.

The event will be held in the Wel Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts. Entry is by gold coin donation. Please RSVP to the department of theatre studies on 07 838 4922 or email jaysh@waikato.ac.nz.

Richard, who appears in the university's latest TV ad, is best known as Riff Raff from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. A statue of Riff Raff, created by WETA Workshop, will be unveiled on Hamilton's Victoria Street later this month

Richard and his family moved from England to rural Tauranga in 1952 to take up sheep farming. After studying dairy farming, Richard tried many jobs including a stint as a barber in Hamilton, where he was inspired by movies at the Embassy Theatre.

On his return to England, these cinematic influences mixed with the psychedelic London of the 1960s. The end result: a cult genre-defying stage show and movie that combined Horror, Rock'n'Roll, Comedy, Cabaret and Cross-dressing.

Besides Rocky Horror, Richard has also appeared in several major stage productions in London's West End, is well-known in the UK as a TV presenter, and has had a varied career in film and TV.

His stage performances include UK productions of Hair, The Little Shop of Horrors, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and his own show, Disgracefully Yours, at the Edinburgh Festival. Television work includes Robin of Sherwood, A Hymn For Jim, The Ink Thief and The Dick Francis Thriller. Richard presented the popular BBC children's series The Crystal Maze for four years and hosted the 1993 Brit Awards. Film credits include Flash Gordon, Dark City, Spiceworld, Ever After - A Cinderella Story, Elvira's Haunted Hills and Shock Treatment.
