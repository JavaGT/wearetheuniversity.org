The Changing Rules Of War

The changing rules regarding war and the stability of international safeguards against war are the focus of a talk by Waikato University School of Law professor Al Gillespie, who is speaking next week at a Law and Security after September 11 seminar.

His talk is entitled The Laws of War in the 21st Century.

"The main theme of my talk is that the laws of war are in a state of flux - from the reasons we condone the invasion of countries through to the weapons we authorise for use - and that many of the safeguards that the international community built up over the last five decades are currently very wobbly," says Professor Gillespie, the 2004 NZ Law Foundation International Research Fellow.

Prof Gillespie's fields of expertise include the laws of armed conflict and international environmental law.

The other speaker at the seminar is Dr Rodney Harrison, leading counsel for Ahmed Zaoui. His talk is entitled New Zealand and the War on Terrorism: Domestic Responses.

The seminar is being held at 5.45pm at the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts on Wednesday 11 August. Seating is limited.
