Indonesia And Christian-Muslim Relations Focus Of Lecture

A chance to better understand the Islamic religion and Christian-Muslim relations is being offered at a Waikato University religious studies public seminar on Wednesday 20 August.

The seminar, entitled Indonesia and Christian-Muslim Relations: Paradigms and Perspectives, will be addressed by Waikato religious studies lecturer Douglas Pratt and Fatimah Husein from the University of Melbourne.

Fatimah Husein will speak on Christian-Muslim relations in Indonesia. She is currently completing a PhD in this area.

Dr Pratt will discuss “Contextual Paradigms for Interfaith relations”. He is an active researcher in the fields of dialogue between religions and Christian-Muslim relations.

“At a time when there is much tension in the world because of the threat posed by Islamic extremists, it is important that we have a better understanding of the Muslim perspective of the world and strong dialogue between Muslim and non-Muslim peoples,” says Dr Pratt.

The seminar will be held in lecture theatre SG.03 at Waikato niversity’s Hamilton campus from 7pm-9pm.
