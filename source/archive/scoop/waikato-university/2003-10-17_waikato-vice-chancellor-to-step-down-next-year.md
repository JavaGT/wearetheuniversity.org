Waikato Vice-Chancellor To Step Down Next Year

Waikato University has announced that Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould will step down by the end of 2004 after a decade in the job.

“It’s been a great privilege to work as the Vice-Chancellor of Waikato since I started in July 1994,” says Professor Gould.

“However, I’ll be 65 next year and my current contract is due to end. I had always said that I expected to be in the job about 10 years. After I finish at Waikato, there are a number of things I want to do and I will have the time to pursue them.”

Waikato’s Chancellor John Gallagher says: “Bryan Gould has provided excellent service to Waikato University and I’m pleased that he will remain to see us through our 40th anniversary year in 2004.

“We will soon start the process of finding a replacement for him. The university Council has established a sub-group to manage that process.

“We will be seeking someone of very high caliber to step into his shoes and we’ll be looking both in New Zealand and overseas for his replacement.”
