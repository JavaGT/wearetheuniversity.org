**Inaugural conference success**

An inaugural indigenous research conference held at Claudelands in Hamilton has been hailed a success.

He Manawa Whenua was held over three days earlier this month and brought together indigenous researchers from around the world in a unique forum.

More than 300 people attended the conference each day with visitors from South Africa, Australia, Canada and the US mixing with academics, researchers, students and community representatives from around the country.

For those who couldn’t make it to the venue, keynote speakers had their presentations broadcast on the Ngaruawahia-based Radio Tainui, which provided five hours of conference coverage each day.

Conference committee chair Associate Professor Leonie Pihama, from the University of Waikato’s Te Kotahi Research Institute (TKRI), says it may have been the first time conference keynote presentations in an academic conference had been broadcast on radio.

“That made it accessible to everyone,” she says, “and was one of many highlights of an excellent conference.”

Assoc Prof Pihama – who was promoted to director of TKRI on day one of the conference - says He Manawa Whenua highlighted the strength of Māori at the University of Waikato, with staff and students from every faculty taking part, either as speakers, panel chairs or facilitators.

The conference was held during Te Wiki O Te Reo Māori and in support of that, opening day keynote speaker Dr Rangi Matamua presented his paper in te reo, as did Pānia Papa, who provided the closing presentation. A full translation service was provided, which received positive feedback from delegates.

“That worked amazingly well,” Assoc Prof Pihama says.

She says the wide range of speakers at the conference brought their own unique perspectives but some common themes came through.

“They were all really focussed on our need to create positive change, to support Indigenous involvement in critical issues such as environmental research and whānau wellbeing, as well as enhancing international relationships.”

Assoc Prof Pihama says there’s a good chance another conference would be held in 2015.

“The success of the conference and the feedback from delegates has really spurred our team into thinking seriously about hosting again.”
