Dual Approach To Computer Graphic Design Degree A First For New Zealand

Waikato University's School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences is offering a Bachelor of Computer Graphic Design (BCGD) in partnership with the Wanganui School of Design, a school within the Universal College of Learning.

The university has traditionally validated graduates' qualifications from the Wanganui facility, but until now has not offered the degree to its own students. BCGD graduates will have their degree jointly awarded by both institutions.

Applications are invited now for the first semester of the three-year course commencing at Waikato in mid-July.

Chairperson of the university's Computer Science Department, Mark Apperley, says the introduction of the computer graphic design course is a significant development for Waikato.

"It represents Waikato's first venture into the art and design area, building on the strengths in traditional computer science and capitalising on the reputation of the Wanganui Computer Graphic Design Degree," says Apperley.

"In this sense, it brings a new culture to the university and will attract new students as well as appealing to many of our existing students.

"Not only does it enhance the spectrum of computing-related qualifications available at Waikato, but it opens up an entirely new domain of creative design."

"The new degree provides a creative computer-based qualification of international standing and opens up new opportunities for students and for industry in the Waikato region."

Senior lecturer Ian Gwilt, who helped develop the computer graphic design programme at Wanganui, says the partnership approach to the degree is a first for New Zealand.

"This is the first time a university and a polytechnic have co-operated like this to jointly award an existing degree," he says. "It's also the only computer graphic design programme provided by a university."

He says the new development provides a unique combination of design and technological curriculum that is not currently available in other degree programmes.

Gwilt describes computer graphic design as a creative process that combines art and technology to communicate ideas. He says the BCGD programme will focus on the technology of design.

"Graduates can expect to find work in a variety of exciting areas including advertising and design, printing and publishing, television and visual communications, digital graphic effects and web design."

First-year students will be given a firm foundation in the basic principles and elements of design. Second-year students will investigate and research in greater depth information from year one. Modules offered include an introduction to time-based media which covers advanced 3D modelling, animation, image-making, interactive media and video.

Third-year students will undertake an intern project where design research, theory, creativity, technical and communication skills are applied to practical projects for selected non-profit clients.

Students have the option of a fourth year for a specialised research-based honours degree. This requires students to prepare a postgraduate thesis and develop a body of work based on this research. The programme encourages students to use their talents and creativity to push beyond traditional design boundaries.

Programmes are also in place for postgraduate diplomas and Master of Computer Graphic Design.

The school's public relations and marketing co-ordinator, Nicola Boland, says entry to the BCGD will be limited to 25 students each semester so students are advised to get their applications in quickly. Selection interview dates are set for June 7 and 10, and the course begins on July 15.
