Conference aims to demystify small business development

With carbon credits being listed for sale on TradeMe, small businesses are turning to their advisors and accountants to see if they should be venturing into this new market. But what kind of advice will they be getting?

“Your average business mentor is unlikely to know the answers to curly questions like these” says Prof Stuart Locke of Waikato Management School. “But help is at hand: carbon trading is one of the topics that will be covered at a forthcoming conference on fostering small business growth for regional development. It’s a great opportunity for small business advisors to update themselves on current thinking around enterprise.”

Prof Locke is organising the conference in Manukau later this month, which aims to bring together practical know-how and research expertise on sustainable business, digital communities, Maori entrepreneurship, support structures for small business and entrepreneurship education.

Keynote speakers include Geoff Brown, head of market products at the New Zealand Stock Exchange; Rod Drury, CEO of online accounting solutions company Xero and 2006 NZ Hi-Tech Entrepreneur of the Year, and Prof Philip McCann, an expert on regional economies from Waikato Management School.

Minister for Small Business Lianne Dalziel and National Party spokesperson on small business Lindsay Tisch will also address the conference.

There will be presentations on business success from companies and organisations such as blackcurrant nutraceutical producer Just the Berries, Maori tourism operator Potiki Adventures, Venture Southland and Northland’s Dive Tutukaka, winner of the 2006 Tourism Industry Supreme Award.

Prof Locke says the conference will also be of value to accounting professionals seeking to expand their portfolios. “The research shows that the first port of call for small business owners seeking advice is often their accountant, so this is a great opportunity for accountants who are looking to move from compliance work to adding value for their clients.”

The conference is jointly hosted by the Economic Development Association New Zealand (EDANZ), the Small Enterprise Association of Australia and New Zealand (SEEANZ), and the Regional Science Association International, Australia and New Zealand section.

Small Enterprise Conference 2007 – Building Sustainable Growth in SMEs will be held at the TelstraClear Pacific Events Centre, Manukau City, on 23-26 September 2007
