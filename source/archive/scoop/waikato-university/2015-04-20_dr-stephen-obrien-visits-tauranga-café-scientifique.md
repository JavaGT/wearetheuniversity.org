Dr Stephen O’Brien visits Tauranga Café Scientifique
====================================================

**World leading conservation biologist Dr Stephen O’Brien visits Tauranga Café Scientifique**

World leading molecular biologist and conservationist, Dr Stephen O’Brien, will visit the Tauranga Café Scientifique on Wednesday 29 April as part of the Allan Wilson International public lecture series. Dr O’Brien is Chief Scientific Officer at St Petersburg State University, Russia, and author of science adventure stories ‘Tears of the Cheetah and other Tales from the Genetic Frontier’. Dr O’Brien uses the tools of molecular biology to help protect endangered species and understand devastating diseases such as cancer and AIDS. His talk entitled Wildlife genetics – uncommon glimpses will show what life histories are revealed in the genomic footprints of tigers, cheetahs and the Florida panther

As one of the founders of conservation genetics, a field that began just 30 years ago, Dr O’Brien will explain to his audience how powerful new genetic technologies have revolutionised our ability to understand the natural history of threatened mammals, and recognise hidden genetic vulnerabilities. Conservation genetics is now an important factor in every management decision about saving wildlife.

His talk entitled Wildlife genetics – uncommon glimpses will show what life histories are revealed in the genomic footprints of tigers, cheetahs and the Florida panther.

In the case of the Florida panther this led to “bold genetic action”. In the 1990s there were fewer than 30 animals left of this subspecies. The demographic and genetic computer models were quite clear – if nothing was done there was a 95% chance that the species would become extinct within 25 years.

“That was the headline that finally turned the heads of even the most vociferous objectors to invasive action,” says Dr O’Brien. “We supplemented the population with a handful of ‘first cousins’ from across the Mississippi, called Texas cougars – but not until after a long political exchange where objectors and self-proclaimed experts were arguing that we should just leave them alone. “Genetics is particularly useful for identifying the numerous hidden dangers that further threaten endangered mammals. These include historic events such as inbreeding or infectious disease, such as Ebola, which affects chimpanzees, and canine distemper, which decimated the wild dog in East Africa.

Dr O’Brien believes that New Zealand is a world leader in conservation. “I think we’ve all learned from New Zealand experiments. We know that marsupials and flightless birds are at a disadvantage if you release mammals – when the Panama land bridge appeared three million years ago, North American mammals outcompeted the South American marsupials until only the opossum was left. New Zealand is doing a good job of controlling invasive species, and shows that conservation can make a difference.”

“I am delighted to be visiting the home country of Allan Wilson, who was a friend of mine. I learned so much from him. He changed the world – the whole field of molecular evolution stands on his shoulders.”

Café Scientifique is on Wednesday 29 April. Seats have to be reserved at www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz. Doors are open from 6.00pm for a 6.30pm start at the Tauranga Yacht and Power Boat Club, 90 Keith Allen Drive, Sulphur Point, Tauranga. Entry is by gold coin donation. For more information contact Wendy Newport-Smith, Manager of the Allan Wilson Centre, w.newport-smith@massey.ac.nz, 021 423 757.
