**FSEN postgraduate scholarships launched**

  
Want to work with top scientists and engineers on ground-breaking research projects delivering genuine benefits?

The University of Waikato’s Faculty of Science and Engineering is offering 50 postgraduate scholarships for B Semester 2015 which provide the opportunity to work on specific projects with world-leading experts.

The scholarships – valued at more than $250,000 – are for two or three years and include research support. They are available in a wide range of subjects and are open to all New Zealand students studying at masters or PhD level in the science and engineering fields.

If successful, you could be modelling nutrient and sediment inputs in Lake Waikare, researching the microbial diversity of geothermal mud pools, measuring the electrical conductivity of brain tissue or exploring the feasibility for automatic barnacle removal from greenshell mussels.

The scholarships have been designed by the University’s top science and engineering academics to focus on specific projects.

A list of research topics, supervisors and a comprehensive description of each project is available at sci.waikato.ac.nz/postgrad-scholarships-science for science and sci.waikato.ac.nz/postgrad-scholarships-engineering for engineering.

Applicants must be New Zealand citizens, qualify to enrol at the University of Waikato and intend to study in Semester B, 2015 in either a masters degree 90 or 120 point thesis or in the first year of a PhD. Both part and full-time students are eligible.

The scholarships are typically valued at $5000 for two or three years and include research support. Applicants may apply for multiple projects.

Applications close on 10 July and can be made at http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/study/scholarships/postgraduate-scholarships-b-semester-2015
