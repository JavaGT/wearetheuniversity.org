**New qualification aims for better governance of organisations**

A new postgraduate qualification targeted at those who govern corporations, trusts and not-for-profits in New Zealand is coming to Whakatane .

The University of Waikato will hold a public information session about the new Postgraduate Certificate in Management (Governance) on Tuesday, 7 July at Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi Campus. If you’d like to attend, please RSVP to aimeeb@waikato.ac.nz

The University of Waikato’s Management School and Te Piringa - Faculty of Law have worked together to develop the new qualification, which is specially designed for those who wish to develop the necessary skillset for governance roles, such as company directors, board members, trustees and councillors.

“Too often we find businesses that like to blame market forces or the government for their financial failure,” says Professor Mueller (MNZM) of Waikato Management School, who is one of the programme’s lecturers. “But in most cases, degrees of poor governance are the real reason why a business ends up falling over.”

This governance programme is aimed at creating successful business leaders who clearly understand their roles and responsibilities. Lectures will cover finance, corporate law, ethics, governance, strategy and leadership.

Throughout the duration of the nine month course, participants will attending three day teaching session and will be asked to put their skills to the test by completing a project focused on the organisation they work for in.
