Conference opens the door to Asia

The 16th New Zealand Asian Studies Society (NZASIA) International Conference will kick off in Hamilton on Monday 21 November, featuring a special welcoming event and concert open to the public.

Original research regarding Asia, its culture, history, and its role in international affairs is the focus of the NZASIA Conference, hosted by The University of Waikato Department of Humanities (East Asian Studies), from 21-23 November.

The welcoming event will feature a presentation by conference keynote speaker, Professor Kam Louie from the Australian National University in S Block, followed by a reception and exhibition of paintings, ikats and Asian artefacts at the WEL Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts.

The evening will conclude with a concert by the Wai Taiko Drummers, the NZ Noh Theatre Players and sitar player Lester Silver with tabla player Rajendra Jadeja. Light refreshments will be available. Conference co-convenor, Senior Lecturer Dr Maria Galikowski, said that the biennial NZASIA conference aims to encourage the spread of knowledge about Asia.

“Over three days, international experts will present their original research in a variety of fields relating to Asian Studies,” she said.
