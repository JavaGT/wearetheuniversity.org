Excellent educator

Waikato University school of education assistant dean, international development Jan Robertson has accepted an invitation to be part of a select and influential international network of educational leadership researchers.

The International Leadership in Education Research Network (ILern) will be funded by the UK’s National College for School Leadership and co-ordinated by Boston College in the US. ILern will bring together researchers to share research on such areas as moral and ethical leadership in schools, and sustainability and social justice leadership in schools.

In the first instance, the network will be meeting face-to-face at least three times in South Africa, the US and the UK.

Jan Robertson says: “I’m honoured to be invited to join such an influential network of researchers. It will be a challenging but fulfilling professional experience and I look forward to the closer link with the National College for School Leaders in the UK and what this might bring to leadership education in New Zealand.

“The focus on the human side of school leadership, sustainability and social justice, issues of diversity and inclusiveness, moral and ethical leadership, teacher and student leadership, are areas to which we at Waikato University have much to contribute. No other leadership research network with this level of support currently exists in education and it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to bring the research at Waikato, and in New Zealand generally, to this international audience.”
