**Press Release: [Waikato University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Waikato_University)**

Teams of students from New Zealand’s five Law Schools meet in Hamilton this week for the New Zealand University Law Students’ Conference featuring four days of competitions aimed at honing the skills of the country’s future litigators.

Sixty students from throughout the country will pit their research and practical skills against each other in Client Interviewing, Negotiation, Witness Examination and Mooting competitions. Finals for each sector will take place at the High Court in Hamilton on Saturday between 9.00 a.m. and 2.45 p.m.

Judging of the finals will be by panels headed by District Court Judges Twaddle and MacLean, Mr David Wilson QC, and Mr Roger Partridge of Bell Gully.

Winners of the competitions will be eligible to represent New Zealand in international competitions, including the Jessup Mooting Competition in the USA. Waikato has been a past winner in many previous sectors of the competition, on one occasion making a clean sweep of all four sectors of the competition.
