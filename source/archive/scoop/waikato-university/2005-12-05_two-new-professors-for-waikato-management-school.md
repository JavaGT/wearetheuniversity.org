MEDIA RELEASE

Two new professors for Waikato Management School  
5 December 2005

Two senior academics have joined the University of Waikato Management School as professors in organisational strategy and in economics.

James R. Barker is the School’s new Professor of Organisational Theory and Strategy in the Department of Strategy and Human Resource Management. Prof Barker comes to New Zealand via the US Air Force Academy and Marquette University in the United States.

His research interests include the development of organisational control systems and the consequences of innovation and restructuring on organisational systems and practices. Prof Barker plans to start several local research projects considering the adoption of sustainability values in the near future.

His current projects include collaborative research on entrepreneurial decision-making and surveillance practices with scientists at the Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories and with scholars at the University of Melbourne, US Air Force Academy, and the University of Western Australia.

Prof Barker has just taken on the editorship of the international journal, Management Communication Quarterly.

Waikato Management School’s Economics Department also has a new professor. Philip McCann comes to New Zealand from the UK where he was previously Professor of Economics at the University of Reading. He has also previously taught at universities in the USA, Japan, the Netherlands and Thailand.

Prof McCann’s research interests are in urban and regional economics, transport economics, economics of multinational firms, the economics of innovation, and labour markets and migration.

He received the 2002 Hewings Award for Outstanding Scholarship from the North American Regional Science Association, and is the only scholar from outside of North America to win the award.
