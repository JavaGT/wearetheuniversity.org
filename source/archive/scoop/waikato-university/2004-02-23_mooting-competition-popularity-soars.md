Mooting Competition Popularity Soars

The popularity of the Waikato University School of Law's secondary schools mooting competition is soaring, with more than 40 schools already registered for the 2004 event compared to 25 in total last year.

Mooting pits teams against each other in debates on points of law, similar to those argued in appeal cases in the courts.

Last year's event was won by Tauranga Girls' College, with Hamilton's Hillcrest High School second.

This year 42 schools have registered so far, including one from as far away as Northland.

"Mooting provides an interesting introduction to the law and gives students an insight into some of the skills required by lawyers. Our competition also gives secondary teachers a way of introducing students to legal issues," says the School of Law's mooting co-ordinator Raewyn Boyd.

Registrations are being accepted until the end of February.
