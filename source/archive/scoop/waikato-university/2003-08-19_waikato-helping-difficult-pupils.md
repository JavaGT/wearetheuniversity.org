Waikato helping “difficult” pupils

Waikato University’s School of Education is involved in developing a new British Open University course aimed at helping teachers internationally work smarter with pupils who have challenging behaviours.

Programmes at two New Zealand schools, Fairfield College in Hamilton and Clover Park Middle School in South Auckland, will be drawn on in the development of the Open University course.

Waikato Professor Ted Glynn and a British colleague, Dr Janice Wearmouth are currently involved in getting together the video and written resources that will be used.

Examples of international good practice will feature in the material.

“Our own Fairfield College in Hamilton has taken a successful whänau-based approach to helping manage problem behaviours,” says Professor Glynn. “It involves helping students to work as a whänau in addressing what the problems and the solutions are.”

Fairfield goes to great lengths to reduce the number of suspensions and expulsions by providing constructive alternative programmes.

The course, being developed with the support of the British government, will be available world-wide after its planned launch in September next year.
