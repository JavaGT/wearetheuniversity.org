Community initiative working with University

**Community initiative working with University to make NZ more hospitable**

What can we all do to tackle social issues and make our communities welcoming, compassionate and inclusive places to live, learn and work? That’s the call to action for those attending an event hosted by the University of Waikato’s Network for Community Hospitality this Thursday, 28 May.

The event, ‘Town & Gown: Flourishing Families’, will bring together University academics, not-for-profit groups, government and business leaders to discuss ways of making New Zealand more inclusive to help families flourish, and identify practical actions that will make a positive difference.

Discussion will focus on key social issues facing many not-for-profits in our community, such as increasing access to social housing and public transport, social inclusion, reducing poverty and child abuse, and making employment and education more accessible for people with disabilities.

The term ‘community hospitality’ refers to the original definition of welcoming strangers across the threshold into one’s community by providing advocacy, shelter and care, says Professor Alison McIntosh, a co-founder of the network, and chairperson of Waikato Management School’s Department of Tourism and Hospitality Management.

“We see this event as a catalyst for ensuring the University of Waikato engages closely with community groups; and to champion initiatives that will help transform the lives of vulnerable people,” says Professor McIntosh. “As a University, we have an obligation to provide a strong, critical voice on issues that impact on our community, and try to change the world for the better.”
