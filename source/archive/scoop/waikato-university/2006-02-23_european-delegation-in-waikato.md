European Delegation In Waikato

A European parliament delegation will meet with University of Waikato School of Education staff on Monday February 27 to hear about Maori education.

Local MPs Lindsay Tisch and Dianne Yates will accompany the delegates who are from the United Kingdom, Poland, Belgium, Germany, Slovakia, Finland and Spain.

The group will be welcomed with a powhiri at the university and will then hear from School of Education Professor Russell Bishop about Te Kotahitanga. Te Kotahitanga is a research project aimed at improving the educational achievement of Maori students in mainstream education.

The delegates are members of the European Parliament and represent committees such as agriculture, culture and education, regional development, international trade, fisheries and foreign affairs. They come from a wide range of political parties.

The purpose of the group’s visit is to build relations with New Zealand and Australia. They will also be visiting Wellington, Christchurch and Auckland and will be in New Zealand until March 5.
