**Otago welcomes release of PBRF results**

The University of Otago welcomed today’s announcement of the 2012 Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) Quality Evaluation, which reveals the remarkable gains in research productivity achieved by Otago and other New Zealand universities since the exercise was last held in 2006.

The PBRF assessment examines the quality of research performance by all eligible academic and research staff in New Zealand universities and other tertiary organisations.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) Professor Richard Blaikie says Otago’s showing in the latest PBRF round reaffirmed the University’s status as one of New Zealand’s leading research institutions.

This latest evaluation reveals that Otago has more than 700 individual staff graded as either “A” or “B” for the quality of their research. “A” graded researchers are judged as possessing high international standing in their fields and “B” as enjoying high national standing.

Since the 2006 evaluation, Otago’s number of “A” staff has increased from 144 to 189, while “B” staff have risen from 473 to 546.

“These significant rises are highly pleasing and reflect the University’s deep commitment to supporting staff to achieve research excellence at a national and international level. At Otago, our research underpins all aspects of our teaching, professional training, community service and commercialisation efforts, so this solid increase in the number of staff performing at these highest levels is very encouraging,” Professor Blaikie says.

Four separate Average Quality Score (AQS) measures for Tertiary Education Organisations (TEO) are being used in the latest evaluation and the University has improved its score in all four measures.

Otago was ranked first among New Zealand universities in the measure of research quality weighted by its postgraduate roll (AQS (P)) and second in the measure weighted by degree-level enrolments and higher (AQS (E)).

“This shows that the ratio of our students to top research-calibre staff is among the best in the country. Accordingly, Otago students enjoy enviable access to research-informed teaching and postgraduate supervision by acknowledged leaders in their fields,” he says.

Professor Blaikie paid tribute to the hard work of all Otago staff who contributed to the 2012 Quality Evaluation.

“The University is deeply grateful for the energy and effort that our academic and general staff have put into writing, or supporting their colleagues in producing, the 1,318 evidence portfolios in Otago’s submission.”
