University selects Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic & International)

The University of Otago has selected Professor Vernon Squire as its next Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic & International).

Professor Squire is currently the University’s Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Division of Sciences. He is an applied mathematician leading a group renowned for research on ocean wave/sea ice interactions and hydroelasticity – subjects that are particularly relevant at present because of global climate change.

Announcing the appointment, Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg said that Professor Squire will make an excellent Deputy Vice-Chancellor.

“Vernon Squire was selected from an outstanding field of applicants. While doing a superb job as Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Sciences for the past five years, he has remained highly productive in research, and has held grants from the extremely competitive Marsden Fund continuously since 1997."

Originally coming to Otago from the University of Cambridge in 1987 to take up the Chair of Applied Mathematics, Professor Squire was Head of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics from 1996 to 2004.

His work has a particular emphasis on polar marine science and sea-ice. He has participated in, and often led, more than 25 field experiments to Arctic and Antarctic regions to collect data to validate theoretical results. As well as being made a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand, he has received many other distinctions, including the Polar Medal.

During his tenure as Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Professor Squire has been closely involved in many teaching and learning initiatives, Professor Skegg says.

“He has championed technology-assisted changes to teaching and learning, and is particularly interested in such developments in relation to student-centred science and mathematics teaching. Within the Division of Sciences, he has led initiatives to improve responsiveness to Maori aspirations and needs."

Professor Squire will take over the Deputy Vice-Chancellor position in February 2010 from Professor Gareth Jones, who has held the position for the last five years.

“Gareth Jones will continue his research and scholarly work at the University. Later in the year the University will want to pay tribute to his outstanding contribution."
