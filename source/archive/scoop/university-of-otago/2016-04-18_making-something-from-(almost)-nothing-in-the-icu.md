Making something from (almost) nothing in the ICU
=================================================

**Monday, 18 April 2016, 10:19 am**  
**Press Release: [University of Otago](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Otago)**

**Making something from (almost) nothing in the ICU. Public lecture by Professor Geoff Shaw.**

**The University of Otago, Christchurch’s final public health lecture for 2016.**

**Wednesday 20th April, 7 – 8pm in the Rolleston Lecture Theatre.**

There is a wealth of technology and devices in intensive care units. But while we can use devices to gather a wealth of data, we are no more able to aggregate and utilise this data to benefit patients than we were 20 years ago.

If the question (and challenge) is how to get the most out of this available patient data, the answer is through computer modelling.

Computer models of physiology provide not merely a research toy or tool, but the means to aggregate large amounts of data into clear physiological pictures of patient condition that can evolve in real-time as the patient evolves. This enables clinicians to customise care– making the greatest use of data, which is currently under-utilised.

The Bio-engineering Research Group has developed better systems to control glucose levels in the critically ill by providing the greatest use from what is just about the world’s oldest medical sensor. In addition, their methods are being extended into the management of mechanical ventilation and cardiovascular resuscitation where ‘useless’ catheter data is turned into real-time stroke volume to titrate management.

The age of the ad-hoc paper protocol that fits every patient is ending; the age of computerised and customised care is beginning.

  
The Rolleston Lecture Theatre is on the ground floor of the University of Otago, Christchurch’s building at 2 Riccarton Ave, on the Christchurch Hospital campus.
