Quakefest ‘11: Dunedin Hosts Ten Christchurch Bands
===================================================

**Friday, 25 March 2011, 1:16 pm**  
**Press Release: [University of Otago](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Otago)**

### **QUAKEFEST ‘11**

### Dunedin Hosts Ten Christchurch Bands Over Two Relief Concerts Plus a Music Industry Social Function.

Following the extensive devastation of Christchurch and in particular the destruction of almost all its music venues local musician Brett Lupton struck upon a plan to hold a festival here in Dunedin for Christchurch bands to perform.

**Brett comments:**  
“It would be an opportunity to showcase Christchurch music to the good folk of Dunedin and a chance, also, for the bands to unwind for a weekend and simply do what they do best”

Brett, (an ex Christchurch musician himself) went online and using social media tools put his idea out there. The Christchurch music scenes response was immediate and overwhelmingly positive. Within 48 hours over 16 bands and musical artists had responded with messages of interest and thanks.

The call then went out to locals to host and assist with putting something on in Dunedin.  
Again the response was positive with local venue owners, musicians, business owners and people willing to lend a hand.  
  
**Brett comments:**  
“I was blown away by peoples generosity and willingness to help to their sister city.  
Sammys, Refuel, The Dunedin Musicians Club, Poppas Pizzas, Modaks, Circadian Rhythm Café, Phantom Billstickers, Dunedinmusic.com, Radio One and CHART ensured with their generous contributions that we could actually make this happen. This is local business helping local people”

**And so QUAKEFEST ‘11 was born.**  
**QUAKEFEST ‘11** is not benefit in the usual sense. Rather than aiming to raise money, **QUAKEFEST ‘11** is a relief festival. In the same way that people donate food and clothing in times of emergency Dunedin instead will donate venues, audiences and a weekend away to Christchurch musicians bereft of venues and an opportunity to play.

**On Friday 8 April** there are two simultaneous live concerts at Sammys and Refuel.  
**On Saturday 9 April** at the Dunedin Musicians Club a music industry function is being held to enable Christchurch and Dunedin musicians to network and socialise. Details are below.

**The line up for the QUAKEFEST ‘11 concerts is:**  
**Sammys**  
T54 Dialtones Undercurrents Valdera Piha Rescue Gorgeous Disorders

**ReFuel**  
Permanence Hayne Anthesiac Killshot Medics Lupus Lunar

Date: Friday 8 April  
Time: Doors open for both events at 8pm. Bands on from 8.30pm sharp!  
Price: $10 admits you to both events

The music industry function is for and about musicians and will be held at **The Dunedin Musicians Club**, 12 Manse Street Dunedin. The club will be open from 5pm with speakers from **CHART and Dunedinmusic.com** at 6pm. Food and drinks to follow with an open mic evening after that.
