New Research Into Kidney Failure In Intensive Care

New Research Into Kidney Failure In Intensive Care

Kidney failure in intensive care units is a complex medical problem with up to 40% of patients in ICUs exposed to this life threatening condition, which has a mortality rate of at least 50%.

Professor Zoltan Endre from the Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Otago University, is proposing a nation wide research project to identify early signals or markers of renal failure so doctors can intervene earlier, and save lives.

“The clinical challenge now is that we have a high mortality rate following acute renal failure in intensive care because it takes at least 48 hours to get results which show a patient’s kidneys are actually failing, “ explains Professor Endre. “ We can speed up that process if we can get earlier detection through urinary markers.”

Professor Endre will be talking about kidney failure generally, and what can be done about it in the first of the popular Health Lecture Series at the School on Wednesday March 10 at 7.30pm. The Series drew record attendance last year with nearly 1000 people attending the six lectures. It is supported by such groups as the Kidney Foundation who will have a display and take part in discussion at the end of the session.

This week’s lecture, “Kidneys….from Failure to Transplantation”, by Professor Endre will include an overview of kidney function, the relationship to the development of kidney disease, and new research strategies to counteract acute and chronic renal failure which is resulting in rapidly increasing numbers on dialysis. His talk will also look at new research evaluating models of chronic renal failure caused by diabetes and nephritis. This could result in new strategies for treatment.

It should be remembered says Professor Endre that although about 45% of kidney failure in New Zealand is because of diabetes, there are also a significant number of the 2700 people on dialysis or with a transplant, plus those who have chronic kidney failure, who do not have diabetes. Nevertheless renal failure is set to escalate dramatically because of the impact of diabetes in the general population.

The lecture will be held in the Rolleston Lecture Theatre on the ground floor of the School. All welcome
