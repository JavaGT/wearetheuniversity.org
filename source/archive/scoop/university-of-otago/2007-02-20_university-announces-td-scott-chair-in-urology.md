University Announces TD Scott Chair in Urology

  
Respected Dunedin businessman Trevor Scott is donating $1m to the University of Otago, partly to increase knowledge about a disease which affected him and is diagnosed in another 580 New Zealanders every year.

The donation will be used to establish the TD Scott Professorial Chair in Urology and, because it has been made under the University’s Leading Thinkers Initiative, it will be matched by the Government’s Partnerships for Excellence Programme, lifting the total to $2m.

Mr Scott says the donation came about as a result of many factors. “I was educated at the University of Otago. I’ve been involved as a member of the University Council. I was chairman of their Commercial Activity Board, which included establishing the publicly-listed cancer diagnostic company, Pacific Edge Biotechnology (PEBL), of which I became chair. And then I find out I’m a victim of the very disease this company is about.”

Mr Scott was diagnosed with bladder cancer in March last year. Approximately 580 New Zealand men and women are diagnosed with bladder cancer annually, while 170 die from the disease each year\*. He went through the traditional route of diagnosis and treatment, and was part of PEBL’s validation work around a urine sample test it was developing at the time. The cancer is currently in remission.

He says the diagnosis triggered his interest in developing the Chair in Urology. “I was going to make a contribution to the University, of a lesser amount and in Commerce. But once I became a victim of this disease, it influenced me and changed my focus.

“I hope this chair will enhance research and teaching around men’s problems. I also hope it will develop a greater awareness of these issues.

Since his diagnosis, Mr Scott has reduced the number of company directorships he holds and is spending more time working on his Wanaka vineyard. However, he is in the process of adding one important organisation to his list of involvements: a trust which will be focused on raising additional money to support the chair and promote research. “I’d like to think we could raise another $2m or $3m and use the interest to support, say, postgraduate work. I’ve already had a very encouraging response – much of it from men who have cancer experiences of their own.”

The trust will also be the recipient of profits from the sale of a Sam Foley painting of the University Clocktower. Mr Scott had the painting commissioned for his own pleasure but believed it was too good not to be shared. Prints are being made and framed copies will be for sold for $550 each.

The new professor, to be appointed after a world-wide search, will be based in the University’s Dunedin School of Medicine.

School Dean Dr John Adams says the donation will allow the School to add an impressive academic to its staff and enhance the urological research already under way at the University. “It will be great for the University and for the city. It can be difficult to afford to attract clinical academics but this donation allows us to develop new areas of urological research. It is most welcome.”

Dr Adams says there is growing recognition of the importance of men’s health issues and there are currently very few academic urologists in this country. “This Chair will create the possibility of further local research into health issues that particularly concern men. It will also be valuable for attracting postgraduate students.”

University Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg says he is delighted that Otago will be home to this important chair.

“Urologists study and treat disorders of the male urinary system. This includes prostate conditions which affect so many men. Many people consider that this has been a neglected area of medicine. We want to appoint a person who will lead and stimulate further urological research and enhance the teaching of both undergraduate medical students and postgraduate trainees.

“Mr Scott has made it clear that he wants the chair to be based in the Dunedin School of Medicine, but I would expect the person appointed to collaborate with colleagues in Christchurch and Wellington and, indeed, in other parts of New Zealand.

Professor Skegg says the University is extremely grateful for Mr Scott’s generous donation, which will benefit not only the medical school, but also New Zealand men.

A function to celebrate the endowment of the TD Scott Chair in Urology will be held at the Council Chamber of the University's Clocktower building at 5pm this evening.
