**University selects next College of Education Dean**

The University of Otago has selected a top educational leadership researcher, Associate Professor Ross Notman, as the next Dean of its College of Education.

Associate Professor Notman is the Director of Otago’s Centre for Educational Leadership and Administration and has led the Centre since its establishment in 2010.

Announcing the deanship appointment, which was made after an international search, University Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne says that Associate Professor Notman is an excellent selection for the position.

“In selecting a new Dean, we were looking for someone who was an outstanding scholar, who had practical experience with schools, and who shared our vision for a world-class College of Education. Associate Professor Notman meets all of those criteria. I look forward to working with him on a number of exciting initiatives,” Professor Hayne says.

His research interests centre on the personal dimensions of educational leadership and their impact on teaching and learning, with a particular focus on values-based leadership. He also teaches in the College’s undergraduate programmes as well as postgraduate leadership papers at masters and doctoral level.

He is currently the principal New Zealand investigator for two international collaborative leadership projects: a 20-country International Successful School Principalship Project and a 10-country International School Leadership Development Network that is investigating how to prepare educators to be leaders in high-needs schools.

Findings from his 2011 Teaching and Learning Research Initiative project, which examined values teaching in New Zealand intermediate and secondary schools, were selected for inclusion in the second edition of the International Olympic Committee’s Olympic Values Education Programme.

Associate Professor Notman gained a BA (Hons) and Dip Ed from Otago, and a M EdAdmin (Hons) and PhD from Massey University. Before joining the Dunedin College of Education in 1991, he was Assistant and Deputy Principal of Bayfield High School, Dunedin. In 1999, he joined the University’s Faculty of Education as the foundation Co-ordinator of Secondary Teacher Education.

He was foundation Head of the College’s Department of Education Studies and Professional Practice from 2007-2008 after the Dunedin College of Education’s merger with the University.

Associate Professor Notman says he is delighted to be heading the College as it consolidates its place as one of the leading colleges of education in New Zealand.

“Our College is a recognised leader in research, preparing quality early childhood, primary and secondary teachers, primary bilingual teaching, undergraduate and postgraduate studies in Education, and professional learning support for practising teachers.”

“In the immediate future, we are looking to enhance our community relationships with schools in particular, and to build our international programmes in teacher education and leadership,” he says.

Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Humanities) Professor Tony Ballantyne says he is very pleased that Associate Professor Notman is taking on the role.

“Ross Notman is well placed to lead the College in its mission to enhance educational practice through high-quality teaching, scholarship, research, professional leadership and community service,” Professor Ballantyne says.

Associate Professor Notman takes up his position in April 2017 after Professor Lisa Smith completes her term as Dean.

“I would like to take the opportunity to thank Professor Smith for her able and inclusive leadership of the College since 2012,” Professor Ballantyne says.
