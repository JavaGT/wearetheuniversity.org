Otago secures major Marsden funding

  
University of Otago researchers have gained major funding to undertake leading-edge research in the latest Marsden round announced today.

More than a quarter of this year’s $44m pool was allocated to Otago researchers to undertake 20 projects. The University’s share was the largest of any institution.

Researchers at the University will investigate areas ranging from the origin of our solar system, to a potential HIV therapy, to the history of interracial marriage in New Zealand.

Other projects include improving eyewitnesses’ identification of suspects in photo line-ups and the role a hormone called MIS may play in boys’ behaviour.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Geoff White congratulated the Otago researchers on their well-earned success in the prestigious funding round.

“Marsden funding is extremely competitive nationally - only 10 per cent of the initial applications were eventually funded this year. For Otago’s applications, the success rate was 12.5 per cent.

“Our researchers’ outstanding performance reflects the excellence of the proposals they put forward. Their success rate is an important quality measure that reinforces Otago’s status as New Zealand’s top-ranked university for research,” says Professor White.

The researchers, from across the University’s Divisions of Health Sciences, Humanities, and Sciences, gained 17 contracts and three Fast-Start grants in the round.

The three Fast-Starts provide important support for promising projects by emerging researchers at Otago and are very welcome, says Professor White.
