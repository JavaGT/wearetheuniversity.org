Otago University Gains Lion’s Share Of Health Research Funding

Funding Coup Confirms Outstanding Quality of Otago Research

University of Otago researchers have gained nearly two-thirds of the total funding available in the latest Health Research Council funding round, winning 25 contracts worth over $33 million out of a pool of $51.42 million.

The researchers, spread over the University’s three campuses in Dunedin, Wellington and Christchurch, have respectively gained $17,524,383, $9,146,542 and $6,370,440 for research that advances human health and is relevant to the needs of the New Zealand health sector.

University Acting Vice-Chancellor Dr Phil Meade extended his warmest congratulations to the successful researchers, saying that the “unprecedented success” represents an “clear vote of confidence in the quality of Otago’s research”.

Research Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Geoff White says the “extremely pleasing outcome is testimony to the truly excellent research conducted by researchers across the three campuses”.

Around 100 Otago researchers submitted successful applications for 18 project and seven programme grants, in what is an extremely competitive funding round,” says Professor White. “Winning external research funding of this magnitude is a key indicator of a university’s research strengths.”

Involving groups of researchers across the University’s Divisions of Health Sciences and Sciences, the 18 projects cover a wide range of research involving individual health, medical conditions, and brain function. “Their research will advance medical and scientific understanding, with many resulting in specific benefits for human health”, he says.

The seven “illustrious” programme grants awarded in areas of injury prevention, housing and health, mental health, social wellbeing, diabetes, cancer, and brain mechanisms for movement disorders involve extensive collaboration over a long period of time, says Professor White. With three programmes and ten projects between them, staff at the Wellington and Christchurch Schools of Medicine and Health Sciences have been “particularly successful”, he added.

“Overall, I see this funding success as a celebration of the high calibre of health, medical, and biomedical research at the University which has the potential to provide real health benefits to New Zealand society and the world,” says Professor White.

Details of the 25 programmes and projects follow below:
