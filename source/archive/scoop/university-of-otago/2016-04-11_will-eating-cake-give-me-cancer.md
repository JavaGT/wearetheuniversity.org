Will eating cake give me cancer?

University of Otago, Christchurch, Public Health Lecture

Wednesday 13 April, 7 – 8pm in the Rolleston Lecture Theatre. Dr Logan Walker, Cancer geneticist.

A simple search for 'cancer' on the internet will find countless theories to explain the cause of this disease. Unfortunately, much of this information is either false or misleading. But the news is positive for cancer-affected patients and their families. Evidence-based research has allowed us to enter an exciting era of genetic health for personalized cancer care and prevention. The lecture will highlight a number of cancer myths, demonstrate how researchers distinguish fact from fiction, and answer questions, including: “If someone in my family has cancer, will I get cancer too?” and “Can cancer be prevented?”

The Rolleston Lecture Theatre is on the ground floor of the University of Otago, Christchurch’s building at 2 Riccarton Ave, on the Christchurch Hospital campus.  
No booking required.
