Otago key partner in Asia-Pacific ties-strengthening initiatives

The University of Otago is a key partner in three inaugural Centres of Asia-Pacific Excellence (CAPEs) announced today by Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Paul Goldsmith.

CAPEs are cross-institutional centres of excellence in the language, culture, politics and economics of countries or groups of countries within the Asia-Pacific region. As well as teaching about and researching these countries, they are mandated to help all learners, exporters, and government agencies improve their understanding of the countries and their languages.

The University of Auckland will lead the North Asia CAPE, which covers China, Japan and Korea, while Victoria University of Wellington will lead two CAPEs focusing on South East Asia and Latin America, respectively.

Otago Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Humanities) Professor Tony Ballantyne says the CAPEs represent important national collaborations that will strengthen New Zealand’s ties to the Asia-Pacific.

“As a globally-engaged University we welcome the Government's investment and commitment in this area.

"I know that many Otago researchers are looking forward to using their expertise to assist businesses and organisations better understand the cultures and economies of the Asia-Pacific region and to have the opportunity to help create new opportunities for students to engage with Asia and Latin America.”  
The three centres are part of the Innovative New Zealand package in Budget 2016, and are funded by a $34.5m Government investment over four years.
