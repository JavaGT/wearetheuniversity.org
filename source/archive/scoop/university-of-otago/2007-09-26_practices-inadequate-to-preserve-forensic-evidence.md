Practices inadequate to preserve forensic evidence

IT management practices inadequate to preserve forensic evidence

The second annual New Zealand Computer Crime and Security Survey has  
revealed New Zealand organisations are ill-equipped to preserve computer  
forensic evidence.

The University of Otago conducted survey - which aims to raise the level of  
security awareness and determine the scope of computer crime in New Zealand  
\- has found that IT management practices are inadequate when it comes to the  
preservation of forensic evidence that could lead to criminal convictions  
for computer hackers or fraudulent employees.

University of Otago researcher KJ Spike Quinn is concerned that New Zealand  
organisations do not appreciate the full seriousness of computer crime and  
associated consequences - both financially and with regard to the reputation  
of an organisation.

"Management of forensic capability is woefully short of ensuring  
admissibility of evidence in court. Having a suitably trained person first  
on the scene makes all the difference in whether a prosecution is  
successful," Mr Quinn says.
