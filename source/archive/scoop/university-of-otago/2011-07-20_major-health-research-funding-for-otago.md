Major health research funding for Otago

Health research at the University of Otago has received a major boost, gaining $27.5M in the Health Research Council's (HRC) latest annual funding round.

Funding will be spread across a wide range of research in areas as diverse as tumour suppression, bipolar disorder and the management of gout.

Acting Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research & Enterprise) Professor Helen Nicholson has welcomed the new funding and says it is further recognition of the quality, breadth and depth of research being carried out at Otago.

\"Otago is producing world-class health research in a variety of areas. All of it has the potential to bring significant health benefits, not only in New Zealand, but further afield."

The new funding covers 22 research proposals across the University's campuses in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington and includes new funding for three major ongoing programmes, 16 projects, and three feasibility studies.

One of the new programmes involves the long-running and highly successful Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS) which has been closely tracking a group of 1265 people born in the city in 1977.

The CHDS has received a further $3.19M in funding over the next five years to extend its research to when they reach the age of 35. This will allow them to look at areas as diverse as the consequences of mental disorders for life course outcomes to the consequences of the Canterbury earthquake.

“This is a significant ongoing study,” says Professor Nicholson. “It is now in its fourth decade and continues to produce research that attracts international attention.”

Two existing Otago programmes have also gained three-year extensions.

Associate Professor Tony Merriman's programme Application of genetics to the pathogenesis of common chronic conditions has received a further $4.765M to continue research into identifying risk genes for in conditions such as abdominal aortic aneurism, gout and inflammatory bowel disease.

The 16 projects receiving funding include research into treatment for Alzheimer's disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, housing conditions and bronchiolitis, and colon cancer screening.

Other projects include early detection of urological cancers, prevention of weight regain in people with obesity, and the association of mental disorders with subsequent physical condition onsets.

Feasibility Study grants worth almost $150,000 each have been made to research into dental caries management in children, falls prevention for adults with intellectual disability, and patient safety in general practice.
