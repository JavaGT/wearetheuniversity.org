University of Otago and GE Healthcare join forces for innovation

One of the world’s largest medical technology companies, GE Healthcare, has signed a partnership agreement with the University of Otago, Christchurch’s Centre for Bioengineering.

The agreement is to work together on medical imaging technology projects.

The Centre for Bioengineering is one of the developers of a revolutionary MARS colour scanner, which provides far greater detail of the body than traditional machines such as MRI.

The agreement will also allow GE Healthcare insight into other New Zealand technology companies.
