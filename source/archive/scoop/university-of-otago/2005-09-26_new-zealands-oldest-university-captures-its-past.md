New Zealand’s Oldest University Captures its Past

Stories of the University of Otago’s past are being collected by a new History of the University Unit, launched by Vice-Chancellor David Skegg today.

The unit, based in the History Department, aims to facilitate historical research and provide a place for sharing stories and pictures about the University, says History Department Head, Professor Barbara Brookes.

“As the oldest University in New Zealand, Otago has a rich and varied history over its 136 years. Gathering those stories together will create a valuable resource for the University as well as ensuring the stories won’t be lost.

“As part of the unit, an electronic archive for alumni accounts of student life and study at Otago is being created, which offers an opportunity for our former students to remain involved in the University,” Professor Brookes says.

The History of the University Unit is unique in New Zealand, she added. The Unit will help locate archived material, both written and visual, about Otago’s history. It is already beginning to capture some of the more light-hearted aspects of student life at Otago over the decades by developing an electronic archive of alumni accounts of student days.

Former students and staff are being invited to contribute information to the Unit through the University’s History Department. The website address is http://ouhistory.otago.ac.nz/. The email contact is ouhistory@otago.ac.nz
