**Vitamin C does not alleviate gout as previously thought**

Latest research from the University of Otago, Christchurch, has shown vitamin C does not significantly lower uric acid levels in gout patients, despite previous studies touting its benefit.

Professor Lisa Stamp and her colleagues found while vitamin C supplementation, alone or in combination with gout drug allopurinol, appears to have a weak effect on lowering uric acid levels in some gout patients, it does not reduce uric acid (urate) levels to a clinically significant degree in patients with established gout.

The research is published in the latest edition of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) journal, _Arthritis & Rheumatism_.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that causes excruciating pain and swelling triggered by the crystallization of uric acid within the joints. Medical evidence reports that long-term gout management requires treatment with medications that lower urate levels by inhibiting uric acid production (allopurinol) or increasing uric acid excretion (probenecid) through the kidneys.

“While current treatments are successful in reducing the amount of uric acid in the blood, there are many patients who fail to reach appropriate urate levels and need additional therapies. Vitamin supplementation is one such alternative therapy and the focus of our current study, which looked at the effects of vitamin C on urate levels in patients with gout,” says Professor Stamp.

Her team recruited gout patients who had urate levels greater than the ACR treatment target level of 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/100 mL). Of the 40 participants with gout, 20 patients already taking allopurinol were given an additional 500 mg dose of vitamin C daily or had the dose of allopuriniol increased, while another 20 patients not already taking allopurinol were either started on allopurinol or vitamin C (500 mg/day). Researchers analyzed blood levels of vitamin C (ascorbate), creatinine and uric acid at baseline and week eight.

Findings show a modest vitamin C dose for eight weeks did not lower urate levels to a clinically significant degree in gout patients, but did increase ascorbate. The results differ from previous research which found that vitamin C reduced urate levels in healthy individuals without gout, but with high levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia).

In fact, the Stamp et al. study found reduction of uric acid was significantly less in gout patients taking vitamin C compared to those who started or increased their dose of allopurinol.

Professor Stamps says: “though vitamin C may reduce risk of developing gout, our data does not support using vitamin C as a therapy to lower uric acid levels in patients with established gout. Further investigation of the urate lowering effects of a larger vitamin C dose in those with gout is warranted.”
