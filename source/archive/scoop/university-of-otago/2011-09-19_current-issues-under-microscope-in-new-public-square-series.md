Current issues under microscope in new Public Square series
===========================================================

**Current issues under microscope in new Public Square series**  
_**\- Libya, global economic crisis, Christchurch re-build among issues examined -**_

Wondering about the impact of the “Arab Spring”? Worried about shaky international markets? Wanting to know how Christchurch can be re-built and at what cost? You’re not alone. And now New Zealanders will be given the opportunity to pose their questions on current issues to an expert panel in a brand new series of The Public Square.

Organised by the University of Otago’s Centre for Theology and Public Issues, the first of The Public Square: Current Issues will be held on Friday 23 September before a live studio audience and will be live-streamed to national and international viewers. Questions from the public on a wide-range of important subjects will be put to the panel, says Professor Andrew Bradstock, Director of the Centre, and the University’s Howard Paterson Chair in Theology and Public Issues.

“We sent out a call for questions last week, and we’ve been excited with the response we’ve received from the public thus far,” he says. “People are clearly hungry for in-depth debate on matters of concern. It’s also interesting how many of the questions deal with international issues. Clearly New Zealanders have a global perspective beyond their own shores and want to know what’s going on and how it might impact their own lives.”

The first panel will consist of four prominent national and local Dunedin commentators with a range of expertise:

Rod Oram, noted business and economics writer and commentator;  
Rt Rev Victoria Matthews, Anglican Bishop of Christchurch;  
Professor William Harris, Middle East expert and Head of Otago’s Department of Politics;  
and Aaron Hawkins, Radio One presenter and 2010 Dunedin mayoral candidate.

The event will run from 9.15 am to 10.15 am, with a live studio audience at the University’s Owheo Building (Corner of Union St East and Forth Street), be live streamed via the University’s website and be heard in Dunedin on Radio One. The Public Square: Current Issues can also be accessed later on iTunes U: http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/itunesu/

The decision to stream the event to a larger audience was a deliberate one, says Professor Bradstock: “This is bigger than just one community. People across New Zealand -- and potentially elsewhere -- want to deepen and broaden their understanding of what’s going on around them.

“Promoting informed, thoughtful debate around serious issues is what the Centre is all about – and you can’t have too much of that in a healthy democracy, especially as we run up to a national election. Good debate should lead to better thinking and, hopefully, better policy. I’m excited about this new series, which should be a useful, interesting and entertaining addition to our public square here in New Zealand.”

Members of the public who would like to attend the event or who have a question they’d like to pose to the panel are asked to contact the Centre at ctpinz@otago.ac.nz by Wednesday 21 September. The studio only holds 40 people, so it will be “first come, first served”, says Professor Bradstock.

Others are encouraged to view the event live by visiting:

Those living in the Dunedin area can also tune into Radio One 91 FM.
