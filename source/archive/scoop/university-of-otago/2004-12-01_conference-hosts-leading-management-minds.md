Conference Hosts Leading Management Minds

The best management minds from around the world will be converging on the University of Otago next week for the 18th Annual Conference of the Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.

More than 400 people from Australasia, Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia will be attending the event, which is being held at the University’s School of Business between Tuesday 7 December and Saturday 11 December.

With the theme “People First – Serving our Stakeholders”, the conference features Professor Denise Rousseau, current President of the US-based Academy of Management and professor of Organisational and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University’s Graduate School of Industrial Management (Pennsylvania, US) and Professor Paul Goodman, Director for the Institute of Strategic Development in the US.

“Profs Rousseau and Goodman are experts in their fields and we are honoured to have them at the ANZAM conference,” says Associate Professor Graham Elkin, Head of the School of Business’ Department of Management, which is hosting the event.

“The ANZAM conference is held only once every four years. This is the first time that it has been held in Dunedin and we have had more registrations than any prior conference. It is testimony to the level of quality research and teaching coming from Otago that we have been asked to host this year’s event and it will further raise our profile internationally.”

The event includes round table presentations, special interest workshops and doctoral workshops for postgraduate students and researchers. More than 380 refereed papers and round table discussion topics have been accepted for the conference. 200 people are coming for pre-conference workshops including 60 for a PhD workshop.
