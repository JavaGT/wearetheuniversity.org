Renowned landscape artist gifts works to Hocken

Prominent New Zealand landscape artist Douglas MacDiarmid has gifted a large collection of his works to the Hocken Collections at the University of Otago.

The 90 works, mainly in pastel and pen and ink, cover 50 years of MacDiarmid's career in New Zealand and Europe, and are valued at more than $200,000.

MacDiarmid is pleased the works are going to a place where they will be available to students, members of the academic community and, from time to time, the public, rather than being locked away in a storage vault.

"I'm too old to face any more of the merchant gallery mentality and you will understand how much happier I'll be if my work can find its way into the prestigious Hocken Collections," he says.

University of Otago Auckland Centre Head Adrienne Molloy worked with MacDiarmid to secure the works and says the artist has given the works enthusiastically.

"He was incredibly generous, forthright and charming about this gift," Ms Molloy says.

"A lot of the reason the Hocken exists is because of the generosity of artists and writers, and Douglas MacDiarmid is a tremendous example of this generosity," she says.
