Do you have a great business idea? Find out whether it's really a million dollar baby or just hot air in a suit.

Bear Baiting is an event hosted by the University of Otago's Enterprise Office, in collaboration with the Upstart Business Incubator, KickStart and the University's Master of Entrepreneurship programme.

Entry into this fantastic event is absolutely free and open to anyone with an original idea - you don't have to be at the University of Otago. You could be a first year student, postgraduate, working in engineering or milking cows on the Taieri - it doesn't matter, we just want to hear from you.

Bear Baiting is a brilliant opportunity to put your entrepreneurial ideas to the test with the added bonus of a rare chance to have four caged experts provide a rigourous commercial evaluation in front of a live audience.

Simply register below to be in to win $5000 worth of free business advice from Dunedin's Upstart Business Incubator and other great prizes. Submit your details along with a brief outline of your concept or idea. Those in the running to pitch on the night will be contacted and groomed for readiness by the talented Enterprise Office staff.

All entrants will receive an invitation to the formal cocktail party after the event where you'll mingle and network with other entrants, venture capitalists, business experts and the Bears.

Register

You'll need to register your interest by 10 March 2008.
