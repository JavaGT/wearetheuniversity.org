### Delgirl New EP And Shows

What does **Delgirl** do when they've got a new EP…? Well they head to Luggate of course!

**‘Freaky Pea’, their new EP**, was recorded with new band member John Dodd at Albany Street Studios, Dunedin in November 2010.

"We had an idea on tour in Februrary 2010, for a wee EP of songs that hadn't made it to the last two albums - sort of 'freak' songs. We made a freaky person out of flotsam and jetsam on a beach we were staying beside in Greymouth, and so Freaky Pea, the 'Freak' EP was born.”

Once they hit the studio however they decided to do two old freaks and two new ones.

When Deirdre Newall decided to retire from Delgirl, Erin Morton and Lynn Vare had to think about what they wanted to do as a band.  
"We had so many songs and ideas, it was really very natural to carry on developing Delgirl and our music. We've been really fortunate to have someone of John Dodd's calibre want to join Delgirl. He is a great singer and musician and brings a new dimension to the band - we are loving it."  
So the rumours are true - no longer a girl band.

"Actually, a group of forty year old women never really were girls anyway" they laugh. John just adds to the irony!"

'Freaky Pea" is being set free and celebrated with two shows - one at the **Luggate Hotel on Sunday the 6th March**, and **Carey's Bay Hotel on Sunday the 13th March** - both at 4pm - so a nice and chilled out Sunday arvo with Delgirl.

Ask **Delgirl** to describe their sound and they'll scratch around for the right words. Acoustic, country-blues? Harmony-rich folk-reggae fusion? It is what it is, they say. Ask them to play, and their songs do the talking, revealing musical roots nourished by the warm waters of the Tropics, the cool mountain streams of North America and the fertile soils of their New Zealand homeland.

These multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriters from Dunedin play _roots_ music, bedded in tradition but speaking of today's laughs, loves and losses in one clear voice. As performers they slip quietly into the living-room of the soul, warming it with their unaffected charm. Fluid, luminous voices meld with guitar, ukulele, banjo and stand-up bass in songs that swing with sweet-tempered ease.

In 2009 **Delgirl** landed the RIANZ Tui Award - Folk Album of the Year 2008, for their debut long player _**Two, Maybe Three, Days Ride**_. Their second album _**Porchlight**_, was released in Dunedin on the 16th October 2009.
