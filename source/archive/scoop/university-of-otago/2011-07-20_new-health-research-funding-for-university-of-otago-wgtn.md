New Health Research Funding for University of Otago, Wellington

Housing and health, stroke assessment, cancer care and clinical decision making, and maternal intervention for infant allergic disease are the focus of new funding grants from the Health Research Council for the University of Otago, Wellington.

The Wellington campus not only educates medical undergraduates, and offers wide ranging programmes in health sciences, but also has a strong and growing health research capacity.

This year UOW has received $4.16 million from the HRC for new research projects. All grants involve teams of researchers investigating an area of study over two or three years.

Dr Tristam Ingham, Department of Medicine, has received $1,157,725 for a three year project in Maori and Pacific health. Whiti Te Ra: The contribution of housing conditions to bronchiolitis disparities. The study will look at the acute respiratory infection, bronchiolitis, in Maori and Pacific children and the risk factors in the home such as poor housing and indoor climate which impact on the high Maori hospitalization rate. Admission rates for Maori children are three to five times higher than non-Maori and the causes are not yet clearly understood.

Dr Kristin Wickens, Department of Medicine, has received $1,181,991 for a three year project to investigate Maternal probiotic intervention for infant allergic disease prevention. This study will expose pregnant women to beneficial bacteria or probiotics to determine any beneficial effects, with regard to gestational diabetes mellitus, group B streptococcal vaginal infection and bacterial vaginosis.

Associate Professor Louise Signal, Department of Public Health, has received $1,198,742 million over three years to investigate Cancer care journeys and clinical decision making. This study will investigate the influences of ethnicity and comorbidity on cancer survival to reduce inequalities. Maori community and clinical groups will provide research guidance. The aim is to provide at least three clinical interventions to reduce inequalities in cancer survival, and improve the management of cancer and comorbidities.

Dr Anna Ranta, Dean's Office, has received $624,846 over two years to study the Efficacy and safety of a TIA electronic support tool. The TIA tool has been developed to assist GPs in the early detection of stroke and initiating treatment. This study will test and investigate the effectiveness of this tool in reducing stroke, assess risks and establish costs compared to conventional management of early signs of stroke. Early detection of pre-stroke symptoms, caused by a temporary disruption of the blood to the brain, is vital in reducing the risk of a serious and debilitating stroke over the following three months.
