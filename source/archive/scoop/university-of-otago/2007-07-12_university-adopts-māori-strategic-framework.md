University adopts Māori Strategic Framework

The University of Otago this week adopted its Māori Strategic Framework.

The Framework follows a Treaty of Waitangi Stocktake undertaken in 2005. It has been developed in consultation with stakeholders over the past two years and should provide a more cohesive approach to Māori strategy across all campuses of the University during the next five years.

The Framework has six specific goals. They include strong accountable leadership, growth and development of Māori staff and students across the University, developing quality research that contributes to Māori development aspirations and the knowledge economy, and continuing commitment to partnerships with Ngai Tahu and other iwi.

Prominent Ngai Tahu member and University Council member Edward Ellison says the framework provides a logical basis for the University to align Māori values and aspirations alongside its own values and aspirations.

“There is a lot of good Māori -related activity within the University at various levels and this provides a measure and benchmark for that.”

University Chancellor Lindsay Brown says this is a further step forward in what has been an ongoing process. “It’s about the University proactively seeking to contribute to Māori development in all areas of its operations.”

Mr Brown says the document is the result of engagement with a broad cross-section of stakeholders.

University Māori Affairs Advisor Darryn Russell says the document is significant because it is the inaugural Māori strategy for the University.

“The Framework – alongside our Treaty partnerships – is a very strong foundation for the University, as a vibrant contributor to things Māori. The simple and clear document is well owned within the University because of the level of involvement in its development.”
