**New discovery to improve success rates of IVF**

  
Researchers from the University of Otago, Christchurch, are collaborating with clinicians at Fertility Associates in Christchurch to develop a test to significantly improve the success rate for in vitro fertilisations implantations.

Christchurch obstetrics and gynaecology researcher, Dr Gloria Evans, has discovered for the first time key biomarkers – or signs - which show when a woman’s uterus is ‘more favourable’ for implantation. If the key biomarkers are not present, then the embryo can be frozen until a cycle with more positive biomarkers can be achieved.

This discovery could have a significant effect in improving the success rate for couples undergoing the emotional and expensive process of IVF.

In collaboration with Fertility Associates Christchurch, Dr Evans now wants to confirm her exciting findings in a larger sample of women and is calling for volunteers.
