Otago appoints first Professor of Earthquake Science

A leading New Zealand seismologist has been appointed as the University of Otago’s inaugural Professor of Earthquake Science.

Dr Mark Stirling, who is currently a Principal Scientist for seismic hazard analysis at GNS Science, will take up this new professorial chair in February of next year. He will also lead a new multidisciplinary Centre for fault and earthquake science that will draw on cross-departmental expertise at Otago.

The Centre’s aim will be to advance fundamental understanding of the relationships between fault structure, earthquake processes, and consequential hazards. It will draw on considerable existing research strengths in University departments including Geology, Geography, Marine Science, Mathematics & Statistics, and Surveying.

University Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne warmly welcomed Dr Stirling’s appointment to the professorial chair and directorship of the Centre.

“Mark Stirling has pursued an impressive career in which he has developed expertise across multiple areas of earthquake-related science. I am delighted that he will be bringing his skills and knowledge to Otago to lead crucial fundamental research into faults and earthquakes,” says Professor Hayne.

Dr Stirling is an Otago graduate who gained his BSc in Geography and Geology in 1983 and after an intervening two years of geological employment earned his MSc (Hons) in Geology in 1988. He went into consulting for five years and then undertook a PhD in Geological Sciences at the University of Nevada, Reno, graduating in 1998. That same year he joined the Institute of Geological Sciences, which became GNS Science in 2002.

His research focuses on earthquake geology, geomorphology, seismotectonics and seismic hazard modelling. His experience in the latter field has included 15 years as leader of the New Zealand seismic hazard mapping project.

Despite the primarily industry-focused nature of his work at GNS Science, Dr Stirling has maintained a healthy academic publication record of 90 peer-reviewed papers and book chapters. Over his 26-year career he has developed a multidisciplinary skillset that crosses the boundaries of fundamental data collection, modelling, and provision of practical solutions for end users.

Dr Stirling says he is excited to be taking up the position.

“I’m looking forward to pushing research frontiers in multidisciplinary earthquake science and associated hazards, and helping to train top-quality undergraduate and postgraduate students in these fields.”

He says taking up the professorial chair will free him up to pursue a number of his long-standing research ideas aimed at improving how earthquake hazards are quantified in New Zealand and abroad.

“I’m also bringing my GNS Science and overseas collaborations with me, which will assist the University’s goal to establish itself as an international hub for fault and earthquake science.

“On a nostalgic note, I will enjoy returning to the University of Otago, which is where I met my wife Jane. We have just celebrated our silver wedding anniversary, and have two lovely boys to show for it.”

The Chair in Earthquake Science will be based in the University’s Department of Geology, which has undertaken decades of world-leading investigations into crustal structure and fault zone mechanics.

Head of Department Professor David Prior says that he and colleagues are “really excited that Dr Stirling has accepted this position”.

“Mark’s earthquake research spans a wide range of technologies and approaches in the Earth sciences. He brings new research directions and is the ideal person to draw together existing fault and earthquake expertise at Otago.”

The establishment of the Chair has been made possible through a number of very generous donations from both individuals and organisations.
