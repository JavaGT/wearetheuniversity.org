World Suicide Prevention Day: September 10

Research evidence points the way for suicide prevention

The theme of World Suicide Prevention Day this year is 'Suicide Prevention Across the Life Span' to emphasise that suicide occurs across all ages, and that evidence-based strategies need to be adopted internationally that recognise this fact.

World Suicide Prevention Day, Monday September 10, is an annual event sponsored by the International Association for Suicide Prevention (www.iasp.info) in association with the World Health Organisation.

\"There's a common misconception that suicide occurs mainly amongst young people and teenagers in New Zealand. This is out of date and not correct," says Associate Professor Annette Beautrais from the University of Otago's Canterbury Suicide Project. "International research shows that suicide is a problem across all age groups, particularly male adults over 24 years, and in some countries the highest rates are amongst those over 85 years."
