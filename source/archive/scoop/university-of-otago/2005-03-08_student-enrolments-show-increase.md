Student Enrolments Show Increase

University of Otago student enrolments for 2005 are up on last year’s figures, Vice-Chancellor David Skegg said today.

At a meeting of the University Council he presented preliminary figures that suggested an overall increase in enrolments of 2.9%, higher than the 2.4% the university had budgeted for.

The figures are preliminary, and it will be 31 March before more reliable numbers are available. Further enrolments are still being accepted which together with second semester enrolments will affect the final figures.

Although there is an overall growth, there has been a small decline in first year numbers, due mainly to the expected fall-off in international first year enrolments. The international student trend is being experienced nationwide.

“Strong growth in first year numbers over the last two years has contributed to overall gains in both domestic and international enrolments. The 2.9% growth represents an increase of 470 equivalent full-time students,” Professor Skegg said.
