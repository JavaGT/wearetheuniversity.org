Professor Hayne to continue as Vice-Chancellor for a further term

Tuesday 2 February 2016

Professor Harlene Hayne will continue in the role of Vice-Chancellor until 2021, after her contract was extended for a further term of five years, University Chancellor John Ward announced today.

“The University is in good heart under Professor Hayne’s capable stewardship, and the University Council is delighted that she has agreed to continue to serve as our Vice-Chancellor,” says Mr Ward.

“Professor Hayne has engaged in depth within the University but also on a much wider scale. She has very high expectations of both staff and students, has encouraged relationships with external academic partners and has activated capital expenditure projects to a level not seen before. Her commitment to the role and the vision she brings to it are readily apparent.”

Professor Hayne’s contract now extends through to August 2021.

Professor Hayne says the opportunity to continue in the role as Vice-Chancellor at the University is a “great privilege”.  
“I look forward to an outstanding 2016 and beyond. The University will continue to recruit and support the best and brightest staff and students from New Zealand and around the world,” she says.

“I am looking forward to the ongoing development of our campuses and facilities, not only here in Dunedin but also in Christchurch and Wellington. Perhaps most importantly, I am extremely pleased that I will be the Vice-Chancellor when the University of Otago celebrates its 150th birthday in 2019.”
