Dunedin School of Medicine celebrates inaugural Research Awards

The Dunedin School of Medicine is celebrating excellent research initiatives and medical researchers within the school and Otago District Health Board with the first annual research awards, where more than $700,000 of grants will be made.

“This is a unique opportunity for the Dunedin School of Medicine and the Otago District Health Board’s joint Research Advisory Group to make strategic distribution of research funds to maintain and build the high research profile of our organizations,” Research Advisory Group chairman Dr Andre van Rij says.

“The strategy for the investment is to firstly support to the school’s very successful and leading researchers, but also to encourage the up-and-coming researchers who have great ideas and potential and are going to be the Dunedin Medical School’s researchers of the future.

“The researchers have proposed some really great ideas for achieving this goal and this is where these additional funds need to go. They include building research groups in critical areas such as obesity in children, the better understanding of the biology of cancer, genetics of cardiovascular disease and looking at the social cost of alcohol abuse.”

There are five categories of awards, which will be presented to recipients at a ceremony at the University of Otago staff club starting at 5.30pm tonight. (Thursday)

Distinguished Researcher Awards

These awards support the highly regarded research outputs of the top researchers within the Dunedin School of Medicine. The Distinguished Researcher Award is worth $50,000 a year and may be renewed for up to three years, based on satisfactory annual reports. The applications were assessed on their potential long-term impact on the research group surrounding the distinguished researcher(s).

The Gil Barbezat Summer Studentship Prize

This $250 prize is for the best report from a student who undertook a summer research project supervised by Dunedin School of Medicine staff. The summer projects are funded by a variety of organisations and the project culminates in the writing of a six-page report. A panel of senior staff assessed the reports. Approximately half the projects are funded through the Otago Medical Research Foundation and those were not eligible for the Gil Barbezat as they have their own prize, which is awarded independently.
