The ASBP meeting (Dec 3) will focus on the growing international research into links between genetic make-up and behavioural and psychiatric disorders. It will also look at how genetic research is enabling improved treatment of psychiatric disorders through the targeting of specific medications (pharmacogenomics) to such conditions as depression. A number of leading clinicians and researchers will present papers on a wide range of topics outlined in the accompanying programme. International keynote speakers include Dr Robert Cloninger, Dr Kenneth Kendler, Dr Patrick Sullivan and Dr Cynthia Bulik.
