Professor of Economics appointed

Professor Ian King has been appointed to a Chair in Economics in the University of Otago’s School of Business.

Professor King joins the School of Business from the University of Auckland Business School where he was an Associate Professor in Economics.

University Vice-Chancellor David Skegg says Professor King is an outstanding academic, who will bring valuable experience to the School of Business.

“The Department of Economics at Otago is already very strong in research, and Professor King’s arrival will further strengthen its research base,” Professor Skegg says.

School of Business Dean David Buisson says Professor King is internationally renowned in his field and highly respected by his academic peers.

“He has published in many leading journals and brings to Otago expertise in a number of areas. In macroeconomics, for example, he is an authority on the relationships between growth, technological change and unemployment. He has also carried out valuable research on the job matching process in labour markets as well as the nature and role of public policy in open economies,” Professor Buisson says.

Professor King is Canadian. In addition to his work at the University of Auckland, he has served as Associate Professor at the University of Victoria, Canada, a visiting Associate Professor at the University of Iowa, US, and an Assistant Professor at the University of Calgary in Canada.

He has been on the editorial board of the Canadian Journal of Economics, is current editor of New Zealand Economic Papers and is a board member of the New Zealand Association of Economists and Centre for Macroeconomics (University of Melbourne).

Professor King will take up his Chair in October.
