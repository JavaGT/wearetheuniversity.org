First Ageing Well National Science Challenge contestable funding round opens

Thursday 7 April 2016

In keeping with the collaborative spirit of the National Science Challenges (NSCs), the University of Otago-led Ageing Well challenge has announced around $3.25 million in contestable funding to researchers throughout New Zealand.

The Ageing Well National Science Challenge is one of 11 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment-funded Challenges aimed at taking a more strategic approach to science investment.

Ageing Well NSC Director Professor David Baxter says in recognition of the specific challenges and opportunities faced by Māori and Pacific Peoples to age well, priority in the current finding round will be given to proposals focused on the ageing of Māori and Pacific Peoples.

“Applications for projects that are transformative and help to deliver the Challenge’s vision will be prioritised. We will encourage prospective projects that align with the mission-led nature of the Challenge” he says.

The vision of the challenge, first launched last March, is to push back disability thresholds to enable all New Zealanders to reach their full potential through life, with particular emphasis on the latter years of life.

“This funding round presents an opportunity to help fund research proposals that examine the distinctive needs, issues and challenges of Māori and Pacific peoples in relation to ageing well (Hauora/Oranga), and the incorporation of mātauranga Māori to support the overall Ageing Well mission (Mātauranga).”

The challenge is a collaboration between the Universities of Otago, Auckland, Canterbury, Massey, Waikato, Victoria and AUT, together with the Centre for Research Evaluation and Social Assessment and AgResearch.

The Contestable Round will follow a two-step process. Expressions of interest are due on 16 May. Full proposals will be invited from 30 June 2016 and must be submitted by 22 August 2016, with funding decisions announced by 28 October 2016. All research must be initiated by February 2017 and be completed by 30 June 2019.
