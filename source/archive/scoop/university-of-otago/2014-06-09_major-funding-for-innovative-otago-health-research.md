Major funding for innovative Otago health research

**Major funding for innovative Otago health research**

More than $31.3M in new health research funding has been awarded to Otago researchers to support a range of world-class studies aimed at improving New Zealanders’ health and well-being.

The latest Health Research Council of New Zealand annual funding round results were announced today. Otago researchers gained 24 contracts, including three major multi-million, five-year programmes, 14 projects and seven grants for emerging researchers. Otago’s successful applicants span the University’s campuses in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington and together gained the largest share of funding of any institution in this latest round.

One of the major programmes, led by Anatomy Professor David Grattan, will examine how the hormonal changes responsible for helping women’s brains adapt to pregnancy operate – and the serious complications that can occur for both mother and baby when these changes go awry.

Resulting conditions can include maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, pre-term labour and postnatal depression. Such adverse events can also have serious consequences on the baby, changing brain development and increasing life-long risk of many diseases, including obesity and mental illness.

Another programme, headed by Biochemistry Associate Professor Tony Merriman, aims to improve the understanding of the causes, treatment and prevention of gout by studying the complex interplay of genetic and environmental risk factors, such as alcohol and sugary drinks, in the development of this painful and debilitating disease. The researchers will also examine whether genetic makeup influences response to the standard gout drug, allopurinol.

The third programme extends the world-leading heart hormone discoveries by researchers at the University’s Christchurch Heart Institute. This research team, led by Professor Mark Richards, will evaluate markers for unmet needs in diagnosing and managing heart failure.

The team’s objectives include early detection of dangerous complications of heart failure—kidney injury and pneumonia—and fine-tuning of the use of markers to guide diagnosis and management of the overall condition.

The three programmes are funded at around $5M each over five years.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) Professor Richard Blaikie says he is delighted by the success of all the Otago recipients in this highly contested annual funding round.

“The breadth and depth of skills that are needed to contribute to high-quality health-related research is highlighted in these results. The lead researchers represent more than ten disciplines across three of Otago’s academic divisions, including—but not limited to—anatomy, biochemistry, general practice, human nutrition, marketing, medicine, pathology, pharmacy, psychology, public health, and women’s and children’s health. Many of the collaborative teams also have strong researchers trained in humanities and social science disciplines,” Professor Blaikie says.

It is also very pleasing to see that half of the 14 Emerging Researcher First Grants went to applicants from Otago, he adds.

“This shows that not only are the University’s well-established staff continuing to put forward excellent research proposals, their colleagues at an early-career stage are also becoming the research leaders of tomorrow,” he says.

One of the seven Emerging Researcher Grants goes towards a study examining whether eating bread made with either less salt or with increased levels of L-arginine from hazel nuts or nitrate from beetroot may be a simple and effective way to reduce high blood pressure.

Another grant involves developing a novel way to selectively target cancer cells for chemotherapy so that tumour-killing drugs are only released when such cells are identified, sparing healthy cells. Also among these grants is one that will focus on discovering why Maori suffer worse disability outcomes after injury.

The 14 Otago Project Grants range from basic biomedical investigations into the genetic regulation of brain stem cell development to devising interventions to improve health outcomes for patients suffering multiple diseases.

They focus on topics that include assessing an existing antidepressant as a pain treatment for knee osteoarthritis, and working towards a new therapy to raise levels of HDL (‘good’ cholesterol) to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

Other projects involve investigating the potential role of a tumour-suppressor gene variant in autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, and teasing out how the sex hormone AMH regulates female reproduction. Another will explore a new biological marker’s potential for diagnosing specific causes of anxiety disorders.

One Christchurch campus project aims to improve the diagnosis and treatment of Legionnaires’ disease in New Zealand, while another will use gene testing and brain imaging to attempt to find a way to predict the onset of cognitive decline in patients with Parkinson’s.

Among the public health-related projects are an evaluation of the effectiveness of New Zealand’s alcohol reform legislation and a comprehensive analysis by Wellington campus researchers of survey data to improve understanding of the impact of racial discrimination on adult health and wellbeing.
