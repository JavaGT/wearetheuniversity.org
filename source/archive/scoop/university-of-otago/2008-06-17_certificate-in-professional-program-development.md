The Grant Institute

Certificate in Professional Program Development and Grant Communication

will be held at the

University of Otago - Auckland Centre

July 28 - August 1, 2008

8:00 AM - 5:00 PM

The Grant Institute: Certificate in Professional Program Development and Grant Communication is a five-day intensive and interactive experience in which participants will be led through the program development, grant writing, and funding acquisition processes through the completion of four courses.  The Grant Institute is not a seminar.  Participants will actively engage in exercises and activities designed to strengthen their mastery of grant acquisition.   Through the completion of varying assignments, students will leave The Grant Institute with a real grant proposal outline complete with quality research, solid content, and expert review.  The Grant Institute focuses on combining the fundamentals of grant proposal writing with expert knowledge of communication principles such as Strategic Research, Persuasion, Argumentation, and Framing.

The Grant Institute trainers and consultants do not merely lecture participants, but act as personal consultants and coaches dedicated to encouraging participants to succeed beyond their own expectations.  While The Grant Institute uses collaboration and small groups for many exercises, each participant will work on their organization's pro ject.  Participants are not overwhelmed with negativity or discouragement, but will be given the highest level of expertise to generate confidence in pursuing any funding project.

At The Grant Institute , participants don't j ust learn to write grant proposals from top to bottom.   Participants become specialists in our unique area of expertise: Grant Communication.  Simply put, this is not your grandfather's grantwriting workshop.  Our graduates are strategic, innovative, and confident.   Whether you are new to professional grantwriting, or an experienced professional, you will not want to miss The Grant Institute.

The Grant Institute consists of four (4) courses that will be completed during the five-day workshop.

(1) Program Development and Evaluation

This course is centered around the belief that "it's all about the program."    This intensive course will teach professional program development essentials and program evaluation.  While most grantwriting "workshops" treat program development and evaluation as separate from the writing of a proposal, this class will teach students the relationship between overall program planning and all strategic communication, including grantwriting.  Consistent in our belief in grant communication, this class encourages students to understand successful program development and to think strategically about funding as an integral part of the overall program planning process.  This class turns students into experts by teaching how to take ideas and concepts and turn them into professionally developed programs.

(2) Advanced Grant Writing

Designed for both the novice and experienced grantwriter, this course will make each student an overall fundraising communication specialist.  In addition to teaching the basic components of a grant proposal, successful approaches, and the do's and don'ts of grantwriting, this course is infused with expert principles that will lead to a mastery of the process.  Strategy resides at the forefront of this course's intent to illustrate grantwriting as an integrated, multidimensional, and dynamic endeavor.  Each student will learn to stop writing the grant and to start writing the story.  Ultimately, this class will illustrate how each component of the grant proposal represents an opportunity to use proven techniques for generating support.  

(3) Strategic Grant Research

  
At its foundation, this course will address the basics of foundation, corporation, and government grant research.  However, this course will teach a strategic funding research approach that encourages students to see research not as something they do before they write a proposal, but as an integrated part of the grant seeking process.  Students will be exposed to online and database research tools, as well as publications and directories which contain information about foundation, corporation, and government grant opportunities.  Focusing on funding sources and basic social science research, this course teaches students how to use research as part of a strategic communication effort.

  
(4) Advanced Communication Strategies: Institute for Communication Improvement Persuasion and Argumentation Techniques

  
This course, designed by Institute for Communication Improvement, will provide students with an arsenal of advanced persuasion and argumentation techniques.  Centered around expert communication principles, this class will change the way students conceptualize grant proposals and other fundraising tools.   Students will leave this course with ICI's masterful methods and will be more than j ust confident grantwriters, but communication specialists.  This course is grounded on the idea that fundraising and nonprofit development represent profound communication activity.  Without question, this course is part of The Grant Institute difference.
