Commitment to Science Communication

Otago demonstrates commitment to Science Communication

  
The University of Otago’s new Centre for Science Communication is getting off to a strong start, with the appointment of a second professor in as many months.

In August, the University announced the appointment of Professor Lloyd Davis to the Stuart Chair in Science Communication. And now, Professor Jean Fleming joins him, as a Professor of Science Communication. Professor Fleming is returning to Otago, after three years in Australia as an academic with Griffith University’s School of Biomolecular and Physical Sciences.

The pair will form the core of New Zealand’s first Centre for Science Communication – which aims to engage with the New Zealand public and will also be home to a new Master of Science Communication programme.

University Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Sciences) Professor Vernon Squire says the University is delighted to be securing Professor Fleming.

“Professors Davis and Fleming have such strong backgrounds and their skill bases and experience are very complementary. Professor Fleming convened the highly-successful Hands on Science secondary school programme for more than five years and helped establish the International Science Festival in Dunedin in 1998. We are delighted to have her on board as part of this exciting new development.”

Professor Fleming says she is looking forward to returning to Otago. “I am really excited to be taking up this new position. For many years, I have tried to bring the magic of a life in science to those choosing their career path. Now, at a time when the planet is facing climate change and resource limitations, a new generation of scientifically-literate New Zealanders will be needed if we are to meet the challenges ahead.

“I believe everyone, not just professional scientists, needs to be able to understand the basic science behind issues such as global warming, stem cell technology and alternative energy possibilities. The Centre for Science Communication will stimulate a vibrant interaction between scientists and society.”

She says the speed at which science progresses is such that scientists have difficulty keeping up with developments, even in their specialist areas, let alone the general public.

The new Master of Science Communication programme will generate the skilled people needed to make the interactions between science and society a great deal easier, Professor Fleming says.

“More than ever, there is a need to encourage people to take up a career in science and to strengthen the links between science and society. In addition, Science Communication allows a place for discussion and feedback between public and scientists. It’s not just a case of scientists telling the public what they are doing. It also involves the public expressing their concerns and feelings about science, for instance, which developments are exciting and which issues evoke concern.”

University Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg says the creation of the Centre for Science Communication was significant, but the appointment of two professors underlines the University’s commitment to science communication.

“Appointing Professors Davis and Fleming signals that this centre will be a very strong and effective channel for science communication, both nationally and internationally.”

Professor Fleming’s time will be split between the Centre for Science Communication and the Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology, where her own laboratory will be based.

Background information:

Brief biography – Professor Jean Fleming  
Professor Fleming was formerly an Associate Professor in the Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology at the University of Otago. She returns to Otago after a period at the Eskitis Institute for Cell and Molecular Therapies and School of Biomolecular & Physical Sciences at Griffith University in Australia.  
Professor Fleming’s research and publications are in the area of molecular reproduction and endocrinology. She was one of four people – and the only scientist – appointed to New Zealand’s Royal Commission on Genetic Modification. The commission’s 14-month inquiry was regarded as the most extensive yet to be held anywhere in the world.

She has a strong interest in encouraging the involvement of women in science, their approach to research and their support networks.

Professor Fleming was involved with 10 of the University of Otago’s annual “Hands-on Science” Schools, five as convenor. Hands-On Science gives promising high school students from around New Zealand a week of practical experience in research science.

She served as president of the Otago Institute Inc (a branch of the Royal  
Society of New Zealand) between 1997 and 1998, and chaired the programme  
committee of the inaugural International Science Festival in Dunedin in 1998.  
That same year, she received the Royal Society’s New Zealand Science and Technology Medal in recognition of her contributions. In 2002, she became an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her services to science.
