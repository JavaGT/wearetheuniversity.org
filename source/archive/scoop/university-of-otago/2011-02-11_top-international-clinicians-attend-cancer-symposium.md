The University of Otago, Wellington is hosting a major Inaugural International Cancer Symposium which will see a stellar cast of overseas and New Zealand cancer experts in the capital city over the coming week, from Sunday 13 to Saturday February 19.  
   
The Symposium has attracted over 80 speakers from the USA, UK, Australia and New Zealand. These include 26 medical staff from the internationally renowned Mayo Clinic in the United States, who will deliver presentations and teaching sessions in haematology and oncology  
   
International cancer experts will cover sessions on cancers of the lung, head, neck, gastrointestinal tract and melanoma; end of life/palliative care, scientific advances and the controversial role of tobacco control in cancer prevention will also be addressed in this wide ranging conference.  
   
The Symposium will be opened on the Sunday evening with an address by the Ambassador of the United States, Mr David Huebner.  
   
On Monday afternoon (12.30pm-2pm) the Minister of Health, the Hon. Tony Ryall will launch changes to improve the NZ Cancer Registry, supported by comment from a panel of clinicians.  
   
The six day conference opens on Sunday 13 February with a series of leading speakers presenting on the latest developments for the treatment of multiple myeloma, or cancer of the blood. Other areas focusing on the treatment and management of haematologic conditions will be discussed over the next two days.  
   
Key presentations from  the Mayo Clinic will include Professor Philip Greipp on “The Staging of Multiple Myeloma” which will discuss a system developed by Prof. Greipp and now used around the world, and Assistant Professor Joseph Mikhael who will speak on “The Management of Renal Problems and Bone Disease.”  
   
Wellington’s Malaghan Institute will also present the latest research into haematologic malignancies on Tuesday afternoon starting at 1pm.  
   
One of the major highlights of the symposium on Tuesday evening will be Mayo Professor Ed Creagan’s dynamic presentation on “Professional Burnout-The Hidden Cost of Health Care”. Professor Creagan is also the best selling author of ‘How not to be my patient, a physician’s secrets for staying healthy and surviving any diagnosis’, and will deliver a presentation on this topic on Wednesday at 3.35pm.

“The Role of Tobacco Control in Cancer Prevention” is the concluding theme for Saturday. The keynote address, “Treating Tobacco Dependence” by Professor Richard Hurt, director of the Mayo Clinic Nicotine Dependence Centre, will provide new insights into combating nicotine addiction at a time when major changes are taking place in tobacco control in New Zealand.  
   
Professor Hurt will also deliver a provocative address on Saturday afternoon entitled “Big Tobacco CEOs – Smuggling, Marketing to Women and Children, and Invading Developing Countries”.
