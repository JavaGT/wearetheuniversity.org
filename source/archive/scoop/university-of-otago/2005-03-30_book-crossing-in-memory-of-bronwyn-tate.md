Book Crossing in Memory of Bronwyn Tate

Book Crossing in Memory of Bronwyn Tate, New Zealand Writer & Teacher

New Zealand books will be popping up in all sorts of places during the first week of May. These books are being 'released into the wild' in a book crossing to honour author and teacher Bronwyn Tate, who died in Palmerston North on 25 February.

A book crossing is a way of sharing books by leaving them in public places for other people to pick up and read. 'It is a particularly appropriate tribute to a woman who was very committed to New Zealand books,' says organiser Lisa Emerson. 'Bronwyn promoted them whenever she could. She was an inspiration to many emerging writers, a woman of great humour, and a vital voice in New Zealand writing.'

Bronwyn Tate's first novel, Leaving for Townsville, was published in 1997 and greeted with critical acclaim. Russian Dolls (1999), Halfway to Africa (2002) and Lily's Cupola (2003) soon followed. A fifth novel was completed shortly before her death, and will be published at a later date. Also the author of a number of published and broadcast short stories, Bronwyn Tate taught creative writing at Massey University from 2002, and reviewed New Zealand fiction for a variety of publications.

Participants in this book crossing are being encouraged to choose either one of Bronwyn Tate's books or a novel by another New Zealand author. Organisers hope this will encourage people to read more New Zealand fiction. Books will be labelled to identify them as part of a book crossing and released in a public place (a café, an airport or bus station, for example) for someone else to pick up. When they have finished the book, they release it again in another place.

People interested in participating in the book crossing should contact Lisa Emerson, L.Emerson@massey.ac.nz, phone 06 356 999 ext 2601. Bronwyn Tate's novels are published by University of Otago Press.
