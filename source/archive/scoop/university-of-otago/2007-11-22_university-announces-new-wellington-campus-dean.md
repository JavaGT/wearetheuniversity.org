University announces new Wellington campus Dean

The University of Otago has appointed Professor Peter Crampton as Dean and Head of Campus at the University of Otago Wellington.

Professor Crampton is currently Professor and Head of the Department of Public Health at the University of Otago Wellington. He replaces Professor John Nacey, who has completed nine years as Dean of the Wellington campus.

Professor Crampton – an Otago graduate – started his career in general practice and become involved in public health and policy from early on. His PhD, awarded in 2001, concentrated on the role of the non-profit sector in providing primary health care services to vulnerable populations. In 2002/2003, he spent 12 months at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, after being awarded a Harkness Fellowship in Health Policy.

He has worked in Otago’s Department of Public Health in Wellington since 1996 and was appointed Professor and Head in 2004. His current research is focused on social indicators and social epidemiology, health care policy, and primary health care organisation and funding.

Professor Crampton says he is looking forward to taking up the position in the new year.

“My interest in the Dean’s role is a reflection of the University’s vision as a research-led institution of international standing. Within the University, the Wellington campus has huge strengths and committed staff. And it has unique opportunities within the University, because of its strong presence in the capital city.

“I have a very strong foundation to work from, thanks to the work done by Professor Nacey during the past decade.”

Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg also paid tribute to Professor Nacey’s contribution. He says that Professor Crampton was selected from a strong field of national and international candidates, and will be an ideal person to lead the University’s Wellington campus.

“As an experienced member of Otago’s Wellington campus, an excellent researcher and a first-rate teacher, Professor Crampton brings many valuable skills and qualities to the position. His leadership ability has been recognised for some time and I am looking forward to the contributions he will make to the University in this new role.”

Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Don Roberton says he is delighted with the appointment. “Professor Crampton brings an extensive knowledge of health and its needs to this position. He has a strong interest in curriculum development and postgraduate teaching and training. He also has a very strong research record.

“We are very fortunate to recruit him to this position. It will be a great pleasure to work with him to further develop the strengths of the School that have been so ably developed by his predecessor Professor John Nacey.

Capital and Coast District Health Board chair Dr Judith Aitken says the appointment signals further opportunities for relationships to develop between the board and University.

“It also allows us to benefit from the excellent leadership that Professor Crampton has already demonstrated in the field of public health, public policy and education.”

Dr Aitken says the board recently took part in a workshop run by Professor Crampton on inequities in the public health system. “It was clear from that day that he is a teacher of extraordinary ability and we are looking forward to working with him in the future.”
