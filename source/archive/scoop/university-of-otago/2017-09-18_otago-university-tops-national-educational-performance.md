**University of Otago tops national educational performance measures**

The University of Otago has topped every one of the latest key Government indicators measuring the educational performance of students at New Zealand’s universities.

Released today by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), the annual Educational Performance Indicators (EPIs) examine course and qualification completions, overall and first year retention rates and progression to higher levels of study. Having been top in all but one of the indicators last year, Otago has now completed a clean sweep by ranking first across all of the key measures.

Otago Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne welcomed the release of the latest indicators, which assess performance over the 2016, this being most recent complete academic year.

“The University of Otago has always rated very highly in the TEC’s annual educational performance indicators, but to rank top in every one of those indicators is an unprecedented achievement. It is a stellar result for Otago, and highlights not only the excellence of our academic staff and teaching and learning environment that the University offers students, but also the commitment Otago students put into achieving to their full potential.”

**Otago’s showing in the 2016 TEC performance measures:**  
• Student progression rate to higher level study (96 per cent)  
• First-year retention rate (84 per cent)  
• Overall student retention (90 per cent)  
• Qualification completion rate (85 per cent)  
• Qualification completion rate - cohort-based (73 per cent)  
• Course completion rate (89 per cent)
