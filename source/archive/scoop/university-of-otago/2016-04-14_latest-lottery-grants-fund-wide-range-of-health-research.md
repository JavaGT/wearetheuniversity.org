**Latest Lottery grants fund wide range of Otago health research**

University of Otago researchers have been awarded around $1.7M in funding from the Lottery Grants Board to support studies focusing on improving New Zealanders’ health.

The grants support the purchase of research equipment, scholarships, and the pursuit of research projects that translate into meaningful health outcomes and community benefit.

Researchers from across the University’s three main campuses in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington have received 19 translational research grants, and six equipment grants. A full list appears below.

Dr Philippa McDowall (Paediatrics, Wellington) also received a $98,805 Postdoctoral Fellowship in the funding round, while Dr Tristram Ingham (Medicine, Wellington) gained a $105,000 PhD Scholarship.

Nationally, 42 project and equipment grants in the Lottery Health Research 2015/2016 funding round were supported with a total of $2.6M being distributed.

Otago’s new translational research projects involve a wide variety of health-related topics. They range from developing a better model of Alzheimer’s disease to developing wool-derived proteins as bone graft substitutes to assessing the fairness of decision making in the NZ Health Sector.

Also among the projects are studies on topics such as investigations into a potential new target in treating cardiovascular disease, New Zealand’s gun control policy, and high-intensity interval training in type 2 diabetes.
