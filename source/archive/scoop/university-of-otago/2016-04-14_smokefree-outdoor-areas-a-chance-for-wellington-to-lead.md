Smokefree outdoor areas: A chance for Wellington to lead
========================================================

**Smokefree outdoor areas: A chance for Wellington to lead**

**Associate Professor George Thomson, ASPIRE 2025, UOW**

This seminar will present evidence from the Smokefree Wellington project, a case study on ways to advance outdoor Smokefree policies in urban areas.  
New smokefree outdoor area policies provide an opportunity for Wellington City to lead New Zealand, and bring the city into a world focus. New Zealand cities have fallen behind many major English-speaking cities around the Pacific-rim,  
which have much more advanced outdoor Smokefree policies. Findings indicate that the hospitality industry was divided in their knowledge of and attitudes to outdoor smokefree areas.

**George Thomson** is an Associate Professor in the Public Health Department at the University of Otago, Wellington, and a member of the ASPIRE 2025 research group.  
His current research interests include the policy process for smokefree outdoor areas, signage for smokefree areas, and the ethics of tobacco taxation and smokefree outdoor areas.

**Friday 15th April 12.30 to 1.30**  
**Small Lecture Theatre, Level D, University of Otago Wellington**  
**23A Mein Street, Newtown, Wellington**

**ALL WELCOME**
