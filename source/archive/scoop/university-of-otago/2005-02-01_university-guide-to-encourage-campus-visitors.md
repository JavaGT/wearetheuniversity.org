University Publishes Guide To Encourage Campus Visitors

Otago University has published a Visitor’s Guide to encourage people to visit its campus and help them find their way around.

Marketing & Communications Director Phil McKenzie says Otago is justly proud of its campus, with its river setting, established trees and gardens, artworks, and mix of historic buildings and modern architecture.

“The University is a public place and we welcome visitors, whether they are tourists, returning alumni, or Dunedin locals. But the campus is large and can be a bit over-whelming, so the idea behind the Visitor’s Guide was to provide a map and route to follow as well as explaining points of interest along the way,” says Mr McKenzie.

Otago was New Zealand’s first university and has occupied its present site in north Dunedin since 1879. It now covers more than 20 city blocks.

“The University has grown considerably in recent years. While the magnificent old buildings at the heart of the campus haven’t changed, someone who was here even 10 years ago will find a lot that’s new since then. The award-winning Information Services Building, in particular, has made a significant difference to the campus and has become a focus for students and staff. This was completed in 2001 and houses the library as well as a number of other student services along with shops and cafes.

“The mix of historic and new buildings, and the fact that we have stayed on the same central site, has allowed Otago to retain its character and traditions while still growing to meet increased demand. The University is very much a part of Dunedin and we’d like to think that locals feel welcome to use and enjoy the campus and that tourists put it on their ‘must visit’ list,” he says.

The Visitor Guide is free and available from the Dunedin Visitor Centre in the Octagon and the University library.
