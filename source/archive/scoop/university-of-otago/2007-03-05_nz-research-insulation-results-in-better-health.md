NZ Research Shows Insulating Houses Results in Better Health

Houses occupied by low income earners have been put under the microscope by University of Otago researchers, and it’s been clearly demonstrated for the first time that when homes are properly insulated there are significant health gains.

The research from the Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences is the cover story in the latest issue of the prestigious British Medical Journal (BMJ), and the results are being hailed as a robust groundbreaking study by its editors.

The BMJ see this as important research as it establishes clear scientific evidence of links between warm homes and good health.

Using community-based randomised control methodology the Otago University researchers divided 1350 houses from low income communities in the North Island into two groups. The first did not have insulation, while the second group of houses had a standard insulation package, including ceiling insulation and draught stopping around doors and windows. The sample had a much higher proportion of Maori/Polynesian participants than in the general population.

“The results are clear and our research is very robust because of the size of the sample and the randomised methodology, “says project leader Professor Philippa Howden-Chapman. “ This is the first time that there has been such a clear and demonstrable link between housing and health and it gives a strong evidence-base on the best way to retro-fit our old, cold and unhealthy housing.”

The study found insulation resulted in a 30% reduction in the frequency with which occupants were exposed to temperatures below 10 degrees C; mean relative humidity causing dampness, down by 3.8%, and decreased energy consumption with insulated houses used 81% of energy of non-insulated. The last factor may also result in greater disposable income, which can be spent on food and clothes.

These results show significant improvements (10 -11%) in the health and quality of life of the occupants. Importantly it was reported that adults and children have reduced wheezing, colds and respiratory problems (40- 50% reduction). People living in insulated houses are also less likely to take days off work and school (40-50% reduction) than people in houses without insulation. There were also fewer visits to GPs and fewer hospital admissions for respiratory conditions.

“By focusing on improving and retrofitting existing houses in low income communities in New Zealand we have shown we can also reduce health inequalities,” says Professor Howden-Chapman. “This is very cost effective as the health-benefits exceed the actual cost of fixing the houses by a ratio of almost 2:1; a significant finding. “

This means that for every dollar spent on insulating old, cold houses, there is close to a two dollar benefit in terms of health saving from not ending up in hospital, or in less time off work or school. In addition people in warm houses are less likely to shift houses, with positive benefits for children’s education.

Professor Howden-Chapman says these results are now being recognised by authorities in NZ. Recently she helped launch the innovative Healthy Housing Taranaki initiative where multiple agencies have come together to fund the insulation of 10,000 low income houses over the next decade.(33% of houses nationally have no insulation).

This research backs up concerns in the UK about housing and health,that have resulted in a new Health and Safety Rating Scheme for houses. This has highlighted that damp, cold buildings are home hazards that have the greatest impact on the health of whole communities.

This scheme is now included in UK legislation and guides the retrofitting of improvements to all older homes. It lists some 29 hazards in homes which can and do have health impacts.

Professor Howden-Chapman is now working with BRANZ and agencies in NZ to try to get similar changes in this country regarding health and homes.
