Landfall Essay Competition Announced

The Landfall Essay Competition, New Zealand's most prestigious essay competition, is being held again in 2006.

The competition encourages writers to think aloud about New Zealand culture, and aims to sustain the tradition of vivid, contentious and creative essay writing that has appeared in Landfall's pages.

Writers are free to choose a topic of their interest, and it is anticipated that entries will provide commentary on a wide range of issues. Essays are to be original and fully developed works no more than 6000 words long.

The prize is $2500 and a year's subscription to Landfall. The winning essay will appear in Landfall 212, published in November 2006.

Former winners have been Gregory O'Brien (1997), C.K. Stead and Peter Wells (1999), Patrick Evans and Kapka Kassabova (2002), and Tze Ming Mok and Martin Edmund (2004).

Otago University Press, Landfall's publisher and the competition's sponsor, will accept entries from 1 May to 16 June 2006. Conditions of entry can be obtained from the Press.
