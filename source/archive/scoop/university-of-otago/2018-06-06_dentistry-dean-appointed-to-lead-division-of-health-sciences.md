**Dentistry Dean appointed to lead Division of Health Sciences**

Dean of the University of Otago’s Faculty of Dentistry, Professor Paul Brunton, has been appointed Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division of Health Sciences.

He will follow Professor Peter Crampton who announced late last year that he was going to step down from his roles as Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division of Health Sciences and Dean of the Otago Medical School.

Vice-Chancellor Harlene Hayne says Professor Brunton has cemented the Faculty of Dentistry’s status as a centre of excellence for research, education and healthcare. She is delighted he will continue his outstanding leadership within the Division of Health Sciences.

“Professor Brunton has had an outstanding record as a researcher, teacher and senior administrator and I am looking forward to him continuing this work in the Division of Health Sciences,” Professor Hayne says.

A former British dental researcher and educator, Professor Brunton arrived in New Zealand in January 2015 to take up the role of Dean of the Faculty of Dentistry. He had previously been Director of Student Education at the University of Leeds’ School of Dentistry.

A huge focus in his three and a-half years in the Faculty of Dentistry has been overseeing the planning and development of a new building and he is pleased that the project is well on track to become a feature of the University’s health precinct.

However, it is his relationships with people and changes he has made in structures within the Faculty of Dentistry where he has made his mark as a leader.

“I have enjoyed leading and working with a wonderful group of colleagues and increasing the Faculty’s international presence and standing,” Professor Brunton says.

He is however, looking forward to a new challenge moving into a broader role leading the Division of Health Sciences, which incorporates the Faculty of Dentistry, the Otago Medical School (including the Dunedin School of Medicine, the Christchurch and Wellington campuses), School of Pharmacy, School of Physiotherapy, School of Biomedical Sciences, Bioethics Centre and the divisional office.

“I relish a new challenge and it is a privilege to lead the division through what I believe is going to be a period of unprecedented change with significant infrastructure projects being developed alongside a new hospital planned for Dunedin.”

Professor Brunton will take up his new role on Monday, 2 July.

Professor Crampton says he is delighted to learn that Professor Brunton is his successor.

“It will be my privilege to hand over the reins to Paul with the knowledge that the Division will be in excellent hands,” Professor Crampton says.

“I am confident he will find the role as enjoyable, interesting and rewarding as I have.”

Professor Crampton will continue in his role as Dean of the Otago Medical School in the immediate future until Professor Brunton has time to appoint his successor.

When he steps down from this role, Professor Crampton will remain at the University of Otago, teaching and researching in his area of expertise.
