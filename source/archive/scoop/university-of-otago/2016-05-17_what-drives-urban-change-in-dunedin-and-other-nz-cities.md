What drives urban change in Dunedin and other NZ cities?

**What drives urban change in Dunedin and other New Zealand cities?**

The first of five public seminars around the country will be held in Dunedin this Wednesday to present research and views on what drives urban change in New Zealand — problems and solutions.

Last year the NZ Centre for Sustainable Cities, which is hosted by the University of Otago, Wellington, released the research in a report “Drivers of Urban Change” within the MBIE-funded Resilient Urban Futures Programme. It brought together views of decision-makers and new research about what drives urban change in New Zealand.

“While cities face common themes and issues, each city also has diverse and specific challenges,” says Professor Philippa Howden-Chapman, from the University of Otago, Wellington, one of the authors and Director of the NZ Centre for Sustainable Cities.

“We looked at how our cities and towns can provide a desirable, prosperous, socially inclusive, healthy and environmentally sustainable way of life,’ she says.

In the Dunedin seminar, speakers Professor Philippa Howden-Chapman, Dunedin Mayor Dave Cull, researchers Dr Lucy Telfar-Barnard and Donna Matahaere-Atariki will talk about issues raised in the report such as compact versus dispersed urban development, infrastructure renewal, resilient urban transport patterns and healthy, affordable housing.

“Dunedin like the other cities faces challenges such as climate change and how to achieve resilience and sustainability in the face of the increasing pace of climate change. The Dunedin City Council is taking the initiative to address some of these issues. In 2014 the Council participated in a national trial of a housing warrant of fitness and is currently working with researchers as to how best to implement it,” says Professor Howden-Chapman.

The seminar will be held at lunchtime on Wednesday 18 May at the Civic Centre at the Octagon. For further details, please see http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/events/otago610398.html
