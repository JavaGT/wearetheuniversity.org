Response to “New Atheists” focus of conference
==============================================

**Response to “New Atheists” focus of conference**

A conference focusing on how Christians should respond to the strident “New Atheism” movement that has emerged in recent years will be held at the University of Otago early next month.

The New Atheists, whose prominent figures include scientist Richard Dawkins and author Christopher Hitchens, claim that believers in ‘the god hypothesis’ should not be tolerated, but should be actively countered and the ‘shoddy’ arguments supporting their beliefs should be exposed. Such leaders among the New Atheists have launched a broadside against all religious beliefs, but have given special attention to the claims of Christianity.

The two-day conference, titled “The New Atheism - A Christian Response”, is being jointly organised by the University of Otago and the Faraday Institute for Science and Religion at the Cambridge University. The event features presentations by leading philosophers, scientists and theologians from New Zealand and overseas who will critically examine the New Atheists’ claims from several perspectives.

The conference runs from the evening of Friday 2 September until late afternoon on Saturday at St Margaret’s College on the University campus.

Participants will explore questions such as: How should Christians respond to the New Atheism? Are the central claims of Christianity reasonable? Do the New Atheists have a new case to be answered or are they dressing up old arguments?

Conference organising committee member Professor Peter Anstey says all interested people are welcome to register for the event.
