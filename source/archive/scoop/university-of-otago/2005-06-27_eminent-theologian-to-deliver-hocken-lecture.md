Eminent Theologian to deliver Hocken Lecture on God in 20th Century New Zealand

Eminent theologian and Emeritus Professor, the Rev Lloyd Geering from Victoria University will be delivering this year’s annual Hocken Lecture entitled God in 20th Century New Zealand: a personal perspective, on Tuesday, July 12.

Hocken Librarian Stuart Strachan, says Professor Geering is one of the most important thinkers, writers and teachers about God and Christianity in contemporary New Zealand. He is well-known and in constant demand as a lecturer and as a commentator on religion and related matters on both television and radio.

Mr Strachan says Professor Geering’s lecture, will be partly autobiographical in nature.

In 1966, he published an article on "The Resurrection of Jesus" and, in 1967, another on "The Immortality of the Soul," which together sparked a two-year public, theological controversy that culminated in charges before the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand—of which he is an ordained minister—of doctrinal error and disturbing the peace of the church. After a dramatic, two-day televised trial, the Church’s General Assembly judged that no doctrinal error had been proved, dismissed the charges and declared the case closed.

Professor Geering was made Principal Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit topping New Zealand's New Year's honours list for 2001. He was previously honoured in 1988 as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He is also the author of several books, including Tomorrow's God (reprint 2000), The World to Come: From Christian Past to Global Future (1999), and Christian Faith at the Crossroads: A Map of Modern Religious History (2001, a revision of Faith's New Age).

He qualified with first class Master’s Honours in Maths from the University of Otago in 1939 and then went to Knox Theological College where he completed a Bachelor of Divinity with Honours in 1946.

The annual lecture is open to the public and will be held in the Castle 1 Lecture Theatre at 5.30pm.

Mr Strachan says the Hocken Collections has been holding its annual lectures since 1969.
