**Prestigious Marsden Fund backs world-class Otago research**

University of Otago researchers have gained more than $13.9M in new government funding to pursue 22 world-class research projects at the forefront of their disciplines.

Their innovative projects are being supported through the Royal Society of New Zealand-administered Marsden Fund, which is regarded as a hallmark of excellence that allows the country’s best researchers to explore their ideas and showcase them internationally.

Researchers from across the University’s divisions of Health Sciences, Humanities and Sciences will lead the new projects, which include 16 standard projects and six ‘Fast-Start’ projects designed to support outstanding researchers early in their careers.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research & Enterprise) Professor Richard Blaikie warmly congratulated Otago’s latest Marsden recipients, who together gained one-quarter of the $55.65M available in this year’s round. In total, 101 contracts were distributed among six universities, two CRIs and three other research institutes.

“I am delighted by these researchers’ success in what is an extremely competitive funding round. Nationally, only 8.3 percent of the 1222 preliminary proposals received were ultimately funded,” says Professor Blaikie.

The Fund’s backing of proposals developed by staff across diverse disciplines at the University reflects the breadth and depth of Otago’s research effort, he says.

The new projects are being led by researchers from the University’s Departments of Anatomy, Anthropology &Archaeology, Applied Sciences, Biochemistry, Botany, Geology, History & Art History, Mathematics & Statistics, Microbiology & Immunology, its National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, Pathology (Christchurch), Physiology, and Zoology.

Professor Blaikie says the researchers’ investigations cover a broad range of topics within the mathematical, physical, environmental, biological, biomedical and social sciences.

One project will focus on unlocking the 80-million-year-old secrets of New Zealand’s flora and fauna by making opaque kauri amber transparent to reveal the fossilised life within.

Several projects involve investigations at the frontiers of neuroscience, including studying impairment-causing changes in brain cell connectivity after strokes, the potential role of the so-called ‘love hormone’ oxytocin in blocking stress hormone release, and delving into the function of a newly identified neuronal circuit involved in the brain’s regulation of fertility.

Another will provide the first comprehensive analysis of the history and use of the coconut as a commodity in the Pacific. The study will explore the impacts of the production and consumption of this versatile natural product upon individual communities and their culture, and economies and environment within the Pacific and beyond.

The six ‘Fast-Starts’ going to Otago early-career researchers include projects that explore native and introduced fish interactions, earthquake fault mechanisms, and how Maori adapted their traditional Pacific dress forms to suit their new home in Aotearoa.

Also included among the fast-starts is a study of the sensing proteins the Kiwifruit pathogen _Psa_ uses to detect specific chemicals in its environment.
