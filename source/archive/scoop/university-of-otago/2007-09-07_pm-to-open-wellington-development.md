Prime Minister to open University of Otago Wellington development

The Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Helen Clark, will open the University of Otago Wellington’s new development on Tuesday (11 September).

The project involved a 1200-square-metre addition and the rebuilding of 2600 square metres on the ground and first floors of the existing medical school building. The $17.9m development came in $2m under budget.

Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg says he is delighted with the result. “The University of Otago Wellington is a long-standing part of the Newtown community, through the medical school, yet it’s been somewhat hidden. This upgrade has created a more accessible reception and entry area to the medical school, which clearly identifies it within the Newtown and Wellington Hospital landscape.
