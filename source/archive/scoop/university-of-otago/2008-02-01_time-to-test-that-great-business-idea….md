Time to test that great business idea…

Time to test that great business idea…

  
The University of Otago’s Enterprise Office and partners are providing a forum for Dunedinites to lay their good business ideas bare, when it hosts its “Bear Baiting” competition on 26 March.

Competition organiser, Marketing Enterprise Manager Lisa Scott says the idea came about after discussions with Dunedin’s other entrepreneurial operators – Upstart Business Incubator, KickStart, the Dunedin City Council (DCC) Economic Development Unit and the University’s Chair in Entrepreneurship.

“Bear Baiting is your chance to put your good idea to the test. How often do you get the chance to have four experts critique your proposal and give you their view on its chances of success?”

The judges are NBR publisher and Dragon’s Den judge Barry Colman, Upstart Chief Executive Norman Evans, DCC Business Development Unit Manager Peter Harris and AbacusBio Managing Director Peter Fennessy.

And the name? “It’s a play on words – baiting the grumpy bears, laying yourself bare – and lent itself to a great mental image,” Ms Scott says. We think this will be a fun way for entrepreneurial types to test their metal, not to mention great entertainment for the live audience.

The top six entries will be selected for grilling on the night, with each taking the floor to “sell” their idea to the judges.

The competition is open to anybody – not just University of Otago students – and first prize is $5000 worth of free business advice.

Registration is free and forms can be found at www.otago.ac.nz/bearbaiting. Entries close 10 March.
