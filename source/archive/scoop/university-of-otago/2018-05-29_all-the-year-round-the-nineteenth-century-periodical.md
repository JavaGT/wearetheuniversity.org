**All the Year Round: Exploring the Nineteenth-Century Periodical**

Nineteenth-century periodicals were the television of their day. They offered riveting serials, lifestyle recommendations, vivid illustrations by leading artists, and the inevitable advertising. They were shared among readers, who discussed their contents avidly and sometimes read them aloud to local audiences.

_All the Year Round: Exploring the Nineteenth-Century Periodical_ tells the story of the rise of the British periodical. The exhibition runs from 15 June to 31 August 2018 in Dunedin at the de Beer Gallery, Special Collections, the University of Otago.

The exhibition charts the rapid expansion of periodical publication from the early years of the nineteenth century, when writers like Lord Byron and John Keats were reviewed and reviled, to the last decades of Queen Victoria’s reign, when ‘decadent’ journals caused controversy, the _Boy’s Own_ and _Girl’s Own Paper_catered to an expanding young readership, and Sherlock Holmes’s appearance in _The Strand_ inspired a devoted following across all classes.

_All the Year Round_ takes its title from Charles Dickens’s weekly journal, which reached tens of thousands of readers and featured many of his now classic novels. The exhibition’s strongest presence comes from the satirical London journal _Punch_, whose columns and cartoons mocked prominent politicians and celebrities and shaped middle-class attitudes. Colonial spinoffs, like _Otago Punch_, soon spread across the British Empire.
