Scientists Work On Aotearoa’s Own Wellbeing Diet
================================================

_Joint University of Otago and University of Auckland media release:_

**Kiwi scientists are developing an Aotearoa New Zealand wellbeing diet, He Rourou Whai Painga, aimed at tackling diabetes and other metabolic diseases.**

A team of researchers is developing a uniquely Aotearoa New Zealand wellbeing diet, He Rourou Whai Painga, they hope will tackle diabetes, heart and other noncommunicable diseases.

Their goal is to develop a ‘New Zealand’ dietary pattern, consisting chiefly of locally produced foods that reflect our unique environment and can improve the health of our communities.

“We know we have great quality produce in New Zealand, and this is an exciting opportunity to show that, when combined in a whole diet, with a focus on on plant-based foods, such as vegetables, legumes, fruits, whole grains and cereals, nuts and seeds, olive oil and a moderate intake of seafood, our foods improve health and wellbeing of people at risk of diabetes and heart disease,” says endocrinologist Professor Jeremy Krebs at the University of Otago in Wellington.

Led by the University of Otago, the scientists are from the universities of Otago and Auckland, as well as a number of other institutes and organisations, and in collaboration with food and beverage industry partners. The $4 million project is part of the High-Value Nutrition Science Challenge, which is based in the University of Auckland’s Liggins Institute. See He Rourou Whai Painga.

“We have a unique opportunity to show that consumption of a healthy dietary pattern based on predominantly New Zealand-produced foods and beverages can improve health, providing strong scientific evidence that can be used to grow our local economy through growing the domestic and export consumption of our products,” says High-Value Nutrition Challenge director Joanne Todd.

The study will recruit 200 participants across four centres (Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington and Kokiri Marae in Lower Hutt). To find out about participating, visit hrwp.co.nz.

“People don’t eat in isolation, so this study uses a whānau-based intervention approach to help individuals and their families to try new foods and recipes and move their diets to a more healthy pattern,” Krebs says.

The 200 participants will receive targeted nutrition support, including guidance on food preparation, recipe ideas and social media groups to connect with other study participants in their community.

He Rourou Whai Painga will provide approximately 75 percent of the family’s food for 12 weeks.

Participants will be assessed 12 months after they first enrol, with whānau included in key measurements.

The goal of the study is improved health, rather than weight loss, although that could be a benefit.

As part of the research, the team has developed a ‘metabolic index’ or metabolic syndrome Z score. This has been used overseas but is now validated in New Zealand. It includes waist circumference, blood sugars, cholesterol, blood pressure and triglycerides.

The 11 National Science Challenges were chosen by the government in consultation with the public. They aim to pull together scientists and industries to solve some of the country’s tough issues.

*   There will be an **official launch for He Rourou Whai Painga in Wellington on Monday 18 July** to be attended by scientists, industry representatives and the media (for the morning).  
     
*   Professor Gary Evans, Chief Science Advisor for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), is attending and speaking at the launch.
