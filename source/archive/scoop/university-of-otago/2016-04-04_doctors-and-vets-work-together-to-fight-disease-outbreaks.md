A novel approach to fighting infectious disease outbreaks that has doctors and vets working together:

**One Health: A global approach to tackling infectious diseases.**  
Wednesday 6 April, 7 – 8pm in the Rolleston Lecture Theatre, University of Otago, Christchurch, 2 Riccarton Ave on Christchurch Hospital campus.

**_One Health recognises the links between humans, other animals and the environment, and is gaining momentum in the fight against infectious diseases._**

Professor Murdoch will discuss the use of One Health principles (recognising that the health of humans and animals, and viability of ecosystems are inextricably linked) in addressing important infectious diseases, including neglected infections in developing countries.
