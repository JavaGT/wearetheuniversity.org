### University of Otago hosts Australian of the Year

Australian of the Year 2007 Tim Flannery will be giving this year's Patricia Coleman Lecture at the University of Otago next month.

Hosted by the University's Consumer and Applied Sciences departments, the climate change guru and author is here for three days. The focal point of his visit is a public lecture at 7.30pm on Tuesday 7 August at the Saint David Lecture Theatre.

Professor Flannery has been described as one of Australia's leading thinkers and writers. His most recent and controversial book - entitled The Weather Makers: The History and Future impact of Climate Change (Text Publishing Melbourne, 2005) - discusses the tangible effect of climate change on people's lives. Using historical events to explain the current state of the globe, he puts the situation in a clear context.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair says Professor Flannery's book leaves readers with an appreciation of how fragile their climate is and how it is up to this generation to act to protect it.

Professor Flannery is an internationally-acclaimed scientist and conservationist, with more than 100 academic papers to his name. In his capacity as a field zoologist and explorer, he has discovered and named more than 30 new species of mammals. He was awarded the Edgeworth David Medal for Outstanding Research and is a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books.

Professor Flannery has just taken up a position with Sydney's Macquarie University. He also recently accepted a role as adviser and ambassador on climate change to the South Australia Premier. Prior to the Macquarie appointment, he was director of the South Australian Museum for seven years. The museum is considered the most successful in Australia.

Visit organiser Mick Abbott says the University and, in particular the departments hosting Professor Flannery, are excited about his upcoming visit.

"Tim Flannery's reputation is up there with the likes of Al Gore, when it comes to climate change. He is a highly-sought-after speaker. We approached him two years to given last year's Patricia Coleman Lecture but demand for Tim is so great that it's taken until this year to secure him.

"In addition to the lecture, Tim is giving a workshop for academic staff and students from across the University. He is also addressing a breakfast meeting of business and infrastructure leaders where discussion will focus around the issues presented to business by climate change. A special lecture with secondary school students is also being planned."
