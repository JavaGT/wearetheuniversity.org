**Otago health research gains major funding**  
  
University of Otago researchers have gained $33.35M in funding for 25 world-class research projects aimed at improving the health and well-being of New Zealanders.

A wide variety of innovative Otago-led research proposals — ranging from basic biomedical investigations into deadly diseases to evaluating New Zealand’s healthcare spending priorities — have gained the lion’s share of funding in the Health Research Council’s (HRC) latest annual round.

Welcoming the funding announcement, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research & Enterprise) Professor Harlene Hayne said she is delighted by Otago researchers’ outstanding success in the highly competitive funding round.

“This significant support from the HRC will enable our established and emerging researchers to pursue projects aimed at producing real health benefits for individuals, families and communities.”

The new funding has been gained by researchers from across the University’s campuses in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington and involves four major multiyear programmes, two of which are new and two extensions; 14 projects; six emerging researcher grants and a feasibility study.

One of the new programmes focuses on the early detection and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, which currently afflict over 40,000 New Zealanders. The five-year programme, led by Psychology Professor Cliff Abraham, aims to develop new treatment strategies and provide an ability to identify those at risk of cognitive decline so treatments can be delivered at an early stage.

The other new five-year programme, led by Professor Tony Blakely of the University’s Department of Public Health in Wellington, will tackle questions such as: How should New Zealand spend additional health dollars? Is prevention or treatment more cost-effective? Will new interventions improve or worsen inequalities?

Two existing Otago programmes have gained three-year extensions. In one, Department of Microbiology and Immunology Professor Andrew Mercer and colleagues will continue their world-class research on viral-human interactions. This programme integrates two core themes of combating viruses and exploiting viruses for beneficial purposes.

Another current programme, led by Dr Dorothy Begg of the Injury Prevention Research Unit, receives further support for extensive work focusing on preventing injury and reducing the subsequent disability outcomes.

Also among the Otago research supported through the latest grants are basic biomedical investigations into mechanisms involved in tumours, stroke, gout, epilepsy, preterm birth, cardiac injury and other areas.

Other projects include studies involving a close examination of the links between alcohol misuse and antisocial behaviour; older people’s dialysis outcomes; investigations into factors underlying inequalities in health outcomes for Maori; and evaluation of flax bassinets as a safer sleeping environment for babies than cosleeping.

Professor Hayne says she is delighted that six of the 10 Emerging Researcher First Grants awarded nationally were gained by up-and-coming Otago researchers. “The University is committed to helping its early-career researchers develop to their full potential and this level of recognition of the quality of their research proposals is very welcome,” she says.

In the overall HRC round, Otago researchers gained the largest share of the funding available and the highest number of contracts awarded.

“This latest impressive performance by Otago researchers continues the University’s strong record in gaining external research funding and reflects the ongoing strength of the University’s research culture.”
