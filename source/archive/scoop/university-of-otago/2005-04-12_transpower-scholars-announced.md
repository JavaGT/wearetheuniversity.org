Transpower Scholars announced

Four new Transpower Applied Science Scholars were announced today, bringing to seven the number of scholars in the University of Otago programme.

The scholarships, generously supported by Transpower, are worth $7,000 a year for three years and require students to maintain an A- average in their work.

Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Gareth Jones said: “The Applied Science programme was specifically designed around the concept of scientific enterprise and what New Zealand needs for the future.

“We are able to combine Otago’s strength across all disciplines, including business, to equip young people for that future. Transpower’s partner ship is very highly valued.”

Transpower’s Chief Executive Dr Ralph Craven said: “The scholarships are important in supporting the emergence of graduates who in coming years will make a significant contribution to New Zealand’s economy and society, whether through existing businesses or through entrepreneurial activity.

“The fact that we had 30 applicants to choose from this year shows the value of the scholarships in encouraging young people to consider Applied Science as a relevant qualification.”

Applied Science links science, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship. There are 11 specialist study areas including: applied geology, computational modelling, design for technology, electronics, energy management, environmental management, molecular biology, process technology, software engineering, spatial information and telecommunications.
