Otago Gains Health Research Funding

  
University of Otago researchers have been awarded nearly $19 million for 24 contracts in the latest Health Research Council funding round.

The funding will allow researchers from across the University's three campuses in Dunedin, Wellington and Christchurch to embark on research that improves the health and well-being of the nation.

The 24 contracts range from identifying ways to reduce crashes among new drivers to exploring how inequalities in health might be reduced to investigating the role of oxidants and antioxidants in inflammatory diseases.

Dunedin-based researchers gain $5.19 million, while scientists at the University’s Christchurch and Wellington Schools of Medicine and Health Sciences receive $10.64 million and $3.05 million respectively.

Health Sciences Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Linda Holloway says that she is “very pleased” that there have been successful applicants in all four Schools of Medicine - the medical schools in Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington and the Otago School of Medical Sciences.

“It is also very encouraging to see that a grant has been awarded in the School of Physiotherapy, which shows how research is beginning to develop in this professional discipline within the University of Otago.

"I am very pleased that there have been extensions to the two large programme grants in Christchurch with Professor Christine Winterbourn and Professor Mark Richards, as well as funding for a new health inequalities programme in Wellington under the leadership of Associate Professor Tony Blakely.

"It is also very good to see support has been obtained for Professor Jim Mann's Ngati Porou Haurora Diabetes programme on the East Coast, given that this is an important disease to address among the Maori population."
