New national research collaboration aims for tobacco-free NZ

The University of Otago, together with Massey University and partners Whakauae Research, and Tala Pasifika, is launching ASPIRE 2025, a new research collaboration designed to help achieve a tobacco-free New Zealand.

Associate Minister of Health and co-leader of the Maori Party, the Hon. Tariana Turia, will launch the new research collaboration at the University of Otago, Wellington at 10.30am Friday July 22.

ASPIRE 2025 will collaborate with all researchers and health groups in New Zealand to conduct world-class original research. It is expected this research will help achieve the New Zealand Government’s goal of minimising tobacco use by 2025.

The ASPIRE 2025 team includes Professor Richard Edwards from the University of Otago, Wellington, Professors Janet Hoek and Rob McGee, from the Departments of Marketing and Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago, together with partners Dr Heather Gifford from Whakauae Research, Professor Chris Cunningham from Massey University, and Stephanie Erick of Tala Pasifika.

ASPIRE 2025 Director Professor Edwards says: “ASPIRE 2025 comprises a team of innovative and exceptional public health researchers who are known nationally and internationally for their abilities and contributions to tobacco research.”

“We believe this collaboration will contribute to a rapid reduction in smoking prevalence in New Zealand, and bring about the tupeka kore Aotearoa, or tobacco-free New Zealand, that so many people want.”
