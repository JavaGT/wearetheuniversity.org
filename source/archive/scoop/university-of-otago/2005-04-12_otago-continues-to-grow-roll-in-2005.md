Otago Continues To Grow Roll In 2005

University of Otago enrolments are up 2.1 per cent on the same time last year, according to the latest figures released by Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Gareth Jones at today’s University Council meeting.

Analysis of enrolments at 31 March shows the University enjoyed a one per cent rise in the number of domestic enrolments (145 equivalent full-time students or EFTS) and an 11.9 per cent rise (196 EFTS) in international students enrolling. “It is pleasing to have achieved overall enrolment growth again in 2005, to have achieved it at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and especially in enrolments for postgraduate research study,” says Professor Jones.

This year the number of students at Otago enrolled in postgraduate research study is up 13.9 per cent.

The analysis also confirmed an anticipated drop in first year enrolments, which was mainly due to a fall in the number of first year international students.

Overall figures for 2005 do not yet include Semester 2 enrolments, which typically result in an increase of five to five-and-a half-per cent in the year’s total.

Professor Jones says that while 2.2 per cent decline in 2005 domestic first year enrolments was a little disappointing, it seemed to be largely a consequence of a very strong job market, with the tougher entrance requirements of NCEA being a secondary factor.

Though the overall first year intake was currently down by 3.1 per cent, it was still the University’s third largest ever, following on from 2004 and 2003’s record intakes, he noted.

“While the first year situation is not quite as strong as we might have hoped, it appears to be part of a wider trend across the sector, resulting to a significant extent from the current strength of the economy,” he says.

The University will carry out further analysis of first year enrolments, as is usual practice at this time of year. The University’s marketing programme for 2006 will take the results into account.
