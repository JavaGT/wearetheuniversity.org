Trinity buys Bioactivity Investigation Group from University of Otago

  
The University of Otago has sold one of its commercial research groups following seeding development over the last seven years. The Bioactivity Investigation Group (BIG) at the University’s Wellington campus has been sold to Trinity Bioactives Ltd.

BIG has developed an international reputation in recent years for its expertise in the analysis and testing of natural products to determine if they have any bioactivity which may be able to be developed for natural or pharmaceutical therapies. It has also developed assays which can test alternative or complementary health products already on the market as to their efficacy or bioactivity.

The Director of Enterprise at the University of Otago, Dr Bret Morris, whose team with help from key University staff negotiated the sale, has welcomed the development.

“We wish the new owners, Trinity Bioactives, every success with providing ongoing research and analytical services for the health food products and pharmaceutical industries,” he says. “The University of Otago is pleased to have seeded and developed this business for the private sector to progress to the next stage.”

Trinity CEO, Mr Geoff Todd, says he is excited by the international potential of BIG for further commercial development under Trinity Bioactives. Trinity will work with drug and health food developers to determine the medical benefits and safety of potential new products.

“We plan to team up with two other New Zealand companies to be able to provide the most comprehensive set of development services in Australasia,” he says.

BIG will remain located at the University of Otago, Wellington for at least two years and all eight staff will retain their positions under the new owners.
