Record health research funding for Otago
========================================

**Record health research funding for the University of Otago, Wellington.**  
  
The University of Otago, Wellington has been granted record funding for health research programmes and projects for the next three to five years by the Health Research Council. The Council is the main funder of health research in New Zealand. The Dean of UOW, Professor Peter Crampton, says the $10.27 million of new funding is recognition of the valuable research done at the School in terms of advancing New Zealand health care, public health improvements and reducing health inequalities.

“The School’s research funding success is testament to the skill and dedication of our researchers, and their commitment to improving the lives of all New Zealanders,” says Professor Crampton.

The funding covers a major new five year programme grant investigating the burden of disease, cost effectiveness and equity impacts of particular health interventions. Five other three year projects have also received significant grants investigating: the genetics of epilepsy, health disparities, racism as a health determinant, barriers to care for young pregnant Maori women, and the effect of co-morbidity on care and cancer survival inequalities. All grants involve teams of researchers working on a project or larger programme.

**Professor Tony Blakely from the Department of Public Health** has been awarded a major programme grant ($4,996,275) for five years to better estimate the burden of disease, cost effectiveness and equity impacts of cancer control interventions, and more generally public health interventions, as they affect all disease outcomes. The study will develop new methods and information to assist prioritization in the health system.

**Dr Lynnette Sadlier, Paediatrics,** will investigate the genetic determinants of epilepsy in children and families ($1,158,831). Molecular genetic techniques will be used to identify genes in children with brain malformations. In families all members will be interviewed, family trees constructed and DNA samples taken. This work will lead to improved diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and genetic counseling.

**Dr Beverley Lawton from Primary Health Care and General Practice** will investigate the barriers to care for young pregnant Maori women and their infants($1,199,936). The study aims to reduce early life mortality and sickness in Maori infants will also examine social, economic and policy factors that may impact on health outcomes. This will provide essential information for appropriate whanau ora interventions to reduce mortality and disability in Maori infants.

**Dr Diana Safarti, Department of Pubic Health** will investigate the effect of comorbidity, or other diseases, on care and cancer survival inequalities. The project ($1,171,238) aims to increase understanding as to why Maori have poorer cancer survival rates and will investigate whether Maori patients with co-morbidity receive less or inferior treatment to non-Maori.

**Dr Tristram Ingham from the Department of Medicine** will look at why admission rates to hospital for the serious lung disease bronchiolitis are three to five times higher for Maori and Pacific children ($1,146,720). The research will investigate whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased bronchiolitis in Maori and Pacific children, and what specific interventions may reduce the impact of this disease.

**Dr Ricci Harris, Department of Public Health** has received a project grant of $600,032 to investigate racism as a health determinant and the implications for Maori health and inequalities. It will contribute to the limited research on racism and indigenous health and support a broader understanding of racism as a health determinant in order to inform anti-racist interventions.
