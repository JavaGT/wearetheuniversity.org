Surgeon named New Zealander of the year by magazine

Associate Professor Philip Bagshaw has been named New Zealander of the Year by North and South Magazine. Mr Bagshaw is a member of the academic staff at the University of Otago, Christchurch, and a General Surgeon at Christchurch Hospital.

His award comes after the successful completion of the first Charity Hospital to be built in New Zealand in recent times. The $6 million Canterbury Charity Hospital, has been built in the last eighteen months in a converted Christchurch suburban house with donated funds and resources from the local community.

It provides free elective surgery for those who are unable to get treatment through the public health system and who cannot afford private surgery.
