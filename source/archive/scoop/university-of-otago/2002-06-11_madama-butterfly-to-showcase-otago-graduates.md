Madama Butterfly To Showcase Otago Graduates' Talent

The University of Otago is to stage a major production of Madama Butterfly featuring an all-star cast that consists overwhelmingly of graduates who are internationally recognised opera performers. The production, set for August 2003, has just received a welcome $50,000 grant from Community Trust of Otago.

Vice Chancellor Dr Graeme Fogelberg made the announcement at today's meeting of University Council.

\"An integral part of the University's mission is to foster the creation and presentation of fine works of art, literature and music for the benefit of the communities we serve. I am very excited by this opportunity to showcase the considerable talent of our distinguished graduates and also the staff and students of our internationally respected Music Department," says Dr Fogelberg. "The generosity of the Community Trust of Otago has helped make this production a reality."

Puccini's tragic tale of the enchanting 'delicate butterfly' Cio-Cio San and her doomed devotion to a faithless US Naval Officer will be brought to life by a "highly talented cast of Otago graduates from a range of disciplines including not only Music, but also French, German, Law, Commerce and English", says the project's Artistic Director and Senior Lecturer in Voice, Judy Bellingham.

The alumni include professional singers Patrick Power, Roger Wilson, Brendon Mercer, Brandon Pou, and Lin Bih-Yuh. The Conductor Tecwyn Evans, also a graduate, currently holds the prestigious position of Chorus Master at Glyndebourne opera in the UK, says Miss Bellingham. The director will be Elric Hooper, recently retired after 20 years as artistic director of Christchurch's Court Theatre.

"Not only are some of Otago's most talented alumni returning home to share their love of opera with the public, but the production will also help hone the skills of a new generation of singers and musicians studying at the University. They will have the valuable opportunity to understudy main roles, take up smaller vocal roles, and instrumental students will learn valuable accompanying skills and as members of the orchestra," says Miss Bellingham.

The casting of Lin Bih-Yuh as Suzuki, and the "very talented" soprano Dr Yi-Lin Hsue of Tunghai University in Taiwan as Cio-Cio San, is a "particular coup that will add a degree of realism that is often lacking in other stagings of the production", says Miss Bellingham.

The opera, to be staged at the Regent Theatre in August 2003, marks 100 years since Puccini wrote his much loved piece, and is the first time it has been put on in Dunedin in 20 years.
