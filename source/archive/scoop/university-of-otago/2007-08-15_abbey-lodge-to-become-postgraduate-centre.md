Abbey Lodge to become postgraduate centre

  
The University of Otago is planning to establish New Zealand’s first residential college for postgraduate students.

The bold move has been made possible by the recent purchase of Abbey Lodge, a hotel complex in the campus area of North Dunedin. The new residence will be called Abbey College.

University Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg says Abbey Lodge provides a superb site for a postgraduate residence. “It has about 80 beds in recently refurbished accommodation. Many of the rooms have en suite bathroom facilities and some have kitchenettes. There is a restaurant, cafeteria and conference facilities, suitable for academic purposes, and even an indoor heated swimming pool, spa and sauna.”

Professor Skegg says the development of dedicated accommodation for postgraduate students underpins Otago’s strategic direction.

“As New Zealand’s most research-intensive university, Otago plans to recruit a higher proportion of postgraduate students, especially research students. Postgraduate students form part of the essential life-blood of a research-led university, such as Otago. This University contains many internationally-renowned research groups which can provide outstanding opportunities for postgraduate education. The establishment of Abbey College means that we can also offer graduates an unrivalled campus experience.”

The purchase of Abbey Lodge includes land that could be used for future developments. In the meantime, this will be landscaped to provide further green space in North Dunedin.

It is expected that Abbey College will admit postgraduate students from the beginning of 2008.
