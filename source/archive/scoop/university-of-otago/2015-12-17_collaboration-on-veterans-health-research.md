Otago and Queen’s University to collaborate on veterans’ health research

The University of Otago is joining forces with Queen’s University in Canada to collaborate in research aimed at enhancing veterans’ health.

The two universities have signed a memorandum of understanding that provides a framework for researchers from Otago’s “Health of Veterans, Serving Personnel and their Families” Research Theme and Queen’s Canadian Institute for Military and Veteran Health Research (CIMVHR) to work closely together on specific research initiatives.

CIMVHR is an internationally leading research institute in the field of Canadian military, veteran and family health research.

Otago Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) Professor Richard Blaikie says signing the MOU is a significant milestone for the Veterans’ Research Theme and will help secure its position nationally and internationally as the key centre for this area of research in New Zealand.

“Otago is a leading university in the fields of international relations, peace and conflict studies, and the health care needs of New Zealand veterans, serving personnel and their families.

“I’m delighted that our researchers in these fields will be able to work closely with their Canadian colleagues on specific projects, build on existing strengths and expertise, and share knowledge that can be put into practice to improve outcomes for service personnel, their loved ones and others who suffer the consequences of conflict.”

Veteran’s Health Director Associate Professor David McBride says that he and his fellow researchers within the Theme are excited to be entering the new collaboration.

“CIMVHR is the hub for nearly 40 Canadian universities, with a unique approach of building partnerships between academia and those who care for veterans. We can’t do better than to strive towards their goal, which is to improve the lives of military personnel, veterans and their families,” Associate Professor McBride says.

CIMVHR Scientific Director Associate Professor Alice Aiken says that the Institute is pleased and proud to have the University of Otago as part of the team.

“At CIMVHR, we recognise the importance of the collaboration between our university partners to produce the evidence that informs health policies, practices, and programmes for those who serve, those who have served, and their families.

“Our international partners have similar issues and needs, and through a broader global effort we can support each other in our common goals,” Associate Professor Aiken says.
