**Otago appoints next Director of Development and Alumni Relations**

The University of Otago has appointed Philip Kearney as its next Director of Development and Alumni Relations. Mr Kearney, who currently holds a senior position at the New Zealand Charities Commission in Wellington, will take up his new role in February.

Mr Kearney is General Manager, Education, at the Commission and has a strong management and marketing background across a variety of industries including several roles in the education sector. He has a Bachelor of Commerce in Marketing from Otago and an MBA from Massey University.

As Director, Mr. Kearney will head efforts to build on the University’s highly successful “Leading Thinkers” advancement campaign, and will oversee the management of relationships with Otago’s 85,000 alumni around the world.

University Vice-Chancellor Professor Harlene Hayne says Mr Kearney was selected following an extensive international search.

“His deep understanding of the charitable sector and demonstrated ability to forge strong relationships across a wide variety of organisations will place him well for this role, which is pivotal to our future development and the relations with the communities we serve.

“As an Otago graduate he also brings a strong appreciation of this University’s special character and the importance of nurturing the life-long bonds that our alumni form with their alma mater,” Professor Hayne says.

Mr Kearney says that he is excited about taking up his new position at Otago and that he and his family are looking forward to settling in Dunedin.

“The University is a very successful and well-regarded organisation and I look forward to building on the excellent work it has already done in development and alumni relations. I am also keen to be part of the strong sense of community and Southern pride I have seen through working closely with a number of Dunedin-based organisations,” he says.

Before joining the Charities Commission in early 2009, Mr Kearney was chief executive of Sport Wanganui for three years. Other previous roles include business development manager for the Universal College of Learning (UCOL) and CEO of Enterprise Wanganui, the local economic development agency.

Mr Kearney has had experience in advising small businesses and not-for-profit groups and has held education roles in strategic planning, management, marketing and human resources. He was a member of the World Vision board for more than 10 years, and has also served on and helped a number of boards in his local community.

He will succeed Associate Professor David Gerrard, who returns to the University’s Division of Health Sciences after three years in the position. Professor Hayne paid tribute to Associate Professor Gerrard, thanking him for his important contributions as Director and wishing him the best in his continuing academic endeavours.
