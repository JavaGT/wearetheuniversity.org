===========================================

**New role combines cancer research, teaching and treatment**

Medical oncologist Bridget Robinson has been appointed to the newly established position of Mackenzie Chair in Cancer Medicine in the University of Otago, Christchurch.

The position is responsible for supporting cancer research at the University of Otago, Christchurch, and integrating research with Canterbury’s clinical services.

She will remain a medical oncologist, treating patients for half her time, but will now spend more time on research and teaching.

“I am thrilled to be appointed and raise the profile of cancer management and research in Christchurch,’’ Professor Robinson said.

“I will continue to be involved as an oncologist and researcher but will take on a bigger role of teaching both medical students and other health professionals about cancer.’’

“We have an ageing population and will have an increasing number of people with cancer so will need to look at innovative ways of delivering cancer care in our community.

The Chair in Cancer Medicine is only the second in the country.

Professor Robinson has been a medical oncologist in Canterbury since 1986.  
In 1997 she joined the University of Otago, Christchurch, where she established its tissue bank.

Her research interest involves cancer biology and aspects of blood vessels relating to cancer which can be targeted for treatment.

Professor Robinson is already the chair of the Canterbury Cancer Network, which links scientists and clinicians managing cancer as well as community cancer support organisations, and the public.

Announcing Professor Robinson’s appointment, Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg paid tribute to the generosity of the Mackenzie Charitable Foundation.

“The Trustees, who are based in South Canterbury, recognised that supporting a new Chair in Cancer Medicine will benefit cancer patients, not only in Canterbury but throughout New Zealand. We are most grateful for the support they are providing.”

Professor Robinson’s appointment will be marked by a function at the University of Otago, Christchurch, at 5.15 pm on Thursday September 2.
