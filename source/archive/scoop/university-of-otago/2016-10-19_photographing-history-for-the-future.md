**Photographing History for the Future**

The history of Dunedin’s future will be captured forever by an enthusiastic group of young photographers this Friday.

Twenty-five students completing the Certificate and Diploma in Digital Photography at Otago Polytechnic are shooting ‘A Day in the Life of Dunedin’. Their best images will form a photographic digital essay, which will be displayed at the research centre at Toitu Otago Settlers Museum.

Photography Lecturer, Chris Gable says the project will become an archive for the city, much like the photos taken by early settler Daniel Mundy in 1864. “The real benefit will be not today, not tomorrow, but in 100 years’ time, when we can look back and see what Dunedin was like”.

Kirsty Glengarry, the Visitor Experience Manager for Toitu says “We’re excited to see the latest selection of work from the students. It’s a really interesting way for us to show contemporary history”.
