**Special Collections, University of Otago: Exhibition - Scholarly Favourites. Researching in Special Collections**

Who uses Special Collections? And why? And what research results emanate from physically examining books and manuscripts? These questions formed the basis of the forthcoming exhibition, beginning on10 June 2016, at the de Beer Gallery, Special Collections, University of Otago. The exhibition, entitled**Scholarly Favourites. Researching in Special Collections**, reveals a variety of readers, and an equally wide variety of books and manuscripts used. In most cases the item was used for research; in others the item was a pure favourite, a work that resonated with the reader’s sense of being. The book or manuscript had become important to them.

A number of readers from in and outside the University were asked to contribute 150 words on ‘their’ chosen book; the exhibition: **Scholarly Favourites. Researching in Special Collections** is the result.

The items selected were from the diverse collections within Special Collections: Brasch, de Beer, Shoults, Truby King, Pulp & Science Fiction, Monro, and Stack. Notable items include Albinus’s spectacular _Tabulae Sceleti et Musculorum Corporis Humani_ (1747); Augustus Hamilton’s _The Art Workmanship of the Maori Race in New Zealand_ (1901); Johannes Wolleb’s _Compendium Theologiae Christianae_ (1642); Gregory M. Mathews’s _Supplement to The Birds of Norfolk & Lord Howe Islands and the Australasian South Polar Quadrant_ (1928); the scurrilous _Alvin Purple_ (1974); and _Egypt and the Sudan: Handbook for Travellers_ (1929). Please enjoy what others have researched and enjoyed.

The exhibition runs to 26 August 2016.

Hours: 830 to 500 Monday to Friday

De Beer Gallery, Special Collections, 1st floor, University of Otago Library
