Outstanding Success For Health Sciences At Otago University In Research Exercise

Today's announcement of the Performance-Based Research Funding results provides a ringing endorsement of the outstanding international quality of Otago University's leading medical and biomedical researchers.

Leading the health research table is the Faculty of Medicine with 23 A's, the largest number of outstanding researchers of any academic department in New Zealand.

However, success is spread widely across the Unversity’s health science sector, with Dentistry, Pharmacy, Biomedical Sciences and Human Nutrition all showing strong performances. Overall, the health sciences attracted 40% of all Otago's A's.

"This is a wonderful result," says Professor David Green, Research Dean for Health Sciences at Otago University. "It confirms Otago's position as New Zealand's pre-eminent health sciences university. Health sciences students at Otago are assured of quality teaching led and inspired by outstanding international researchers," he said.
