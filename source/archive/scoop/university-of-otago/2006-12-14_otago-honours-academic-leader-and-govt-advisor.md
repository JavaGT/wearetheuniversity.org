Otago Honours Academic Leader and Government Advisor

Professor Malcolm Grant, CBE, a distinguished law graduate from the University of Otago who is now the President and Provost of University College London, will receive an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree at the University graduation ceremony on Saturday.

Professor Grant is a barrister, an environmental lawyer, academic and public servant.

He has had an outstanding career in research, particularly in the fields of environmental planning and law, and in the regulation of biotechnology.

Professor Grant was born in Oamaru and educated at Waitaki Boys High School. He graduated as Bachelor of Laws in 1970, Master of Laws with First Class Honours in 1972 and Doctor of Laws (by examination) in 1986 from the University of Otago. He was a lecturer at Southampton University from 1982 to 1986 before becoming Professor of Law and Vice-Dean at University College London.

In 1991 he became Professor of Land Economy at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Clare College. He was the head of the Department of Land Economy at Canbridge between 1993 and 2001 before accepting the post of Pro-Vice-Chancellor in 2002.

In 2003 he returned to University College London as President and Provost.

Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg, says the University of Otago is pleased to be able to honour a distinguished graduate.

“Malcolm Grant has made an exceptional contribution in legal research, in public roles such as chairing the United Kingdom Local Government Commission, and now as the head of a major university. Indeed he is one of the most influential university leaders in Britain today.”

Professor Grant has kept in regular contact with the University of Otago and in particular with the Law Faculty.

His work has also been recognised by other institutions. He was appointed CBE “for services to planning law and local government” in 2003, and Officier dans L’Ordre Nationale de Merite by the French Minister of European Affairs in 2004.

Professor Grant will address graduates at the 16 December graduation ceremony in the Dunedin Town Hall.
