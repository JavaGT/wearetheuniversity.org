Major Marsden Fund Success Reflects Otago’s Research Excellence

University of Otago researchers have won 18 Marsden Fund contracts worth nearly $11 million to undertake fundamental research.

Otago projects funded in the latest round of the highly competitive Government research fund will allow innovative research across a wide range of areas such as: how the brain kick-starts puberty, how a tumour-suppressing protein works in cells, further study at the frontiers of physics into a exotic new state of matter, and research into patterns of early contact between Maori and Europeans in the South Island.

Other projects include work on understanding how children’s memory skills grow with age and investigating the process of programmed cell death, which often goes awry in cancer and other diseases.

University Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Geoff White says he is absolutely delighted at the outstanding outcome, which saw researchers from across the University’s Health Sciences, Sciences and Humanities Divisions win 15 ‘standard’ contracts and three ‘Fast-Start’ grants for early-career researchers.

“I warmly congratulate our researchers on their tremendous efforts in winning these grants. Marsden funding is extremely competitive,” says Prof White.

He points out that the very high quality of Otago’s research is shown by its high success rate compared to other institutions.

For Otago, 13.5 per cent of initial applications were funded, whereas for all other universities and Crown Research Institutes, the success rate averaged 7.4 per cent, he says.

The researchers’ success was especially pleasing given the University’s continuing efforts to foster and support a strong research culture among staff, he added.

“This brilliant result will help reinforce Otago’s mission as a research-led university with an international reputation for the quality of its research and teaching.”

In this year’s Marsden round, Otago gained more contracts and funding than any other institution in New Zealand. A full list of winners follows below.
