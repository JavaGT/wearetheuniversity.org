**Well-known paediatric surgeon is first Pacific Island Associate Dean**

Christchurch paediatric surgeon Dr Kiki Maoate is the University of Otago, Christchurch’s first Associate Dean, Pacific.

The role was established to give priority to Pacific Island issues in the University’s teaching, research and links with community.

“It is going to be an interesting as well as a challenging role, however I am pleased to be in a position where I can continue to contribute to the Pacific Island issues within the University and the Christchurch community.’’

Dr Maoate has worked his entire career as a specialist paediatric surgeon in Christchurch. He is a University of Otago medical graduate, who was born in the Cook Islands. He will continue his paediatric surgery work along with the Associate Dean role. Dr Maoate has been a key player in the establishment of a comprehensive paediatric surgical programme for the South Island ensuring equity of access to quality services for all the children and families in need.

For more than a decade, until recently, Dr Maoate was the Chairperson of the Pacific Trust Canterbury, which provides primary health care and community support to Pacific Island peoples in Canterbury. He remains the President of the Pasifika Medical Association and Chairperson of Pasifika Futures, Pasifika Whanau Ora commissioning agency.

Over the past few decades Dr Maoate has been a leader in organisations who arrange for specialist teams to assist Pacific countries to manage complex medical issues. This work also involves assisting with Pacific countries’ workforce development so they can achieve their own specialised services.

University of Otago Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Health Sciences, Professor Peter Crampton says “I am delighted that Kiki is taking up this important leadership position at the University’s Christchurch campus. The University wants to build on and strengthen its relationships with Pacific communities both in New Zealand and in the Pacific. One particularly important objective is to assist in strengthening the Pacific health workforce. Kiki’s appointment will greatly enhance our ability to achieve these objectives.”
