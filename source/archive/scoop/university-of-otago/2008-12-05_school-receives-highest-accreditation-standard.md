University of Otago Medical School receives highest accreditation standard

  
The Australian Medical Council (AMC) has awarded the University of Otago’s Faculty of Medicine the maximum period of accreditation possible.

All medical schools in Australia and New Zealand are required to undergo regular accreditation processes for their medical student teaching programmes. The accreditations are undertaken by the AMC, on behalf of the Medical Council of New Zealand. The Australian Medical Council assessments of medical student training are highly regarded internationally and are recognised as being world leading in their standard setting and processes.

Pro-Vice-Chancellor of Health Sciences and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Professor Don Roberton says he is delighted at the very positive report from the AMC and the associated praise for the medical curriculum at the University.

“The Faculty of Medicine is very pleased with this outcome. It represents a significant achievement, and shows that our medical curriculum is of the highest international standard. The report from the Australian Medical Council strongly endorses our curriculum developments, our methods of supporting student learning, our emphasis on clinically relevant and research based learning, the quality of our staff, and our close links with the health system and community.”

For the assessment, Otago’s Faculty of Medicine provided a detailed written assessment (more than 500 pages) reflecting the standards required. The written submission provided details of the Faculty’s curriculum in medicine, its staffing,

facilities and supporting structures, student support processes, its governance and its financial status. Included in the submission were details of significant curriculum and facility development in recent years. A detailed written submission was also provided by medical students.

The Accreditation Assessment Team (chaired by Professor Fiona Lake from the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences at the University of Western Australia) visited Otago’s Faculty of Medicine at Dunedin, Christchurch and Wellington between 11 and 15 August 2008, interviewing staff and students, and inspecting facilities.

In addition to awarding the Faculty the full period of accreditation, it also recommended consideration of extension for up to a further four years subject to a comprehensive report at the end of the fifth year of the accreditation. This is the maximum period of accreditation possible.
