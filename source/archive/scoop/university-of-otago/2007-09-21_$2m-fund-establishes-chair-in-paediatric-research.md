$2m Fund Establishes Chair in Paediatric Research

  
A $1m donation from charity Cure Kids will strengthen the University of Otago’s excellence in paediatric research at its Christchurch campus.

Head of the Christchurch Department of Paediatrics Professor Brian Darlow is the first holder of the Cure Kids Chair in Paediatric Research. Cure Kids – the charity which funds medical research into children’s life threatening illnesses – has made the donation to the University’s Leading Thinkers Initiative, which means it will be matched by the Government under the Partnerships for Excellence scheme, lifting the total to $2m.

University Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg says the establishment of the chair endorses the outstanding work undertaken by Otago’s Christchurch-based paediatric researchers.

“Professor Darlow and his colleagues are doing world-class research in child health. Cure Kids has recognised this excellence and its generosity will enhance the team’s capability.”

Professor Darlow’s primary research interest is in neonatology – the medical field concerned with the care of newborn, sick and premature babies – but specifically free-radical disease in the newborn and the longer-term outcomes of premature births.

“The nature of clinical neonatology means it is very time demanding,” Professor Darlow says, “so productivity in research is continually compromised by calls on clinicians’ time. The establishment of this Chair enables additional resources to support and enhance both established and future research programmes in neonatal medicine.”

Professor Darlow, who is Chair of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians’ Board of Paediatrics in New Zealand and a member of the College’s council, says the Chair’s establishment enables him to provide leadership in research beyond his own specialty area and to extend research capabilities through the appointment of a research assistant.

“This is an exciting appointment. In the 25 years I have been a clinical neonatologist in Christchurch, there have been many advances in the management of high-risk pregnancies and neonatal intensive care. These have led to lower mortality rates and a better quality of life for affected babies. Most of these changes have been the result of high-quality research – both basic science research and clinical and applied research. This endowment is a significant boost to such research.”

Cure Kids Chairman Roy Austin says the organisation believes the best outcomes for children are achieved by securing New Zealand’s top researchers in the field and supporting them in their work.

“Professor Brian Darlow is regarded internationally as an expert in his field and his research outcomes make a real difference. We are delighted to be partnering with the University and this researcher.

“We want to build long-term research capacity and excellence in New Zealand for the sake of our children. This chair will be funded in perpetuity and has the flexibility to be based at either the Christchurch or Wellington campuses. That means we can be confident that there will always be an internationally-acclaimed paediatric researcher filling this vital position.”

Cure Kids also funds two other Chairs in Child Health Research, at the University of Otago and the University of Auckland. These chairs are held by Professor Stephen Robertson and Professor Ed Mitchell respectively. In addition, Cure Kids funds more than $2m annually for paediatric research throughout New Zealand.

  
The $1m donation will be formally announced at a function today (21 September) at 6-8pm in the Christchurch Art Gallery. Media are welcome to attend.
