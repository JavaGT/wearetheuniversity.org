Physiotherapy circuit training decreases treatment waiting times

2nd October 2007

A programme of group circuit training classes for neurological outpatients at Christchurch’s Burwood Hospital Brain Injury Unit has earned the innovators a place in the finals of the 2007 New Zealand Health Innovation Awards (HIA).

Rather than the traditional twice weekly one-on-one session, the group of three to nine patients work through nine exercise stations with a family member or carer as part of their physiotherapy intervention.

Not only has it meant patients get timely access to physiotherapy outpatient intervention, but the patients themselves say they feel motivated by the other group members and enjoy the social dynamics and companionship of working with others. Those surveyed said they would attend such a programme again.

Outcomes also show that balance, endurance, walking speed and quality of life are either maintained or improved. So far 19 patients in three groups have taken part in the programme. “As well as showing positive results with patients, the programme allows timely access to outpatient physiotherapy and provides a service that is flexible, current, evidence-based and holistic,” said Allyson Calder of Canterbury District Health Board.

“Because of this, staff satisfaction within the brain injury unit’s Physiotherapy Team is also enhanced.”

The Group Circuit Rehabilitation Programme will be competing against 21 other finalists in the HIA, five of which are also from the Canterbury region.
