University of Otago annual report reflects on excellent year

The University of Otago enjoyed an excellent year in 2004 on many fronts, as reflected in its annual report released today.

New Vice-Chancellor Professor David Skegg, who took up his position in August 2004, says the university is in a sound position with excellent staff and a supportive community.

“Despite pressures of growth, and financial stringency, the University has continued to develop as an institution of international standing. Our degrees are very highly regarded and much research of global significance is being reported.

“I am hopeful that the New Zealand Government will recognise the need to make a greater investment in research-led universities such as Otago, as they hold the key to the social and economic progress of the nation,” Professor Skegg says.

The report reflects record student enrolments in 2004; the outcomes of the first round of Performance Based Research Funding (PBRF); and changes in the management structure of the University.

In 2004, the University:

Enrolled a record 17,543 equivalent full-time students, up 777 on the previous year Produced 4,288 graduates across its four academic divisions Employed a total of 3,259 full-time equivalent staff, with academic & research staff numbers rising by 2.7 per cent to 1,042. Research-only staff numbers increased 6.1 per cent to 536 Had a total income of $372.3 million (includes University group companies and controlled trusts) Produced an operating surplus of $29.0 million of which just under half came from the University Trusts The University group gained $60.5 million in external research funding and $35.3 million in consulting and commercial income Spent $12.5 million on scholarships

The Annual Report is available on line at www.otago.ac.nz and printed copies will be available from Tuesday 26 April.
