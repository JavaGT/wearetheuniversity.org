Otago signs MOU with Bishop’s Action Foundation in Taranaki

  
The University of Otago and the Bishop’s Action Foundation (BAF) will today sign an agreement to undertake collaborative research in areas relating to public theology, the sustainability of rural communities and helping communities flourish.

BAF is an Anglican charitable trust based in New Plymouth that was established to create and support initiatives that meet the unanswered needs of communities throughout Taranaki and works through a community development model.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will see the University work together with BAF to undertake collaborative research that will contribute practically and theologically to the policy debate around a broad range of issues relevant to rural communities.

Director of the University’s Centre for Theology and Public Issues, Professor David Tombs, says that the move presents exciting new opportunities for the Centre and other researchers at the University to collaborate and share their expert knowledge.

“Otago already has agreements in place with NGOs such as The Salvation Army and World Vision so this MOU is a welcome extension of our engagement with this sector.”

The Centre and Foundation will work together to develop robust research on, and theologically based engagement in, public issues. Other areas for collaboration being explored with researchers from the wider University include projects profiling New Zealand’s rural communities and exploring the impact of spirituality on individual well-being.

Professor Tombs says BAF’s work to nurture and support the social, spiritual, economic, environmental and cultural wellbeing of communities fits well with the University’s core values.

“Otago’s values include equity and social justice, encompassing support for full and equal participation and outcomes for all groups in society. I greatly look forward to working closely with BAF to advance our common interests,” he says.
