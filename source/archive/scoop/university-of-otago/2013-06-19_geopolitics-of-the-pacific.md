**Otago Foreign Policy School focuses on Geopolitics of the Pacific**

Critical developments and issues in the Pacific will be closely scrutinised at next weekend’s University of Otago Foreign Policy School, which is gathering leading academics, diplomats, politicians and development experts for a weekend that promises insightful presentations and fruitful debate.

Former Fijian Prime Minister Major-General Sitiveni Rabuka is among several speakers who will address the current Fiji Coup, the prospects for a successful return to democracy and what the wider implications for the region may be.

Other national and international experts will focus on themes including the US and China’s growing engagement with the Pacific, the uphill struggle the region faces in meeting millennium development goals, and the emergence of sub-regional groupings such as the Melanesian Spearhead Group that are challenging traditional voices such as the Pacific Islands Forum.

This year’s School, which runs from Friday 28 June to Sunday 30 June at St Margaret’s College, Dunedin, is co-directed by Associate Professor Jenny Bryant-Tokalau (School of Maori, Pacific & Indigenous Studies) and Dr Iati Iati (Department of Politics).

Dr Iati says that the School’s Academic Committee is delighted by the calibre of presenters who will be leading debate on pressing issues crucial to the future of the Pacific and New Zealand foreign policy-making.

“Deadlines are looming for both Fiji to return to democracy, and for Pacific nations to meet their agreed development goals. Whatever the outcomes are, they will have important and far-reaching implications for national and human security concerns in the region.”

Associate Professor Bryant-Tokalau noted that interwoven with the factors above are the continuing rise of China, its rivalry with the US for influence in the Pacific, and the emergence of strong sub-regional movements and whether they can be reconciled with region-wide approaches.

Among the speakers at the School is former New Zealand Ambassador Michael Powles who will give a presentation titled: “New Pacific Geopolitics: Do we have to choose between security, trade and our neighbours?”
