Major support from Marsden Fund for innovative Otago research

  
Friday 24 September 2010

University of Otago researchers have received major support from the prestigious Marsden Fund for a wide variety of innovative studies that will push the boundaries of current knowledge.

In the Fund s latest round, researchers from across the University s Divisions of Health Sciences, Humanities, and Sciences have gained $10.67M for 19 projects addressing unsolved questions in realms ranging from atomic physics to societal conflict resolution.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research & Enterprise) Professor Harlene Hayne welcomed the Marsden Fund s support for world-class research at Otago and warmly congratulated the University s latest successful applicants.

I am very proud of the researchers performance in this fiercely contested funding round. Nationally there was a record number of preliminary proposals submitted to the Marsden Fund. Less than one in ten of those proposals was eventually funded.’

Professor Hayne noted that for the sixth year running, the University of Otago has secured more Marsden funding than any other institution in New Zealand.

Once again, our researchers have demonstrated the world-class nature of the research that is conducted at the University of Otago. Their success reflects Otago s ongoing commitment to building and sustaining a strong research culture,’ Professor Hayne says.

Among the new Otago projects are studies aimed at gaining new understandings of the world around us, including investigations into the bizarre behaviour of ultra-cold atoms, the effects of magnetic storms on polar air temperatures, mechanisms involved in plant photosynthesis, and genetic diversity in endangered bird populations.

Biomedically-focused projects include studies into mechanisms underlying the spread of bacterial infection between cells, deadly cardiac arrhythmias in heart disease, drug resistance, brain control of human fertility, and the hormone-related neural basis of mood disorders in some new mothers.

Projects in both science and humanities are designed to glean important new insights into facets of human behaviour and in society, both past and present. Included are investigations into decision-making when embryos show genetic anomalies, improving the reliability of children s court testimony, and several studies focusing on gaining new knowledge about key aspects of societies and social interactions that are occurring now and in the past.

Professor Hayne says she is excited by the significant proportion of Fast-Start’ grants among the successful Otago projects.

Fast-Start awards are designed to support outstanding researchers early in their careers. These staff members promise to become the University s research leaders of tomorrow, and it is really exciting to see their potential recognised through these grants.’

Marsden grants are administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand and support research excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, social sciences and the humanities. This year, $60M was distributed among 13 institutions in New Zealand.
