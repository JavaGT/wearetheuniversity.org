Otago University Wins Funding for Exporting Education to Middle East

  
Dr Rob Griffiths from the University of Otago’s Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences has received $105,000 from the Export Education Innovation Programme (EEIP) to develop an innovative distance learning teaching programme for the Middle East.

The programme will be developed in conjunction with the Harvard Medical School Dubai Centre and involve a postgraduate programme of Continuing Medical Education and Professional Development in Occupational Medicine.

The EEIP funding is for a set-up phase after which the programme is expected to be self-sustaining. The University of Otago will use its expertise in distance learning to establish a Postgraduate Diploma in Occupational Medicine based on the University's successful Distance Learning Programme.

Otago’s Wellington School of Medicine has innovative distance learning techniques, including DVD-based course materials, the Internet, interactive software, online discussion and personal study facilities. The funding of the pilot project enables the University and Dr Griffiths to demonstrate their skills in distance learning based on more than 20 years experience in New Zealand.
