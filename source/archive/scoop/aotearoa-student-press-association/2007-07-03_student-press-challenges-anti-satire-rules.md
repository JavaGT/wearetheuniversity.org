Student press challenges anti-satire rules

Student press challenges anti-satire rules

Members of the Aotearoa Student Press Association \[ASPA\] are joining with the Parliamentary Press Gallery in speaking out against anti-satire rules recently imposed by the New Zealand government.

Under the new rules it is now illegal to make use of in-house footage which satirises or denigrates Members of Parliament, including both video and still images.

National Secretary of the Association Rory MacKinnon says the restrictions are "ridiculous in their premise, but terrifying in their implications".

"Dr. Cullen has said MPs will interpret the rules liberally, which is to say that our leaders have pretty wide powers of discretion in deciding what is and isn't satire. In the event that someone is convicted, the inevitable gag orders will ban the media from even reporting on the suppression of material."

MacKinnon also says that student media are unlikely to adopt Cullen's recommendation to 'wait and see'.

"Student media has a long history of both satire and political activism. We have a legacy of going where commercial publications fear to tread, especially on issues of freedom of speech. I would be very surprised if our member publications rolled over without a fight."

MacKinnon has declined to comment on rumours of a nationwide "week of shame" co-ordinated by the Association, but says he hopes to see a repeal of the rules rather than a crackdown on civil disobedience.

"Our MPs have said that the public need to be able to trust them. We would suggest that they consider doing their job properly, rather than censoring our journalists."
