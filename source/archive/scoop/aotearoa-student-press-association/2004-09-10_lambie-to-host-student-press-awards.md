Lambie to host student press awards

Television personality Mary Lambie is the latest addition to the line-up for next Friday’s student press awards.

Lambie will be hosting the 2004 Aotearoa Student Press Association (ASPA) Awards in Auckland on the evening of Friday September 17. The Awards are presented in association with the New Zealand Listener.

The celebration of young talent will also feature performances from rock acts Devil Gate Drive and Daisy Chain Halo, and a speech by Tim Watkin (Deputy Editor, NZ Listener).

The Awards have been decided by 38 high calibre judges, including media professionals, academics, and student press veterans. Judges include Metro editor Nicola Legat, TV3’s John Campbell, Jim Tully of the University of Canterbury, indie legend Chris Knox, and New Zealand Herald senior feature writer Michele Hewitson.

“This is the first year we’ve actually drummed up enough cash for an Awards ceremony, so we’re hoping Lambie will get trolleyed with us to celebrate,” said Hamish McKenzie, spokesperson for ASPA and editor of Otago University student magazine Critic.

The Awards acknowledge the achievements of young writers, editors, designers, and cartoonists at twelve University and Polytechnic magazines around the country.
