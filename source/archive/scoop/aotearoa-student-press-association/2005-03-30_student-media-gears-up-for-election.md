Student Media Gears Up for Election

National news coverage in student media has been strengthened by a new news sharing agreement. The revamped Aotearoa Student Press Association (ASPA) Newswire will utilise new technology and methods to deliver news to the 13 ASPA publications across the country, with a combined reach of over 100,000 students and youth.

ASPA also has a permanent correspondent in the Press Gallery, giving student media an unprecedented level of access for this election.

To get in touch with an ASPA newswire outlet, contact a student magazine near you, or call Salient News Editor Keith Ng at 021 115 9677.
