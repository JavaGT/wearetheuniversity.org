ASPA Awards: Critic named Best Student Publication
==================================================

### Critic named Best Student Publication In ASPA Awards

Critic, the much-talked about Otago University student magazine, was named the best publication by a panel of media experts at the annual Aotearoa Student Press Association awards, held in Auckland on Saturday in association with the NZ Listener.

Critic scooped seven of the 16 awards on offer, including best designed publication, ‘best news writer (paid)’ (Kate Newton) and ‘best editorial writer’ for editor Holly Walker.

Feature writer and columnist Steve Braunias said Critic was “Solid, entertaining, provocative, sometimes properly stupid, and, possibly, vital to Dunedin… \[with\] lots of humour and a clear editorial intelligence at work.”

Media commentator Russell Brown said “"Critic has had a banner year - the issues submitted were strong from beginning to end. While it does the basics well - the pages look good and the copy is well-edited - Critic also shows a distinctive editorial imagination."

Auckland University of Technology’s Debate was named best small publication.

Other winners on the night included Craccum co-editor Alec Hutchinson, who won the categories of ‘best columnist’ and ‘best features writer’. Listener feature writer Alistair Bone said that Alec’s writing was “on a different level”.

The Aotearoa Student Press Association comprises 13 publications from the country’s university and polytechnic campuses. These are the fourth annual awards, and the second held in association with the Listener.
