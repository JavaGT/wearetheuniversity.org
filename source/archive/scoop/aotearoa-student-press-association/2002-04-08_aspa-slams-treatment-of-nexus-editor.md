ASPA Slams Treatment Of Nexus Editor
====================================

**Monday, 8 April 2002, 4:31 pm**  
**Press Release: [Aotearoa Student Press Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Aotearoa_Student_Press_Association)**

The national student press body, ASPA, has condemned the behaviour of the Waikato Students Union toward their magazine Editor, Anthony Hiron.

Hiron felt forced to resign following threats of legal action from members of the WSU Executive.

The legal action was in response to an article Hiron wrote criticising members of the Executive and alleging unconstitutional behaviour.

ASPA spokesperson and Salient Editor Max Rashbrooke said the actions of the WSU Executive were a threat to freedom of the Student Press.

“No Editor should be placed in the position where they feel they should resign. Hiron was only fulfilling his duty to report on the activities of the WSU.”

Hirons departure signals the end of a successful two year rebuilding phase which saw Nexus move from bankruptcy to a thriving business with a weekly 48 page publication.

“The rapid departure of my predecessor nearly crippled the company. I’m resigning so that my replacement can be trained and have the chance to rebuild the relationship with the Executive” Hiron said.

“I’m gutted, but my work doesn’t need to me to be there for it to continue” he added.

Rashbrooke warned that ASPA would not look kindly on other Associations’ attempting to interfere with student media.
