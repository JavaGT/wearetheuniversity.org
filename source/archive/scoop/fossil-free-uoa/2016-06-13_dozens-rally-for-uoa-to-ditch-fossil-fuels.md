Dozens rally for UOA to ditch fossil fuels  

  
  
Students, staff and alumni of the University of Auckland have sent a strong message to the University Council to vote to support divestment from fossil fuels at a rally today.

More than fifty people gathered and marched to the University clocktower where the University Council is meeting to decide whether to urge the Foundation that manages the its money to divest from fossil fuel industries due to concerns about funding climate change.

As the University Council members walked into the meeting the marchers chanted: “Hey hey UOA! Stop funding climate change!”

Áine Kelly-Costello, spokesperson for Fossil Free UoA said: “the University of Auckland owes its donors a safe investment. It owes its students a safe climate future. Investing in fossil fuels is wrecking our planet and it’s time for the University Council to stand up and urge its endowment fund to divest from these polluting industries.”

“Divestment is in line with the University’s Strategic Plan which outlines a long term commitment to sustainability. It is also in line with international trends towards sustainable investment.”

“If the University of Auckland considers itself a leader in New Zealand and to be of international standing, then it should catch up to competitors who have already divested.”

More than fifty prominent international universities have made moves to shift their money out of fossil fuels including Victoria University of Wellington, Australian National University, Stanford University and London School of Economics.

The University Council is voting on the motion put forward by its student representative that “Council considers fossil fuel divestment to be in line with the mission and values of the University of Auckland, and would respect a divestment decision by the University of Auckland Foundations, subject to due diligence." The meeting commences at 4pm.

The divestment motion has the support of over ten student associations including Auckland University Students’ Association, and a petition made by Fossil Free UoA had nearly 3000 signatures.

Ms Kelly-Costello said: "today the University Council has the opportunity to stand on the right side of history. Climate change is the defining issue of our time and the University of Auckland must show leadership by cutting its ties to the fossil fuel industry."
