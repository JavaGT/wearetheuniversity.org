Bangladesh catastrophe must be heeded

This year’s catastrophic loss of life at a clothing factory in Bangladesh is another instance where people have been put second to safe working conditions, says Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA)

“The death of 1,129 people to date in the collapse of the factory building on the 24th of April is the largest industrial accident of its kind”, says Shane Malva the AUSA National Affairs Officer.

In response to the collapse the Bangladesh government has increased the minimum wage and closed other factories with substandard conditions. “These actions are not enough, and as students and New Zealanders we really need to call for more action to prevent such needless tragedies”, says Malva.

“Companies have ways of protecting their trademarks all around the world, all we are asking for is for them to extend some minimum protections to the workers who make the products that they sell.

“The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh is an agreement companies can sign to guarantee a minimum level of safety for workers overseas. Many companies in New Zealand have signed already, but some have refused – amongst those being Foot Locker and Kmart.

“Most people are unconcerned about the origins of the products or the poor, and often life-threatening, conditions those people are working and living in” says Daniel Haines AUSA President.

“There is a balancing act to be made between making things cheaply, and ensuring the conditions of those working in factories are to a minimum standard. The Bangladesh tragedy has to be a case of saying ‘No More!’”

As well as expressing its concern for students who may have friends and loved ones living in Bangladesh, AUSA is considering a name-and-shame campaign to further highlight companies that have not yet signed the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh.
