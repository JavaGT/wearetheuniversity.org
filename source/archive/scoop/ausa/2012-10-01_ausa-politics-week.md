Media Release – For Immediate Use

AUSA Politics Week

  
Every year the Auckland University Students Association invites MPs and organisations onto campus for a week of debates, discussion and deliberation.

  
\"Politics Week 2012 will actually be one to remember,” said University of Auckland student Sarah R Thompson, 19. “There are events for all people along the political spectrum, and a huge variety of contemporary and controversial issues to be discussed. I for one am really excited, as hopefully it will serve to engage the largely politically disinterested Auckland Student Body."

  
Politics Week will be held this week from the 1st to the 5th of October. All events are easily accessible for students in the City Campus.

  
There are over twenty events in a single week. Highlights this year include a Marriage Equality debate between MP Louisa Wall and Colin Craig and a “Mini Back Benches” with Wallace Chapman at our very own Shadows Bar. Students can also expect a variety of stalls, including free food from a ‘kiwi’ barbeque in the quad and fair-trade coffee from Oxfam.

  
“This year AUSA tried really hard to reach out to as many students as possible. It is also amazing the contribution and unique ideas which I have received from clubs,” said Max Lin, National Affairs Officer of the Auckland University Students Association.

  
This year not only external groups are involved but our own clubs have a very strong presence.

  
“Amnesty on campus is doing a workshop, Red Cross NZ is promoting their campaign Make Nuclear Weapons the Target, and the Sustainability Network has a vegan lunch and documentary. Every major political party in New Zealand is also involved in some way. Students and clubs are making this their week.”

The week will also be visited by a long list of MPs, including MP David Cunliffe, MP Nikki Kaye and MP Jacinda Ardern, who will all come on campus to meet students and do their own presentations.

  
There is also an international focus, including a protest condemning the human rights abuses in Syria and another against the unjustified imprisonment of Pussy Riot in Russia.

  
The week begins at 10am on the Monday 1st of October, where all the stalls go up in the quad.
