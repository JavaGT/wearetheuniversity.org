New Zealand’s biggest student union backs 40% target

Auckland University Students Association, AUSA, New Zealand’s largest student union representing more than 20,000 students is backing Greenpeace’s call for John Key to accept a binding 40% emissions reduction target by 2020 (based on 1990 levels) at the Copenhagen climate summit this December.

AUSA President Darcy Peacock said, “This is one of the biggest challenge facing our generation, it’s time we started acting like it.” He went on to comment that “Inaction in desperate times is going to lead to horrible outcomes and unless we encourage the government to sign on to the 40% target at Copenhagen we are going to end up in dire circumstances”

Peacock hopes AUSA backing the Sign On campaign will kick start renewed focus on the issue at tertiary institutes where he hopes further actions will be taken to ensure our government takes the necessary steps to do our bit as part of a global deal at Copenhagen.

Reacting to yesterday’s government target announcement Peacock stated, “AUSA is calling for 40%, 20% just doesn’t cut the mustard. I’d like to see strong action to a strong threat facing this country”

“It’s sad to see the government isn’t dealing with this issue realistically.”
