**Students' Association celebrates the opening of University Hall**

The University of Auckland opened the new student accommodation complex tonight. University Hall will provide housing and catering for 442 students in the coming year.

Auckland University Students' Association is positive about the new hall. \"Auckland rent prices are keeping students out of the central city. Its great to see the University taking steps to help students live closer to where they study," says Auckland University Students' Association President, Arena Williams. "Hopefully this will have some effect on the inner city rental market, and allow 442 other students to find flats elsewhere."

"$330 a week to live in the new hall is steep for rent and expenses, but subsidising it further from the Student Services Levy wouldn't be appropriate. That money should be spent of services that everyone can access, like the University Health Service or the academic advocacy service."

Arena Williams says the Students' Association is always sceptical about University spending on things which don't benefit the majority of students, but that on balance the University Hall addressed a real need.

"We'd like see more equitable rules about who gets priority to live here. There should be a preference for the most vulnerable students who struggle to find suitable accommodation for the academic year, rather than top high school scholars and sports-people."
