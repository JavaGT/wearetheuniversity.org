Loan Limit Increase
===================

**Monday, 2 July 2018, 11:42 am**  
**Press Release: [AUSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUSA)**

“AUSA is delighted that from Sunday 1 January 2019 the Government is increasing the student loan borrowing limit to 10 years for students studying medicine, dentistry, optometry or veterinary science,” says AUSA President Anna Cusack.

“Extending the borrowing limit for particularly long courses reduces the financial barriers that prevent students from pursuing or completing study. This decision is a positive step towards offering equal access to higher education for everyone. It is great both for students and for the Health sector.”

“The limit increase is such a win for all the students who were a part of the #LetUsFinish campaign and everyone who lobbied the Government to enable students to be able to afford to finish studying. The student action behind this decision has been impressive and sustained. These students deserve to be celebrated.”

“We commend the Government on increasing the loan borrowing limit and the students who pushed for this change.”
