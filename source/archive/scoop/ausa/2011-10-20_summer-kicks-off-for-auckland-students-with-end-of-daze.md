**Summer kicks off for Auckland students with End of Daze**

Summer kicks off for University of Auckland students with the live music and end of year celebrations at End of Daze, this Friday October 21st at the Student Union Quad.

End of Daze is a proud tradition always held on the last day of the academic year, with thousands of students expected to enjoy the free event brought to them by their students’ association, AUSA.

AUSA has made the event bigger and better than ever before, with an impressive lineup aiming to appeal to wide range of musical tastes.

End of Daze 2011 features some of the finest names in contemporary Aotearoa music including roots reggae legends Katchafire, State of Mind, the talented Ladi6, dDub, Sunshine Sound System, and the North Shore Pony Club.

The Student Union Quad will be transformed into a live music venue for the R18 event, including the iconic Shadows garden bar, in an expansive, safe and fully-enclosed environment.

Student President Joe McCrory is expecting a good crowd. “Events like End of Daze are essential parts of student life at university. Students need something to enjoy before exams, and End of Daze should once again be a great send off,” McCrory said.

End of Daze is FREE for University of Auckland students (Student ID required at the door), $15 for other students (Student ID required at the door), and $20 for general public. Limited presale tickets for non University of Auckland students available at www.eventfinder.co.nz.

End of Daze is brought to you by AUSA, 95bfm, Shadows and Craccum.
