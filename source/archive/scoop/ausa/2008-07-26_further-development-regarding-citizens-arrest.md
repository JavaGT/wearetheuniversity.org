Further development regarding citizen’s arrest

In the interests of the safety of our students, the Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) has retracted its $5000 reward for any student who makes a successful citizen’s arrest of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

“AUSA maintains its firm opposition to the visit of Condoleezza Rice and will still support any student who seeks to arrest Rice. None of the multiple justifications for her arrest have changed,” said AUSA President David Do.

“It is unfortunate the Police have threatened students for essentially a form of peaceful protest and civil disobedience.”

AUSA encourages any students who wish to make this arrest, and students who seek to protest Rice’s presence in Auckland, to make their way to the demonstration organised by Global Peace and Justice Auckland on Saturday.

The demonstration will meet at the corner of Carlton Gore Road and Park Road by the Auckland Domain, Newmarket at 1.30pm.
