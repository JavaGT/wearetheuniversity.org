AUSA and The Daily Blog ‘Anti-Debate’ to be live streamed

  
Auckland University Student’s Association (AUSA) and The Daily Blog are teaming up to live stream the upcoming ‘Anti-Debate’.

The Anti-Debate, which will provide a platform for all Auckland Mayoralty candidates who have not been invited to participate in mainstream debates, will be held at Shadows, the Auckland University campus bar, at 7pm on Monday 26 th August. The live steam will commence at 7pm on the Daily Blog.

“We’re really excited to be working with the team at the Daily Blog to ensure that this debate, and the messages of the candidates can reach as many Aucklanders as possible” says AUSA President Will Matthews.

AUSA is inviting all mayoral candidates who have so far been deprived of a platform to come to the Anti-Debate, where they will be given the opportunity to speak and interact with voters. Candidates who are interested in attending can contact Sarah Butterfield at peo@ausa.org.nz

Media is also welcome at this event, to ensure that the messages of the candidates can reach beyond the Anti-Debate.
