United Future well-received on campus

Auckland students received United Future leader Peter Dunne positively today when he spoke in the AUSA Quad this afternoon, highlighting the party’s zero-fees tertiary education policy.

United Future’s tertiary education policy focuses on abolishing tuition fees, while also ensuring high quality tertiary education. AUSA believes this will go a long way to lowering financial barriers to higher education, as well as attacking student debt at the source.

“While our main focus this year has been on pushing a universal student allowance, we welcome this policy as a useful contribution to the tertiary education policy mix. Both approaches help students and ensure access to higher education,” says AUSA President David Do.

Peter Dunne mingled and chatted with students after his speech today. He appeared to be well-received by students and students were interested in learning more about the party’s policies.

Note: Some photos of his speech are attached.
