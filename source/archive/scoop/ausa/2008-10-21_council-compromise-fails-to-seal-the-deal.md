Council compromise fails to seal the deal

Auckland University students are pleased their Council has supported removing financial barriers to their success, however are disappointed the Council did not endorse the solution to many of these problems – a universal student allowance. This afternoon University Council agreed to an amended version of the original motion put forward by student reps AUSA President David Do and AUSA Education Vice President Sophia Blair.

The carried motion reads: That the University of Auckland Council, 1. recognises that some students face financial difficulties during their studies due to lack of access to student allowances, and 2. recognises that properly supporting students through their studies yields positive benefits for students and the institution, and thus 3. calls on the Government to ensure that no person is denied access or success in education because of financial constraints

The compromise amendment was suggested by Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon after discomfort by some Council members at the original motion.

“We are disappointed Council chose not to endorse a universal student allowance. This would have been a principled stand in support of properly supporting students through their studies,” says AUSA President David Do.

“Nevertheless, we are glad that Council did recognise the financial difficulties some students face and supported the principle that financial barriers should be minimised for those undertaking and entering higher education.”

“There are a variety of ways to minimise financial barriers to success and achievement in tertiary education, and we firmly believe that a universal student allowance is key to that,” concludes Do.

University Council also voted in favour today of raising undergraduate fees by an average of 2.7%, postgraduate fees by 7.8%, and most international student fees by 5%, (with some courses by 7.5%). The two student reps voted against the fee rises.
