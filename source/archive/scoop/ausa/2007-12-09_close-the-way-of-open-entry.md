Embargoed until 6pm December 10th

Close the way of open entry, fa la la la la, la la la la…

Auckland students will show their opposition to the University of Auckland’s proposal to eliminate open entry in a creative audio and visual protest this Monday afternoon.

The University of Auckland Council is meeting from 4pm this Monday afternoon to make a final decision on whether to eliminate open entry to the University from 2009.

AUSA is protesting before the meeting to highlight the implications of this proposal. This protest will be in the foyer of the Clocktower building (22 Princes St) at 3:30pm.

While not wishing to spoil the surprise, the protest will involve three elements: roadworks, no vacancy signs, and a Christmas carol made specially for the season.  
Cameras and recorders most welcome.

The Council meeting itself is public, so media and the general public are able to attend as well.

ENDS
