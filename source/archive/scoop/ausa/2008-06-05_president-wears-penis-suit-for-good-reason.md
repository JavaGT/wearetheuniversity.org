President wears penis suit for good reason

Students have warmly received a creative drive to increase awareness of male sexual health and encourage STI testing amongst male students by the Auckland University Students Association.

This has involved the student association president walking around the campus promoting the initiative while wearing a costume shaped like a penis.

“We wanted to catch people’s attention and get them thinking about the issues. We’ve had really positive feedback from students - students love the costume,” says AUSA President David Do.

AUSA is participating in ‘Men as Advocates of Sexual Health’(MASH), an initiative agreed to by student associations nationwide through NZUSA (New Zealand Union of Student Associations). Other campuses such as Waikato, Massey Wellington, and Victoria have also done their own campaigns over the past month to increase awareness amongst male students.

“We’re all doing this for a good reason. The last thing we want is for our male members to be thrust into a sticky situation!,” says Do.

“Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed sexually transmitted infection in New Zealand, and gonorrhea surely can’t be far behind. Sometimes those who have it don’t have any symptoms, so this increases the importance of being safe and getting checked.”

AUSA is working with the University Health Centre, which have been putting on free clinic hours this week for students to register and get tested.

AUSA also wishes to give credit to student Kris Sproull - who made the suit for a costume party - as without his help this would not be possible.

Note: A sample photo from Wednesday’s walkabout is attached. The President will be available during his walkabout around campus Thursday from 12 noon to 1:30pm.
