Auckland University students promote fairtrade with free coffee

Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA), as part of Oxfam’s Fairtrade Fortnight campaign, will be giving away fairtrade coffee to students in the university quad between 11am and 1pm today.

The Auckland University Students’ Association will transform the quad for the event today by setting up a makeshift lounge of couches and heaters, in the hope that students will sit down and beat the winter blues with a hot cuppa.

Oxfam’s Fairtrade Fortnight campaign runs from the 2nd to the 17th of May, and Oxfam is encouraging everyone to hold a fairtrade coffee break during this time, whether it’s in the workplace or at home with friends. AUSA is proud to be participating, and hope that it inspires more students’ associations to do so.

AUSA President Darcy Peacock says “This event is really valuable because it enables students to enjoy fairtrade products and discuss the issues that surround fairtrade in a friendly and relaxed environment.”

“At a time when people are so conscious about what they’re spending, it’s more important than ever that we continue to raise awareness about the importance of buying fairtrade,” adds Peacock.
