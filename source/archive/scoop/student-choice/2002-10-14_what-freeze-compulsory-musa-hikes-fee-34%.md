What Freeze? Compulsory Musa Hikes Fee 34%

WHAT FREEZE? COMPULSORY MUSA HIKES FEE 34%

In the three years since the introduction of the tertiary tuition fee freeze, the compulsory Massey University Students Association (MUSA) has increased its own fee by 34%, Student Choice spokesman Clint Heine said.

Heine said the maximum MUSA fee was $135 in 2001, $165 in 2002 and will rocket to $180 in 2003. "This is more hypocrisy from the people in charge of compulsory student associations. MUSA student politicians protest against tuition fee increases and support the fee freeze but have shown they're more than happy to increase the cost of compulsory membership of MUSA," Heine said.

"This highlights the priorities of student politicians. They oppose people paying for a quarter of the cost of their education but are more than happy to force students to pay for their bureaucratic empire building," Heine said.

MUSA will argue that the fee increases were approved by votes, but this doesn't change the fact that a 34% increase over three years is excessive. "If tuition fees increased by the same amount MUSA would be outraged. With a maximum fee of $180 MUSA is now the most expensive compulsory association in the country. Massey students are being forced to fund a massive bureaucracy for student politicians," Heine said.

Much of the blame for this situation rests with Steve Maharey. His education amendment act and the facility to borrow student association fees under the loan scheme allows student politicians to easily impose unnecessary costs on students. Student politicians can't complain about tuition fees when they're responsible for continually adding to the cost of tertiary education, Heine said.
