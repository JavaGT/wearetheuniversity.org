Compulsory WSU Bungles It Again

The bungling of the executive elections by the Waikato Student Union (WSU) is yet another argument against compulsory membership of the association, Student Choice said today.

WSU elections were supposed to run from 1-3 October but have been delayed, and this week the Waikato Times reported that a further postponement is possible due to alleged electioneering rule breaches. In addition WSU has failed to pass the 2003 budget and set its fee for next year.

"The mismanagement of the election and the budget - on top of WSU's many other problems - has again confirmed that students should not be forced to join this dysfunctional organisation," Student Choice spokesman Clint Heine said today.

Without the 2003 fee being set the election is a farce. "Candidates will be making promises without knowing how much money WSU will take from students next year.”
