New Government Must Grant Students Their Freedom

New Government Must Grant Students Their Freedom  
Media Release: Student Choice  
11 November 2008  
   
Student Choice congratulates John Key and the National Party for their victory in last Saturday's General Election.

With ACT likely to have a role in supporting the government, Student Choice spokesman Mike Heine today reminded the National Party that a bill exists in the name of ACT Deputy Leader Heather Roy to extend voluntary membership to student unions.

"For too long students have missed out on the fundamental freedom of voluntary unionism, enjoyed by every other sector in our society," Mr Heine said.

"National would do well to remember that during the election campaign, the New Zealand Union of Student Associations (NZUSA) campaigned heavily for the parties of the left, and against a National Government. NZUSA is an organisation financed by member associations which are in turn compulsorily funded by students - a direct result of compulsory student union membership.  
   
"NZUSA's constant attacks on the National Party and demands for a universal student allowance were made by them "on behalf of students".  This election result makes a mockery of their claims and proves beyond doubt that students do not speak with a unified voice on any issue.  It is degrading to us to pretend that we do.

"Student Choice is encouraged by discussions with key figures in the National Party prior to the election, and look forward to this dialogue continuing," Mr Heine said.
