NZUSA comes clean

After making public accusations about the negative effects of voluntary union membership at the Waikato Students Union (WSU), New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) has now come clean, admitting that it actually has no information supporting the accusations.

According to Student Choice spokesperson Glenn Peoples, "For some time NZUSA has attacked voluntary student assoiation membership by claiming that it forced WSU to sell off huge numbers of accumulated assets just to survive, supposedly showing that voluntary membership is unviable." However, in response to a recent line of enqueiry by Student Choice says Peoples, "NZUSA leadership has finally admitted that it actually has no information supporting these claims. It's a shame that their claims have been taken seriously for so long and done so much damage, but this recent admission is significant nonetheless."

WSU declined to comment on the admission, although it has significant implications for them, since similar claims have been circulated by WSU in the past, and they are currently facing legal action by a former WSU president for making these allegations. "NZUSA's confession does not put the integrity of the current WSU in a good light," commented Peoples.

Student choice supports voluntary student association on the grounds of the freedom of association. www.studentchoice.org.nz
