Students Misrepresented Over Mapp Bill

Students Misrepresented Over Mapp Bill

  
Press Release: Student Choice

NZUSA's salivation over the demise of Dr Wayne Mapp's Employment Relations (Probationary Amendment) Bill is a gross misrepresentation of the opinions of students.

Student Choice spokesman Mike Heine said today "NZUSA claims to represent the views of all students, but in reality this is an impossible task. Political opinion amongst students is a microcosm of society at large but this is never reflected in the left-leaning commentary provided by NZUSA.

"NZUSA co-president Conor Roberts, a former chairman of the Princes Street Branch of the Labour Party, showed his bias this week when he stated:  
'Students could see that this bill would lead to their exploitation. Thousands of students finish studying at the end of November then start back again at the end of February, that is a three month period, exactly the same amount of time National wanted them to have no rights at work.'

"The membership of NZUSA consists almost entirely of compulsory student associations. This guaranteed membership and funding base means they have no incentive to accurately convey student opinion. As long as this compulsory structure exists, NZUSA will remain unresponsive to students' views and continue to misrepresent them," Mr Heine concluded.

Student Choice upholds voluntary student association membership on the grounds of freedom of association.
