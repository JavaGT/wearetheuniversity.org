Auckland Students Call for Tax Cuts

At a public meeting of Auckland University students yesterday at the University Quadrangle students voted by a two to one majority for the government to cut taxes.

The Student Representative Council meeting was organized by union representatives to focus on the seven billion of student debt. Much to the chagrin of student union politicians who spoke and voted against the tax cut resolution the following was carried by a two to one majority

“That AUSA (Auckland University Students Association) urge the government to drop the 39% and 33% marginal tax rates, so that graduates have more money to repay loans in a shorter time.”

The resolution was moved by “ACT on Campus” President David Seymour, and opponents of the motion pointed out this was ACT policy. Student Union politicians who spoke against the motion were affiliated with the influential Princes Street Labour Party branch, and suggested it was important to tax wealthy graduates.

Auckland University students rejected the line of their union representatives and voted by a two to one majority to adopt ACT tax policy as their own.
