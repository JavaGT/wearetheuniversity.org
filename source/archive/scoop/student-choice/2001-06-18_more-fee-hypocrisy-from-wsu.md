More Fee Hypocrisy From WSU
===========================

MORE FEE HYPOCRISY FROM WSU

The Waikato Students' Union (WSU) support for the government's fee-freeze deal is hypocritical when the re-introduction this year of compulsory membership of WSU added over half a million dollars the annual cost of attending Waikato University, Student Choice spokesman Clint Heine said today. Heine said it was hypocritical for WSU co-president Mecina Stanbury to say students can't accept a tuition fee hike when she supports compulsory membership, a policy that has already imposed huge and unnecessary new costs on Waikato students.

"The WSU is a political organisation that simply doesn't represent all students. This year WSU is budgeted to take over $550,000 off Waikato students. People who are struggling to pay other costs shouldn't be forced to join an unrepresentative political group before they can attend university," Mr Heine said.

Heine also said that at a meeting in November last year attended by less than 30 people, WSU raised its own 2001 fee by 40%. "In less than an hour this meeting cost Waikato students an additional $165,000. If Mecina Stanbury is so opposed to fee increases she should act to reduce this additional burden on Waikato students," Mr Heine said.

"Stanbury accused the government as treating students as cash cows, but it's obvious that student politicians see students in exactly the same way," Mr Heine said.
