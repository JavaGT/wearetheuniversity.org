Waikato Students Need Voluntary Membership

Waikato Students Need Voluntary Membership

In order to avoid being forced to join the dysfunctional and illegitimate Waikato Students Union next year, it is critical that Waikato University students have voluntary membership of WSU, Student Choice said today.

Spokesman Clint Heine said compulsory membership of WSU is the underlying cause of the problems afflicting students at Waikato University. “Voluntary membership is the ultimate accountability mechanism for every incorporated society in the real world outside of tertiary institutions,” Heine said.

“Under a voluntary membership system, nobody is forced to join an organisation and existing members are free to leave. This sends a clear signal to failing organisations – improve performance or cease to exist.”

“However under compulsory membership an incorporated society can waste money and abuse and misrepresent members yet people still have to join and fund it. This is precisely what’s happening at Waikato University.”

The outrageous situation at Waikato means that a handful of people could easily vote to double the compulsory WSU levy in 2003. This means that despite widespread dissatisfaction with WSU, Waikato students could easily be forced to pay a million dollars next year to an organisation that is failing in every way. It would mean even more money for an irresponsible executive to waste.

Supporters of compulsory membership such as Bryan Gould, Steve Maharey and Dianne Yates should enrol in a first-year economics paper so they can learn how monopolies hurt customers and reduce choice. They should also explain to Waikato students why they should have to cough up yet again for membership of an illegitimate and unrepresentative association, Clint Heine said.

Student Choice promotes freedom of association through voluntary membership of student associations.
