Celebrating Te Wiki o te Reo Maori

  
To celebrate Maori Language Week 2011, Te wiki o te Reo Maori, Auckland University Press has published _Ngā Mōteatea: An Introduction / He Kupu Arataki_ written by Jane McRae and translated into Māori by Hēni Jacob.

The songs of Māori tradition are a living art form and an abundant source of knowledge about tribal history and culture. From the 1920s, Sir Āpirana Ngata began collecting and annotating these songs – a massive undertaking that, with the help of translators Pei Te Hurinui Jones and later Hirini Moko Mead, became the treasured four-volume _Ngā Mōteatea._  
  
_Nga Moteatea: An Introduction/He Kupu Arataki_, published in association with the Polynesian Society, is an introduction to Ngata’s classic collection.

Its first essay outlines the origins and publication history of the _Ngā Mōteatea_ volumes; the second celebrates the power and meaning of Māori song, discussing styles, roles, poetry, cultural content, tribal origins, composers and methods of composition.

With dual text in English and Māori, illustrations, and ten songs reproduced from the volumes, _Ngā Mōteatea: An Introduction_ is a perfect entry point for students, teachers or singers interested in the rich and vibrant poetry of the traditional songs.

He toi mataora tēnei mea te mōteatea, he putunga mātauranga mō te noho a ngā iwi Māori me ngā tikanga ā-iwi. I tīmata mai te kohikohi, te whakamārama a Tā Āpirana Ngata i ngā mōteatea i ngā 1920 – he mahi nui whakaharahara. Whai i muri mai ko ngā kaiwhakamāori, ko Pei Te Hurinui Jones rāua ko Hirini Moko Mead. Nā rātou mā, ko ngā pukapuka e whā o _Ngā Mōteatea_ – he kura, he puiaki.

Ko tēnei pukapuka nei nā, _Nga Moteatea: An Introduction/He Kupu Arataki,_ i whakaputaina tahitia me Te Rōpū Poronīhia, hei whakataki i te kohinga kāmehameha a Ngata.

Ko te tuhinga tuatahi o roto, e tātai ana i te orokohanga ake o te kohinga me ōna putanga o roto i ngā tau; ko te tuarua, he whakanui i te mana, i te mauri, i te matū o te mōteatea. Ka kōrerotia ngā momo waiata, ngā kaupapa, te huatau o te kupu, ngā tikanga Māori, ngā pūtakenga ā-iwi, ngā kaitito me ngā tikanga tito.

E rere tahi ana te reo Pākehā me te reo Māori, ko te whakaahua hei kīnaki, ā, me te tāruatanga o ētahi waiata tekau nō roto mai i te kohinga. Kāore pea i tua atu i _Ngā Mōteatea: He Kupu Arataki_ hei kūaha e tomo mai ai te ākonga, te kaiako, te kaiwaiata e minamina ana tōna ngākau ki te reo ātaahua, ki te reo auaha o ngā mōteatea.
