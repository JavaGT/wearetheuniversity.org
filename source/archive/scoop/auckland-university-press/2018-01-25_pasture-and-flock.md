Poetry  
**The latest collection of poetry from Anna Jackson is pastoral yet gritty, sweet but with a sting.**  
Uneasy nights out with dead Russian poets, dalliances with German gasfitters and emotionally fraught games of badminton are brought together for the first time, along with a brand new body of work, in this time-spanning selection of Anna Jackson’s poetry. Local gothic, suburban pastoral and answerings-back to literary icons are all enhanced by Jackson’s light hand and sly humour.

  
_There are some poets you travel the routes of_  
_so often you could feel your way in the dark,_  
_that turn, that corner, and then the plummet_  
_towards the end. What does it give you, after all,_  
_to meet in person in a room? A thought_  
_the dog doesn’t share, when, having known_  
_the followed route, the stored scent,_  
_an affair of the air, here is_  
_the other dog! Incarnate! Guessed and host!_  
‘Poets know words, know routes, know ghosts’

Pastoral yet gritty, intellectual and witty, sweet but with stings in their tails, the poems and sequences collected in _Pasture and Flock_ are essential reading for both long term and new admirers of Jackson’s varied and slanted approach to lyric poetry.

  
**Anna Jackson** made her debut in AUP _New Poets 1_before publishing six collections with Auckland University Press, most recently _I, Clodia_ (2014). She has a DPhil from Oxford and is an associate professor in English literature at Victoria University of Wellington. Jackson is the author of _Diary Poetics: Form and Style in Writers’ Diaries 1915–1962_ (2010) and, with Charles Ferrall, _British Juvenile Fiction 1850–1950: The Age of Adolescence_ (2009).
