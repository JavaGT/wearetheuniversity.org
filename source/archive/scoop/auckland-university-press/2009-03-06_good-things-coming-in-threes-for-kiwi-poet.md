**For Immediate Release**

  
**Good Things Coming in Threes for Kiwi Poet**

It’s a great year for Kiwi poet, editor and psychotherapist **Michael Harlow**, who has already won a trifecta: he has just published a **new collection of poems, _The Tram Conductor’s Blue Cap_** (Auckland University Press); he has just taken up the 2009 **Robert Burns Fellowship** at the University of Otago; and he is concurrently the **inaugural** **Caselberg Artist in Residence** in Dunedin.

In the first of a trio of launches for _The Tram Conductor’s Blue Cap_, in Auckland this week, New Zealand Poet Laureate Michele Leggott said, “In _The Tram Conductor’s Blue Cap_ the words fly and sing and dance. With Michael Harlow you have language on the one hand and you have the world on the other; when you put the two together you get marvellous poetry.”

_The Tram Conductor’s Blue Cap_ will also be launched in Dunedin on 20 March, in conjunction with the English Department of Otago University and UBS Otago, and in Christchurch at Madras Café Books in April.

**As part of the Dunedin Heritage Festival this month, Michael Harlow will be conducting a one-day Writing Workshop at the Caselberg Trust cottage in Broad Bay and he is looking forward to contributing to the life of both Otago University and of Dunedin during his dual residencies.**

**“For me”, he says, “the added bonus is being part of the University community again, and the Dunedin one at large. I've always found this community stimulating, and congenial".**
