"His Way" the bestselling biography of Robert Muldoon by Barry Gustafson has been awarded the 2001 Ian Wards Prize for published historical writing in the preceding calendar year.

The Ian Wards Prize recognises "an outstanding piece of published writing that makes imaginative and constructive use of New Zealand archives and/or manuscripts".

It was established by the Archives and Records Association of New Zealand as a tribute to the life-long contributions to New Zealand archives and history (in the broadest sense) of Ian McL Wards, former Chief Historian, Department of Internal Affairs.

The prize will be presented during a reception at the Wellington Town Hall on 24 August, during the Association’s Silver Jubilee Conference.

"His Way" has just been released in a paperback edition.
