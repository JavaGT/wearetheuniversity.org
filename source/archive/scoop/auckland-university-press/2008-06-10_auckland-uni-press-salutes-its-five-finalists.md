Auckland University Press Salutes Its Five Finalists in Montana NZ Book Awards

Auckland University Press has five finalist books, more finalists than any other single publisher, in the 2008 Montana New Zealand Book Awards shortlist announced today.

"I am really thrilled with the number and calibre of Auckland University Press books among the finalists for this year's Montana Book Awards," said Auckland University Press Director Sam Elworthy.

The AUP finalists are spread across the Award categories: The Age of Enterprise: Discovering the New Zealand Entrepreneur, 1880-1910 by Dr Ian Hunter (History); Waimarino County and Other Excursions by Martin Edmond (Biography); cold snack by Janet Charman and The Pop-Up Book of Invasions by Fiona Farrell (both Poetry); and the multi-authored work Look This Way: New Zealand Writers on New Zealand Artists conceived and edited by Sally Blundell (Reference and Anthology).

"Those five finalists--more than any other publisher--are a great tribute to the quality of our authors and to the publishing skills of the team here at the Press. We salute our authors Janet Charman, Fiona Farrell, Martin Edmond, Ian Hunter, and Sally Blundell."
