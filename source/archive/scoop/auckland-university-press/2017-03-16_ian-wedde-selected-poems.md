**This impressive collection of poetry shows the prolific nature of one of our favourite poets, ranging over four decades. This is the largest collection of Ian Wedde’s poems to date.**

  
How can language contain the world that spills

From its torn rinds, how can my ode hold

On to language that ejects itself like birdsong

From pine trees still shady with dawn . . .

‘To Mount Victoria’, _The Commonplace Odes_

Ian Wedde has constantly experimented with and pushed boundaries of form and influence in his poetry. With selections from 1971’s Homage to Matisse all the way through to 2013’s _The Lifeguard_, Ian Wedde’s _Selected Poems_ will introduce readers new and old to one of New Zealand’s most distinguished contemporary poets.

In a selection spanning four decades, a poet could be forgiven if their poems mellowed somewhat - not so with Wedde. Selected Poems shows a prolific lifetime of work from a wide-ranging, tenacious, conceptually rigorous yet romantic poet. His linguistically rich but intellectually inquisitive voice retains all its edge, and tracing that voice through fourteen diverse collections is one of the many pleasures readers will take from this book.

The book’s cover and internals feature original art by famed New Zealand artist, John Reynolds. This is a must-have for any lover of poetry at any level.
