FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
3 MARCH 2009

AUCKLAND UNIVERSITY PRESS AUTHOR A FINALIST IN CHILDREN’S BOOK AWARDS

Auckland University Press author Gregory O’Brien’s book Back & Beyond: New Zealand Painting for the Young and Curious (Auckland University Press, 2008) has been announced as a finalist in the 2009 New Zealand Post Book Awards for Children and Young Adults.

“Greg O’Brien blows a breeze of fresh air through the world of New Zealand painting in Back & Beyond to create a book that everyone from 10-year-old kids to 80-year-old artists rave to me about. And with good reason. The book is overflowing with intriguing ideas and arresting images about art and life in Aotearoa,” said Auckland University Press Director Sam Elworthy.

“Auckland University Press is very lucky to work with one of New Zealand’s great creative omnivores in author Greg O’Brien and we’re thrilled that Back and Beyond has been named a finalist in the New Zealand Post Book Awards.”

The finalists were selected from more than 130 children’s books published in New Zealand in 2008 and submitted for the awards. All winners will be announced at an awards ceremony held at Auckland Museum on Wednesday 20 May. Finalists will be participating in children’s book events around the country as part of a nationwide celebration of the New Zealand Post Book Awards. The festivities begin on Monday 11 May and continue through to Wednesday 20 May.

Gregory O’Brien, a graduate of The University of Auckland, is a past New Zealand Post winner. His Welcome to the South Seas: Contemporary New Zealand Art for Young People (Auckland University Press, 2004) took out top honours for non-fiction in 2005, won the 2005 LIANZA Elsie Locke Award and was a finalist in the 2005 Spectrum Print Design Awards.
