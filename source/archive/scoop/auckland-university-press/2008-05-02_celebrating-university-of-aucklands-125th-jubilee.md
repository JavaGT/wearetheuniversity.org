Book Celebrates University of Auckland’s 125th Jubilee

A new book, celebrating The University of Auckland’s 125th jubilee, The University of Auckland: The First 125 Years, will be launched by university alumna Dame Dorothy Winstone at a special function for former staff on Tuesday 6 May.

Established in 1883 at the heart of our largest city, The University of Auckland has played a central role in the life of this country for 125 years.

The richly illustrated jubilee book celebrates this story, from the days of the first few pupils studying in a rented disused courthouse and goal to the present, when almost 40,000 students attend classes on four main campuses across the city.

“The book also examines the central features of life at the University in the twenty-first century,” says publisher Dr Sam Elworthy, “the drive for world-class research across the faculties, the diversity of the student body, the strength of creative arts such as painting and literature, and the impact of Auckland staff and students on the life of the nation.”

The University of Auckland: The First 125 Years has been written by historian Nicholas Reid, a graduate of The University of Auckland and a well-known writer, book reviewer and the author of James Michael Liston: A Life (2006). It will be published on 9 May 2008.
