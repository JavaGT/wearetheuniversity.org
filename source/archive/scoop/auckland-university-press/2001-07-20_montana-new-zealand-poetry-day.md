Nau mai, haere mai ki te kete whiti o Aotearoa Welcome to the New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre at the University of Auckland

We are pleased to announce the establishment of the New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre (nzepc) at the University of Auckland on Montana New Zealand Poetry Day. This marks the culmination of a trial collaboration between several parts of the university and the poetic community.

The nzepc is a trial project based in the University of Auckland to set up an electronic gateway to poetry resources in Aotearoa/New Zealand and the Pacific region. It aims to coordinate existing archival and publishing information, and to present some full-text electronic publication of poetry and commentary in consultation with authors and their publishers.

The site is being developed by Michele Leggott (Department of English) and Brian Flaherty (University Library, co-editor of online literary journal Trout), with the support of the University Library and Auckland University Press.

Poets will be selected by an editorial committee and will represent leading voices, both contemporary and historical, in the region. Plans include the provision of a wide range of resources to users and the site will also offer a platform for electronic publication, an important audiovisual poetry archive and support for performance events.

Author pages already posted are: Alan Brunton, Murray Edmond, Michele Leggott, Bill Manhire, Elizabeth Smither, Kendrick Smithyman, Robert Sullivan and Ian Wedde. We are grateful for their assistance in these initial stages and also to artist Rick Killeen for the use of his images online.

For further information or to comment on nzepc please contact Michele Leggott, m.leggott@auckland.ac.nz or C/– Department of English, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.
