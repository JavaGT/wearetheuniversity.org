New book comes at right moment for broadcasting debates

This is a very important time for New Zealand Broadcasting. The idea of public service broadcasting is receiving increased attention (eg, with the current moves to introduce a TVNZ charter).

A new book by Dr Patrick Day of Waikato University, Voice and Vision: A History of NZ Broadcasting Volume Two, arrives at exactly the right moment. Day has a broad and passionate interest in public service broadcasting and his book will be of interest to everyone who cares about this issue.

Voice and Vision gives equal attention to radio and television. All future debate on the subject of public service broadcasting will need to start from this book, which takes up the story in 1950 and gives us the history of the "vision".

Voice and Vision is the culmination of 10 years' research into New Zealand's broadcasting history. Dr Day won a commission from the Broadcasting History Trust in 1990 to write a two-volume history of NZ broadcasting.

Voice and Vision was launched in Wellington on 4 October 2000 by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, The Rt Hon Jonathan Hunt.

About the Author Dr Patrick Day is a Senior lecturer in the Education Department of Waikato University. His main research interests are history, sociology and the New Zealand media and include New Zealand's mass media and social services.

Since he received the original commission to produce his history of New Zealand broadcasting, Dr Day has also had a Senior Scholar Fulbright grant and spent time at the University of Maryland and Stanford University. In 1999, he spent time in Dublin at the UCD, University College Dublin.
