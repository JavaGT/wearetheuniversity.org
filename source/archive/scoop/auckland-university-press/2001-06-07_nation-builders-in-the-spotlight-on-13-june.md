Nation Builders In The Spotlight On 13 June
===========================================

**Thursday, 7 June 2001, 3:06 pm**  
**Press Release: [Auckland University Press](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Press)**

Auckland University Press’s exciting 2001 list includes Brian Easton’s "The Nationbuilders" (September), which has much to tell us about the history of New Zealand and of being a New Zealander.

Wellington author Easton will talk about his forthcoming book at 12 noon, Wednesday 13 June, National Library Auditorium, Molesworth Street, Wellington.

"The Nationbuilders" weaves together the biographies of 16 significant New Zealanders in order to explore our ideas about nationhood, our economic and social development, our culture and a lot more besides.

These noteworthy New Zealanders include Julius Vogel, Gordon Coates, Bernard Ashwin, Peter Fraser, James Fletcher; Fintan Patrick Walsh, Douglas Robb, Denis Glover, Bill Sutch, Colin McCahon, Norman Kirk, Sonja Davies, Bryan Philpott, Rob Muldoon, Henry Lang and Bruce Jesson.

In some cases, the biographies in "The Nationbuilders" will be the longest biographies we currently have on these influential people. Even where full biographies exist, the chapters in this new book will add fresh material and original insights, while the book as a whole will reveal the interdependence of the nationbuilders’ efforts and achievements.

In the original version of Denis Glover’s “Home Thoughts”, the poet thinks “of how that little band / Of pilgrims viewed their Promised Land.”

These 16 New Zealanders tried to turn that promise into a reality. "The Nationbuilders" tells their story, and the author hopes in a small way that it will encourage us, their successors, to do the same.

"The Nationbuilders" Brian Easton September 2001; paperback; $39.95
