**Aloe Takes A Gold At 2010 Pride In Print Awards**  

  
**ALOE**, a poetry collection by Wellington author Diana Bridge, has taken a **Gold** in the **Books category** of the **2010 Pride in Print Awards**.

Printers Astra, who submitted _Aloe_ for the Awards, also won Gold for innovation, based on their ISO Colour management system - the first print company in New Zealand to achieve this status.

_Aloe_’s cover was designed by Spencer Levine, the 2009 Awa Press Young Designer of the Year, and internal design was by Katrina Duncan, Auckland University Press.

**MARTI FRIEDLANDER** by Len Bell, published by Auckland University Press, was **Highly Commended** in the Books category of the Pride in Print Awards.

“Good books should look great - and ALOE and MARTI FRIEDLANDER do just that,” said Auckland University Press Director Dr Sam Elworthy.

“We take enormous pride in the design and production values that we bring to our publishing at Auckland University Press and, working with local printers and talented designers, it’s a real thrill to produce such spectacular work.”

**MARTI FRIEDLANDER** **is also a finalist** in the Best Illustrated Book category of the **2010** **PANZ Book Design Awards**. The winners of the Design Awards will be announced at a ceremony in Auckland on 22 July, along with the Awa Press Young Designer of the Year.

The 2010 Pride in Print Awards were presented in Auckland on Friday night, 18 June, at a gala event hosted by John Campbell and Carol Hirschfeld.
