C K Stead Made A Distinguished Citizen Of Auckland

Auckland University Press congratulates poet, novelist and critic C K Stead ONZ, CBE, on being made a Distinguished Citizen of the City of Auckland.

"Karl Stead is New Zealand's literary giant - in poetry, fiction, and criticism. He brings great verve, wit, and energy to all his work and invigorates the cultural life of New Zealand by talking about literature at readings and festivals throughout the country and around the world. We are proud to have published Karl Stead's poetry and criticism over the years, including his outstanding new collection THE BLACK RIVER," said Press Director Dr Sam Elworthy.

Now Professor Emeritus, Stead was Professor of English at the University of Auckland for over 20 years. His outstanding service to New Zealand literature has brought him many other awards and honours. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, received the CBE in 1974, was elected Honorary Visiting Fellow of St John's College, Oxford in 1997, received an Honorary Doctorate in Letters from the University of Bristol in 2001, was awarded the prestigious CNZ Michael King Fellowship ($NZ100,000) in 2005 and was made an extraordinary member of the Order of New Zealand in 2007.

The Mayor of Auckland City Dick Hubbard presented Professor Stead ONZ, CBE, with the Distinguished Citizen Award at a function in the city on Monday night.

"Professor C K Stead has dedicated his life to the literary arts, and recognising his contributions is important," said Mayor Hubbard.

"His work is recognised and celebrated throughout the world, and it is a privilege to be able to present such a prestigious award to one of our country's most outstanding citizens."
