New Business Book Provides Keys to Growth for SMEs

Changing Gears: How to Take Your Kiwi Business From the Kitchen Table to the Board Room by David Irving, Darl Kolb, Deborah Shepherd & Christine Woods (Auckland University Press)

At last, a practical guide to one of New Zealand’s biggest business problems: How can we grow our small to medium sized enterprises \[SMEs\] into world-class companies?

The ICEHOUSE co-founder David Irving has teamed up with colleagues from The University of Auckland Business School to produce Changing Gears, an insightful guide for SME owner-managers wanting to scale up their business.

In easy-to-read format, the book explains how owner-managers can tackle some of their biggest issues.

The book shows how to align skills, knowledge and company structures at each step along the path to growth.

It examines the interplay between the owner and his/her business and provides tips on how to manage each interlocking aspect of work and personal life.

It details how owner-managers can overcome loneliness, learn to delegate, set up high-performance teams, and look after their own health and wellbeing.

The authors draw inspiration from New Zealand owner-managers, the understated heroes of our economy.

David Irving says the SME segment of New Zealand’s economy is often overlooked.

“Yet the 2009 Privately-Owned Business Barometer shows the sector has a value several times the size of our publicly-listed markets and forms the engine room of our country’s future economic growth.”

Sir Stephen Tindall, DCNZM, founder of The Warehouse and Tindall Foundation, says, “The owner-manager is a critical part of New Zealand’s economy and future. Changing Gears is a fantastic guide book for Kiwi businesses as they strive to go to the next stage in their journey.

“It is great to see such insight coming from a group of talented New Zealanders who have developed a real deep niche and knowledge of the Kiwi business person.”

Changing Gears celebrates the vision and tenacity of New Zealand’s owner-managers and provides the tools for taking a small business from the kitchen table to the board room.

Bill Day, managing director of marine services company Seaworks, describes Changing Gears as the Kiwi entrepreneur’s handbook.

“It covers every aspect of growing your own business and even tells you what to eat for breakfast!

“I wish this book had been around when I was starting up because I would have made far fewer mistakes and eaten far better breakfasts.

“Get this book, highlight the parts that are most relevant to you, scribble all over it, make it your own and keep it in your top drawer as you will be dipping into it frequently.”

Sam Elworthy of Auckland University Press is proud to publish this great Kiwi business book – Changing Gears.

“From dairy farms in the King Country to furniture factories in Petone, New Zealand’s economy is driven by owner-managers running small and medium sized businesses.

“In this new book, a talented author team has pulled together the key insights that will enable those hard working men and women to grow their businesses in New Zealand and around the world.”
