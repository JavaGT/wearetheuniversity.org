**Mister Hamilton**  
John Dickson

**Mister Hamilton is John Dickson’s first collection of poetry in eighteen years.**

_For many years I lived in Southland  
In fact, I am from Southland.  
Some people say my speech is slow  
I say it’s deliberate, just.  
And my soul runs dark  
like Southland’s slow intestinal rivers  
laden with manuka dust.  
And my detachment from anything plain._

  
Mister Hamilton is an appealing, questioning mix of elements. Over a base of South Island bedrock (granite, schist, greywacke), Dickson has peopled this quietly fiery collection with day-to-day working voices, shifts and narratives (sometimes comic, sometimes tragic) charged with a political consciousness and lyrical intensity.

Shot-through with a vein of jazz, rock and blues, a quizzical religiosity, a streak of the absurd: this book takes a fresh look at the streets and lawns and people of urban and suburban ‘Pig Island’ and from that space offers some careful, wisely pitched and immensely likeable poems.

And who is Mister Hamilton? A familiar everyman, a voice of authority, a common presence, an old friend – readers may make up their own minds after spending time in the company of Dickson and his book_._

Descended from a mix of Irish, Scots and English ancestors, **John Dickson** was born in 1944 at Milton, South Otago. John worked at The Bill Robertson Library in Dunedin for many years, and was Burns Fellow at the University of Otago in 1988. He is the author of the poetry collections _what happened on the way to Oamaru_(1986) and _sleeper_ (Auckland University Press, 1998), as well as an audio CD _Plain Song_ (2009). In 2000, John Dickson was the Writer-in-Residence at the University of Waikato.

**Mister Hamilton** is published by AUP on 22 August 2016, RRP $24.99
