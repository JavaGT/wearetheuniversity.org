Occupy Auckland University to negotiate demands
===============================================

**Occupy Auckland University to negotiate demands**

Occupation seems to be the new popular form of protest on small and large scales. University students in both Auckland and Wellington have done their own occupations to protest fee increases and programme cuts. The ongoing one at the University of Auckland is getting dramatic. Scoop received the following communication from Hala Nasr of WeAreTheUniversity at around 4.10pm today:

Around 100 people are marching against fees that are being raised at the University of Auckland. Currently we have occupied the council room in the clock tower. We’re going to hold a General Assembly to discuss demands, which include free education and the demilitarization of the campus. There are a group of police officers with dog handlers outside the clock tower.
