**Students occupy Business School at University of Auckland**

26th Septmber 2011

Students at the University of Auckland have occupied the top floor of the Owen G Glenn Building in opposition to three key issues: the Voluntary Student Membership (VSM) bill, due to pass its third reading on the 28th September, the erosion of democracy on campus and the regular hiking of student fees.

At around 2pm, over 300 students stormed the foyer of the building and have blockaded the doors in protest to increasing corporatism at universities across the country.

Spokesperson Guy Cohen says, “This is an amazing turn-out and really demonstrates that student unity still exists. This is a rebirth of the sort of action that has traditionally been the domain of the university, as the critical conscience of society. This will send a strong message to the Vice Chancellor that we are the university and we will defend it.”

ENDS.
