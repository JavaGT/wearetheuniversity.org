**Applications for the Motu Thesis Scholarship are now open.**

Every year, the Motu Research and Education Foundation offers a one-year $10,000 scholarship to a promising university student of Māori descent planning to work on an Honours, Masters or PhD thesis. The preference is that this topic be in economics, or some other social science, and use a quantitative methodology.

“By offering this scholarship, we hope to encourage students of Māori descent to develop an interest in researching topics relevant to public policy development,” said Adam B Jaffe, Director of Motu Economic and Public Policy Research Trust. “Motu is committed to improving the level of public policy debate in this country and that means we’re committed to enhancing Māori research capacity.”

One of Motu’s key tasks is to build New Zealand’s ability in the area of economic and public policy research. Part of this is to improve the skills of individuals, groups and institutions to carry out empirical and theoretical research on New Zealand public policy through training, collaboration, and sponsorship of students or researchers.

“There are some amazing researchers out there,” said Dr Jaffe. “Many of them want to study overseas and the danger is that they get captured there. We’re hoping that if we help the good ones while they’re young, they might remember us fondly as they mature and come home to an international academic life in this country.”

Some past recipients of the scholarship include:
