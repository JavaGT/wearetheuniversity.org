Unitec wins unique case against Government

Unitec has won their court case against the Government today after a long battle to prove that the suspension by the Government of Unitec’s application for University Status was unlawful.

“This decision proves that the Labour government has its own agenda when deciding whether or not Unitec should become a university. There is no other reason why the government would have delayed the decision-making process unless it wanted to influence the outcome,” says Robert Freeth, President, Unitec Student Union

The outcome proved that the Associate Minister Steve Maharey unlawfully suspended Unitec’s university application, breached the laws of natural justice and breached the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990.

“The only expectation now is that the settlement amount is adequate and reflects the seriousness of the Government’s reckless actions,” says Freeth.

“Compensation from the Government is valuable money that will make up for the funding wasted on battling for fair and due process,” says Freeth.

“Students will see this epic win as a well earned victory” Say Freeth. “They will see this as the first victory for Unitec in gaining its rightful status as a University” Says Freeth.
