USU Honours Top Unitec Athletes for 2007

Unitec’s sporting heroes were honoured, this week, at the USU (Students’ Association at Unitec) and Unitec Sporting Blue Awards, with Sportsperson of the Year going to New Zealand Yachting representative Scott Illingworth.

USU Sport Coordinator and awards organiser Julie Bennett says the awards recognise the students’ ability to achieve outstanding sporting success while studying.

“It’s about recognising those students who can get the balance right between sporting and academic achievement,” says Bennett.

Scott Illingworth was awarded Sportsperson of the year for his achievement of second place, along with his sailing partner, in the 420 World Championships in Spain (August 2006) and in Auckland (January 2007). Illingworth was awarded with the annual trophy and a cash prize, which was donated by the National Bank.

Illingworth was surprised and honoured to be given the award.

The panel of judges included Rex Thomson (Chairperson), Adam Beach (USU president), Ed Mason (School of Communications’ lecturer and sports journalist) and Emma Haigh and Josh Coxen (current students). When choosing the award recipients the judges took into account the level of the students’ sporting achievements, academic achievements and contribution to sport in the community,.
