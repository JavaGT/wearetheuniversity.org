Prebs Rebs - following Mad Dog

Prebs Rebs - following Mad Dog

Young Labour

  
"It seems that the Prebbles' Rebels are following in the footsteps of their mentor when it comes to personalised attacks on their opponents," Jordan Carter, Vice President of Young Labour commented this afternoon.

"After their election loss, the entire right is in disarray. The Rebels seem to be following this trend. Instead of putting forward their own views, they are merely attacking me personally - much the same as the Young Nats tried to do some weeks ago.

"For Clint Heine's information (President of the Rebels), it is he and not me who is out of touch with young people today. Heine's dream society is one where poor people are left to waste away on their own, where the environment is at the mercy of anyone who wants to abuse it, and where opportunity is only there for those who can afford to buy it.

"Young people don't follow that view. Most of us actually care about our country and our society. Socialism is the ideological framework which distills that instinctive caring for others into a coherent political programme," continued Jordan Carter.

"While most shy away from the word these days, the truth of the matter is that the only alternative to the new right reforms the world is turning its back on is democratic socialism. Parties like Labour are enjoying electoral success around the world, with the support of young people. Economic success in today's changing world depends on everyone having access to health and education - a core socialist ideal, and something Clint Heine's party opposes.

"Far from me living in the past," concluded Jordan Carter, "it's Clint Heine who wants to go back to the Victorian age. He's free to do so - but he's not got young people behind him."
