Labour Highlights Sale of Prime Assets
======================================

**Labour Highlights Sale of Prime Assets**

A phony auction of state assets is being held in Civic Square in Hamilton on October 7th from midday. Waikato Young Labour Chairperson Brendan Madley says that the event is being organised to highlight that a re-elected National government will sell our most valuable and important state assets.

‘These assets should be helping all New Zealanders. Air New Zealand, Mighty River Power and Genesis Energy, among others, are on the chopping block - its frankly scary how much of an impact the sales will have for the ordinary Kiwi family already struggling with the higher cost of living. If they are sold, profits will go to the wealthy few and flow overseas. The majority of families will have to pay higher bills. We will be selling control of our future and putting our economic recovery at risk’ says Brendan Madley.

The event is being organized by Waikato Young Labour to mark the launch of the Young Labour nation-wide campaign.
