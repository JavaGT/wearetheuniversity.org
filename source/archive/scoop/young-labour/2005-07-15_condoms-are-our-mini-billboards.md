Condoms are our 'mini billboards'

Young Labour, the youth wing of the New Zealand Labour Party, has taken a novel approach to talking to young people about politics this year - condoms.

"We are handing out condoms with stickers on them that say 'be safe with Labour' and 'don't get screwed by National" said Conor Roberts, President of Young Labour.

"They are our little mini billboards.

"People always take them with a bit of a laugh, we use them to initiate a conversation with young people who aren't normally engaged in the normal course of political events. Its Young Labour's job to get youth interested in politics and the condoms are a part of that.

"Talking with young people about the issues they are concerned about, it is obvious that their interests are different to what they might hear about in the media.

"Young Labour is metting a good response when we're out there talking about how this government didn't send combat troops to Iraq, how there is more New Zealand music on the radio and TV, how Labour will keep New Zealand nuclear free and how we have invested heaps more in tertiary education" concluded Roberts
