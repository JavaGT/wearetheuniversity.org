Young Labour slams right wing arrogance

**Young Labour slams right wing arrogance**

Young Labour President Moana Mackey today slammed ACT leader Richard Prebble and National's David Carter for their vitriolic attack on the integrity of students. "This again highlights their appalling lack of concern for youth issues," Ms. Mackey said.

Both MP's claim that Labour's policy to ease the financial burden on students by reducing interest on loans for full time students and low income graduates, will entice students to play the stockmarket or take expensive holidays - costing taxpayers "over a billion dollars".

"This about face by two parties who continually claim to support individual responsibility and accountability is amazing. Clearly National and ACT only trust individual decision making when it doesn't cost the Government anything, or if they can make a profit out of it."

"While Labour is concerned with the detrimental effect of crippling debt on young graduates - and the consequent impact on participation rates - it is clear that all National and ACT care about is money. Unfortunately for them, we have carefully costed our policies, so their selfish cynical scaremongering is redundant."

"It is hard enough as it is to raise youth issues, and have them treated seriously, without an elected representative like Richard Prebble trivializing such matters with questionable statistics and an alarming ignorance of the facts," Miss Mackey said.

"It is more likely that the facts do not best serve Mr. Prebble's cause."

"This would explain his desperate claim that Labour will adopt the Alliance's land tax in order to fund tertiary education. Labour has been clear on this point. I suggest Mr. Prebble find a new dead horse to flog," commented Miss Mackey.

"It is obvious National and ACT intend to run a scare campaign based on wild speculation and unfettered fabrication. I guess that's the only option left when the truth does not work in your favour," concluded Miss Mackey.
