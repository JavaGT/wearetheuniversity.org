National Comments Appalling - Young Labour
==========================================

\*National Comments Appalling - Young Labour \*

Young Labour is appalled by recent comments made by senior National MPs and now a junior candidate.

National's Dunedin North candidate and number 49 on the list, Michael Woodhouse said in the Otago University students' magazine \*Critic\*, "I love spring around here, it's bloody fantastic, the skirts were never this short in my day.\[i\] "

Young Labour President, Eric Goddard says, "This is yet another example of why the National Party are not fit to govern. Not only do they say and think highly inappropriate things about Pacific and Asian peoples – but they also make very sexist and seedy comments about young students."

"It is totally unacceptable in 2008 to be a misogynist, especially when you want to represent women and men in Parliament. There is no guarantee that Michael Woodhouse would treat people fairly when he holds such out of date ideas," said Goddard.

"New Zealanders cannot trust National to be in government – their foot in mouth problems are a sign that National is a party from a century passed."
