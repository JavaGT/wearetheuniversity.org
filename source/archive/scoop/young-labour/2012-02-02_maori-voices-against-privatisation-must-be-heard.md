Maori voices against privatisation must be heard

**Maori voices against privatisation must be heard**

2 February 2012

Young Labour today reiterated their call for an end to National’s planned sale of our state assets and encouraged young Maori all around the country to speak up against the selling off of our most important state assets.

Young Labour Maori Vice-President Morehu Rei said “The recent breakdown between the Maori Party and National is yet another sign of the deep unrest that this plan for state asset sales has generated".

“The revelation that the Government's original intention was to keep a crucial Treaty of Waitangi clause out of legislation required for state asset sales is outrageous and if this is the case the Maori Party should walk away from their confidence and supply agreement with the Government”.

“While Young Labour completely opposes the Prime Minister’s plan to exclude references to the Treaty of Waitangi in legislation required for his asset sales, from our point of view the whole debate is irrelevant because there should be no sale of our most strategic assets" added Rei.

"Any sale will have a hugely negative impact on the rights of Maori under the treaty and on the long-term economic future of Aotearoa. We therefore encourage young Maori from all over the country to attend and voice their opinions at the Government's series of hui that will be held around New Zealand."

Young Labour Maori Representative Arena Williams stressed the importance of young peoples’ involvement in this hui. She said that “Rangatahi must be heard in this process".
