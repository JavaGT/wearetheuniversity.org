Young Labour requests an apology from John Key

07 August 2008

Young Labour today requests an apology from John Key after Duncan Garner revealed that his source was not a member of Labour, or any other political party.

Young Labour President, Eric Goddard said, \"Mr Key has consistently accused Young Labour of being behind the secret recordings of Bill English and Lockwood Smith being caught out telling the truth at their recent conference."

"I expect an apology for his dishonest accusations, which border on a tantrum-like after having our organisation drawn into this scandal in an attempt to deflect Mr Key's own short comings as a leader. Kiwis deserve better."

"Mr Key's knee jerk reaction and strange sense of paranoia has shown he isn't ready to lead the country, let alone his own party. If National's 'leadership' team are spooked by a bunch of students' how is he going to face the challenges of running the country?"

"This is not the first time Mr Key has wrongly accused Young Labour of being involved in a dirty tricks campaign, despite Young Labour continuing to campaign positively on the issues that matter," added Goddard.

"We feel that Duncan Garner's stellar journalism has vindicated Young Labour, and has put the spot light firmly back on John Key and National's secret agenda," concluded Goddard
