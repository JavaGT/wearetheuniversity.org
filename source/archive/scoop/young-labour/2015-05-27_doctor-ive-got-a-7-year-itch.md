Doctor, I’ve got a 7 year itch

Doctor, I’ve got a 7 year itch  

  
Young Labour supports the campaign by the New Zealand Medical Students’ Association to have the 7 year lifetime limit on student loans scrapped.

“This policy by the National Government makes no sense. It means that medical school students may be unable to graduate, or have to defer their graduation” said Young Labour President Katie Wilson.

“What’s more concerning is that the policy undermines the Government’s own commitment to fund more medical school places. There’s little point funding more places when students are unable to afford to finish their studies, graduate and become a medical doctor.

“Young Labour believes that support for future graduates should continue throughout their undergraduate degrees. Medical students are unfairly affected by the simple fact their degree takes longer to finish.

"We welcome the call from the Young Nats to grant a two year extension for medical students, however Young Labour also believes the cap should be scrapped all together" says Wilson.
