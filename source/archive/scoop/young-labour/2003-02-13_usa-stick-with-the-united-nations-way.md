USA: Stick with the United Nations way

“Do what is right – and keep working through the United Nations,” is Young Labour’s message to the United States of America today.

As the tension between the United States and Europe mounts over how to deal with the situation in Iraq, Young Labour members are urging America and its allies to stick with the difficult but proper process of working through the United Nations.

“Only by pursuing a multilateral course can the United States turn aside allegations that it is acting against the will of the rest of the world,” said Young Labour President Jordan Carter.

“It is vitally important that before decisions to use force are made, the inspections process that is currently in place is given the time to work. Every single peaceful means for Iraq to be disarmed must be explored before anything else is considered.

“The carnage, death and destruction that would be dealt out to literally hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians has to remain foremost in the minds of the international community. Only a clear failure by Iraq to comply with the will of the international community could possibly justify the cost of war.

“New Zealand’s stance, as expressed by Helen Clark in Parliament yesterday, is an appropriate one. We are pleased to join the Government in urging Iraq to comply fully and quickly with the will of the international community, and in arguing that war is still avoidable,” Jordan Carter said.
