Young Nationals sink into the mire

Young Nationals sink into the mire

Moana Mackey, President of Young Labour, has met the Young Nat's latest profession of concern for the wellbeing of students with amusement this evening.

\"Clearly the National Party has struggled to find a single flaw in Labour's student loans policy, resulting in this rather desperate attack on students. What National have implied is that students are irresponsible and undeserving of any assistance. Yet, they claim to be vying for the student vote. If I were them I'd review my tactics."

"National has caused the $3 billion+ student debt problem - it's as simple as that. Does anyone really believe that they now intend to fix it? Labour offers the fairest deal for students; National offers only rising fees and rising debts," Moana Mackey continued.

"More of the same is the name of the game for National," Ms. Mackey concluded.
