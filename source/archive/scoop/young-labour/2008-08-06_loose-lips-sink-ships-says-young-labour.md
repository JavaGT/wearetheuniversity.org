Press Release | For Immediate Release

Loose lips sink ships says Young Labour

6 August 2008

Young Labour President Eric Goddard denies John Key's accusation that Young Labour was involved in secret recordings of Bill English and Lockwood Smith at the National Party conference in the weekend.

"Young Labour was not involved in the recordings that caught Bill English and Lockwood Smith telling the truth," says Mr Goddard.

"This is a blatant attempt to divert attention from the real issue arising from the recordings. Key should spend less time making up allegations against Young Labour and more time concerning himself with the post-election plans of his caucus. Bill and John don't need to be afraid of a bunch of university students, they should be more afraid of their caucus' loose lips."

Key tried to divert attention from Nicky Hager's allegations by attacking Labour, now he's trying to divert attention from these revelations by attacking Young Labour. When will he take responsibility for the real concerns New Zealanders have about National's real agenda?", added Goddard.

"The fact is that National has been caught out saying that they'll sell Kiwibank and that they're prepared to say one thing before the election then do something else afterwards.

"Personally I hope this is an inside job by the principled members of the National Party that continue to leak information to Nick Hager."
