**Press Release: [Young Labour](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Young_Labour)**

Today Green Party MP Nandor Tanzcos promised students the Green Party would end the student loan scheme and reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit.

“Nandor Tanczos must have been smoking ganja if he thinks the promises the Greens are making at present can be delivered” Waikato Young Labour spokesperson Daniel Rimmer says

“Students have had more out of the Labour Government than any other group other than superannuants since the Labour - Alliance Government came to power in 1999” stated Mr Rimmer

Nationally students have saved $68.5 million last year in student loan interest wipe off alone. While an additional $800 million has been spent on the student loan scheme and student initiatives. These figures include savings of $3.5 m for Waikato University students and $1.8m for Waikato Polytechnic students. Fees have also been frozen for 2001 and 2002.

“Also today Waikato Students’ Union marked that tenth anniversary of the student loans scheme with a birthday cake celebrating the fact that under Labour Student loans are cheaper and are being paid off quicker.

Labour’s election promise of 1999 was to “cut the cost to students of tertiary education, starting with a fairer loans scheme” “Never before have such specific promises been made to students and been delivered by previous National Governments” Daniel Rimmer states.

“Labour was careful at the last election to make specific promises on the interest on student loans and we have delivered on those promises” concludes Mr. Rimmer

Tomorrow at 11.30am Labour MPs Nanaia Mahuta and Dianne Yates will speak on campus during the Orientation festival.
