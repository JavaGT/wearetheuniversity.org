"Don't cut our future" says Young Labour
========================================

**"Don't cut our future" says Young Labour**

**PRESS REALEASE: For Immediate Release**

Young Labour has elected a talented new executive for 2011, and is ready to take the fight to National in November's election. Newly-elected Young Labour President Ella Hardy spoke out against the "inequitable" cuts in the Government's latest Budget, which she said proved that National has no plan for New Zealand's economy.

“Under this Government we're going backwards. John Key and National have no plan to deal with the rising unemployment and living costs facing working New Zealanders” said Hardy. “This will be the first generation of New Zealanders worse off than its predecessors”

“As young New Zealanders we want to help our country prosper in the future, but it's hard to do that when education, investment, and other opportunities are being cut by those who benefited from them in the past.”

Hardy highlighted discriminatory and short-sighted changes to student loans for part-time students and those over the age of 55, as well as the changes to Kiwisaver. "National have broken their promises on Kiwisaver and introduced changes that shatter youth confidence in the scheme. Cutting our savings scheme at a time when New Zealand needs to invest its future will only harm young people in the coming years" Ella Hardy concluded.
