Young Labour Renewed

WELLINGTON – “A fresh face for Young Labour” is how Young Labour \[YL\] Spokesperson Jonathon Jones described the result of the organisation’s Annual Conference held last weekend.

Young Labour gathered in Wellington to determine its priorities over the next year and elect a new executive. Reaching beyond the main centres, the conference was attended by delegates from around the country including several representatives from Invercargill, New Plymouth and Hamilton.

“Over half of YL’s new executive committee are fresh faces as well”, says Jones, “which is great, it brings a lot of new ideas and energy to our organisation.”

The conference also celebrated the successes of the past year – including YL’s contribution to the 2005 General Election campaign victory and the No Interest on Student Loans Policy that was introduced on April 1st.

“In part, the no-interest policy was a recognition of the work Young Labour had being doing for a long time to raise awareness of the issue” said Jones. “It really shows the impact young people can have in politics.

The conference also formally agreed that Young Labour support the union-led campaign to abolish unfair youth rates; support the campaign to repeal Section 59 of the Crimes Act; and take steps to raise political awareness of the need to respond to climate change.

“For those who say we’re tired, this conference sends a message,” said Jones, “That they are just plain wrong. From out perspective, under a third term Labour-led government, political activism right now is youthful, energetic and diverse.
