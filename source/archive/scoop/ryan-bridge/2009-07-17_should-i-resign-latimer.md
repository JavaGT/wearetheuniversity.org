"Should I Resign?"- Latimer

Ryan Bridge | Independent Journalist | 17 July 2009

An embattled student politician has reportedly asked fellow executive members if he should resign from his position at the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association (VUWSA).

It's been a trying week for VUWSA's Education Officer, Robert Latimer, who made headlines after failing to front-up to allegations he lost confidential documents relating to Victoria students.

Latimer has reportedly asked members of VUWSA's executive, including president Jasmine Freemantle, if they believe he is fit for the job.

The question came less than 24 hours after Latimer faced the public in a bid to have him removed from his position. The bid failed after the public meeting didn't reach quorum.

VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle today confirmed that she'd been approached by Latimer.

"Robert asked me if I thought it'd be a good idea for him to resign. I told him that he should reflect on what he's achieved and decide if he thinks he still has the support of the student body," Freemantle said.

When interviewed on Wednesday afternoon, Latimer confirmed he would be considering his future at VUWSA regardless of the outcome of the vote \[to have him rolled\].

"I will be thinking about my role as Education Officer and will make a decision about whether to stay on"

Several other VUWSA executive members have confirmed they've also been approached. Latimer reportedly plans to seek the opinions of all executive members by the end of the week.
