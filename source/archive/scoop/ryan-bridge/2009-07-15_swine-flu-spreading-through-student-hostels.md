Swine Flu Spreading Through Student Hostels

• 3 New suspected cases in the last 48 hours

• Allegations of unhygienic conditions

Ryan Bridge | Independent Journalist |15 July 2009

The Capital’s largest University is under fire from students following an outbreak of suspected swine flu cases and allegations of unhygienic and cramped living conditions.

Student hostels owned by Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) admit that three suspected swine flu cases have been reported in the last 48 hours, prompting a late night meeting on Tuesday amongst the University’s residential advisors.

The news comes just weeks after two students, who were both confirmed to have the virus, were quarantined for up to 72 hours at Helen Lawry Hall in Karori.

The three latest suspected cases, two of which are from Helen Lawry Hall, are currently seeking medical advice and being urged to steer clear of fellow students.

Victoria University Students’ Association Welfare Vice President, Seamus Brady, says he has received several complaints from students about the state of Helen Lawry Hall.

“I’m concerned about the conditions that students of the \[Helen Lawry\] hall are living in. Students are genuinely worried about the damp and mouldy walls, ceilings and floors,” Brady said.

At least 6 students were treated at Victoria’s Health Clinic in Kelburn today after presenting to medical staff with flu-like symptoms.

The Victoria University Communications team today failed to respond to media enquiries.
