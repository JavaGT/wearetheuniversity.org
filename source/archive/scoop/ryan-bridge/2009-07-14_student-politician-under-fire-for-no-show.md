Student Politician Under Fire For No-Show

Student Politician Under Fire For No-Show

Ryan Bridge | Tuesday 14 July

A student politician has failed to front-up to allegations he’s responsible for losing a student-owned laptop and wasting time and money on a failed database project.

Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA) Education Officer, Robert Latimer, declined several invitations by a student radio show to face-off with VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle in a live debate.

After several attempts by The VBC Breakfast show to persuade Latimer to join the debate, which was set to take place this Wednesday morning, Latimer sighted time restrictions as a reason for his no-show.

“I am well aware of the importance of this issue. I have to attend my classes in the first week. None of those times I am free. What questions do you want to ask?” Latimer said.

However, VUWSA President Jasmine Freemantle doesn’t buy the excuse, because Latimer was offered a range of different time slots to attend the debate.

“I’m disappointed he’s not willing to be accountable to students… it’s yet another example of \[Latimer\] undermining the democratic process,” Freemantle said.

VBC Managing Co-Director Matthew Davis today confirmed that Freemantle will still be interviewed on the show, ahead of a vote to ‘roll’ both Latimer and herself, from 9:30 am on Wednesday.

Tune in to the VBC breakfast show at 88.3 FM in central Wellington, or stream it live at www.vbc.org.nz.
