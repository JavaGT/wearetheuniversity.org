Students Welcome National's Focus On Allowances
===============================================

Talk of universal student allowances at the weekend's National Party regional conference has been welcomed by the national student union, the Aotearoa Post-compulsory Student Union (APSU).

National Party deputy leader Wyatt Creech said the National Party would begin a "searching review" of policy and will look at universal allowances as part of that review.

"APSU has argued for a long time it is grossly unfair to punish people for studying by denying them access to living support," said David Penney, National President of APSU.

"Mr Creech's comments on the weekend regarding universal allowances means National is moving closer to the policy position held by the majority (Alliance, Greens, NZ First, United) of political parties in Parliament."

"We hope the National Party will continue to think about supporting - rather than punishing - people who are bettering themselves. We also hope that the National Party will look again at its policies on Student Loans."

"Given that a 'radical conservative' party is looking seriously at universal allowances, we believe it is only logical that the centre-left Labour Party in Government should act," concluded David Penney.
