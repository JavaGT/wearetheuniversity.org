University Of Auckland Business School Secures Business Education's Triple Crown

The University of Auckland Business School has passed a significant milestone on its path to world-class status with accreditation awarded by the US-based quality assurance scheme AACSB International (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business).

"This is a major international acknowledgement of the high quality of our faculty, our students and our business programmes" says Professor Barry Spicer, Dean of The University of Auckland Business School.

"We're delighted with the accolade. It greatly enhances the international standing of our graduates' degrees and diplomas and also our ability to recruit top calibre researchers and teaching staff from around the world."

AACSB accreditation gives the Business School the third leg of business education's coveted "Triple Crown" after being accredited in November by EQUIS, the quality assurance scheme of the European Foundation for Management Development.

The Business School is already a member of the UK-based AMBA (Association of MBAs).

"This achievement reflects well not only on The University of Auckland but the entire New Zealand business education sector," says Professor Spicer.

Professor Spicer says accreditation follows the Business School's top ranking among New Zealand business schools in the Government's Performance-Based Research Fund review of research quality released last year.
