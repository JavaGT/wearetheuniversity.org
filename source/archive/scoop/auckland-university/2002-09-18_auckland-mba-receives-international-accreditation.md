The Auckland MBA receives international accreditation

The University of Auckland Business School's MBA programme has recently received an official accreditation by the Association of MBAs (AMBA) at an official certification ceremony in Barcelona.

The University of Auckland Business School Director of The Auckland MBA Professor Geoff Lorigan says the MBA is one of the most prestigious graduate qualifications and the Association works to make sure that the expansion in the number of business schools is matched by an equal concern for quality.

"The AMBA accreditation is one of the three most recognised accreditation authorities in the world.

"For our MBA graduates, this accreditation will give their qualification a new level of international recognition. They also get the opportunity to join AMBA and enjoy the number of networking opportunities the Association provides," Professor Lorigan says.

Other members of the Association of MBA's include the London Business School and INSEAD.

The Association of MBAs accreditation system has been established for over 25 years and is unique in monitoring the quality of MBA programmes.
