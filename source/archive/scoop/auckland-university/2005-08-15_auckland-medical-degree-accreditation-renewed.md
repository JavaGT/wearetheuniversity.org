University of Auckland Medical Degree accreditation renewed

The University of Auckland's Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences has taken another step forward in securing maximum accreditation for its medical programme from the Australian Medical Council, the accrediting organisation for Australian and New Zealand medical schools.

The 10-year renewal of accreditation, until June 2015, is for the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) degree in the School of Medicine.

"The renewal of accreditation is an international acknowledgement of the quality of our teaching and research and our contribution to the medical community," says Professor Peter Smith, Dean of Medical and Health Sciences.

"We're delighted with the accolade. It will continue to enhance the international standing of our graduates' qualifications and also our ability to recruit top calibre researchers and teaching staff from around the world."

The School of Medicine has received a full and unconditional six-year accreditation from the Australian Medical Council and a further four years will be confirmed in the fifth year of accreditation, subject to the submission of satisfactory annual reports. The renewal comes 10 years after the School's initial accreditation.

Head of the School of Medicine Professor Iain Martin says the accreditation is "a very positive report on the medical programme".

"Over the last four years, the curriculum has been evolving to keep pace with new developments and advancements. To have a team of international experts come in and review our programme thoroughly, and renew accreditation for 10 years, the maximum period you can be accredited, is a fantastic endorsement of the Faculty's strengths."

The accreditation review panel commended the strong culture of research within the School, with many teachers being active researchers, the high quality teaching resources and the large number of highly motivated and committed clinical teachers.

The panel highlighted the adoption of an evolutionary approach to curriculum development and an outcome-based curriculum, a focus on national health priorities, and an active student body committed to contributing to the quality and development of the programme as some of the strengths of the School.

"The panel also took into account our good relationships with the Ministry of Health and District Health Boards, and strong links with bodies that oversee postgraduate medical training."

When presenting the findings of the accreditation review, the panel chair concluded with the following remarks: "the team has been greatly impressed by the on-going commitment of the University, staff and clinical teachers to development and delivery of a high quality medical course that is relevant to the healthcare needs of the communities of New Zealand, the Pacific and beyond".
