University of Auckland Associate Professor Appointed to Prestigious Music Board

  
An Associate Professor at The University of Auckland has been voted onto the board of the prestigious International Federation of Choral Music at the Sixth World Choral Symposium in Minneapolis, USA.

Dr Karen Grylls, head of the University’s School of Music, was invited to join the International Board of Directors on August 7 2002.

This is the first time a New Zealander has been elected to the board.

The invitation took place when Dr Grylls attended the sixth world symposium, held from August 3 – 10, to present a session on New Zealand choral music.

She represented the cultural mix of New Zealand’s rich choral music practice including repertoire from Pacific and European traditions.

”It was a fantastic platform to showcase NZ music,” she said. “No choral event in the world is more impressive.”

During the 2002 Symposium's eight days, delegates from more than 50 countries studied a wide range of choral topics, heard over 40 choirs, and took part in lectures, rehearsals and concerts with outstanding composers, scholars and performers.

This appointment to the board is an important opportunity for the artistic face of New Zealand to be visible on the international platform. As a board member she will represent countries from the Pacific region.

Professor Doug Sutton, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, says Dr Grylls’ world-class reputation is honoured by this appointment, and is a reflection of the high quality academic staff at the University.

“The University benefits immensely from having Karen Grylls as part of the academic staff,” says Professor Sutton.

“Not only is she head of the School of Music, but she has a huge international reputation. She leads the two University Choirs, conducts University and civic concerts and is the artistic director of Tower Voices New Zealand and the Tower NZ Youth choir.”

The International Federation for Choral Music (IFCM) was founded in 1982 for the purpose of facilitating communication and exchange between choral musicians throughout the world.
