Famed Japanese architect to give public lecture

**Famed Japanese architect of paper buildings to give public lecture**

The architect famed for using cardboard tubes to create houses for disaster victims will deliver a public lecture as part of a University of Auckland architecture series.

Shigeru Ban is an acclaimed Japanese architect whose innovative work with paper, particularly cardboard paper tubes, has earned him international respect. His so-called “DIY refugee shelters” were used in Japan after the Kobe earthquake, in Turkey, Rwanda and around the world and have proven to be highly effective for low-cost disaster relief-housing.

Ban’s key early projects were a series of innovative houses, many employing unusual structural solutions such as the use of furniture as load-bearing structure. These include his Curtain Wall House (1995), in which an urban house was given a façade of tent-like cloth. Recent and current projects include housing in France, the United States and Sri Lanka; a flagship store for Swatch in Ginza, Japan; and the new Centre Pompidou in Metz, France, due for completion next year.

A strong sense of humanitarianism also informs Ban’s work, and he is particularly attracted to sustainable, ecological architecture and materials, such as paper, that produce very little waste. Ban was the first architect in Japan to construct a building primarily out of paper, a medium he is attracted to because it is low-cost, recyclable and can be replaced.

Shigeru Ban will deliver a public lecture on Thursday 17 September as part of The University of Auckland’s Fast Forward lecture series, hosted by the School of Architecture and Planning. Lectures are open to the public, and those other than Shigeru Ban are free entry. Attendance at each lecture earns 10 NZIA CPD points
