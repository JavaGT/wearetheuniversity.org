Kick starting engineering careers

The Faculty of Engineering at The University of Auckland is offering scholarships to help students kick start their engineering career.

Twenty-two Kick Start Scholarships are up for grabs for first year engineering students in 2005.

Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Professor Peter Brothers says the Kick Start Scholarships aim to make life easier for engineering students entering the university environment for the first time.

"Beginning tertiary study can be daunting for some students and the Scholarships will go some way towards making this transition easier," he says.

The scholarships assist engineering students to overcome the potential financial barriers that they face when starting university. The grant of $2000 is expected to help with initial set-up costs such as textbooks, fees and accommodation.

There are three types of scholarships available:

\* Kick Start Merit Scholarships  
Eight scholarships which are awarded to the applicants with the best academic results in their final year of high school. These scholarships are open to students across New Zealand.

\* Kick Start City of Sails Scholarships  
Ten scholarships which are open to students who live outside the Auckland metropolitan area. This area is classified as north of Orewa or South of Drury.

\* Kick Start Affirmative Action Scholarships  
Four scholarships which are open to students of Maori or Pacific Island background.

Applications for the Kick Start Scholarships close on 7 January 2005. Details and applications can be obtained from school careers advisors or from the Faculty of Engineering website www.engineering.auckland.ac.nz .
