Great Ideas Turned Into Business Success
========================================

Inventors' Course Turns Great Ideas Into Business Success

Getting great ideas out of the garage and into the marketplace is never easy. But from next month inventors keen to make this critical transition will benefit from some expert (and free) advice from a new University of Auckland Business School course.

Open to the public, and supported by The Inventors' Trust and Industry New Zealand, the six-week Inventors' Course will introduce participants to the basics of commercialisation, including:

  
· Skills for the inventor, innovator and entrepreneur  
· Designing products and services for the consumer  
· Market testing, product evaluation and branding  
· How to protect business ideas from competitors  
· Where to get assistance and money to make ideas a reality.

Participants in the hands-on course will meet experts in the field, and hear practical advice from experienced innovators and entrepreneurs.

An invaluable international perspective is being provided by key facilitator Professor Henry Bolanos, a visiting academic and inventor from Yale University, who holds more than 100 patents and has wide commercial sector experience.

Professor Bolanos is in Auckland through to the end of June teaching Business School students a semester-long course on innovation and new product development. He teaches a similar course at Yale which has led to a number of students successfully taking new products to market.
