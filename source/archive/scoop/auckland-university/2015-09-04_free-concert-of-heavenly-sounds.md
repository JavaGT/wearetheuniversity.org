**Free concert of heavenly sounds**

**Music lovers will be in heaven at the upcoming concert Sounds Celestial at the Auckland Town Hall this month.**

Presented by the School of Music at the University of Auckland, in conjunction with the Auckland Philharmonia’s INSPIRE programme, the evening features a line-up of heavenly classical music.

“The evening has an incredibly beautiful programme - from the ethereal sounds of David Hamilton to the most tuneful melody from South America’s Villa Lobos and over to the luscious score of Mahler’s child’s vision of heaven – and with two magnificent sopranos as well,” says conductor Uwe Grodd.

The large-scale concert stars acclaimed conductor Uwe Grodd, sopranos Patricia Wright and Natasha Wilson, and the University of Auckland’s Symphony Orchestra, Massed Choir and Chamber Choir. Altogether this concert will feature some 220 musicians on stage in the sumptuous acoustics of the Auckland Town Hall.

**Sounds Celestial**  
30 September 2015  
8-9.15pm  
(75 minutes with no interval)  
Auckland Town Hall  
303 Queen Street, Auckland Central  
Free admission.

**Programme:**  
**Hamilton, Dance-Song to the Creator**  
This work was commissioned for the International Summer School in Choral Conducting in 1993. It is scored for two semi-choruses (SSA and SATB) with a large mixed-voice choir. The accompaniment is for piano duet and percussion. Two texts from different spiritual traditions (the Latin 'Te Deum' and 15th century India) offer complementary hymns of praise to both the creator and to the power of music.

**Mahler, Symphony No.4**  
The work is paired with Mahler's Fourth Symphony, a work of transcendent beauty, that includes the song _Das himmlische Leben_ - a child’s vision of heaven - sung in this performance by Patricia Wright, one of New Zealand’s finest sopranos.
