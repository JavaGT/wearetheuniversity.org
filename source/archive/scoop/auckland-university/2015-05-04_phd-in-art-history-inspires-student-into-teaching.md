**PhD in Art History inspires student into teaching**

Simon McNamara enjoyed his PhD in art history at the University of Auckland so much he’s now studying to be a teacher so he can pass his knowledge on to others.

Simon initially did an MA in English and then a Post Graduate Diploma in Art History.

He graduated with his PhD today. Titled “Concetto in Rembrandt's Passion Series”, he embarked on a detailed study of Rembrandt’s Passion Series, the name given to five paintings of similar subject, size and format painted between 1633 and 1639 now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich.

A ‘concetto’ is Italian for an idea or concept.

The works were commissioned by Fredrick Hendrick, Stadholder of the United Dutch Provinces and Prince of Orange at The Hague.

“I posited that the concetto for the paintings was based on an Ignatian meditational sequence via a friendship Rembrandt had with Constantijn Huygens secretary to the Stadholder and poet who structured his poetry along Ignatian lines.”

The research was immense. Simon travelled to Europe four times during his PhD so he could study Rembrandt’s works in galleries in Germany, France, Belgium and even St Petersburg.

“There is more literature written about Rembrandt than any other artist. Just getting through the literature was a real challenge.”

During the PhD Simon tutored six art history courses and also lectured in three different papers.

“I really enjoyed it, in fact, I loved it. I really enjoy teaching.”

“You spend such a long time accumulating the knowledge and sharing the knowledge was wonderful.”

It was these teaching experiences that helped Simon decide to enrol in the Graduate Diploma in Secondary Teaching at the University’s Epsom campus.

Tomorrow he’s off to Auckland’s St Cuthbert’s school for a six-week practicum teaching art history.

Simon also had the support of his father, art critic TJ McNamara, during his PhD.
