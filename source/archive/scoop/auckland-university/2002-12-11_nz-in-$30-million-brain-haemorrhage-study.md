New Zealand Participates in $30 Million International Brain Haemorrhage Study

New Zealand researchers are taking part in a $30 million international study of the formation of blisters in blood vessels in the brain that can rupture and result in serious brain haemorrhages.

The study - which is being led by the University of Cincinnati - will involve researchers from the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It is being funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health in the United States. Craig Anderson, of The University of Auckland's Clinical Trials Research Unit, is coordinating the project across 10 centres in Australia and New Zealand.

Professor Anderson says the condition can have serious consequences.

"The blood blisters - called intracranial aneurysms - rupture in more than 1500 people in Australia and New Zealand annually. Nearly half of these people die within 30 days. Survivors are often left with substantial disability and reduced quality of life.

"The most devastating complication arising from intracranial aneurysms is a serious type of brain haemorrhage - called subarachnoid haemorrhage. It accounts for 27 percent of all stroke-related years of premature life lost.

"Intracranial aneurysms are associated with risk factors such as age, family history, cigarette smoking, hypertension and alcohol consumption. There is also evidence of a genetic link that may work in concert with lifestyle issues during the ageing process.

"The long-term goal of the study is to test the hypothesis that there are specific human chromosomal regions associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms.

"We will be collecting information about the health and lifestyle of people who have two or more family members who have been affected by intracranial aneurysms or subarachnoid haemorrhage. These people will also be asked to provide a blood sample to be sent for sophisticated statistical and genetic (chromosome) analysis."

The study group is hoping to recruit 400 families worldwide - or about 3200 individuals - who are prepared to be interviewed, provide blood samples, and undergo brain image screening for intracranial aneurysms. About 160 people are expected to be New Zealanders.

Mr Edward Mee, the Head of Neurosurgery at Auckland Hospital will coordinate the New Zealand sector of the study. The researchers will recruit prospective participants by approaching specialist neurosurgeons and neurologists, and GPs, nationwide.

Anyone interested in participating in the study can also contact Dr Colin Howe, Study Manager, Clinical Trials Research Unit at The University of Auckland (09 3737599 extension 84765).

Results of the study are expected to be reported in 2007.
