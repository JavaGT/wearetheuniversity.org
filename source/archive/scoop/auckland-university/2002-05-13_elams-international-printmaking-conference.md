Printed Images: Elam’s International Printmaking Conference

One of the stars of the British contemporary art scene visits Auckland this month to speak at Elam School of Fine Arts’ International Printmaking Conference.

Simon Patterson has become one of the Young British Artists – or YBAs – who has elevated London’s status as an international art centre.

His best-known work - The Great Bear (1992) – reworked the London Underground map, one of the city’s visual icons. The work typifies his playful subversion of familiar classification systems such as maps, charts and diagrams.

Mr Patterson, 34, who has been exhibiting since the early 1990s, will come directly from the Sydney Biennale where he is representing Britain. His address will make reference to his exhibition at the Biennale, Escape Routine, which furthers the artist’s ongoing fascination with his idol Harry Houdini.

Nominated for the Turner Prize in 1996 - Britain's most prestigious contemporary art award – Mr Patterson recently undertook a project for the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and was one of two artists invited to make works for London’s Tate Gallery website (www.tate.org.uk).

The other keynote speaker at the conference is master printer Kim Westcott, one of Australia’s leading printmakers. Other speakers include Carole Shepheard, Associate Professor of Elam School of Fine Arts, Elizabeth Rankin, Professor of Art History at The University of Auckland, and Geraldine Berkemeier and Rilka Oakley from Australia.
