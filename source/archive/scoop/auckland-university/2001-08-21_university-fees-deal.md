University Fees Deal

The University of Auckland Council has reluctantly resolved to accept the Government’s funding offer in return for holding university fees at current levels. The offer amounts to an increase of 1.8% in revenue per student, which is in line with current forecasts of inflation.

Vice-Chancellor Dr John Hood said that the Council had faced a very difficult decision because the offer maintains for another year a funding system that seriously underfunds, by internationally benchmarked standards, a research-led University.

Dr Hood said that 2002 would see the challenges that the University is facing in retaining and internationally recruiting top quality teachers and researchers, remain.
