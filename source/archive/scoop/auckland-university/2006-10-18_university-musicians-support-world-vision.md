University musicians perform to support World Vision

The University of Auckland School of Music, the National Institute of Creative Arts and Industries (NICAI), will give a special concert this month to support World Vision’s Children in Crisis programme for children living in desperate situations throughout the world.

The concert features the music of Shostakovich, Mozart and Mendelssohn and will be led by acclaimed American conductor Marc Taddei. The equally heralded Uwe Grodd, Associate Professor of Flute and Conducting at the School of Music, will give a solo flute performance. The University of Auckland chamber orchestra, comprising approximately 50 student musicians, is one of the country’s top young classical orchestras.

The concert opens with Russian-born Shostakovich’s Theatre Music Suite, penned for a scandalous 1932 production of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The suite will be followed by Mozart’s Flute Concerto in G, written when the composer was 21 years old. Mendelssohn’s Reformation Symphony No 5 concludes the concert.

All proceeds from the concert will go to World Vision.

“We are delighted the University’s School of Music has offered its talent to help such a worthy cause as our Children in Crisis programme,” says World Vision Communications Manager Liz MacIntyre. “We strive to put around 80 cents for every dollar raised into work on the ground. Funds raised from the concert will provide supplies during natural disasters, help to rescue children from bonded labour and support kids who have lost their parents to AIDS.”

“When the opportunity arose to partner with World Vision we didn’t hesitate,” says School of Music Head Professor Eric Hollis. “An essential part of the NICAI ethos is to encourage collaborations between the University and the community. The chance to make a difference to children in need is too important to ignore.”

What the critics are saying about Marc Taddei and Uwe Grodd:

“The hero was Marc Taddei. His was a real interpretation…his rhythms were beautifully sprung… and dynamics scrupulously observed” (The Dominion Post)

“…Grodd’s strong tonal projection and a natural interpretive charisma make him one of the most arresting solo flautists I have heard here for some years...” (The Christchurch Star)

The School of Music World Vision Benefit Concert will be held on Friday 27 October at the Auckland Cathedral of the Holy Trinity (446 Parnell Road) at 7:30pm. Voluntary contribution $20.
