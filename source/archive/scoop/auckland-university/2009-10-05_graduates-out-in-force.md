At 9.30am graduands, staff and Council members will process through the city down Bowen Avenue and Victoria Street East, and up Queen Street and Mayoral Drive.

Chancellor Roger France will personally confer 1848 degrees and diplomas with the rest (902) bestowed “in absentia” on those not attending.

Speakers at the ceremonies are the Attorney-General, the Hon Chris Finlayson, the Acting Chief Executive of Te Papa Tongarewa, Michelle Hippolite, the Managing Director and CEO of Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Mike Daniell, and the CEO of Fletcher Building Ltd, Jonathan Ling.
