“Edible Education’

The Clock Tower Library Lectures

in association with the Centre for Continuing Education, The University of Auckland

Food is a quintessential element of human existence. A new lecture series organised by The Clock Tower Library at The University of Auckland will examine the historical, cultural, artistic, scientific and culinary aspects of food. The series will run from Thursday 12 September to Thursday 17 October and is open to the public.

The lecture series will be accompanied by an exhibition of an illustrated book, “Cornucopia’. Produced by a variety of chefs and artists, it contains a collection of fourteen original lithographs celebrating six traditional culinary dishes.

Library books relating to food will be available at The Clock Tower Library, and can be viewed at:

Clock Tower Library Resources: http://www.auckland.ac.nz/lbr/conted/booklists/food.htm

The series includes four lectures in September and October, which each take place from 7.30-9.00pm on Thursday evenings:

12 September Why Italians Eat Pasta and Swedes Eat Herrings: 8000 Years of European Cuisine

Mike Hanne, BA(Oxford)

People in every country (and many provinces and districts) of Europe are strongly attached to their own cuisine. What people eat, how they prepare food and drink, how and when they eat, and what they refuse to consume, all play a major role in defining national and communal identity. This lecture explores some of the factors, including climate, patterns of agriculture and human contact, religion, and the building of overseas empires, which have shaped the dietary and culinary habits of Europeans over the centuries.

19 Septemberƒn More Than Just a Meal: The Symbolism of Food in Renaissance and Baroque Art

Mary Kisler, MA

This lecture will consider the important role that food played in art from the 14th to the 17th centuries, beginning with religious symbolism and then moving through to the more complex readings of the later period. Food symbolism can often be read as metaphors for particular societies, with references to gender, politics and power placed alongside a growing desire for locating food within a wider order of things. Within this frame, the succulent peach on a plate may do more than simply tempt one's taste buds.

10 October The Alchemy of Food.

Glynn Christian

Glynn Christian, food journalist and author, explores pseudo-scientific alchemy and how its aim to create treasure from dross is relevant to today’s food and cookery. Although chefs and cooks are neither scientists nor artists, they do somehow combine both disciplines. A cook can magically transform the mundane into the celestial. The conclusion will be drawn that what appears to be art in cookery is actually skilful science. The greater skill is convincing diners they are dining from the palette of an artist or the crucibles of an alchemist.

17 October New Zealand's Culinary Heritage

Ray McVinnie, MA

This lecture traverses New Zealand’s culinary heritage and examines the current state of New Zealand food. What are the major food trends in New Zealand? What are the influences? Do we have our own modern cuisine? In fact, why is food in general so popular today? Join chef and food writer, Ray McVinnie, to find out.
