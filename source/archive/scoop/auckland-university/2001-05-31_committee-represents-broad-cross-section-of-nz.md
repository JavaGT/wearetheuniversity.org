CONFERENCE COMMITTEE REPRESENTS BROAD CROSS SECTION OF NEW ZEALAND INTERESTS

The Conference Committee guiding the Catching the Knowledge Wave project and conference is representative of a broad cross-section of New Zealand education, government, arts, business, media, trade union, social and community interests.

“Their collective experience and expertise make this a dynamic committee for shaping the conference and the broader project,” said Conference Committee Chair, Dr John Hood.

Dr Hood said other countries had demonstrated that it was possible to achieve a more prosperous and socially cohesive society based on knowledge society values quickly. It required a broad commitment to that goal, with national priorities re-ordered and resources made available.

“A diverse group such as the one we have brought together is the key to ensuring that all sectoral interests have the opportunity to be heard during the process of forming a national consensus on what needs to be done to achieve this goal and how best we might go about it,” he said.
