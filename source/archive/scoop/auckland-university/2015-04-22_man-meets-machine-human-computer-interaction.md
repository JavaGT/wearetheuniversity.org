Human interaction with computers is evolving at a dizzying speed. The ground-breaking invention of the mouse can already seem outmoded by the rise of touch-screen mobile technology.

This month’s Gibbons Lecture series provides a fascinating showcase of the past, present and future of one of the fastest-developing aspects of our everyday life – human-computer interaction.

Topics covered in the series include tracing the development of the Mouse to the Smartphone; using everyday tools as input devices; innovation in airline computer systems and a look at how responsive computers could be to our wants and needs within just a few decades.

This series of four lectures provides a chance for the general public to hear from leading researchers in the field as well as a view from Air New Zealand’s Chief Architect on the role of technology within a company that deals directly with thousands of consumers each day.

The Gibbons Lecture Series is free and open to the public. It is held on Thursdays at 6pm (for 6.30pm start), beginning on April 30 and running until May 21.

This event is held in the Owen G Glenn Building, University of Auckland, 12 Grafton Rd, commencing in level 1 lobby and moving to Room OGGB3/260-092 on Level-0 for the lectures. Public parking is available in the basement of the Owen G Glenn Building.
