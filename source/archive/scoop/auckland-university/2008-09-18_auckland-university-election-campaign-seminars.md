2008 Robert Chapman Memorial Lecture: Polls versus Expectations - An Australian Perspective on the New Zealand Election

  
Antony Green, Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s Leading Election Commentator

  
Throughout 2007 Australian opinion polls indicated that John Howard’s government was heading for massive defeat. Yet Howard’s two previous victories had come after some low polls, leading many to believe that he could yet again grasp victory from the jaws of defeat.

In the end the polls were right. Howard was defeated, but the contest narrowed as polling day approached, and the victory of Kevin Rudd’s Labor Party was narrower than expected. Parallels can be drawn in the experiences of the two countries. John Howard and Helen Clark may be from opposite ends of the political spectrum, but both have been political survivors. Both span several decades of turbulent political history.

The idea that either could lead their party to government was often doubted, but once in power, both built a dominance no one would have predicted in earlier times. Now New Zealand faces an election. After nine years in power, the Clark government faces a new Opposition Leader who wasn’t part of past political battles, and the government is dogged by bad opinion polls. Is the government doomed, or are the opinion polls likely to narrow as the election approaches? Antony Green is the face of ABC elections, having covered around 40 elections on camera for the ABC.

In recent years he has also developed the ABC’s internet election site into the preeminent source of election related material. He has also travelled overseas to cover and observe elections in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. He also produces regular publications on electoral matters for Australian parliamentary libraries. He contributes regularly to parliamentary reviews of electoral laws.

As part of the 150th anniversary of selfgovernment in NSW, he co-edited The Electoral Atlas of New South Wales, a book that maps the history of the state’s politics. He is currently working on an historical project to properly document the state’s elections in the period before Federation. Antony is a graduate of the University of Sydney. He completed a Bachelor of Science, with majors in Pure Mathematics and Computer Science, and a Bachelor of Economics with honours in the Department of Government.

Mike Lee, Chairman of ARC

New Zealanders have left behind the secure landmarks of the 20th century and are now into unknown territory. Have New Zealanders lost their way? Is a lack of national direction and awareness part of our social/political malaise? Mike Lee will discuss these issues and the question of NZ nationhood and examine again the case for constitutional change for New Zealand.
