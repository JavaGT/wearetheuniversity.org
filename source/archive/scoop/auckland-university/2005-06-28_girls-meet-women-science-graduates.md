Girls Meet Women Science Graduates

Media Release  
28 June 2005

GIRLS MEET WOMEN SCIENCE GRADUATES

Girls can do anything! That's the message that will be promoted at The University of Auckland's WISE Futures' evening this week.

Secondary school girls who are considering studying the sciences will have a chance to talk through their career options with successful women graduates at the Faculty of Science on Thursday June 30.

Programme organiser and Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) Equity Advisor, Ros Smart, says the evening is designed for Year 11-13 girls to give them more information on what a career in the sciences involves.

\"This is a fantastic opportunity for girls who are interested in science but aren't really sure what their career options are. They will be able to meet role models who have studied science and are now applying it in their careers."

The keynote speaker for the evening is Carron Blom, an Environmental Scientist at Beca, a major engineering consultancy. Carron will discuss why she studied science and provide students an overview of the diverse range of career options available.

The girls will hear addresses from a number of women who are working in fields such as computer science, forensics and physics. Speakers will share their reasons for choosing a science career, benefits, challenges, and strategies for success.

One of them who will speak at the evening is Olivia Samson, a scientist in the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's (ESR) Crime Sample Database Unit.

Ms Samson, who holds a Masters in Forensic Science from The University of Auckland, interprets and reports DNA analysis results from crimes such as burglaries and car thefts.

"I enjoy my job immensely and in addition to being very interesting, I find it rewarding knowing that I'm contributing to a safer community."

Ms Samson says she is looking forward to sharing her experiences with secondary school students.

"Ever since I can remember I was going to study science at university. During school holidays, I attended science camps run by the local university and polytechnic and this gave me an insight into the numerous career paths that science provided. Through the WISE Futures' programme, I hope a new generation of girls will become interested in science."

The evening will also include an overview of Faculty of Science programmes available at The University of Auckland and a tour of the laboratory facilities.

WISE Futures is based on a similar successful programme used in Australia and Ms Smart says it is equally popular with school students here.

WISE Futures runs from 5.00pm to 8.30pm on Thursday, June 30. Parents and teachers are welcome to join students. Registration via school careers advisors is necessary to attend the evening.
