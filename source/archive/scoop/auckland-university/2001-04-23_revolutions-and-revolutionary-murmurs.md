Revolutions and Revolutionary Murmurs: Fiji and Aotearoa New Zealand

Noted constitutional law expert Jock Brookfield is to give a public lecture on the Fiji constitutional crisis at The University of Auckland on Tuesday 1 May.

His lecture “Revolutions and Revolutionary Murmurs: Fiji and Aotearoa New Zealand” follows on from his prize-winning book "Waitangi and Indigenous Rights: Revolution, Law and Legitimation" (Auckland University Press; 1999), which deals with how the revolutionary taking of power by one people over another can be legitimated.

In his lecture he will look in particular at: (i) the recent case of Fiji v Prasad (where the Fiji Court of Appeal held that the interim civilian government, established by the Military Commander, had not become lawful); and

(ii) constitutional developments since the judgment.

Professor Brookfield will also consider the implications of the crisis for Aotearoa New Zealand.

Professor Brookfield is a noted legal author, commentator and Professor Emeritus of The University of Auckland who taught for 27 years in the areas of constitutional law, land law and conveyancing. He has a special interest in the role of law in revolutionary constitutional changes and the factors that legitimate them.

The lecture will take place in the Stone Lecture Theatre, Eden Crescent, The University of Auckland, from 1 to 3pm on Tuesday 1 May.
