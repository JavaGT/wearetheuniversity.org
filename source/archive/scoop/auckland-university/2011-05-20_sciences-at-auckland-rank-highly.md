Sciences At Auckland Rank Highly

The University of Auckland continues to be the best performing New Zealand university in subject rankings released by QS World University Rankings®.

In Mathematics it came 30th, in Environmental Science 34th equal, and in Chemistry 43rd equal. Auckland was placed in the 51-100 range in Earth and Marine Sciences, Metallurgy and Materials, and Physics and Astronomy.

QS ranks universities worldwide based on academic reputation, employer reputation and research citations, with weightings tailored to each subject.

Earlier QS placed Auckland 27th in Psychology, 39th in both Medicine and Biological Sciences, 40th in Computer Science and Information Systems, and 55th in Engineering and Technology.

The Dean of Science, Professor Grant Guilford, in whose faculty most of these disciplines reside, says the rankings are a useful benchmarking tool for the faculty. “It is very pleasing to see an across-the-board improvement in the faculty’s rankings from last year and the esteemed international universities with which we stand. It is a testament to the quality of our staff.”
