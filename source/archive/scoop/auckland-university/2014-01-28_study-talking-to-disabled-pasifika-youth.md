The first New Zealand study to understand the experiences of disabled Pasifika children, youth and their families is underway in Auckland.

Pacific youth with a disability and their families are invited to contact the researchers and take part in focus groups to share their issues, concerns and challenges.

The Talanga Project is carried out by the Pacific Health and Health Systems departments at the University of Auckland for the Ministry of Health.

Pasifika people make up 6.9 per cent of the New Zealand population and are the most youthful of all ethnic groups in this country.

The number of Pasifika children is growing rapidly and it’s estimated that one in five children in New Zealand will be of Pasifika ethnicity by 2051.

“Despite this predicted increase, there is little knowledge, information or research available on Pasifika children and youth,” says study leader and head of Pacific Health at the University of Auckland, Professor Teuila Percival.

“This study is a response to the need for further research in the area of Pasifika disabled children and youth that was recommended in past research findings and a key action in the Faiva Ora Pasifika Disability Plan,” she says.

The Talanga Project will identify the demographics of the Pasifika disabled population that is accessing Ministry funded disability support services with the focus on children and youth.

As well as identifying the issues, concerns and challenges of this group and their families, the study will also assess the impact they have on Ministry funded disability support services – now and in the future.

The project will also inform future planning and development of the Ministry’s Disability Support Services for Pasifika peoples, and guide Ministry and sector decisions on resource allocations for this group in the future.

Disability information sources to support efficient collection and reporting of accurate data on Pasifika disabled peoples in New Zealand will also be identified by the study.

For more information on the study, or to take part in a focus group, Pacific youth can contact Dr Teuila Percival at the University of Auckland by phone to 0800TALANGA or 0800 825264, or by text to 027 TALANGA or 0278252642, or by email to 0800talanga@gmail.com
