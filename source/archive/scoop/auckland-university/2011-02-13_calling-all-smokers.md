Calling all smokers

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Get the good guys award without having to actually change your bad habits. Too good to be true?

Every years hundreds of thousands of us sign up to health trials to help New Zealand’s science community find out more about what works and what doesn’t in treating just about any health condition you can think of.And right now there’s a trial that’s looking for you to be heroic.

That is, if you’re a smoker and live in Auckland. ,

"We know that bouts of exercise can provide relief from cravings for abstaining smokers, but what are the mechanisms behind this?" asks Vaughan Roberts, PhD student at the University of Auckland’s Clinical Trials Research Unit. This study will look at the effect of brief periods of exercise on smoker’s short-term desires to give up smoking.

For the research to be successful, Roberts and his team are looking for 50 volunteers to participate in their study. "We are inviting smokers who are not currently exercising to join the study”You may be surprised what you learn. Check it out on www.smokingandexercise.getparticipants.com
