University Sells Coromandel Block

The University of Auckland today announced that the successful tender for its 150 hectares of land at Waikawau Bay was from the Crown.

An American, Paul Kelly, previously donated the property to the University so that it could be sold to raise funds for The University of Auckland Business School.

The University's Registrar, Warwick Nicoll, said the sale to the Crown meant that the Business School would receive the money intended for it and that the land's high conservation value would be protected.
