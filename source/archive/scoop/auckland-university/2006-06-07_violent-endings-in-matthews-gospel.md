Violent endings in Matthew’s Gospel and an end to violence

The annual Pompallier Lecture – hosted this year by the University of Auckland’s School of Theology and the Catholic Institute of Theology – will focus on Christian views of violence.

Dr Barbara E. Reid, a Dominican Sister and a Professor at the Catholic Theological Institute of Chicago, USA, will offer a view of how Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew teaches Christians to respond non- violently to violence.

Dr Reid holds a PhD in Biblical Studies from the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C., and is the author of Parables for Preachers (in three volumes), Choosing the Better Part? Women in the Gospel of Luke and, most recently, The Gospel According to Matthew.

School of Theology and Catholic Institute of Theology Pompallier Lecture: “Violent endings in Matthew’s Gospel and an end to violence”, Room B10, University Library Building, 5 Alfred Street, 7.30-9pm, 12 June. Koha welcome.
