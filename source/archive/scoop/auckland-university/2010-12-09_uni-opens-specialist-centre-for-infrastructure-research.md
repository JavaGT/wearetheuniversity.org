### University Opens Specialist Centre for Infrastructure Research

The University of Auckland’s Centre for Infrastructure Research set up to help tackle New Zealand’s infrastructure challenges is being launched today in Wellington.

The specialist research centre, which aims to improve infrastructure decision-making and management through research, training and policy development, is to be formally opened at a function held at Parliament this afternoon.

Those speaking at today’s event include Infrastructure Minister the Hon Bill English and Faculty of Engineering Dean Professor Michael Davies.

Professor Davies says the Centre for Infrastructure Research (CIR) will provide those building and maintaining the country’s infrastructure with greater access to emerging technologies developed within the University and associated overseas universities.

“We recognise that as a leader in infrastructure design and innovation we have an important role to play in the Government’s plan for infrastructure development within New Zealand,” he says.

Professor Bruce Melville, Head of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, says the University welcomed the opportunity to contribute its expertise and practical know-how in a vital field.

”As well as providing government and industry greater access to infrastructure research, CIR will help practitioners and policy-makers make smarter decisions for better infrastructure provision.”

CIR director Dr Jim Bentley says the Centre has already started working with water utilities on asset management and investment prioritisation, on social housing projects, with EcoMatters Trust on its Auckland Sustainable Development Centre, and on a Low Impact Stormwater Design project in Waitakere.

“The formation of the new Auckland Council brings together a large area of infrastructure responsibility affecting services to more than 1.3 million New Zealanders. This responsibility also brings opportunities to work together to find ways to solve some of the city’s stormwater, water and transport issues,” he says.

CIR will be working with the Auckland Council in several areas of infrastructure investment, says Dr Bentley.

The Centre is based at the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department within the Faculty of Engineering.
