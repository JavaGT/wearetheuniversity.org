=======================================

Establishment of Maurice Paykel Postdoctoral Fellowships

The Trustees of the Woolf Fisher Trust and the Maurice and Phyllis Paykel Trust have donated funds for the establishment of the Maurice Paykel Postdoctoral Fellowships.

The University of Auckland today announced that it had received a significant donation of $200,000 per year on a continuing basis that will see the establishment of two postdoctoral fellowships in the fields of Engineering and Medical and Health Sciences.

The fellowships will be offered for the first time in 2003.

Vice-Chancellor of the The University of Auckland, Dr John Hood, said that the University is very grateful to the Trustees of the Woolf Fisher Trust and the Maurice and Phyllis Paykel Trust for providing the funds for the fellowships, which will be used to attract researchers of international standing.

"Throughout his career Maurice Paykel pioneered engineering and biomedical advances, and their commercial development in New Zealand industry. His contribution to these fields was recognised by The University of Auckland in 1992 when he was awarded an Honorary LLD.

"It is most appropriate, therefore, that his name be associated with ongoing research at this University.

"I have no doubt that the Maurice Paykel Postdoctoral Fellowships will rapidly become very prestigious and highly sought-after positions, particularly as they will be located within high quality research institutes already established at the University.

"Every new and talented researcher we are able to attract and fund within our research institutes adds to the depth and breadth of the research community here in Auckland.

"The entire University of Auckland community is grateful to the Trustees for their very generous donation," Dr Hood concluded.

The University of Auckland's Liggins Institute and the Bio-Engineering Institute are currently drafting research proposals on which the Fellowships will be based. Each Fellowship will be held for the period of two years and will cover salary and research expenses. They will be advertised internationally.
