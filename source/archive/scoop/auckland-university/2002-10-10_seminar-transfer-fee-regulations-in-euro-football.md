Seminar: Transfer Fee Regulations In Euro Football

Seminar: Transfer Fee Regulations In European Football

Date: Friday 11 October Time: 11:00 am - 12.30pm Venue: Commerce A Building, Rm G18 The University of Auckland Symonds Street

Presenter: Eberhard Feess Aachen University of Technology

The seminar will analyse the impact of three different transfer fee systems on payoffs, contract lengths, training and effort incentives in European football.

The different regimes (those used until 1995, those currently in use and those recently approved), differ with respect to the transfer fee an initial club is entitled to depending on whether a player has a valid contract or not.

The seminar aims to show that the different systems differ only with respect to the contract length, if the contract which maximizes the expected joint surplus of the initial club and the player is feasible under each system.
