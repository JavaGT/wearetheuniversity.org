Arts Scholar To Discuss September 11
====================================

**Tuesday, 16 April 2002, 3:02 pm**  
**Press Release: [Auckland University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University)**

A world expert on arts and culture will discuss the way we understand and remember September 11 when she visits New Zealand this month.

Dr Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett is University Professor and Professor of Performance Studies at the Tisch School of the Arts, New York University.

She will be in Auckland to present a public lecture at The University of Auckland's School of Creative and Performing Arts (SCAPA) on Wednesday 24 April entitled: Kodak Moments, Flashbulb Memories: Reflections on 9/11.

Dr Kirshenblatt-Gimblett works just blocks from the World Trade Centre and has assembled her own photographic collection of images of the aftermath, which will be shown at the lecture.

Her illustrated presentation will discuss the ways in which the events of September 11 have been documented and preserved through photography and other mediums to create memories of the tragedy.

Head of SCAPA, Alan Smythe, says Dr Kirshenblatt-Gimblett's visit is a rare opportunity for New Zealanders.

"It's a chance to learn from someone who combines her expertise as an anthropologist and arts scholar with a firsthand experience of September 11," he says.

"In the days after the attack, Dr Kirshenblatt-Gimblett was out on the streets of New York taking photographs of the memorabilia and notes that mourners were leaving to remember their loved ones.

"She has studied the way people have dealt with the loss, both from an academic and personal perspective."

Dr Kirshenblatt-Gimblett's lecture will also raise some of the questions surrounding the events, such as why people were so compelled to document what happened, and the appropriate use of memorials to commemorate the deceased.
