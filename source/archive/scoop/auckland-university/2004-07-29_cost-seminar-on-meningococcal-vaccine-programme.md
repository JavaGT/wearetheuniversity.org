Cost Seminar on Meningococcal Vaccine Programme
===============================================

Seminar focuses on cost effectiveness of meningococcal vaccine programme

The costs and health benefits associated with the current meningococcal vaccine programme in New Zealand will be the focus of a seminar at The University of Auckland next week.

Presented by Associate Professor Richard Milne from the School of Population Health in the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, the seminar will focus on the cost effectiveness of a vaccination programme compared with no vaccination.

Entitled “Cost effectiveness of the meningococcal vaccination programme: an update”, the seminar draws from an in-depth economic evaluation of vaccination against meningococcal disease, which was carried out by Associate Professor Milne and his colleagues.

  
“One purpose of our analysis was to determine the relative cost effectiveness of a once-off vaccination programme targeted at children living in high-risk regions versus a programme that is offered to all individuals under 20 years of age,” says Dr Milne.

Through the research, the team found that a programme that offers vaccination to all individuals under 20 years of age would achieve higher benefits at a higher net cost to the taxpayer compared with a regionally targeted programme. However, Dr Milne says the two programmes would be equally cost effective because the unit cost of the vaccine would be higher in the targeted programme. The Government subsequently approved free vaccination for all individuals under 20.
