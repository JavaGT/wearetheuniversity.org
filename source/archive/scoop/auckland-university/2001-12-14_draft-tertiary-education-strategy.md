The Government's draft Tertiary Education Strategy creates a sound platform for debate about the future shape of the tertiary sector, the Vice-Chancellor of The University of Auckland, Dr John Hood, said today.

"The University endorses the need for a strategic framework that builds on New Zealanders' growing recognition of the importance of higher education if we are to make the most of our country's economic and social potential.

"We welcome the opportunity for input over the next three months into the development of strategy, and are pleased that it is intended that it should develop over the years to take account of new opportunities and national priorities," Dr Hood said.

The University would examine the six strategies outlined in the draft, and the proposals to measure outcomes, and looked forward to working with the transitional Tertiary Education Commission to develop the final Strategy document.

"Development of robust international benchmarking is one area which the University will be identifying as crucial to measuring the results of New Zealand's investment in tertiary education," Dr Hood said.

The Strategy is important also for seeking new and sharper focus on tertiary institutions' research capabilities, outputs, and collaborations.
