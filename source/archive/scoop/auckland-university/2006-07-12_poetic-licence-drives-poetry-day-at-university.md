Poetic licence drives poetry day at The University of Auckland

Poetry will take to the streets, trees, galleries, libraries, escalators, digital screens and airwaves on and around Montana Poetry Day (Friday, 21 July).

\"It's a chance to bring poetry into public spaces as the semester begins and campus is seething with deployable energy," says Dr Michele Leggott, acclaimed poet, Associate Professor in the Department of English and coordinator of the NZ Electronic Poetry Centre (nzepc) at The University of Auckland. "Poetry day is for everyone who wants to see or hear poems coming off the page all over the city."

Montana Poetry Day events at and around The University of Auckland include:

POETRY SLAM AT POETRY LIVE: Go head to head with other poets in a poetry tournament! Bring your best performance poems, maximum three minutes per poem, costume optional. Best poet on the night wins - judged by audience applause,
