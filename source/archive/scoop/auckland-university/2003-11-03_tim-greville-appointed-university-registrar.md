Tim Greville Appointed University Registrar

The University of Auckland today announced that it has appointed Mr Tim Greville as Registrar, replacing Mr Warwick Nicoll who retires early next year. Mr Greville will take up his appointment from 1 February 2004.

Mr Greville has been for many years a partner at one of New Zealand’s major law firms, Buddle Findlay. He brings to the University a wealth of legal and organisational experience including experience in the tertiary sector.

Vice-Chancellor Dr John Hood said that this appointment reflects the importance the University places on ensuring that its administration and governance remain first-class as it deals with an increasingly complex statutory environment and an ever expanding set of relationships with external organisations.

“The past decade has seen the University develop many sophisticated relationships with other academic and research institutions, businesses and community organisations, here and overseas,” Dr Hood said. “Mr Greville’s skills and experience are well suited to this expanded role over the coming years.”

Having completed an LLB at this University in 1970, Mr Greville began his legal career with Auckland law firm, Nicholson Gribbin. He became a partner with Malloy, Bramwell, Moody and Greville in 1973. In 1988 that firm merged with Buddle Findlay. Mr Greville was a partner with Buddle Findlay until the end of 2002, where he was for a time a principal partner and supervisor on major mergers and acquisitions and commercial transactions in New Zealand. He has acted as a consultant to that firm since then.

The Registrar’s key responsibilities include leading the University’s institutional requirements, compliance and responses to statutes, procuring legal advice and overseeing University contracting, coordinating collaborative agreements with other New Zealand entities, overseeing the University’s interests in various trusts and other entities, acting as Secretary to the Council and Senate and advising the Vice-Chancellor as required.

Mr Greville has had input into various charitable and community organisations, such as the Hearing Association and School Boards, is past President of the Auckland Wine and Food Society, is a regular lecturer for the Institute of Directors, and has taught at the University’s Business School. He is married, with two children.
