University of Auckland’s Philosophy Department ranks well world wide

The University of Auckland’s Department of Philosophy has been ranked in the top four such departments in Australasia for graduate studies by an international survey. It is the only philosophy department in New Zealand to be ranked.

“We welcome the findings of this important survey and are delighted to see the international strength of the Department recognised, says Head of Department, Professor Rosalind Hursthouse.

The survey, ˜2002-2004 Philosophical Gourmet Report, was completed recently by 180 philosophers throughout the English-speaking world. The philosophers rated graduate programmes according to their quality and reputation. The survey is aimed at helping potential graduate students choose high-class universities.

The survey also rated specialist areas of philosophy in universities throughout the US, UK and Australasia. The results reflect the quality, reputation and influence of the work done by researchers in the philosophy departments.

The University of Auckland’s Department of Philosophy was listed as good in ethics; applied moral, political and social philosophy; philosophy of art/aesthetics; and nineteenth century German philosophy after idealism, alongside, in some cases, Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, Yale, Stanford, Cornell and Harvard, and, in other cases, outranking them.

The following areas were also notable: philosophical logic and philosophy of logic and language; philosophy of action; and twentieth century continental philosophy, where the department was ranked with, in some cases, Harvard, Chicago, Yale, Berkeley, Cornell and Cambridge.

The Department is currently welcoming applications for its Summer School. In addition to beginners’ courses in philosophy, the Department will offer a new advanced logic course for the first time.

Applications are also open for the Diploma in Professional Ethics, which, according to Professor Hursthouse, is one of the Department’s areas of greatest strength.

For enrolment on the Summer School or Diploma courses, contact the Departmental Administrator on 09 373 7599 extension 5073, or by email on mailto:s.pinto@auckland.ac.nz.
