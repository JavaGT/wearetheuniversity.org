Workshop encourages democracy through writing submissions

Ever wanted to have a say on what’s happening in your community but don’t know how to ensure your voice is heard? If so, the forthcoming Centre for Continuing Education course, “How to Prepare and Write a Submission” may be for you.

On Saturday, 30 September and Saturday, 7 October Deidre Bourke will lead a two-session workshop outlining the role of submissions in the law and the steps involved in making a strong submission. In addition, the sessions will identify the different types of submissions that can be made, and the pros and cons of each format; discuss how to research and draft a submission, including a joint submission; and demonstrate how to effectively present an oral submission and appear before a select committee.

Participants will also learn how to comply with the guidelines for drafting and putting forward a submission to various local and central government authorities; and how to access government reports on submissions and analyse the final decisions made as a result.

“The submissions process is an essential feature of our parliamentary democracy,” says Ms Bourke, who is earning a doctorate in law at The University of Auckland. “It exists to ensure that people have a say in shaping the laws that affect them and that the views of the community are considered when laws are drafted. “

CCE’s How to Prepare and Write a Submission course will be held on Saturday, 30 September and Saturday 7 October, from 9:30am-12:30pm. The course will be held in Room 15, Commerce A Building Number 114 (3A Symonds Street). Fee: $126. Limited to 20 participants.
