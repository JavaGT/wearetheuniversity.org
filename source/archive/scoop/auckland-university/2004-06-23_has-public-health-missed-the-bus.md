Has public health missed the bus?
=================================

Has public health missed the bus?

One of the aims of the New Zealand Transport Strategy is to "protect and promote public health", but a group of experts in Auckland argue that health is still a marginal consideration in transport planning and funding.

At a debate at The University of Auckland's School of Population Health this evening , experts will question whether public health has marginalised itself by being insufficiently involved with transport planning or whether transport planners marginalise health as a consideration in their strategy.

The debate will bring together academics, planners, and industry specialists from the transport and health sectors at the University's Tamaki Campus.

The evening will be facilitated by Warren Lindberg, Public Health Planner for the Northern District Health Board Support Agency.

Speakers include:

\* Virginia Hope - Environmental Health Strategist and Medical Officer of Health \* Alistair Woodward - Head, School of Population Health, The University of Auckland \* Robin Kearns - School of Geography and Environmental Science, The University of Auckland \* Sandra Coney - Auckland Regional Council \* Tim Hazledine - Department of Economics, The University of Auckland \* Stephen Selwood - General Manager, Transport Policy, Automobile Association of New Zealand \* David Craig - Department of Sociology, The University of Auckland \* Martin Dawe - Director, Health and Safety Development \* Chris Freke - Manager, Transportation, Manukau City Council \* Jenny Dixon/Elizabeth Aitken-Rose - Department of Planning, The University of Auckland
