Industry pulls together for future of property study and research

Business rivalry was put aside last night as New Zealand's property industry banded together in support of The University of Auckland, donating over a quarter of a million dollars in sponsorship to the Department of Property over the next five years.

Over 300 people from the property industry, as well as students and academics from The University of Auckland, gathered together to celebrate the success of this year's property graduates at the Department of Property's Annual Graduation Dinner at Old Government House.

Senior Lecturer Deborah Levy said she was delighted at the support received from the property industry.

"We have a vision of securing a world class Department of Property, and that requires us to look for extra funds," she said.

"The financial support we received last night is a great start and will help us achieve this vision. It will help us to recruit outstanding staff, appoint a new Head of the Department and invest in new academic postgraduate programmes."

"It's wonderful to see academia and the industry working together to contribute positively towards the future of study and research into property in New Zealand."

Ms Levy said the Department's close relationship with the property industry was invaluable.

"Our students have benefited greatly from an active student buddy and mentoring scheme where students can work through part of their studies with registered valuers, real estate agents and members of the NZ Property Institute in areas as diverse as development, consultancy and property management."

The graduating property students were also the winners of the evening, with over 80 per cent of the industry-sponsored prizes awarded to women.

However Ms Levy said the evening was a celebration of property's future and all the graduating students should feel proud of their achievements as they completed their property qualifications.

"We have a high calibre of students and this dinner is our way of congratulating them on their success and wishing them well for their future as they enter the property profession."
