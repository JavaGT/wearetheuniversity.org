MEDIA ADVISORY

  
Annual Bank Customer Survey  
Results Announced 23rd September 2002

The results of The University of Auckland Business School‘s fifth annual bank customer survey will be announced on Monday 23rd September.

The survey has been conducted by Mr Bodo Lang and Dr Mark Colgate, consultants to (and former members of) the Business School’s marketing department.

The survey will look at the attitudes of New Zealanders to our country’s banks, measuring customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and the reasons why people conduct their business with particular financial institutions.

The study investigates both retail customers and the business market, with a sample size of more than 1,000 for each category.

The annual bank customer survey is part of a larger research programme within The University of Auckland Business School, which focuses on the financial services industry.

Results will be distributed in a media release.
