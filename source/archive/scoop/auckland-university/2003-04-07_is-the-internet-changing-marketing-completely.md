Is The Internet Changing Marketing Completely?

Media Advisory 7 April 2003

IS THE INTERNET CHANGING MARKETING COMPLETELY?

  
If the internet is having the massive effect on marketing often subscribed to it, the change is taking place more slowly than many imagine.

Professor Rod Brodie and Associate Professor Richard Brookes, of The University of Auckland Business School's Marketing Department, will present a seminar on the topic this Wednesday (April 9).

The presenters' recent research addresses the influence on marketing of information technology (IT), including e-service adoption.

This shows that most firms are currently operating at the reinforcing stage, with far fewer operating at the enhancing or transformational stage, such as moving to stand-alone "e-service".

To highlight the critical developments needed to progress to the transforming stage, they compare firms where IT is reinforcing practices with firms where IT is seen to be enhancing or transforming practices.

"In Marketing is the Internet Changing Everything?"

Room 115 Commerce C Building Symonds Street Wednesday 9 April 4.30pm
