New Dean Of Medical And Health Sciences Appointed

Professor Iain Martin has been appointed the new Dean of the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at The University of Auckland.

Professor Martin, currently Head of the School of Medicine that forms part of the Faculty, will take up his position on September 5. He replaces Professor Peter J. Smith, who has left the University to head the Faculty of Medicine at the University of New South Wales.

University of Auckland Vice-Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon welcomed Professor Martin’s appointment.

“After an extensive international search, we were pleased to discover that the best candidate was right here ‘at home’. Iain has a very strong research background, an international reputation as an academic surgeon, and has successfully led the School of Medicine through a crucial time in its development. He will provide strong academic leadership to the Faculty and continue to build its relationships with external agencies.”

Professor Martin joined the staff of the University in 2000 as Professor of Surgery. He holds an MBChB, an MD and an MEd from the University of Leeds, and is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (England) and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. His clinical practice and research interests are in the area of upper gastrointestinal disease, focussing on stomach and oesophageal cancer.

At the beginning of 2004, Professor Martin became Head of the School of Medicine, guiding the School through the renewal of its degree programme accreditation.

Earlier this month, the School secured the maximum possible period of renewal (10 years) for accreditation of its Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) degree from the Australian Medical Council, the accrediting organisation for Australian and New Zealand medical schools.

“The accreditation renewal secured by Iain and his colleagues is an international acknowledgement of the strength of the Faculty’s medical programme, and of its contribution to the medical community,” said Professor McCutcheon.

Professor Martin said he was honoured to be offered “the opportunity to head the leading medical and health sciences faculty in New Zealand” and he was looking forward to his new challenge.

“The past decade has seen very significant growth across the Faculty and I intend to build upon our multiple research and teaching strengths. There are many exciting opportunities for us to not only enhance the body of academic knowledge, but more importantly to make significant contributions to the health of New Zealanders.

“The breadth of expertise within the Faculty ensures that we have the capability to address health issues from the most detailed laboratory based investigations to population level interventions,” said Professor Martin.
