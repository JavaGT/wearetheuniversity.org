Auckland Tops NZ in Life Sciences Rankings
==========================================

**Press Release: [Auckland University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University)**

### Auckland Tops NZ in Life Sciences Rankings

The University of Auckland has been ranked in the top 50 in the world and first in New Zealand in life sciences subjects.

In the recently released QS World University Rankings® Life Sciences subject ranking, Auckland was placed 39th in both Medicine and Biological Sciences, and 27th in Psychology.

QS ranks universities worldwide based on academic reputation, employer reputation and research citations, with weightings tailored to each subject.

“We are pleased to have been placed in the top 50 in these subjects,” the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Stuart McCutcheon, said today.

“While international rankings are not the only indication of quality, consistently high rankings do add to our reputation on the international scene. More importantly they affirm the outstanding quality of research being undertaken by our staff, and the impact it is having both nationally and around the world.”
