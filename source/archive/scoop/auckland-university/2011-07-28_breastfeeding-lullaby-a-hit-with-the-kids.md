### **Breastfeeding Lullaby A Hit With The Kids**

Kids around the country will be humming away to a new lullaby on breastfeeding released by Whakawhetu to coincide with World Breastfeeding Week 1-7 August. The special lullaby draws attention to the role breastfeeding (alongside other features like sleeping baby flat on their back and smoke free environments) play in protecting baby from the risk of Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy, or SUDI. A recent international study reveals that breastfeeding to any extent and of any duration is protective against SUDI. Furthermore, the protective effect is stronger for exclusive breastfeeding.

“We are so thrilled to bring you this lullaby and do hope it becomes a part of every family’s repertoire at bed time” says Kodi Hapi, Whakawhetu, General Manager. And so far, the song seems to be a hit not only with parents, but kids as well. One mother remarks “I played the lullaby to my baby and four-year-old son and now he runs around the house singing it to me and baby and asks to hear it again and again”.

Whānau are in the best position to protect baby from SUDI by:  
• always placing baby for sleep flat on their backs (not propped)  
• always close to a sleeping parent (in the same room but in own baby bed such as wahakura, pepi-pod, cot or bassinette)  
• always ensuring smokefree air for baby  
• always breastfeeding baby

The lullaby is available on our website www.whakawhetu.co.nz
