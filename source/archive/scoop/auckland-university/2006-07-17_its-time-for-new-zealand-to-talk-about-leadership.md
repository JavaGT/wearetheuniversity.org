It's time for New Zealand to talk about leadership

It’s time for New Zealand to talk about leadership

Are leaders born? If not, can somebody learn to lead? Does New Zealand have its own unique leadership challenges? These are all questions up for debate at The University of Auckland during New Zealand Leadership Week this week.

The event is being staged by Excelerator: the New Zealand Leadership Institute based at the The University of Auckland Business School.

The Business School is marking the week by bringing together its three Professors of Leadership to guide a public debate on how to understand and foster leadership.

The Three Professors: An Evening of Classical Leadership will be held on Tuesday evening and will feature:  
Dr Brad Jackson: Professor of Leadership  
Dr Lester Levy: Chief Executive of Excelerator and Adjunct Professor of Leadership  
Dr Allan Lind: Visiting Professor of Leadership (from Duke University USA).

Jenny Gibbs, Pro-Chancellor, The University of Auckland and Patron of the Arts will chair the evening.

The three professors each have unique viewpoints on leadership and how it can provide the missing link between aspiration and achievement.

Dr Levy believes there is a lack of understanding about different types of leadership in New Zealand.

“There are a lot of unresolved issues about leadership and this is a chance for people to say what’s on their mind,” he says. “There is evidence that effective leadership can make a huge difference in organisations but we first need to understand what effective leadership is.”
