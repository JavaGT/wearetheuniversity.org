From Forrests to the South Seas
===============================

**From Forrests to the South Seas**

Among the exceptional literary talent appearing at the May Readers and Writers Festival are several authors from The University of Auckland.

Famed novelist Emily Perkins will speak about her anticipated soon-to-be released novel The Forrests at a session on Friday May 11. A lecturer in the Department of English, her new book follows Dorothy Forrest from New York to Auckland at the age of seven, through to the end of her life in a narrative that shifts and moves, growing as wild as the characters. She will also appear with acclaimed US writer Jeffrey Eugenides, discussing the future of the novel.

Distinguished Professor Dame Anne Salmond hosts a session in conversation with fellow writer Paul Diamond about her internationally acclaimed triumph Bligh: William Bligh in the South Seas (2011). Inspired by her research for the earlier Aphrodites Island (2010), the beautifully told story captures the excitement, drama and terror that surrounded the life of the captain of the mutinous Bounty.

Distinguished Professor Brian Boyd is the world’s leading Nabokov scholar, as well as a professor of English at The University of Auckland. Brian will talk about his work old and new, including his latest book Why Lyrics Last: Evolution, Cognition, and Shakespeare’s Sonnets (2012), in conversation with poet, critic, author and alumnus Iain Sharp.

Emeritus Professor Witi Ihimaera will talk about his new book The Parihaka Woman. An eclectic combination of fiction and history, central character Erenora guides readers through the tumultuous times of the Taranaki.

In addition, The University of Auckland is this year hosting the Writers on Campus event. Four contemporary sessions - on war, social media, performance poetry and powerful fiction – will be hosted at the Business School’s Fisher and Paykel Auditorium on Saturday.
