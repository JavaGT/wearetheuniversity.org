Art Goes Mainstreet in Remuera

Remuera Shopping Centre will come alive with art by 63 Fine Arts students from Elam, School of Fine Arts for the second year in a row.

Elam School of Fine Arts at The University of Auckland, in conjunction with the Remuera Business Association, present the annual ‘Art Goes Mainstreet’ art exhibition -the largest of its kind to be held in New Zealand - from 5 to 17 August.

The street-long exhibition of art will be on display along Remuera Road in shop windows, on shop walls, in malls and above shop balconies.

Students from second year Bachelor of Fine Arts to PhD level have been invited to present proposals for specific sites and a selection process is taking place.

Their work - including photography, installations, painting, design, sculpture, intermedia and printmaking – will be on display in various locations along Remuera Road including bookshops, banks, cafes, and optometrists.

Catherine Parker, Mainstreet Manager for the Remuera Business Association, said that local businesses were delighted to once again offer their support for this exciting exhibition.

“We’re proud to support these emerging fine artists. Following the success of last year’s exhibition, this year we have doubled the number of sites to 65, which gives more students the opportunity to display their work to a wide audience,” she said.

The best exhibit will be awarded a $1000 prize sponsored by John Gow from Remuera Gallery (formerly John Leech Gallery), and the runner up will receive $750, sponsored by Trumps Homeware and Gifts.

The judges, John Gow and Professor Michael Dunn, Head of Elam, will present the prizes at a presentation ceremony on Tuesday 6 August.

John Gow said, “As the oldest gallery in New Zealand, established in 1855, we are delighted to be sponsoring this award for the best student exhibit. We may be the oldest gallery but we are proud to be involved with the cutting edge of contemporary art from the leading art school in New Zealand.”

A “walk and talk" event around the exhibition will be lead by Associate Professor at Elam, Carole Shepheard, on Thursday 8 August starting at 10am. Interested people should gather outside Trumps, Airlie Court, 320 Remuera Road.
