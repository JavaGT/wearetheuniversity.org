Graduate returns from Cambridge to join University

Associate Professor Cristin Print, a graduate of The University of Auckland's Faculty of Medical and Health Science, has returned to join the faculty after six years at Cambridge University.

He is joining the Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, where he will teach and continue with his research activities. His current interests are in molecular medicine and bioinformatics, particularly involving the cardiovascular and immune systems.

Associate Professor Print is also a co-founder of Gene Networks Incorporated (GNI), a United Kingdom/Japanese-based pharmaceutical development company which combines laboratory experimentation with mathematical modelling to improve the efficiency of new drug development.

Associate Professor Print says it is an exciting time to be involved in scientific research in New Zealand.

\"I have come back to New Zealand because there seems to be a real push here to advance science through research that combines multiple disciplines such as cell biology and mathematics. I wanted to be involved in that, both in a teaching capacity and as a participant."

Dr Print is also keen to promote international collaboration, particularly with Asia, which he sees as important for the future of New Zealand science.

After graduating from The University of Auckland with a MB ChB in 1989, he became a House Surgeon at the Otago Area Health Board and a Junior Research Fellow at the University of Otago.

He completed his PhD in molecular medicine at Auckland in 1996.

He was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Division of Molecular Genetics of Cancer at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne from 1995, before moving to Cambridge University as a research fellow in 1999.

He has been a fellow of St Edmund's College in Cambridge since 2000.
