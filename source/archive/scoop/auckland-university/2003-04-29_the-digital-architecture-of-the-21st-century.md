The Digital Architecture Of The 21st Century
============================================

The Digital Architecture Of The 21st Century Enterprise

The Centre of Digital Enterprise (CODE) at The University of Auckland Business School next week hosts a public seminar on the new foundations of business success.

Professor Brent Gallupe, an internationally known Canadian scholar who holds a visiting professorship at the University, will present the seminar.

His seminar will examine three current information technology (IT) related phenomena: knowledge management, relationship systems and enterprise systems.

These three phenomena, argues Professor Gallupe, will form the "Digital Architecture" for the typical 21st Century enterprise - but only if they can be integrated to enable the enterprise to use its knowledge and systems to adapt to looming economic, technological and social changes.

Professor Gallupe is Professor of Information Strategy, Director of the Queen's Centre for Knowledge-based Enterprises, and Co-Chair of the E-Commerce Research Program, at the School of Business, Queen's University at Kingston, Canada.

He has received numerous research grants and awards, has served on several editorial boards, including MIS Quarterly, is widely published and has held executive positions with several IS (information systems) practitioner organisations. He advises private and public sector organisations around the world on the development and use of information technologies.

Professor Gallupe arrives in New Zealand next week and will be available for media interviews.
