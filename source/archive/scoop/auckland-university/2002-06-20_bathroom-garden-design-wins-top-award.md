Bathroom garden design wins top award

University of Auckland architecture student Philip Kwong and graduate Elvon Young are encouraging people to bathe in their garden.

The two young designers have won the Young Designer of the Year award in the New Zealand Kitchen and Bathroom Design Awards for designing a home bathroom with a garden in the centre.

22 year-old Philip and 26-year-old Elvon also picked up the Northern Region Best Virtual Design award for the CD Rom presentation of their kitchen design, and the Northern Region Young Designer award.

Philip says they wanted to design a bathroom that provided rest and respite in a busy urban environment.

"We figured that many people, particularly in the inner city, don't have the luxury of relaxing in a garden outside. So we've brought the garden to them inside their own bathroom!" he says.

The metre-square garden sits at ground level against one of the bathroom walls, which is open to the sky.

Philip says translucent louvers adjacent to the garden and steam from the bath and shower would give the garden an environment in which to flourish.

Elvon says they didn't expect their design to win three of the awards.

"We set out to have fun, be creative and learn a lot. We didn't really think about winning at the time, but the awards are a very nice surprise," he says.

The New Zealand Kitchen and Bathroom Awards have been running for about 10 years. They recognise excellence in the design and construction of residential kitchens and bathrooms.

Philip says his education at The University of Auckland was big help in winning the award.

Philip is completing his fifth and final year of a Bachelor of Architecture degree through The University of Auckland. Elvon is currently running his own private architecture practice in Auckland, Studio E7.

"I was able to draw on a lot of the practical skills and academic theory I learned in my degree, which was a huge bonus," says Elvon.

Senior Architecture Lecturer at The University of Auckland, Dr Koung Nyunt says the award is a credit to Philip and Elvon, and to the University.

"We're proud of their accomplishment. It shows we are producing students who understand New Zealand architecture and what it takes to design a creative, but useful end product," he says.

The University of Auckland offers a five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree and a three-year Bachelor of Architecture studies degree.
