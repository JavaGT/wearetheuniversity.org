### Teens and their parents needed for parenting study  

A researcher from The University of Auckland is seeking three hundred parents and their young adolescents to take part in a study comparing the effectiveness of two parenting programmes.

Joanna Chu, a doctoral student from the Triple P-Positive Parenting Research Group, based in the Faculty of Education, is running a six-month study to investigate the acceptability and relevance of two Triple P parenting programmes.

Miss Chu is looking for at least three hundred pre-teens and teenagers aged 12 to 14-years-old and their parents to take part in the large-scale study which is being run in central and west Auckland.

The parents and their teenagers will be randomly divided into three groups of a hundred, one group will complete the Teen Triple P Seminar Series, a series of parenting seminars, the second group will complete the more intensive Group Teen Triple programme and the final will act as a control group.

As part of the study the families will need to complete a series of assessments and questionnaires and those involved in the control group will have an opportunity to complete one of the Triple P parenting programmes for free at a later date.

Miss Chu says the study is important because it is the first time that the Triple P’s teen parenting programmes have been compared.

“Along with extending previous literature on Teen Triple P through its examination of the prevention of drug and alcohol use in early adolescents, the study will provide crucial information regarding the implementation of the two Teen Triple P programmes in New Zealand.”

The internationally recognised parenting programmes have been developed based on 30 years of research. The project is supported by the Auckland Council.

To volunteer for the research project contact Joanna Chu on 09 623 8899 ext. 83042 or email jt.chu@auckland.ac.nz
