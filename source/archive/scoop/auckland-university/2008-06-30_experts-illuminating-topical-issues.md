Media release 30 June 2008

Experts Illuminating Topical Issues

Sustainability, racial problems in the United States, and the "War on Terror" are among topical matters being aired at the Centre for Continuing Education's Winter Week on Campus.

University of Auckland academics who are expert in their field and passionate about teaching adults will be offering the popular annual programme from July 7 to 11.

Those attending need no experience of university study, simply a love of learning and an interest in the key issues of our time.

The sessions on "Making your Vote Count", for example, provide a detailed rundown of how New Zealand's political system works as well as the role of the media and opinion polls.

Another stream of lectures gives a brief historical perspective of the United States from its democratic foundation to the race problem, foreign affairs and events post-2001.

"Engineering Today" covers not only sustainability but also such aspects as green roofs, replacing bone joints, and food properties.

In "Legal Issues" Scott Optican and colleagues from the Law School will discuss questions including disclosure of previous convictions, admissibility of illegally obtained evidence, and the law of shipwreck.

There is a lecture series on "Philosophy of Religion and the Problem of Evil" and another entitled "Music Matters" to help develop and enhance musical appreciation.

Three sessions, each with a choice of two lecture options, will be run each day. For more information and to enrol, phone 0800 UNICONTED (0800 864 266), email conted@auckland.ac.nz or visit www.cce.auckland.ac.nz.
