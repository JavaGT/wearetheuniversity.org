Public Lecture by Professor Stuart Parker

Health Services for our Future Selves:

Developing Health Services for Older People in the 21st Century

The implications of the rapidly aging population demographic of many first-world nations are already beginning to be felt in the public policy arena, and these effects will continue to develop over the coming years.

For this reason, research on aging and how Healthcare systems can best meet the needs of an aging population plays a vital role in government and policy planning.

In addition, our understanding of what ‘aging’ means is changing with improved nutrition and access to healthcare. Professor Parker will argue that now is an appropriate time for us to re-evaluate our pre-conceived notions about best practice in healthcare for older people.

Professor Stuart Parker trained in medicine at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne and has spent time at the TNO Institute for Experimental Gerontology, Rijswijk, the Netherlands, and the University of Leicester. He currently holds the Chair in Gerontology at the University of Sheffield. His research focuses on the application of health services research methods to clinical practice research, with particular reference to health status assessment of older patients, the hospital discharge of elderly patients, rehabilitation and long-term care.

Professor Parker is a consultant physician at Barnsley District General Hospital where he is lead clinician in Medicine for Older People. The Barnsley clinical service has gained national recognition within the UK for the quality of its acute and intermediate care for older people.
