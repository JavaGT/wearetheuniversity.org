How Will New Zealand Cope With The Future Of Digital Television?

  
Leading broadcasters, academics and media commentators will be gathering in Auckland this week to discuss the future of digital television in New Zealand, and in particular how it will impact on public service broadcasting.

Jointly hosted by The University of Auckland’s Department of Film, Television & Media Studies and the NZ Broadcasting School, the one-day conference, New Frontiers: New Zealand Television in a Digital World, promises a wide range of discussions and debates about digital television, funding issues, and the role of public broadcasting in a digital world.

Sharon Crosbie from Radio New Zealand will chair the conference and speakers include Minister of Broadcasting Hon. Marian Hobbs and Marion Jacka, an Australian expert in digital television.

Professor Roger Horrocks of The University of Auckland says the conference will be along the lines of the successful 'Local Content' conference held several years ago.

“We’ll be bringing together politicians and policy makers, producers and directors, academics, and creative people from many other fields for a comprehensive discussion about digital television in New Zealand in the future,” Professor Horrocks says.

“We’ll look at what are the implications of digital television for public service broadcasting, and what threats and opportunities digital television might pose for 'local content',” he says

Other speakers include James Munro from TVNZ, Rick Friesen from TV3, David Plummer from TelstraSaturn and John Barnett from South Pacific Pictures. Paul Norris will also speak about his recently released NZ On Air report on New Technologies and the Digital Future.

The conference will also consider the future for non-commercial television – in particular, how well the new Maori television channel can operate in a multi-channel, global environment. Derek Fox, Chair of the new Maori television channel will also be speaking to this matter at the conference.

The conference runs from 9am to 6pm on Friday, November 30, at The University of Auckland’s Conference Centre at 22 Symonds Street.
