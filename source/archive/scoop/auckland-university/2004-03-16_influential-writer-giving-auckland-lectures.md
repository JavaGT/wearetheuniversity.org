Influential Writer Giving Auckland Lectures

Marina Warner, the British novelist, critic and cultural historian, will be giving the prestigious Sir Douglas Robb Lectures at The University of Auckland later this month.

Her theme is ³Magic and transformation in contemporary literature and culture².

The lectures will extend the arguments in her book Fantastic Metamorphoses, but will focus on different writers and artists, with a more strongly contemporary emphasis.

There will be three free evening lectures in B28, Library Basement, 5 Alfred Street starting at 8pm. Tuesday 30 March ‹ ³After The Arabian Nights: Daemons & Alters². Thursday 1 April ‹ ³After Ovid: Flowers & Monsters². Tuesday 6 April ‹ ³After Revelation: Angels & Engines².

Marina Warner has been an influential figure in British feminist writing since the 1970s. Much of her writing examines the mythology, folklore and archetypes surrounding the feminine throughout history, as expressed in art, literary texts and fables.

Her fiction includes The Lost Father which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize and won the Commonwealth Writers Prize (Eurasia region), and Indigo, a striking postcolonial/feminist reworking of Shakespeare¹s Tempest. As well as novels she has written short stories, children¹s books and libretti.

In 1994 Marina Warner become only the second woman to deliver the BBC¹s Reith Lectures, published as Managing Monsters: Six Myths of our Time. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature since 1985 and an honorary fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, she lives in London.
