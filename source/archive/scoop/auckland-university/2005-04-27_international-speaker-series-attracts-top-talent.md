International Speaker Series Attracts Top Talent

One of the world’s leading technology forecasters, a lateral-thinking entrepreneur who has been likened to Richard Branson, and an Asian expert advocating a fresh strategy for New Zealand business comprise the lineup for the 2005 New Hemisphere Speaker Series. The series, which is open to the public, begins next Tuesday (May 3).

Now in its second year, New Hemisphere is an initiative of The University of Auckland Business School, designed to help New Zealand meet the challenges of enterprise creation and growth in the global business environment.

The three speakers who aim to stimulate, inspire, enlighten and inform are:

May 3

Simon Woodroffe  
\"How I got my YO! using innovations to win new markets"

A former UK Emerging Entrepreneur of the Year whose burgeoning YO! empire has been likened to that of Richard Branson’s Virgin, Simon will share some of the secrets of his success in building YO! Sushi, YO! Below, YO! to Go and a host of YO! spinoffs.

Sponsor: Air New Zealand

May 17

Daniel Burrus  
"Futureview: Creating and sustaining competitive advantage"  
US-based Daniel Burrus, one of the world’s leading technology forecasters and business strategists, will share the latest technology-driven trends and strategies for applying technology to drive growth.

Sponsor: Simpson Grierson

June 21

Professor Peter Williamson

"Winning a share of Asia’s future: The strategic agenda for New Zealand business"  
Peter Williamson, Professor of Asian Business and International Management, INSEAD, France and one of the world’s foremost experts on Asian business issues, will argue that New Zealand business needs to reassess how it is going to win a share in the next cycle of Asian growth because Asia’s competitive environment is undergoing a sea change. Repeating what worked in the past is unlikely to succeed in the face of these new realities.
