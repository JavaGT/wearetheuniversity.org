Using Patents as a Basis for Understanding Secure Patch Management Systems: The Creation of an Instruction Set Taxonomy and a Unified Model

Date: Tuesday, 8th October 2002 OCH 140A, Old Choral Hall Corner of Symonds and Alfred Streets Time: 12:30-1:45 pm. All Welcome

**Abstract**

Security breaches and software bugs are periodically discovered resulting in the issuing of software patches and updates. To accommodate the proliferation of updates being issued, software manufacturers have developed update systems.

As a basis for developing a history and an overall understanding of update systems, a worldwide search of published patent and patent applications (English filing countries) was conducted based on an inter-process search criteria. The primary objective was to review complete, software-based updating systems that are applicable to patch management.

What shall be presented are highlights of the resulting research, an instruction set taxonomy, the application of said taxonomy to a review of security design provisions, and a simplified, unified model of patch management systems.

**About the Speaker**

Andrew Colarik is a doctoral candidate and assistant lecturer at the Department of Management Science and Information Systems at The University of Auckland.
