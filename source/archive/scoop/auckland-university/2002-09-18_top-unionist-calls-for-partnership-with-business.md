TOP UNIONIST CALLS FOR SOCIAL PARTNERSHIP WITH BUSINESS

The country’s top unionist has called for a “social partnership” between unions, business and government to ensure New Zealand’s future growth.

Council of Trade Unions President Ross Wilson makes his case in the latest issue of the University of Auckland Business Review, the country’s biggest-circulation business magazine.

“I think we need a social partnership under which the CTU and Business New Zealand, and perhaps other organisations, actively engage with each other and with government to devise innovative and sustainable solutions,” writes Mr Wilson.

Mr Wilson acknowledges his proposal will provoke lively debate within the union movement.

“The essential question is whether there is a will for government, business or the union to commit to such a model with integrity.

“People are bruised by the experience of the 1990s. But the more inclusive government policies of the past few years are building confidence again. The real question for unions is whether business is ready to break from the policies of the 1990s and make the watershed change.”

Finance Minister Michael Cullen last week indicated the government was considering the prospect of a “social compact” with business and unions to boost economic growth.

Mr Wilson’s article, “The Role of Unions in Building an Innovative and Productive Society,” leads the latest issue of the University of Auckland Business Review.
