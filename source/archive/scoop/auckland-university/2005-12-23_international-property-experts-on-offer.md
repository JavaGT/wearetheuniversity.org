International Property Experts On Offer

Property professionals and investors seeking an edge have an opportunity in January to attend an Industry Day run by The University of Auckland Business School's Department of Property. The day is associated with the Twelfth Pacific Rim Real Estate Society (PRRES) Conference being co-hosted by the University.

Department of Property Senior Lecturer Deborah Levy says that the Industry Day, sponsored by IPD (Investment Property Databank) and the Property Council of Australia, is a good opportunity for professionals and investors to learn from the best in their field.

"We are delighted to have a number of very high calibre international speakers taking part in the Industry Day," says Ms Levy. "They will be covering a wide range of topics including trends in property markets, the changing roles of property professionals and property investment from an investor's perspective. The day also includes a session on successful joint venture research projects between universities and industry.

"Property is currently a hot topic in New Zealand and we see both the Industry Day and the conference itself as a good opportunity to learn more about its different perspectives. I would encourage anyone interested in the property market to come along."

Ms Levy says that the theme of the conference, "Extending the Boundaries", refers to boundaries relating to academic excellence and industry as well as geographical boundaries.
