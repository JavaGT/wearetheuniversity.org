University Of Auckland Business School Scores Highly In Asia Pacific Research Survey

The University of Auckland Business School’s finance research is amongst the most productive in the Asia Pacific region according to a survey recently published by a leading finance journal.

The Pacific-Basin Finance Journal ranked 97 universities from the Asia-Pacific region in finance research productivity by collating academic contributions to 17 leading finance journals during the 1990s.

The University of Auckland Business School ranked eighth overall in the Asia Pacific region. It was third in Australasia and well ahead of any other New Zealand university.

Dean of the University of Auckland Business School, Professor Barry Spicer, welcomed the journal’s findings.

“Our vision is for an enterprising, research led Business School that is highly regarded for its programmes of teaching and research and for the significant contributions it makes to New Zealand’s competitiveness and capacity to create wealth.

“The journal’s findings are a welcome endorsement of the Business School’s progress so far in achieving that vision.

“The Business School measures its success by producing people, ideas and research that will play importance roles in the development of New Zealand’s global, knowledge based society.”

Professor Spicer said that other important areas of research were also emerging in electronic commerce and electronic business, enterprise resource planning systems and supply chain management, network economics and the pricing of access to network and entrepreneurship, innovation, business creation and the development of SMEs.

“The Business School is looking to provide leadership in these areas over the next decade.”

The top five universities in the Pacific-Basin Finance Journal survey were the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the National University of Singapore, City University of Hong Kong, Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of New South Wales.

The New Zealand universities that participated included The University of Auckland, Victoria University, Massey University, Otago University and Waikato University. The University of Auckland was the only New Zealand university to be ranked in the top twenty.

The survey also found that the top 20 Asia-Pacific finance programs compare favourably with leading state and private universities in North America.
