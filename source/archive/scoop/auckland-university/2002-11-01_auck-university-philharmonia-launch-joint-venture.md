University of Auckland and Auckland Philharmonia launch joint venture

The Auckland Philharmonia and The University of Auckland School of Music today announced the formation of AP~SOM, a collaboration designed to enhance and strengthen the musical endeavours of both organisations in Auckland and throughout the country.

Dean of the Arts Faculty, Professor Douglas Sutton and Auckland Philharmonia General Manager Anne Rodda agree that the University and Philharmonia have many complementary skills as well as a large range of resources in music performance and study. By bringing these two organisations together under the AP~SOM umbrella, it is envisaged that an environment of innovative and inspired learning and performing will be provided.

The Prime Minister and Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Helen Clark, says it is encouraging to see organisations within the arts sector pooling their resources for maximum effect.

"The formation of AP~SOM appears to be leading the way for established organisations to work creatively in a complementary manner to improve the high standard of music training already available in New Zealand," she says.

AP~SOM’s agreement takes into account the sharing of physical resources such as music libraries, instruments and personnel, and extends to a wide range of activities including:

· joint concerts  
· summer and winter courses  
· masterclasses by visiting guest artists  
· workshops for conductors and composers  
· workshops in new, experimental music  
· ourses in orchestral training and preparedness  
· internships  
· competitions  
· community and continuing education.

A graduate programme in orchestral studies is being developed as an exciting new initiative within this relationship.
