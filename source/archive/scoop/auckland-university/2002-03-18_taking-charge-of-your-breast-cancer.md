One of the USA’s foremost practitioners in the field of breast cancer, Dr John Link, is visiting New Zealand and will conduct a one-off, free public lecture at Auckland University for women with breast cancer, their families, and friends.

He will discuss the different ways in which patients can manage their condition.
