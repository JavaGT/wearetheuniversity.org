Medical Imaging - from the cell to the mind

The central role that medical imaging plays in the diagnosis of diseases and research will be explored in the 2005 Winter Lectures at The University of Auckland starting on July 26.

Series co-convenor Dr Brett Cowan, an international expert in cardiac imaging and Director of the University's Centre for Advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), says medical imaging has become an essential part of medical research, teaching and practice.

"The Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2003 was awarded to the inventors of MRI, a technology that has revolutionised medical diagnosis," says Dr Cowan.

"While MRI is one of the more recent developments in imaging technology, the Winter Lectures will trace the history of medical imaging from the development of X-rays just over 100 years ago to today's state-of-the-art imaging capabilities."

The series of lectures over six weeks will look at the impact of medical imaging on everything from cells to the eye, heart and brain.

Topics will cover imaging of the mind, the latest techniques to image the eye and improve visual function, improving diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases, a virtual simulator which assists in the treatment of hip fractures, and the economics and ethics of whole-body MRI screening.

"The speakers are all authorities in their field and will demonstrate how leading technology is being used to advance research and diagnosis," says Dr Cowan, director of the country's only centre dedicated to high-level MRI research.
