University Welcomes Government Contribution To New Projects

The University of Auckland welcomed the announcement today of new funding for the University’s planned Fale Pasifika and support for the Institute of Education.

The projects are amongst a number being funded through the Government’s new Strategic Change Fund.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic), Professor Raewyn Dalziel, said the establishment of the Strategic Change Fund recognises that moving to a new policy and funding regime will impose significant costs on institutions.

“The contribution to the Fale Pasifika will be a significant factor in turning this project into a reality, and builds on support the University has already received from the ASB Trust and the Pacific community.

“As well as providing a much needed ‘home’ for Pacific staff and students and a facility for Pacific community groups, the Fale complex will be for the use of all communities.

“The University recognises that it is a New Zealand and Pacific university. Our goal is to develop one of the world centres of excellence in Pacific studies and research, in order to show genuine leadership on a wide range of Pacific issues.

The Institute of Education is a joint initiative between the Auckland College of Education and The University of Auckland to develop research alliances and collaborative partnerships between the two institutions and beyond, with public agencies and the private sector.

“Its purpose is to build a centre of excellence in educational research and teacher education that will make a significant contribution to the education sector throughout New Zealand.

“The beneficiaries will be teachers and aspirant teachers, our collective scholars, our students now and in the future, our nation’s children and our wider communities,” Professor Dalziel concluded.

Fale Pasifika

The new Fale Pasifika at The University of Auckland will have a threefold focus – as home-space for the University’s Pacific Islands students, as the base for the university teaching and research activities and as community facilities.

The University has consulted extensively with Pacific communities in Auckland, and has widespread support for the project.

At the heart of the proposed complex will be a Pacific-style Fale built with traditional materials and decorated with Pacific artwork and artefacts. A fale or its equivalent stands at the centre of each village in many Pacific societies, and provides space for ceremonies, discussions teaching and learning.

The new Pacific Building on Wynyard St will enable the University to draw together into its Centre for Pacific Studies, all academic programmes and research activities and offer a new Pacific curriculum to make educational support available to a greater range of Pacific students.

In 2000 there were 1837 Pacific islands students enrolled at the University.

The University already has an international reputation as centre for research into and teaching of Pacific Island culture and languages.

Its Centre for Pacific Studies is the only centre worldwide which teaches several Polynesian languages. The University also offers Pacific programmes in many subjects, particularly in the Faculty of Arts.

At present the centre operates out of two small houses on Wynyard St and has no dedicated teaching or research space.

With the development of the Fale Pasifika, the University aims to consolidate and enhance its Pacific academic programmes and research activities, and support services for students.

The enhanced Centre for Pacific Studies will co-ordinate research across the university, fostering teaching about the Pacific Islands within the University and beyond, building up a strong Pacific Island graduate community and serving Pacific Islands communities both in New Zealand and at home by engaging in teaching, research and consultancy.  
Institute of Education

The Institute of Education is a joint initiative between The University of Auckland and the Auckland College of Education to build a centre of excellence in educational research and teacher education.

The project was announced last year following the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission’s call for Universities and Colleges of Education to explore ways in which they might co-operate in programme development and research.

It will provide for collaboration between both institutions, whilst allowing each to maintain their autonomy and integrity.

The Institute aims to give students increased choice and greater diversity of programmes, more flexibility with qualifications, greater opportunity for specialisation and access to a broader range of staff expertise.

The Institute will offer co-operative academic programmes for initial teacher education qualifications and further post-graduate qualifications.

For 2002 the Institute is co-operating in the College’s concurrent Bachelor of Education/Graduate Diploma in Teaching that enables graduates to teach in both primary and secondary schools. There are also several students enrolled in co-operative Masters of Education programmes.

Students enrolled in programmes offered by the Institute might take courses at both the University and the College and be members of the Institute.

It is expected that benefits for staff will include increased opportunities for national and international research in a diversity of fields and a more varied and comprehensive academic, research and teaching profile.

Staff who teach on the programmes of the Institute will remain employed by their respective institutions but will be members of the Institute. They will remain covered by their existing employment contracts and will continue to be employed by their current institution.
