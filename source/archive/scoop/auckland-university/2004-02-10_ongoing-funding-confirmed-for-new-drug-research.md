Ongoing Funding Confirmed for New Drug Research at The University of Auckland

The longstanding relationship between Pfizer and the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at The University of Auckland has been reaffirmed with the announcement of a renewed research contract that will extend the work of the Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre into the field of antibiotic discovery.

Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences Dean Peter Smith said the continuation of funding was an acknowledgement of the University and New Zealand’s research excellence.

“This extended contract is a demonstration of the international community’s confidence in our work. With this relationship with Pfizer assured for another ten years, the University will make a major contribution to antibiotic development and the treatment of infectious disease.”

The continuing contract is valued at approximately NZ $4 million a year, and has provisions to help the University expand research capacity at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences.

“This partnership will enable New Zealand to make a significant contribution to the global fight against infectious disease,” Professor Smith said.
