Andrew has taught more than 20,000 students in Information Systems and is one of the University’s most innovative teachers. His principal contribution has been in the development of new ways to engage and motivate students in large classes, taking advantage of technology to improve engagement and assessment practices. Andrew was one of the first Professional Teaching Fellows (PTFs) in the University and was the first PTF elected to the University Senate. He has also served on University and Faculty level Learning and Teaching Committees.

**Associate Professor Andrew Luxton-Reilly Faculty of Science (Computer Science).**  
_Award for Sustained Excellence in Tertiary Teaching_

Andrew Luxton-Reilly has made important contributions to the development of Computer Science teaching within the Faculty of Science. His teaching innovations encompass a wide range of software tools and teaching methods trialled and developed in his courses over many years. He aims to help students see the connections between the digital and the social worlds, and understand how choices in one world affect the other.

**Peter Bier, Faculty of Engineering**  
_Award for Sustained Excellence in Tertiary Teaching_

Peter Bier has made a sustained contribution to large class teaching in the Faculty of Engineering, particularly with undergraduates in ENGGEN 131. His teaching is described by students as highly engaging, insightful and focused on problem-solving and he uses juggling and uni-cycling breaks to provide students with performative linkages between these activities and lecture content.  
Peter has been an active champion within the wider teaching community of systems that offer scope for rapid feedback on assessment and support to students. With innovative use of technology, marked tests can be returned to classes of 1000 students within 24 hours.

_The Prime Minister's Supreme Award, selected from the awardees, will be announced on 30 October at a ceremony at Parliament._
