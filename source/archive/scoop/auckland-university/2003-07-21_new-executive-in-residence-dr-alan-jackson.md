New Executive In Residence Dr Alan Jackson
==========================================

**Press Release: [Auckland University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University)**

New Executive In Residence Will Focus On Corporate Governance

Dr Alan Jackson is The University of Auckland Business School's Sir John Logan Campbell Executive in Residence for 2003.

Dr Jackson, The Boston Consulting Group's Managing Partner Australasia, and a member of the company's executive committee responsible for global operations, intends to focus on corporate governance issues during his residency, which begins today.

"In my roles with The Boston Consulting Group, I work with large organisations around the world and I'm familiar with the challenges of the global economy," says Dr Jackson.

"I've seen first hand how difficult it is for directors to meet today's challenges, given the size and complexities of these companies and the global market place. Many of these governance challenges exist in New Zealand and our size and our export focus provide additional hurdles for New Zealand-based companies."

Dr Jackson will work with a small research team within the University which will examine these issues - focusing on the particular challenges New Zealand companies and their directors face as they seek to grow internationally.

More generally, Dr Jackson says he is also looking forward to strengthening the links between the Business School and the business community.

Dr Jackson has extensive experience in Australasia's agricultural, resource and industrial organisations. He is a graduate of the University and has a long relationship with the Business School, having played a significant part in the development of The ICEHOUSE business incubator and accelerator. He is also a member of the Business Council of Australia.

Dean of the Business School, Professor Barry Spicer, welcomed Dr Jackson's appointment. He says the aim of the Executive in Residence programme is to develop closer ties between the School and New Zealand's business leaders.

"The programme aims to provide University staff and students with the opportunity to meet, talk with and learn from the experiences, values and motivations of business leaders," says Professor Spicer.

"The programme also provides business leaders with the opportunity to improve their understanding of the Business School and its operations and to advise the School on its strategic and operational development."

The Executive in Residence Programme was established in 1998 with the financial assistance of the Sir John Logan Campbell Trust.

Dr Jackson will fulfill his new role through to December, coordinating its demands with his professional obligations around the globe.

He is the latest in the line of exceptional New Zealand business leaders to hold the position. Previous holders include David Irving, Adjunct Professor of the Business School and former CEO of Heinz Wattie Australia, and Dr Jim Watson, CEO of Genesis Research and Development.

Dr Jackson holds a Bachelor's degree and Doctorate in Structural Engineering from The University of Auckland, and an MBA with Dean Honours from IMD Management Institute in Switzerland.
