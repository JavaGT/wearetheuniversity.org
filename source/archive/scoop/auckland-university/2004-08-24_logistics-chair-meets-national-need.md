Logistics Chair Meets National Need

Ports of Auckland and The University of Auckland Business School have established New Zealand’s first Chair in Logistics and Supply Chain Management (SCM).

The new Chair will provide academic leadership in co-operation with industry in an area crucial to New Zealand’s economic success.

Optimising the logistics of moving, storing and information management of goods from the farm or manufacturer to shop shelf along the supply chain is key to ensuring the future competitiveness of New Zealand’s goods in world markets.

The Ports of Auckland Chair in Logistics and Supply Chain Management will foster and promote research in the broad area of logistics and SCM. The Chair will encourage collaboration among academia, the commercial sector and Government, as well as linking with prominent international centres of research such as those at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ohio State University.

To this end, the Chair will develop a first-rate programme of teaching and research in logistics and supply chain management, housed within The University of Auckland Business School’s Department of Information Systems and Operations Management.

A high calibre candidate is being sought to fill the position, which is being funded by Ports of Auckland with a $1 million grant, payable over five years at $200,000 a year.

Dean of The University of Auckland Business School, Professor Barry Spicer, says the creation of the Chair fits well with the Business School’s aspirations and goals.

“The partnership with Ports of Auckland is a good fit. The company is an innovative organisation committed to exploring new frontiers in logistics, supply chain management and professional business practice in general. “Similarly, the Business School is determined to become a dynamic forum in which business and economic issues and policies can be researched and taught, for the benefit of the whole country.”

Ports of Auckland Chairman Neville Darrow also welcomed the initiative: “This type of partnership is important and will be of significant value to the port industry – an integral part of New Zealand’s supply chain with the world.

“Ports of Auckland is committed to an optimal supply chain for New Zealand. This is reflected in the company’s mission: To ensure the most efficient and cost-effective supply chain is created for containerised cargo between export and import customers and shipping line services for the benefit of Ports of Auckland stakeholders, the Auckland region and New Zealand.

“The Chair will assist to combine academic knowledge and insights with commercial knowledge, practice and experience,” said Mr Darrow.

Ports of Auckland and Logistics Ports of Auckland has a dedicated logistics team. Since 2002, this team has focused on the needs of importers, exporters and their transport operators. Its purpose is to better understand their supply chain needs in order to help identify efficiencies.

Ports of Auckland’s inland port network being developed is a key logistics initiative to optimise freight logistics. It allows greater volumes of containerised freight to be repositioned at night when roads and motorways are flowing freely, adds flexibility and reduces container dwell time at the seaport, and provides for future rail freight options.

The East Tamaki inland port is well established, with another inland port under development in Wiri.

Containers trucked after-hours are now 33% of all containers moved by truck – which shows that the company is making real progress on reducing port-related traffic during peak hours. Opportunities to further increase after-hours movement of containers are being explored.

Ports of Auckland supports the new Logistics and SCM Chair, and will continue to liaise with Government as a responsible and important player in the supply chain.

The World Class Business School Project The new Chair is part of The University of Auckland Business School’s World Class Business School project. The Business School embarked on this project in 2001, aiming to transform itself from a leading Australasian institution into a truly world class centre, excelling in the basic disciplines of business and economics, and providing leadership to meet the challenges of New Zealand’s enterprise creation and growth.

The funds raised will be spent on programmes and staff, and a new building scheduled for completion in 2007, although parts of the facility will be available for student and staff use before then.

The Business School reached its initial fundraising target of $50 million in June, including $25 million of funding from Government under its Partnerships for Excellence Programme. The Business School is now seeking to raise a further $25 million from the private sector. The Ports of Auckland funding was committed as part of the initial target of $25 million.
