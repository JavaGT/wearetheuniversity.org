INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS TO DELIVER FREE PUBLIC BIOTECHNOLOGY LECTURES

The public are invited to attend free lectures by New Zealand and international experts on biotechnology and bioentrepreneurship at The University of Auckland, beginning next week.

The public lectures are part of the "Commercialising Biotechnology for Financial Success" summer course, run by the University in conjunction with NZ Trade & Enterprise (NZTE).

The key objective of the course is to encourage the growth of biotechnology companies using research from New Zealand's biotechnology sector which has been identified as crucial to the country's economic future.

The course aims to provide all participants with a background on the international and local biotechnology sectors. In addition, it aims to provide people from a scientific background with a basic understanding of business principles, and to provide businesspeople with an understanding of the science that underpins emerging biobusiness ventures.

Each of the six evening sessions, spread over three weeks from January 20 to February 5, includes a free public lecture, half an hour of networking, and a tutorial for enrolled participants. The venue is the Old Government House Lecture Theatre, 3A Symonds Street, Auckland.

Titles for the public lectures include:

\*The Rocky Landscape of Biotechnology (Tuesday 20 January 5-6pm)

\*Running Rivers: Routes to Biotechnology Commercialisation (Thursday 22 January 5-6pm)
