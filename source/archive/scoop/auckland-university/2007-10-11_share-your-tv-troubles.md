Share your TV troubles

Parents who have problems getting their kids away from the TV are being asked to share their experiences to help reduce obesity.

Researchers at The University of Auckland's Clinical Trials Research Unit are investigating ways of reducing obesity in children and are looking at the television (TV) behaviour of young people as a factor influencing health.

\"In New Zealand, almost one third (31%) of children aged 5 to 14 years are overweight or obese, with a higher prevalence amongst Maori and Pacific children," says Dr Cliona Ni Mhurchu, Programme Director. "The most popular leisure time activity in New Zealand is watching TV, and our children spend an average of 131 minutes per day in front of the TV set. We're looking at ways we can help parents reduce their children's TV time and divert them to other, healthier pastimes."

Despite a variety of strategies available to modify children's TV watching, many parents feel that their existing strategies are not successful. Interventions aimed at helping parents have more influence over their children's TV watching could be a promising strategy in reducing childhood obesity.

The research aims to evaluate parents' perceptions regarding their children's TV watching, including possible difficulties and effective strategies, to identify an appropriate method of TV restriction for New Zealand children, and to evaluate its feasibility and potential efficacy by piloting the trial design and interventions next year. "There are many possible ways of reducing a child's TV watching, and we are interested in learning about what works and what doesn't," continues Dr Ni Mhurchu. "For example, some parents may consider tamper-proof timers that switch the TV off after a pre-set duration, but we want to hear some first hand stories of how these seemingly straightforward strategies might actually work in the home."

The study is looking for parents in the Auckland or Counties Manukau areas who have a child aged 9 to 12 years and report difficulty reducing their television watching. Researchers will conduct focus group discussions with parents to discuss their experience and attitudes towards their child's television watching. Anyone who would like to take part should contact Trisha Lundberg on 09 373 7599 ext 88937 or email t.lundberg @ auckland.ac.nz.
