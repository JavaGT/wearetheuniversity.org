World renowned conductor leads University of Auckland musicians in  
Russian Serenade

One of the world's most respected musicians will conduct The University of Auckland Strings in a Russian Serenade concert later this month.

Professor Wolfram Christ is one of only a few violists who boasts an international reputation as a soloist. He became the Principal Viola of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra at the age of just 22.

Between 1995 - 2000, Wolfram Christ was Artistic Director of the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and in recent years he has turned increasingly to conducting. He says his desire to conduct arose from years of playing under such conductors as Herbert von Karajan, Claudio Abbado, Carlos Kleiber, Leonard Bernstein and Nikolaus Harncourt during his two decades with the Berlin Philharmonic.

In addition to conducting professional orchestras of renown, Wolfram Christ is also hailed for his work with student orchestras. His forthcoming visit will mark his fourth time working with School of Music students and The University of Auckland Strings.

The Russian Serenade concert comprises Rachmaninov Romance and Scherzo, Alfred Schnittke Moz-Art la Haydn, and Tchaikovsky Serenade Op.48.

\"The University's music students are incredibly fortunate to have access to such a world-class artist, conductor and music educator," says School of Music Head Professor Robert Constable. "Under Wolfram Christ's expert guidance the University's young musicians have the opportunity to challenge themselves, hone their skills and make musical advances they may never have imagined possible."
