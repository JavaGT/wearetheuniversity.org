Final Graduations At Auckland Town Hall
=======================================

**Final Graduations At Auckland Town Hall**

The University of Auckland will hold graduation ceremonies at the Auckland Town Hall, for decades its traditional capping venue, for the final time this coming week.

The Aotea Centre, whose greater capacity necessitates fewer ceremonies, has been used since 2009. At present it is required for Rugby World Cup purposes.

At six Spring Graduation ceremonies spread over two days (20 and 22 September) 2450 graduates will receive a total of 2708 qualifications. These include 124 doctorates.

Business and Economics is the faculty awarding the most qualifications with 611 followed by Science (599), Arts (596) and Education (252).

There are 201 in Engineering, 195 in Medical and Health Sciences, 140 in Creative Arts and Industries, 113 in Law and one in Theology.

The ceremonies are being webcast live so that relatives and friends can watch proceedings from anywhere in the world.

Leaving Princes Street 9.30am on each day graduands, staff and Council members will process through the city down Bowen Avenue and Victoria Street East, and up Queen Street.

University Chancellor Roger France will personally confer 1880 degrees and diplomas, bestowing the rest (828) “in absentia” on those not attending.

Speakers at the ceremonies include the Auckland Museum’s new director Roy Clare, Epsom Girls Grammar School principal Madeline Gunn, and Counties Manukau District Health Board CEO Geraint Martin.
