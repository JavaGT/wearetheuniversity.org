The Student Volunteer Army (SVA) continues three fronts of attack focused on restoring a sense of normality to Christchurch’s quake ravaged suburbs.

Today a Battalion of just under 1000 students battled silt in the streets of Avondale, they joined forces with crews from Fulton Hogan, Federated Farmers and volunteers in Ashburton. SVA field team leader, Sam Johnson says he’s extremely proud of his team, b the army is now a well oiled machine web and will be able to handle 1500 volunteers tomorrow. Over the last five days the Battalion has contributed to, along with heavy machinery operators, moving 30,000 tonnes of silt and estimates another 120,000 tonnes remain.

b Web re extremely grateful for all the donations that have been made, web re not only feeding our volunteers, but the people web re helping as well.b

In a separate operation 300 jobs were completed by around 100 Squadrons comprising of three to five volunteers each. As of last night 350 jobs have been completed. SVA head quarter’s team leader Louis Brown says he’s astounded the system is working given this is a five-day old world first project. We’vemade a big dent in the 1500-long list of registered jobs on [www.sva.org.nz](http://www.sva.org.nz/). We’re stoked we’ve been able to meet resident’s needs.

The third operation, Street Team, is being run on behalf of the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). 120 volunteers visited isolated residents of east Christchurch (Dallington, Avonside, Shirley and Linwood) who were crying out for first hand information of available services given they do not have power, water or sewage. The volunteers talked to residents one-on-one, provided them with flyers and asked what other information they need. This is the first time two-way communication has been established with residents in these areas. In the morning New Brighton residents should look out for a 45 people strong Street Team.

Tomorrow volunteers wanting to take part in the Army are asked to be at the UCSA car park at 90 Ilam Road between 9 and 10am tomorrow. A marquee has been erected to house and cater for volunteers. People of all ages and abilities, especially those who may not be able to wield a shovel, will be welcomed with open arms.

You can register for help, or volunteer on [www.sva.org.nz](http://www.sva.org.nz/), or phone 03 974 8414.

In other student volunteer related news: Ten engineering students from ENSOC (the University of Canterbury Engineering Society) have, since Friday, been working with qualified structural engineers to assess homes in Dallington, Cashmere, Huntsbury Hill, Parklands, Merivale, Fendalton and across the entire eastern suburbs. They are evaluating whether houses are safe or not, and this work is ongoing.
