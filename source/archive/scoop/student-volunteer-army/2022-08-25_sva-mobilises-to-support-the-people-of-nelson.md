SVA Mobilises To Support The People Of Nelson
=============================================

**Thursday, 25 August 2022, 2:38 pm**  
**Press Release: [Student Volunteer Army](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Student_Volunteer_Army)**

**SVA is partnering with Nelson College to mobilise and assist the people of Nelson and Tasman in response to devastating floods in the region.**

50 students have already committed to providing their support, and more volunteers are welcome to sign up via SVA at the following address: https://volunteer.sva.org.nz/programmes/128

Residents can request help by calling SVA on 0800 005 902, emailing hello@sva.org.nz, or by filling in the form on SVA's website at https://sva.org.nz/nelson-floods/  
 

Sam Johnson, co-founder and Chief Executive of SVA, is enthusiastic about using SVA's skills and experience to support volunteers in the region: "SVA steps up when we're needed, and we've had plenty of experience with floods and silt. We're really proud to be working alongside the students of Nelson College and providing our systems to help coordinate volunteers."  
 

Matt Donald, a student from Nelson College helping to organise their volunteers agreed: "When the floods struck Nelson, I knew a massive response was needed to get our community back together. We’ve all seen the pictures of the damage in our region, and I thought the students and other rangatahi could make a real difference by coming together and supporting our community."
