Statement regarding the dismissal of Dr Paul Buchanan, University of Auckland

In response to media enquiry in relation to the dismissal of Dr Paul Buchanan from his position as a lecturer in Political Studies at the University of Auckland, the Association of University Staff makes the following points.

Dr Buchanan is a highly respected academic with a high public profile.

We can confirm that Dr Buchanan sent an email to a student about which a complaint was made. Dr Buchanan has apologized to both the student and the University regarding this email.

There are extenuating circumstances surrounding the sending of the email, and the University had a range of options open to it other than to dismiss Dr Buchanan.

The Association of University staff does not believe Dr Buchanan should have been dismissed from his position.

Dr Buchanan’s dismissal is being appealed.

There will be no further public comment on this matter at this time
