NO CERTAINTY YET ON FUNDING  
We will have to wait until after the Budget in June to find out the  
Government's intentions regarding the former Government's decisions to  
institute the Universal Tertiary Tuition Allowance and to severely curtail  
postgraduate tuition funding.  
In response to our request last week, the Hon. Steve Maharey has given AUS  
an assurance that a clearly differentiated sector, and the funding  
principles that underpin this, will form part of the Tertiary Advisory  
Commission's programme. AUS sees the realignment of funding as being a  
priority for TEAC when it is finally established.

Also in Tertiary Update this week:  
1\. TEAC Chair Welcomed  
2\. Polytech Alliance Will Lower Fees and Staff Costs  
3\. Crossbearer and Whitefoot Strike Again  
4\. Otago Proposal Disenfranchises Academics from Voting on Council  
Representation

TEAC CHAIR WELCOMED  
The appointment of Dr Norman Kingsbury as chair of the Tertiary Education  
Advisory Committee has been welcomed by the Association of University Staff  
(AUS).

AUS President Neville Blampied said Dr Kingsbury has a great wealth of  
knowledge and experience which will provide a very sound foundation to TEAC.  
"Dr Kingsbury has an intimate knowledge of how universities, other tertiary  
institutions and the Ministry work, and he is universally respected within  
the sector," he said.

JOB LOSSES LIKELY FROM POLYTECH ALLIANCE  
The Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) were not impressed  
that Otago Polytechnic staff found out about a new polytech alliance and  
potential job losses from the Otago Daily Times.  
The Tertiary Accord of New Zealand announced this week, involves Otago  
Polytechnic, Auckland's MIT, Palmerston North's Universal College of  
Learning (the former Manawatu Polytechnic) and Christchurch Polytechnic.  
ASTE president Jill Ovens told the Otago Daily Times the union was concerned  
that there might be intellectual property issues at stake in the  
announcement that a key focus would be on the joint development and delivery  
of programmes.  
Otago Polytechnic CEO, Wanda Korndorffer, said student fees were to be  
limited and staffing costs were predicted to fall as a result of the  
alliance.

CROSSBEARER AND WHITEFOOT STRIKE AGAIN  
Putting the AUS views before the public is assisted from time to time by a  
morphic organisation, whose latest manifestation was as the Association for  
United Science.  
The chief spokespersons for this Association - Neville Whitefoot and Rob  
Crossbearer - leapt to the defence of universities when it was suggested by  
Dr Andrew West (see Tertiary Update Vol. 3 No.7) that only by merging  
universities could New Zealand develop at least one world-class institution.  
In a press release embargoed until 1 April 2000, Crossbearer and Whitefoot  
supported rumours that a merger of Crown Research Institutes into a new  
Department of Science and Innovation - DSI - was the only way to achieve a  
critical mass expertise within NZ's research and development sector.  
Organisations ringing the AUS for further information were gently advised to  
check the date of the release!

OTAGO PROPOSAL DISENFRANCHISES ACADEMICS FROM VOTING ON COUNCIL  
REPRESENTATION  
Academic staff at Otago are bristling at the Vice-Chancellor's proposals for  
the Senate that would see a downgrading of their voting rights on the  
University Council representation.  
Currently three of the Council's members are elected by academic staff. The  
proposal involves the non-elected Senate having the capacity to 'elect' two  
of its members to be two of the three academic staff members of Council.  
This would mean that academic staff could only directly elect one of the  
three academic members of Council instead of three.  
"If the Vice-Chancellor wants overlap between the membership of Senate and  
Council, there are other ways to achieve it short of drastically curtailing  
the democratic rights of academics to participate in the governance of their  
institution," said AUS Otago branch president, Michael Robertson. He  
suggested that co-option was available to achieve overlap.

  
WORLD WATCH

· UK TREASURY APPOINTS NZ ECONOMIST  
Current Director of Macroeconomic Forecasting and Policy in the New Zealand  
Treasury, Roger Procter, has been appointed as Chief Economist in the Public  
Services Directorate (PSD), one of the most senior and influential posts in  
the UK Treasury.  
His is the second appointment from outside the Civil Service to the Board of  
PSD in the last two months.

· UNION TO CHART CHANGING SECTOR  
Changes in work patterns, funding, the user-pays trend and quality in  
universities will be revealed in a national audit to be carried out by  
Australia's National Tertiary Education Union.  
The report resulting from the audit, which will identify crisis points and  
problem areas in universities, will be released next year in time to link  
with the federal election cycle.  
NTEU president Carolyn Allport said the audit would focus on material that  
was not currently collected. The union wanted to use the data not just to  
raise public consciousness but to reflect the need for broader  
accountability.  
The NTEU project comes amid concern about the lack of an independent  
government advisory structure, particularly with a deregulation agenda in  
the offing. A progress report is expected by September.

NO EDUCATION VOUCHERS IN FLORIDA  
In a tremendous victory for families and children, a Florida Circuit Court  
found last month that the Florida State constitution means what it says --  
that children are guaranteed the right to free, public education. As Judge  
Ralph L. Smith Jr. stated, "Tax dollars may not be used to send the children  
of this state to a private school."  
This ruling puts a stake in the heart of the voucher movement, sending a  
strong signal across the States that vouchers are no substitute for a  
quality public education.
