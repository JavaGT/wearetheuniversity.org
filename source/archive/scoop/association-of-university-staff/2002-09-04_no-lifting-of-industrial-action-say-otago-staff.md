No lifting of industrial action say Otago University staff

The Otago University Combined Unions Negotiating Team met today to discuss how to further progress employment agreement negotiations.

The huge show of support for university staff strike action on Monday has seen the Vice-Chancellor quoted in the Otago Daily Times as saying that \"the university would be prepared to negotiate beyond 1.5% to get this thing settled."

Combined Unions spokesperson, Dr Shef Rogers, said that the unions have decided to attempt mediation through the Employment Relations Mediation Service as a possible way forward, in the hope that this may see a new offer from the employer that enables formal negotiation to recommence.

“There will be no lifting of the current action around withholding exam questions, however, until a new offer is before members, and such action is rescinded by a vote of members,” said Dr Rogers.
