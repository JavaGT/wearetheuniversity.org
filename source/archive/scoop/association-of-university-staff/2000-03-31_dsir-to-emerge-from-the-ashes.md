DSIR to emerge from the ashes?

The Association for United Science (AUS) has welcomed rumours that the Government is seriously contemplating the merger of the various Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) into a new Department of Science and Innovation (DSI).

Neville Whitefoot, chair of AUS national council said in Christchurch that the fragmented and competitive nature of the CRI research and development sector in New Zealand was a major barrier to New Zealand developing a knowledge economy. \"Only by merging these small entities will we obtain the critical mass needed for the information economy in the 21st century."

“The establishment of DSI will also provide an opportunity for funds that are currently spent on managerial salaries and wasteful competition to be channelled into coal-face science,” said Neville Whitefoot.

“We understand that the new DSI will be the operational arm of the country’s research initiatives while the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology will continue to be the policy arm”, said Rob Crossbearer, General Secretary of AUS.

"AUS expects the new DSI to be widely welcomed by farming, technology and research leaders, who have been active in calling for government initiatives to merge institutions in the research and development area".
