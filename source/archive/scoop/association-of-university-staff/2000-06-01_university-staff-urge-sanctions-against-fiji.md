The Association of University Staff (AUS) has today called on its members not to take up appointments at the University of the South Pacific, not to attend academic conferences in Fiji, and not to undertake consultancy work which is not part of a humanitarian aid project.

“AUS condemns the actions of the terrorists and their use of arms and hostages to force the overthrow of the democratically-elected Government and constitution of Fiji.

“We support the call for an immediate release of the hostages, reinstatement of constitutional democracy and the return of all recognised human rights and freedom in Fiji,” said AUS National President, Neville Blampied, in Wellington today.
