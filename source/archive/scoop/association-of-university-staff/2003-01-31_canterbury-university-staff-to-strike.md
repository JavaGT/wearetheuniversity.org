Canterbury University Staff to Strike
=====================================

Members of the combined unions at the University of Canterbury have voted to take a 24 hour strike during Enrolment Week (17 – 21 February).

University of Canterbury AUS Branch President Jane Guise said today that “The vote was overwhelmingly in favour of strike action. Union members have sent a clear message to University Management that they will not accept the lowest pay offer to University staff in the country.”

The decision on which day to strike will be made at a stop-work meeting to be held on 17th February – the first day of Enrolment.

“University management have now offered to meet again, and we welcome the opportunity to resolve this crisis. However members have articulated their bottom line, and we believe the management must take this on board in their response”, Jane Guise said.

Jane Guise said that the ball is firmly in the employer’s court. “They can take the sensible approach to meet our reasonable demands and avert the strike, or they can force members into taking the action that has been planned. The responsibility for disrupting Enrolment Week rests entirely with them.”

The unions have organised a rally for Monday 3rd February 2003 to voice their frustration, coinciding with the campus visits of the prospective Vice Chancellor candidates. “We want to show them that the successful candidate must see rebuilding the damaged staff relationships as a priority,” Jane Guise concluded.

Release ends

Note: The rally will commence at 9am on Monday 3rd February.  
It will be held between the Registry and library buildings.
