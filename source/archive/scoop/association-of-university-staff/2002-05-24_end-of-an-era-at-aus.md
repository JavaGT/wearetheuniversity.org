Association of University Staff (AUS) General Secretary, Rob Crozier, steps down today after more than 22 years in the position.

Mr Crozier, who commenced in December 1979, has been involved with a myriad of changes in the tertiary education sector, including numerous reviews and legislative changes, and has worked with 7 Ministers with responsibility for tertiary education.

During his tenure, the AUS had grown considerably in terms of its membership and staffing numbers, and overall budget. Membership has increased from 2,500 to 6,200 and staff numbers from 3 to 18. The overall budget is now $1.7 million (net of gst) compared with around $57,000 in 1979.

Mr Crozier, who is an elected director of PSIS, says he intends expanding his interests in this area.

Helen Kelly commences as AUS General Secretary on Monday 27 May. She comes from the position of Assistant Secretary (Industrial/Professional) at NZEI.
