Multi-employer contracts possible but not certain
=================================================

The Association of University Staff (AUS) has reacted with concern to reports that it plans to seek multi-employer contracts in the universities.

AUS has welcomed the introduction of the Employment Relations Bill as, combined with the Government’s declared intention to make the tertiary education sector operate in a more co-operative way, it provides scope for the real value of staff to the institutions to be recognised.

AUS National President, Neville Blampied, confirmed from Christchurch yesterday that AUS had resolved to develop and implement a national political/industrial strategy on university academic pay and conditions based on national and international relativities.

“This does not automatically translate into negotiations for a multi-employer contract. The proposed select committee inquiry into the resourcing of tertiary education, for example, could have a profound impact on salary levels in the sector.”

“As we understand it, before any multi-employer agreement could be negotiated this would first have to be approved by a majority of employees on each site.”

“AUS is extremely democratic in the way it takes such decisions. Members ultimately determine AUS policy and, as 50% of AUS members are general staff, their views will also be taken into account,” he said.
