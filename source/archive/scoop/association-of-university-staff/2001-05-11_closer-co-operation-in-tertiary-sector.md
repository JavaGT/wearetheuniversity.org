======================================

**Press Release: [Association of University Staff](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff)**

![AUS WEB SITE](http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif)The Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE), Association of University Staff (AUS) and Technical Institutes’ Allied Staff Association (TIASA) met in Wellington today and agreed to create a new formal entity – the Council of Unions in Tertiary Education (CUTE).

Leaders of the three unions said that the aim of CUTE was to provide a forum for discussing issues of general concern to all staff in the tertiary education sector.

“This is an important development in light of the future engagement that tertiary sector staff envisage with the proposed Tertiary Education Commission.

“CUTE, which will be made up of the Presidents and General Secretaries of the three unions will meet on a regular basis during 2001 and 2002. Its future will be reviewed in 2003,” they said.
