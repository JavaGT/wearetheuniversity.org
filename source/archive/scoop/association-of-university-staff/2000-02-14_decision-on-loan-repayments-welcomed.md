The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the Government’s announcement that part-time students on low incomes will qualify for a full write-off on their student loan, if their annual income is lower than $24,596.

“From the inception of the student loan scheme, the Association has been critical of the threshold at which loans repayments commence,” said AUS President, Neville Blampied, in Wellington today.

“The Government’s decision fits well with a philosophy of encouraging life-long learning and retraining for new employment possibilities.”

“Growth in university enrolments has ceased and it is imperative for the future of New Zealand that all aspects of the loan scheme and student allowance provision are re-evaluated, along with Government funding for tertiary education.”

“We see this as the primary task of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission, which the Government has promised to establish,” said Mr Blampied.
