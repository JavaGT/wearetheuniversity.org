Waikato Court decision to stand

The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Bryan Gould's decision to abandon his appeal against the High Court decision, which struck down his proposed restructuring of parts of the University.

"The Association was always confident that the judgment was legally correct and that the Vice-Chancellor did not have the managerial powers he claimed. We are pleased that Professor Gould has now accepted that", said AUS National President, Professor Jane Kelsey.

"Staff concerns about managerial excesses are not confined to Waikato and this case had resonance throughout the country. At Victoria University, similar criticism was a significant factor in the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor Professor Irving, announced yesterday. Problems exist at most other New Zealand universities.

"Professor Gould's decision is a timely recognition that current university management practices will have to change. The Government has made it plain that market-driven competition is to end and that universities are to return to their traditional functions and values.

"The AUS welcomes that shift, and will work hard to ensure that the Vice-Chancellors implement the necessary changes. We will work constructively and positively with them towards that end," said Professor Kelsey.

Professor Kelsey can be contacted on 021 680 475
