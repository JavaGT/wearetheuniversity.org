University negotiations resume

University unions and employers will meet in Christchurch on Wednesday and Thursday this week to resume the negotiation of national collective employment agreements in the university sector.

The university unions have claimed a salary increase of 10% per annum over the next three years for academic staff and 10% in 2004 for general (non-academic) staff plus increases in job evaluation alignments to the higher quartiles of the salary market.

The unions are seeking national collective employment agreements for academic and general staff, as part of an effort to ensure the long term sustainability of high-quality university education in New Zealand.
