Increase of confidence for Māori

Māori members of the Association of University Staff (AUS) today met with the Associate Minister of Education, Hon Parekura Horomia, and have an increase of confidence in the consultation process around the Tertiary Education Strategy.

“Following the meeting this morning, we are confident that our concerns around the inclusion of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and a Māori tertiary component in the Tertiary Education Strategy will be acted upon by the Minister” said Naomi Manu, AUS Māori Officer.

“It is important that agencies accountable to the NZ Government allow a transparent and stringent consultation process with key stakeholders” said Leighton Te Kowhai-Tuagalu, AUS Tuarua Māori. “The meeting with the Minister today has given us assurances to this effect.”

The Minister also gave his assurance around the party opposition to the Deletion of the Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Bill.
