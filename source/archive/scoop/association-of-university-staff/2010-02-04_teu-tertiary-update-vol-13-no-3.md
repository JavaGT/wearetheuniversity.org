PM DIAGNOSES TERTIARY EDUCATION WITH ECONOMIC WOES

The prime minister John Key told TV3's Sunrise this week that he has  
given Steven Joyce the tertiary education portfolio to sort out the sector's  
economic issues.

"If you look at the tertiary sector a lot of the challenges that lie before  
that sector are quite economic in nature", stated the prime minister.

"There are some polytechnics which are struggling financially. There are  
issues around basically how the student loan policy works. There could be  
improvements in that policy, for instance. There're a lot of economic issues  
in there and from our perspective Steven Joyce is well placed to take on  
those issues."

When later challenged by NZUSA co-president David Do on what 'improvements'  
to the student loan scheme might mean, the Prime Minister confirmed that the  
government is not going to change interest-free student loans, telling the  
New Zealand Herald:

"At the margins, at the boundaries, there are specific issues where, as I  
understand it, the universities and the student associations have been  
having some discussions," Mr Key said. "But zero percent loans remain."

Mr Joyce has not made any public statement yet on his views regarding the  
economic situation of New Zealand's tertiary education system generally, or  
how best to address the problem of financially struggling polytechnics.

UNIVERSITY OF OTAGO TO MERGE SCHOOLS TO SAVE MONEY

A University of Otago is proposing to merge the departments of Design  
Studies and Clothing and Textile Sciences.

The university told staff in the departments last week of a proposal to  
establish a department of Applied Sciences, which would incorporate Clothing  
and Textile Sciences and elements of the department of Design Studies.

"The process of considering the proposal is at an early stage, and people  
who work in these departments are currently being consulted," pro  
vice-chancellor, sciences, Professor Vernon Squire told the Otago Daily  
Times.

Prof Squire told the Otago Daily Times the university was facing a  
difficult financial environment and the proposal was partly the result of  
this situation.

"It is too early to determine how this might affect jobs and a specific  
time-frame is not established."

TEU national president Dr Tom Ryan says that announcements like these are  
challenging for staff who are concerned not only about their employment, but  
with the interests of their students, as well as maintaining their  
subject’s presence in the university.

"TEU staff and members are considering the proposals, and will provide the  
university with a response to them. However it is too early to guess at  
outcomes, as this is just the beginning of the consultation phase."

"This is part of ongoing restructuring in the tertiary education sector and  
highlights financial pressure in the sector. I hope the new minister of  
tertiary education recognises the need to invest in tertiary education in a  
way that protects jobs and professional skills, while also enhancing  
educational outcomes for students," said Dr Ryan.

TAX REFORMS UNLIKELY TO ADDRESS FUNDING OR INEQUALITY

Prime minister John Key is preparing to announce at the opening of  
parliament next week his government's view on reforms to the tax system.  
At this stage he has ruled out increasing the government's revenue base so  
that it can better afford to fund tertiary education and other sectors that  
must drive any economic recovery.

However, CTU economist Bill Rosenberg has warned that the Tax Working Group,  
which the prime minister established and recently has reported back to him,  
may not have considered the issues broadly enough.

"It limited its view of the taxation system largely to its revenue gathering  
purpose. Yet there are other purposes for the taxation system, notably to  
redistribute income in an unequal society. Given the substantial rise in  
inequality and poverty in New Zealand, particularly over the 1980’s and  
90’s, this review was an ideal opportunity to look for ways to use the  
taxation system for this important social purpose."

Dr Rosenberg says that officials did a good job of testing different  
proposals for their effect on income inequality and poverty, but the results  
were used to maintain the inequality status quo rather than improve things.

TEU national president Dr Tom Ryan says it is unfortunate that the  
government still fails to see that investment in higher education is an  
important way of beating recession, creating employment opportunities for  
young people, and improving the economy.

"United States president Obama recently said 'the best anti-poverty  
programme around is a world-class education’. Like the United States,  
France, Germany, Australia and so many other countries, New Zealand could  
make the same wise choice. But first of all we need to see that choice as an  
investment rather than a cost," said Dr Ryan.

TERTIARY EDUCATION WON'T MAKE YOU RICH - IN NEW ZEALAND

A series of indicators released by the Ministry of Education last month  
shows that New Zealanders who gain a tertiary education qualification can  
expect a substantially smaller return on their investment, in terms of  
earning potential, than students in other countries.

Average earnings in 2007 for New Zealanders with a tertiary education are 21  
percent higher, compared to those with only upper secondary and  
post-secondary non-tertiary education. This is lower than equivalent figures  
for Australia (31 percent) and considerably lower than the OECD average  
across 25 countries of 52 percent. In 2007, both the United States (72  
percent) and the United Kingdom (57 percent) had very high premiums for  
tertiary education over these lower levels education.

The ministry states that this is important because the success of an  
education system is manifested in, amongst other things, the success of  
individuals in finding sustainable employment as well as the level of wages  
that employers are willing to pay for the skills and knowledge that the  
individual brings to a job.

"These labour market advantages are an important outcome of education. They  
may even be the primary economic and social outcome, because earned income  
enables people to achieve a higher standard of living and many of the other  
individual and national outcomes associated with education may accrue either  
directly or indirectly from higher incomes."

MINISTRY UNLIKELY TO REACH PASIFIKA TERTIARY EDUCATION TARGET

The Pasifika Education Plan: Monitoring Report 2008 published by the  
Ministry of Education at the end of last year, sets a target to increase the  
completion rates for young Pasifika people in tertiary education. However,  
its target is still significantly lower than the existing completion rates  
for young non-Pasifika people.

The ministry is aiming to raise the five-year completion rates for Pasifika  
people aged 18 to 24 in qualifications at levels four and above from 37  
percent of those first enrolled in 2004 to 43 percent of those first  
enrolled in 2008. The five year completion rate for non-Pasifika people of  
the same age first enrolled in 2004 is significantly over 50 percent.

The ministry notes in its report that it needs to change its approach if it  
is to reach this target:

"While the New Zealand recession is likely to increase the retention rate  
for young Pasifika students in the foreseeable future as younger people find  
it harder to gain employment when the labour market weakens, it is unlikely  
that the target will be met without some form of intervention."

In fact, the ministry estimates that without intervention the completion  
rate is likely to be just 39 percent.

The report also notes that the participation rate by Pasifika students in  
postgraduate-level study continued to increase. The Pasifika participation  
rate in postgraduate study has risen from 0.40 percent in 2001 to 0.58  
percent in 2008. It now is forecast to reach 0.72 percent by 2012, lower  
than the previous target of one percent by 2012.
