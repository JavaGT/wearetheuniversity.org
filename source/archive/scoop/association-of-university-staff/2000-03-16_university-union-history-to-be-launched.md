University union history to be launched
=======================================

**Thursday, 16 March 2000, 8:39 am**  
**Press Release: [Association of University Staff](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff)**

The Association of University Staff (formerly the Association of University Teachers) is launching its published history in Parliament’s Grand Hall this evening.

The publication, Professionals and Unionists, covers the 75–year history of the Association for the period 1923 –1998 and was written by Emeritus Professor Nicholas Tarling of Auckland University, a former National President of the Association.

AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier, said that Parliament has been chosen for the launch because more than 10% of MPs (including the Prime Minister) are ex members of the Association. Former member, the Hon Steve Maharey, now Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, will formally launch the publication.

Rob Crozier said that New Zealand’s union history was an important facet of the nation’s past and he was pleased that the Association had committed itself to commissioning this work.

“The launch comes during a week in which organisations such as ourselves will again have to regroup for the next phase of our existence.”

Note: Professionals and Unionists (132 pp) can be obtained from the Association of University Staff, P.O. Box 11-767, Wellington; price $15 (incl. Gst, p&p)
