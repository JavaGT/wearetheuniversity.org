Maori participation in tertiary education declines

The Association of University Staff (AUS) has called for an improvement in the rates of Maori participation in tertiary-education. This follows the publication of a series of fact sheets by the Ministry of Education showing that, while Maori participation rates were proportionately higher than other groups, the actual numbers of Maori student enrolments in 2005 had decreased by 1,860, or 3.4 percent, equivalent full-time students from 2004.

Te Kahurangi Whaiti, the Maori sector of AUS, said the fact sheets also showed that the numbers of Maori enrolling in bachelor degrees had decreased by 0.2% between 2004 and 2005.

AUS Maori Officer, Naomi Manu said concerns arose over the fact that the majority of Maori learners are still concentrated in the lower levels of tertiary-education and that Maori students at bachelors level are more likely to be aged twenty-five years and over. She said that Maori participation at lower levels of tertiary education comes as a result of secondary schooling failing Maori. “Many Maori are constantly in catch-up mode, so that, rather than entering at higher levels, many Maori enter tertiary education to receive the education and training that they should have received at school.”

”With the omission of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Te Rautaki Matauranga Maori in the new Tertiary Education Strategy, and also the withdrawal of Manaaki Tauira, we remain concerned that Maori participation will continue to decline,” Mrs Manu said.
