MEDICAL AND DENTAL ACADEMICS REJECT SETTLEMENT
==============================================

Medical and Dental Academic staff members of AUS employed by the University of Otago have voted to reject the salary offer made by their employer.

The offer was the same as that made to (and rejected by) other University of Otago staff – a 2% lump sum payment with a further 2% to be added to salaries in February 2002.

The AUS advocate for the negotiations, Marty Braithwaite, said that the offer was regarded by members as “woefully inadequate”.

“The Vice-Chancellor has acknowledged that there are serious problems with recruitment and retention in this area but has done nothing to address this issue with the offer he has made” said Mr Braithwaite.

It is expected that the Medical/Dental staff will now join with their colleagues in a programme of industrial action in pursuit of a better settlement.
