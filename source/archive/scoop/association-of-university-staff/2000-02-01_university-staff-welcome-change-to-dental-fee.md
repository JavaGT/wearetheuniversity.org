The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the Government announcement of an increase in the tuition subsidy for dental students at Otago University.

AUS President, Neville Blampied, said in Christchurch today that the Association welcomed the injection of fairness and common sense involved.

“We are encouraged by this change in policy direction and look forward to a full review of the level of all course tuition subsidies once the proposed Tertiary Education Advisory Commission is established,” said Mr Blampied.
