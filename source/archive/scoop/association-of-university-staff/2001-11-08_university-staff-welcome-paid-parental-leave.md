Association of University Staff \[AUS\] Women’s Vice-President, Mary Cain, in  
Christchurch today, welcomed the Government’s announcement on paid parental  
leave. “This is a very positive first step towards what is accepted as standard practice  
in most other countries and is an important victory for New Zealand women and  
their families,” said Mary Cain, AUS Women’s Vice-President.

“To be competitive in an international labour market context, New Zealand must be seen as a country that offers a high quality working life and enlightened working conditions.

“Over 120 countries already provide for paid parental leave – we need now to build on the current welcome initiative and meet the International Labour Organisation requirement of 14 weeks paid leave as soon as possible,” continued Ms Cain.

“AUS will continue to work with other unions and community groups towards that end – and at the same time will be seeking to achieve this for our members through collective agreements with our employers.”
