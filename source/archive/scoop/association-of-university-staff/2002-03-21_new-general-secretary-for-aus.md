Helen Kelly has been appointed to the position of AUS General Secretary, commencing on 27 May.

Helen is currently Assistant Secretary, Professional/Industrial, at NZEI, a role which has given her oversight of large and very significant industrial negotiations and of policy development for a major education-sector union.

She was formerly a schoolteacher (Dip Teaching), was an AUS Branch Organiser at Victoria (1996-97), and is currently completing an LLB at Victoria’s School of Law.

Helen will bring to AUS a sharp intellect and a strong political and industrial strategic focus that will both serve the interests of all members and strengthen AUS as a union organisation.
