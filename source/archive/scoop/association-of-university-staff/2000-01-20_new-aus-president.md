Neville Blampied, a senior lecturer in Psychology at the University of Canterbury, has taken office as National President of the Association of University Staff (AUS).

Mr Blampied, a former AUS Canterbury Branch President, intends to capitalise on the Association’s strong international links and its success in stimulating and informing policy debate and development.

“We look forward to using our strengths and resources in helping the new Government to set up the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC), assisting TEAC to formulate and carry out its work programme, and in ensuring its independence.

“All members of AUS are committed to the development of a more cooperative, better planned, more differentiated, better funded and higher quality tertiary education system, and we will work enthusiastically during 2000 with all those who share these goals," said Mr Blampied.
