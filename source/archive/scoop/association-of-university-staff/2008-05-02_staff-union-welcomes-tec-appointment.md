Staff union welcomes TEC appointment

The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the appointment of Professor Roy Sharp as the new Chief Executive of the Tertiary Education Commission.

Professor Sharp is currently the vice-chancellor of the University of Canterbury and will take up his new position in August this year.

AUS National President, Associate Professor Maureen Montgomery, said the appointment of a chief executive from the university sector would ensure that there was a clear understanding of the issues faced by universities and their role within the Tertiary Education Strategy.

Associate Professor Montgomery said AUS had worked well with Professor Sharp in his role as Chair of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, particularly in the establishment of a tripartite process among the universities, government and university unions. “Through that process, around $46 million in new funding was made available to university staff for funding for salaries,” she said. “We are confident that we will continue that positive working relationship with Professor Sharp at TEC.”
