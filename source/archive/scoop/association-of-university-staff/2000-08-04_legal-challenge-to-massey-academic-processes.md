The Association of University Staff (AUS) is issuing proceedings to challenge the internal academic decision-making processes followed by Massey University in its ‘repositioning’ exercise.

AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier, said in Wellington today that the Association believed that the mandated procedures at Massey University have not been followed.

“To enable this dispute to be resolved, Massey University Council has agreed to withhold from consideration some of the recommendations before it today and will not proceed to implement others pending the outcome of the Court hearing,” said Mr Crozier.

It is anticipated that the High Court hearing will take place early in September.
