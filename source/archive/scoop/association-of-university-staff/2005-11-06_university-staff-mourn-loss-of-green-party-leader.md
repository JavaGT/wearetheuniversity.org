University Staff Mourn Loss of Green Party Leader
=================================================

**Press Release: [Association of University Staff](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff)**

The Association of University Staff (AUS) today expressed great sorrow at the death of Green Party Co-Leader, Rod Donald.

AUS Secretary Helen Kelly said that Mr Donald was the principled leader of a political party which has always supported trade unions and working people. She said that Mr Donald had long promoted policies which were consistent with those of the AUS, and had been an advocate for a well resourced and high-quality university system.

“Mr Donald has had a long personal association with our organisation and a number of staff and members, in some cases well preceding his Parliamentary career, and his contribution and support has been greatly appreciated,” said Ms Kelly. “Union members will be both shocked and saddened to hear of Mr Donald’s death.”

Ms Kelly said that Mr Donald had displayed remarkable political maturity, most recently being instrumental in allowing the formation of the new Government.

Ms Kelly passed on her condolences to Mr Donald’s family and to the Green party.
