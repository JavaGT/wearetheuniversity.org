AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier, has today emailed the NBR editor and cancelled the AUS subscription in protest at the naming of the police officer involved in the recent incident at Waitara.

Noting that the editor had acknowledged on Morning Report that he had published the name “because he could”, AUS has suggested that NBR reimburse the New Zealand Herald for expenses incurred in challenging the name suppression.

Police Association President, Greg O’Connor, has welcomed AUS support.
