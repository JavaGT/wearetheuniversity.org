Media Release

UNIVERSITY UNIONS CONFIDENT OF STRONG SUPPORT

The combined unions are expecting strong support for the strike at the University of Otago today spokesman Dr Shef Rogers said.

Union members voted to implement a half day strike from 12.15 PM in support of an 8% pay claim in their collective agreement negotiations with the University of Otago. Union members have also voted to implement rolling stoppages and a work to rule if no breakthrough in the negotiations is achieved after the strike.

\"We are not fazed by the Vice Chancellors predictions that our members will not support the strike and that classes will not be affected by the action. The huge turnout at the stopwork meeting and clear support for the strike action resolutions tells us that members will support this action and classes will face major disruption today."

"We say to students that if they are concerned about classes being cancelled then they are welcome to join our march and support the action we are taking, or stay home and avoid the disappointment of turning up to an empty lecture theatre."

Unions members will cease work at 12.15 PM and gather outside the central library for a march past the Registry building. Members will then march from the Dental School to the Octagon from 1 PM.
