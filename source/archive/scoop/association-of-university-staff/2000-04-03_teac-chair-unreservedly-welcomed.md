The Association of University Staff (AUS) unreservedly welcomes the appointment of Dr Norman Kingsbury as chair of the Tertiary Education Advisory Committee.

“Dr Kingsbury has a great wealth of knowledge and experience which will provide a very sound foundation to TEAC,” said Neville Blampied, AUS President in Christchurch today.

“Dr Kingsbury has an intimate knowledge of how universities, other tertiary institutions and the Ministry work, and is universally respected within the sector.

“He understands the different values, culture, nature and purposes of universities and other tertiary education sector institutions exceptionally well, and will bring a humane, principled and flexible perspective to the task of developing a strategic vision for the sector.

We warmly welcome the opportunity to work with the TEAC under Norman Kingsbury's leadership,” said Mr Blampied.
