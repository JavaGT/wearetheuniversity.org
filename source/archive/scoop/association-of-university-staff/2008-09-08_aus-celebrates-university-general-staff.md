AUS celebrates university general staff

Monday 8 September 2008

Local university branches of the Association of University Staff will be holding lunchtime activities to celebrate the contribution of general staff to the life of our universities this coming Wednesday, 10 September.

“The celebration and associated events are a great opportunity for the union to highlight the valuable work that general staff undertake in universities,” said AUS general staff vice-president, Cate Bardwell.

“The main event will be the General Staff Day on Wednesday 10 September, when each AUS branch will be organising a short programme of activities to be held over the lunch-break at its university. Many branches will be encouraging members to bring a friend to the lunchtime activities, which will be a positive event for all staff,” said Ms Bardwell

Leading up to the local events, each branch has also displayed a series of posters featuring general staff members, and will be distributing other promotional material up to and on the day.

To ensure that as many general staff as possible are able to participate in the branches’ lunchtime activities, approval has been sought from vice-chancellors by the union for an additional hour to be added to the lunch-break for general staff on the day. “This allows staff to engage fully with each other, interact, and network with other staff they may not often have the opportunity to see, as well as encouraging maximum participation in the event,” Ms Bardwell added.

“All vice-chancellors have supported the event, either granting the extended lunch hour or asking departmental managers to adopt a flexible approach to enable as many general staff as possible to attend the events. We are very appreciative of their support,” Ms Bardwell concluded.
