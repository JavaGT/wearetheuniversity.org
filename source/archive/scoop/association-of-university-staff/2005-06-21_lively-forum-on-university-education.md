Lively Forum on University Education
====================================

**Tuesday, 21 June 2005, 11:04 am**  
**Press Release: [Association of University Staff](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Association_of_University_Staff)**

Forum on University Education

Wednesday 22 June - 12.10pm

Hunter Lecture Theatre 323

Victoria University, Wellington

Speakers will include the Minister of Education, Hon Trevor Mallard (Labour), Bill English (National), Nandor Tanczos (Green), Craig McNair (NZ First) and Stephen Franks (ACT)

The forum will be introduced by Helen Kelly, General Secretary of the Association of University Staff who will outline the critical situation facing university staff following the breakdown of national collective employment agreement negotiations today.

Last week, the Minister of Education agreed to set up a University Salaries Group, involving employers, unions and the Government to look at ways of resolving salary problems in the sector. This week the employers rejected a cooperative approach.

Against this background the forum promises to host some lively debate.

Note: The Hunter Building is the historic centrepiece building at Victoria University. It can be reached by the first or second driveways off to the left ascending Kelburn Parade. Hunter Lecture Theatre 323 is on the third floor and is reached by stairs at the south end of the building (not by the central stairway).
