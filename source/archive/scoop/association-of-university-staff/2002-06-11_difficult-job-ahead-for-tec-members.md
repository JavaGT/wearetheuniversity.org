The commissioners appointed today to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) have an important and hard job ahead of them said Association of University Staff (AUS) General Secretary, Helen Kelly today.

“The current shortages of funding in the tertiary sector and the reluctance by Government to increase the funding in any real way, will mean making a difference to both quality and access of tertiary education is going to be a most difficult challenge for the new commissioners.

“Unless the Government bites the bullet and commits to investing real new money in the sector, the commissioners will only be able to deliver more of the same. We will be watching for election policy that commits to new investment now that the election date has been announced.

The AUS has also expressed disappointment at the composition of the TEC. “We are disappointed that two key stakeholders – students and staff – have no direct voice on the Commission and that many of the commissioners are senior executives for institutions that will receive money from the TEC,” said Helen Kelly.
