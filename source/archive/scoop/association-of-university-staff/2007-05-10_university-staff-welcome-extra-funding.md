University staff welcome extra funding

The Association of University Staff (AUS) has welcomed the announcement today by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Dr Michael Cullen, that universities will receive $129 million in new funding over the next four years.

Of that new funding, $20 million has been specifically allocated to the University Tripartite Forum this year to explore and create opportunities to increase the competitiveness of New Zealand universities through recruitment and retention strategies.

Responding to today’s pre-Budget announcement, AUS General Secretary Helen Kelly said that the unions representing university staff had successfully engaged with vice-chancellors and the Government over the past two years through the tripartite process and had made significant gains towards addressing funding and salary problems in the university sector. “The new funding allocation will assist us to continue to address salary issues and allow us to develop a broader agenda that will provide additional benefits for the sector,” she said. “The union is pleased that the Government recognises that universities are under funded and is looking at long-term sustainable solutions.”

According to Ms Kelly, today’s funding announcement illustrates what can be achieved when unions, vice-chancellors and the Government work together. “We know that the tripartite process has been successful in achieving consensus and providing results for universities, including university staff,” she said.

Ms Kelly said that AUS will now work with the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors Committee to determine the implications of today’s announcement for the current bargaining process.

Dr Cullen also announced today that student component funding to universities would increase by 2.2 percent next year, in line with current consumer price index figures. He also announced $10 million dollars this year that would be available for supporting change in the sector.
