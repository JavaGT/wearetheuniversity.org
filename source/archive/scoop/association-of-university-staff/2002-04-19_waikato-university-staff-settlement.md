Collective Agreements Settled at University of Waikato

  
Members of the Association of University Staff (AUS), the Public Service Association (PSA) and Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) yesterday voted by a majority to accept the University of Waikato’s latest salary offer.

This gives all members of those unions who are covered by the collective employment agreements a salary increase of 3.2% from 1 October 2001.

“Members are pleased at a positive settlement, given the depressing beginning of negotiations six months ago,” said AUS Waikato Branch President, Stan Jones.

"We were particularly pleased to see backdating to the end of the last agreement and the understanding that this applies to our members only”.

“The whole process happened against a background of the permanent financial crisis caused by successive governments deliberately reducing the investment the country has to make in its university system."

"Despite the difficulties this situation continues to produce, Waikato shows how all parties in the negotiations have managed a settlement in the best interests of this campus and the community it serves."
