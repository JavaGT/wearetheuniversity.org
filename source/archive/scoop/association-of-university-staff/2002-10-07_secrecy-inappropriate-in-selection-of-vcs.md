Secrecy inappropriate in selection of VCs

![AUS WEB SITE](http://www.aus.ac.nz/pictures/logo.gif)Secrecy inappropriate in selection of Vice-Chancellors

The Association of University Staff \[AUS\] has called on university councils to ensure that future selection processes for the position of Vice-Chancellor be conducted in a manner that is open to scrutiny by, and feedback from, all university staff, students and the public.

AUS National President, Dr Grant Duncan, reminded councils that the unique character of the university resides in its ideal of an open, unconditional and contestable pursuit of knowledge, based upon free collegial investigation, debate and inquiry.

‘The person who has the privilege to occupy the position of Vice-Chancellor is entrusted with upholding these principles of the contemporary university. A university is not like other public-sector organisations, and it is certainly not a commercial enterprise.

Any applicant for the post of Vice-Chancellor who insists on absolute confidentiality during the selection process, or who refuses to be presented to the university community as a candidate, has effectively declared him- or herself unworthy of the job.’

Dr Duncan’s comments were directed at future selection processes expected to occur in New Zealand universities.
