The Lincoln Association of University Staff \[AUS\] will have a presence at the  
Lincoln University Graduation this Friday (April 12), according to Branch  
Vice-President Walt Abell.

"We will have a table and display in the main foyer with messages of  
congratulation to the graduands but we will also have leaflets and posters  
warning about the desperate underfunding of universities by the  
government", he said.

The AUS Lincoln branch originally considered making a more formal protest  
outside the graduation venue but opted for a lower key approach. "Many of  
our members are committed to participating in the graduation and not just  
by sitting on stage. Quite a few are acting as ushers and marshalls, jobs  
which are crucial to the smooth running of the ceremony", said Mr Abell.

"I think that the high participation of staff at the graduation and the  
constructive way that they are expressing concerns about university  
funding demonstrates the commitment of Lincoln staff to the students," he  
added.

Lincoln AUS members are still in negotiations with the university over  
a new employment contract.
