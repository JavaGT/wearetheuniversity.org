UNIVERSITY STAFF URGE SANCTIONS AGAINST FIJI SITUATION  
Association of University Staff (AUS) members have been asked not to take up appointments at the University of the South Pacific, not to attend academic conferences in Fiji, and not to undertake consultancy work unless it's part of a humanitarian aid project.  
"AUS supports the call for an immediate release of the hostages, reinstatement of constitutional democracy and the return of all recognised human rights and freedom in Fiji," said AUS National President, Neville Blampied.

Also in Tertiary Update this week:  
1\. Reinvestment in Tertiary Education Signalled  
2\. 'Labour, Labour, Don't Rob Your Student Neighbour!'  
3\. Women Main Award Winners at Victoria  
4\. Highest Student Debtor Tops $130,000  
5\. Government Moves to Establish Education Council  
6\. AUS National Office New Telephone Numbers  
7\. Values in Education National Conference

REINVESTMENT IN TERTIARY EDUCATION SIGNALLED  
Associate Minister of Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey, said yesterday that reinvestment in the tertiary education sector was an important issue for Government.  
He indicated that if students were to continue to receive a quality education, it would be necessary to ensure that staff were sufficiently well paid to keep them in New Zealand.  
While AUS is not hopeful that these matters will be redressed in the Budget on 15 June, we believe that the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission's work will provide strong support for the need to revitalise the university system.

'LABOUR, LABOUR! DON'T ROB YOUR STUDENT NEIGHBOUR!'  
A message of solidarity to Massey staff facing redundancy finished off a day of protest by Waikato students in Hamilton this week.  
'Massey says cutback- we say fightback!' was among the slogans shouted on the 'Education Freedom Bus' tour which visited Labour MP Dianne Yates' office, Labour MP Martin Gallagher's office at the Ministry of Education and the central WINZ office.  
"Dianne Yates and Labour- Don't rob your student neighbour" was the call from the fifty-strong picket, protesting that the Labour MPs saying that free education is unrealistic, benefited themselves from it when they were young.

WOMEN MAIN AWARD WINNERS AT VICTORIA  
Women students have won the majority of academic awards being presented at Victoria University's student award ceremonies on June 7 and 8. Of the 416 awards, 255 - sixty-one percent - have been won by women.  
Victoria University Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Academic) Roger Robinson linked the women's success to their rising participation rates in tertiary education.  
The latest (1998) figures for all New Zealand show 58,889 women at university compared to 49,048 men.  
Professor Robinson noted that women were also now a majority in areas such as law, traditionally a male preserve, and that many of the best students were mature women, who now make up greater numbers than previously.

HIGHEST STUDENT DEBTOR TOPS $130,000  
Figures just released to APSU and NZUSA under the Official Information Act show that the highest student loan account currently held by the IRD is between $130,000 and $140,000.  
The figures also show that the percentage of students and graduates in higher debt brackets is increasing.  
"The core causes of debt - fees and the lack of a universal living allowance - must be addressed in the upcoming Budget," said Sam Huggard, co-president of the New Zealand University Students' Association.  
Students in Hamilton, Wellington and Dunedin were protesting this week about these two issues.

GOVERNMENT MOVES TO ESTABLISH EDUCATION COUNCIL  
A new Education Council to be operating by the middle of next year was announced by Education Minister Trevor Mallard this week.  
"The Council will be an expansion of the Teacher Registration Board and will help the Government in its objectives to lift standards in education," Trevor Mallard said.  
The Council's roles will include setting standards for registration, looking at pre-service education and training, ongoing professional development, and administering the police and character checks on teachers.  
"A professional body for teachers is long overdue. It has the potential to improve the quality in our schools and early childhood centres through promoting best practice and high quality standards in teaching," Mr Mallard said.

WORLD WATCH

\* MALES THE 'SECOND SEX'  
Campus Review (May 24-30, 2000) reports that males are now the 'second sex' on Australian university campuses. There are now 68,000 more female students than male, and more female staff than male. Of the 162,000 students who finished their awards in 1998, 56% were women.  
Female students now dominate 6 of the 10 major fields of study.

\* SEX PAY GAP IN HIGHER EDUCATION GETS WIDER  
In an analysis by the Association of University Teachers (UK), latest figures show that the university pay gap is wider than a year ago, with men earning on average 18% more than women, compared to 17% in 1997-98.  
David Triesman, general secretary of the AUT, said every university should be shocked into action. In some groups at some institutions the pay differential is over 25%.
