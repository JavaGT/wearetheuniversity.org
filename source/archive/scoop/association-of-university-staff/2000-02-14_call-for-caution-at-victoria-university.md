Call for caution at Victoria University
=======================================

The Association of University Staff (AUS) has urged Victoria University to take a cautious approach to proposed lay-offs in the Faculty of Humanities.

AUS Executive Director, Rob Crozier, acknowledged that Victoria University had been severely penalised by the changes to postgraduate student funding that had been made in the last Budget.

“The present Government, however, is committed to a review of the funding system and will shortly be establishing a Tertiary Education Advisory Commission to assist with such a review.

“The Government has also promised a move away from the competitive market model in tertiary education. The Association therefore challenges Victoria to re-evaluate its priorities and reduce its expenditure on marketing and public relations before cutting the core business of the university,” said Mr Crozier.
