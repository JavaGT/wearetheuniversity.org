University union appoints new Deputy Secretary

The Association of University Staff (AUS) has announced the appointment of Nanette Cormack as its Deputy Secretary. The role is a new one, and will strengthen the management and industrial leadership of the Association.

Nanette brings to the Association significant experience in senior union positions, including ten years as the London Regional Secretary of the general workers union, Amicus, which represents staff in the National Health Service and local government, as well as the private sector across the United Kingdom. Prior to then she gained union experience in New Zealand with the Clerical Workers and Finsec (finance sector) unions.

For the last two years, Nanette has worked for the New Zealand Council of Trade unions developing policy and working with unions to build capability and capacity around pay and employment equity.

AUS National President, Professor Nigel Haworth, said that Nanette will lead the Association’s bargaining strategy this year, and will be the lead advocate for the combined unions in forthcoming collective employment agreement negotiations with the country’s universities.

“Nanette’s role in the development of the pay and employment equity will also be invaluable, with the scheduled implementation of pay and employment equity reviews in all universities this year,” Professor Haworth said.
