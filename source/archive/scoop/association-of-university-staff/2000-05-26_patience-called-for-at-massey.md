The National President of the Association of University Staff, Neville Blampied, has joined colleagues at Massey in condemning the untimely action of the Vice-Chancellor in signalling 116 redundancies among university staff.

“Government has clearly signalled its intention to seek rationalisation of course offerings throughout the sector and the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission (TEAC) is expected to provide advice on how this might best be achieved.

“We therefore urge the University to be patient and to postpone any decisions on the “repositioning and cost-saving exercise” until TEAC has reported on strategic directions,” said Neville Blampied.

“We also understand that while Massey continues to be in a surplus situation, it intends making decisions that will affect the lives of its staff before it knows what its final enrolment numbers for 2000 will be.”
