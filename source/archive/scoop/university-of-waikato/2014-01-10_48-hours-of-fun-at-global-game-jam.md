48 hours of fun at Global Game Jam
==================================

**Friday, 10 January 2014, 2:55 pm**  
**Press Release: [University of Waikato](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato)**

10 January 2014

The University of Waikato’s Computer Science Department is hosting a site for the world’s 6th Global Game Jam - GGJ 2014 from 24-26 January.

In a game jam, participants come together to make video games over a 48-hour period working in teams. People in over 100 countries take part.

The Global Game Jam (GGJ) takes place in the same 48 hours all over the world. The New Zealand game jams are from 5pm Friday, January 24 until 5pm Sunday, January 26.

Anyone can participate in a game jam: experienced professionals, students and wannabes. Teams will be formed at each of the local jams.

The university will make computer labs and work (and crash) space available, but participants are welcome to bring their own laptops. The university computer labs provide Windows 7, Visual Studio 2010, XNA Studio 4, Game Maker and Blender.

The rules of GGJ preclude participants from using pre-made content (including program code, audio, graphics, models etc) unless it was publicly available at least a month prior to the GGJ.

Participants need to bring sleeping bags/mats. Registration is $25 and covers the cost of food, drinks and a T-shirt.
