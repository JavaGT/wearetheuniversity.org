Tauranga Careers Expo to showcase Waikato’s coastal marine research

Live sea creatures in aquariums and research displays focused on the grounding of the Rena are just a few of the things to be on show next week on the University of Waikato’s Coastal Science stand at the Tauranga Careers and Business Expo.

Amongst others, Professor Chris Battershill, Chair of Coastal Science and Dr Phil Ross, research fellow, will be able to answer questions about studying Coastal Science at the University of Waikato in Tauranga, and the future career opportunities.

The Coastal Marine Group, part of the Faculty of Science & Engineering is a specialist operator in shallow water mapping and surveying, meeting the needs of researchers, managers, and developers of New Zealand’s marine and water resources.

Researchers from the Coastal Marine Group will be at the Tauranga Careers Expo, TECT Arena, Baypark Stadium on Friday 8 August from 9am-4pm and Saturday 9 August from 9.30am-3.30pm.
