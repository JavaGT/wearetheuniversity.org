**Top honour for top coach**

One of New Zealand’s most successful sports coaches is to receive an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Waikato.

Richard ‘Dick’ Tonks, MNZM, will receive his Honorary Doctorate at the University graduation ceremony at Claudelands on 15 April.

Mr Tonks has coached New Zealand rowing crews at the 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympics and has been hugely influential on some of our best rowers, including Philippa Baker, Brenda Lawson, Rob Waddell, Hamish Bond, Eric Murray, Mahe Drysdale, and Caroline and Georgina Evers-Swindell.

He has won five Halberg awards for coach of the year and was voted International Rowing Federation coach of the year and world rowing coach of the year in 2005, 2010 and 2012.

Rowers under his guidance have won around 30 Olympic and World Championship medals since 2004.

An Honorary Doctorate is the University’s most prestigious honour and University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says it is in recognition of Mr Tonks’ substantial and ongoing contribution to high performance rowing.

“Mr Tonks is has made a significant contribution to New Zealand through preparing some of our most successful Olympic athletes. Their successes have brought New Zealand immeasurable amounts of pride and some of our most memorable sporting moments.”

His coaching methods are based on the philosophy of ‘miles make champions’ first advocated by athletics coach Arthur Lydiard.

But Mr Tonks has also worked with the University of Waikato’s Department of Sport and Leisure Studies since 1998 to learn how far athletes can be pushed in training by testing blood, saliva, hormone levels, immune function, muscle damage and heart rates.

“He has certainly fulfilled the criteria for this award and proved himself a worthy recipient of the title of Honorary Doctor at the University of Waikato,” Professor Quigley says.

Mr Tonks says the recognition was totally unexpected and he struggled to understand what he had done to deserve it.

“I guess it’s the most unexpected source to be recognised by. It’s not something you can aim for and to come from an organisation with such a reputation and history as the University of Waikato is quite an honour.”

Mr Tonks was born in Whanganui and as a rower, won a silver medal at the 1972 Olympics in Munich in the coxless four.

After retiring as a competitive rower he turned to coaching, initially working nights so he could coach during the day. In the 2003 New Year Honours he was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to rowing.
