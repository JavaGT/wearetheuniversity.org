A post-doctoral roadshow

**A post-doctoral roadshow**

This year’s Research Management Law Association (RMLA) roadshow topic is ‘Conditions of Consent’, a topic that came about partly due to the research of University of Waikato doctoral student Marie Brown.

The RMLA works to promote understanding of resource management law and its implementation. It takes its message on the road to inform members about topical issues in the often delicate and controversial field of environmental law.

Dr Brown completed her PhD with professors Bruce Clarkson and Barry Barton, graduating in April 2014, and now works as the Senior Policy Analyst for the Environmental Defence Society.

Dr Brown’s PhD research focused on environmental monitoring and how pre-agreed ecological compensation was being met across 245 conditions in 81 different resource consents granted across New Zealand. She found that as many as a third of resource consent holders were not complying with their obligations set under consents granted based on the ecological measures promised by them.

The roadshow, which will include workshops, will travel the length of New Zealand with presentations in 10 cities during July and August. The workshop includes a range of speakers including Principal Judge of the Environment Court, Laurie Newhook.

Dr Brown says she is honoured to be invited to participate in such an important programme of workshops.

“Securing better outcomes from resource management in New Zealand is vital to our economy and our environment,” she says.

“Promoting good governance is a passion of mine, and is part of the overall ethos of the Environmental Defence Society, which I am fortunate to work for.”
