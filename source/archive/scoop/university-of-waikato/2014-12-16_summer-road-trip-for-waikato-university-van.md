**Summer road trip for Waikato University van**

What’s black, has mag wheels and will be turning up at Coromandel beaches in the New Year?

It’s the University of Waikato’s new-look van, which is heading to where the action is over summer, spending January 2 and 3 at Williamson Park in Whangamata and January 4 at Kennedy Park at Pauanui.

Waikato students and van volunteers Tia Sweet, Scott Martin and Shelby Wilson will be turning up the music while beachgoers drop in to play backyard cricket, volleyball and swingball, or just chill out on beanbags. There will be prizes and an opportunity to chat with the students about studying at Waikato.

  
Tia, who has just finished the second year of a conjoint Bachelor of Communication Studies and Bachelor of Social Science, says even though it will still be early in the year, people need to be thinking about enrolling and this will give them the perfect opportunity to talk to Waikato students about studying at the University of Waikato.

“I want other people to see how much fun studying at Waikato uni is. It’s full of awesome people and the student life is really strong. It’s great meeting new people as many of them can open doors to your future.

“At Waikato they’ve been very versatile and helpful because I started off doing one degree, then went to a conjoint. I’ve had lots of help with planning my study and it’s been no trouble switching papers, even half way through. They’re really flexible.”

Scott says starting at uni can be quite confusing, “but at Waikato they take the time to sit with you face-to-face to help you sort out what you want to do, and it’s really good”.

Scott has just finished the third year of a Bachelor of Management Studies and says he chose Waikato because the Waikato Management School has a strong reputation.

“I’m looking forward to our beach road-trip. It’ll be lots of fun and we hope to be able to let people who visit us at the van know what a cool place Waikato is to study.”
