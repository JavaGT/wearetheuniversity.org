**Waikato academic reappointed to PHARMAC**

University of Waikato governance expert Dr Jens Mueller has been reappointed by Health Minister Jonathan Coleman to a rare third 3-year term as a director of the PHARMAC board, where Dr Mueller also chairs the audit and forecasting committee.

During his past six years as director, since July 2010, PHARMAC has changed considerably and now assists with the procurement of medical devices, in addition to negotiating more than $850 million a year of medicines. This saves New Zealand taxpayers an estimated $25 million, which is made available to district health boards for community health care.

Dr Mueller has taught at the University of Waikato for nearly 20 years and is an associate professor of entrepreneurship and strategy in Waikato Management School’s Centre for Corporate and Executive Education. He also consults with firms around the globe on matters of governance and performance.

Meshweyla Macdonald, executive director of Corporate and Executive Education, says: “Many of our presenters, like Jens, are pracademics, who are both academic experts and practicing executives. They facilitate classes that equip our executive students to make an immediate contribution to their company’s growth and development – and rise into leadership roles quickly."

"This Pharmac appointment demonstrates the capacity to be able to ‘do’ before they teach; and the result is a very high level of corporate engagement," says Mrs Macdonald.

Previously, Dr Mueller managed a $1 billion healthcare organisation in California, and spent more than 30 years as chair and CEO of global health and technology firms in Europe and North America. He was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2015.
