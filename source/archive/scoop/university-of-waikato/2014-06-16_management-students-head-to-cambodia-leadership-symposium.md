Management students head to Cambodia leadership symposium
=========================================================

**Press Release: [University of Waikato](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato)**

16 June 2014  
**Sights set for Cambodia**

Seven Waikato Management School students have been invited to attend the University Scholars Leadership Symposium in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in August. This annual event, hosted by Humanitarian Affairs (UK), is designed to provide the next generation of leaders with an understanding of key sustainable development challenges and the skills to overcome them.

The symposium will bring together 1000 of the world’s dynamic student activists in the field of sustainable development. It offers a unique opportunity to network with leaders from all over the world and learn the skills of social entrepreneurship.

Twenty-five Nathan Orr is one of the delegates attending the symposium.  
“This symposium brings together future leaders who are changing the world and I want to be one of those people,” he says.

Accompanying Nathan Orr are Megan Burton-Brown, Adelle Stead, Greg Johnston, Jamie Carson, Isabelle Atherton and Gina Milicich. Together, they are motivated and passionate about social change and the symposium will empower them to create events, conduct relief programmes and participate in global action.

Delegates can participate in the _Voice in Social Change_ challenge; a competition to turn social development proposals into a reality. The team has submitted a proposal that will help address the plight of poverty, not only in New Zealand, but around the world. The winning team will receive close mentorship for 12 months and a cash grant of up to USD5000 to launch their proposal.

The team are looking for support from the community to attend this event. Please contact Nathan at nathanorr@hotmail.com, if you are interested or able to help them through sponsorship. Direct donations can be made via www.givealittle.co.nz//cause/leadershipsymposium.
