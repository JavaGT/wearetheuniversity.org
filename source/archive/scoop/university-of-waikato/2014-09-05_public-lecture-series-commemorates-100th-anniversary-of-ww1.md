**Public lecture series to commemorate 100th anniversary of World War I**

The University of Waikato and the Tauranga Historical Society have organised a free public lecture series to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War. The eight-part series is called ‘Sons of Empire: New Zealand and World War One’ and will start on 17 September at the Bongard Centre in Tauranga.

The first lecture in the series will start with introductions by University of Waikato’s Professor of Law Alexander Gillespie, and Stefanie Smith, President of the Tauranga Historical Society.

They will be followed by the inaugural presentation by Dr Kirstine Moffat, Senior Lecturer at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, titled: The Monstrous Anger of the Guns: Poetry, Protest, and World War I.

The weekly presentations focus on delivering a unique New Zealand perspective of WWI, the voices of our soldiers from the battles and the trenches to their legacy of literature, the diaries, the images and the poetry.

The first lecture is on Wednesday 17 September, 6.30pm Tauranga Bongard Centre, Lecture Theatre 104, 200 Cameron Road, Tauranga.

Registration for these free lectures is essential. Please email nyree@waikato.ac.nz or phone 577 5376.
