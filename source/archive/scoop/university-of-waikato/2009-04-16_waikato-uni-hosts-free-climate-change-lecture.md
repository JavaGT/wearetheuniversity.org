Waikato Uni hosts free climate change lecture

  
An Australian professor who argues climate change is a natural phenomenon gives a free public lecture at the University of Waikato on April 30.

Bob Carter is a Research Professor at James Cook University (Queensland) and the University of Adelaide (South Australia). He says current public views about climate change are based upon 20 years of talking up dangerous global warming by a hugely powerful coalition of self-interested groups and agencies.

Prof Carter’s talk will look at Australian and New Zealand climate change policies and how the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has failed.

The palaeontologist, stratigrapher, marine geologist and environmental scientist holds degrees from the University of Otago and the University of Cambridge. He has worked at the University of Otago and James Cook University (Townsville), where he was Professor and Head of School of Earth Sciences between 1981 and 1999.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the university is hosting Prof Carter’s lecture because it believes in robust discussion. “We recognise there are strong views about climate change,” he says. “Sustainability is one of Waikato University’s distinctive factors, but we’re not afraid of generating robust debate through free public lectures such as this.”

The lecture follows the highly successful talk given by journalist and international commentator Gwynne Dyer in September, which attracted hundreds of people to Waikato University.

Prof Carter’s public lecture is at 6.30pm, Thursday April 30 at the university’s Wel Energy Trust Academy of Performing Arts.
