University of Waikato delivers substantial increase in research performance

University of Waikato has achieved a major improvement in research performance with the release of the Tertiary Education Commission's 2006 Performance-Based Research Fund Results.

The results, which independently evaluate the research performance of the country's tertiary education organisations, showed a 25% improvement in the University's aggregate quality score to 3.73. This compares an average growth in quality scores across all tertiary education organisations of 14%. \[Please refer to explanation of quality scores at the end of this release.\]

The University was ranked fifth out of 41 tertiary education organisations assessed by the rankings. This is the same ranking as achieved in the last, 2003, PBRF rankings. However, the gap between the top five ranked universities is now very small.

Significantly, the University of Waikato achieved number one ranking in ten subject areas, compared with five in 2003. Only Otago University (with 14) achieved first place in more subject areas.

The University increased its number of world class rated researchers (those rated 'A' under the PBRF system) by 32% and its high quality (or 'B' rated) researchers by 19%. Importantly, the number of 'R' rated researchers reduced by 50%.

Subject area firsts are:  
• Accounting and finance  
• Chemistry  
• Communications, journalism and media studies  
• Computer science, information technology, information sciences  
• Ecology, evolution and behaviour  
• Education  
• Management, human resources, industrial relations, international and other business  
• Molecular, cellular and whole organism biology  
• Music, literary arts and other arts  
• Pure and applied mathematics.

University of Waikato's School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences has been reconfirmed as the number one school in its area in the country as has Waikato Management School. Waikato also has the country's top combined School of Education (where a university has combined its former School of Education and the regional teachers' college).

Significant improvements were achieved in a range of other subject areas like English Language and Literature (up 85%); Ecology, Evolution and Behaviour (up 30%); Law (up 28%); Economics (up 37%) and Marketing and Tourism (up 84%); Philosophy (up 47%) and Anthropology and Archaeology (up 41%).

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford said the University was extremely pleased with the results.

"They validate the work of our academic staff and demonstrate to undergraduate and post-graduate students that the University of Waikato is now a top, research-led university on the international scene. Students who come here will be taught by some of the best staff in the world.

"This improvement has come about as a result of the serious focus the University has placed on lifting its research performance," he said.

"For this reason the rankings are particularly pleasing, but I would still expect to see a further advance on these quality evaluation levels in 2012 – we intend to keep improving."

Professor Crawford said all research and other university staff should be congratulated for supporting and growing research excellence.

"This is an across the board effort. We clearly have a large number of highly capable research staff and we recognise that their performance depends on the support of the whole university team."

Professor Crawford said the University was particularly pleased it achieved real quality improvements across a broad range of individual subject areas.

"This shows we have diversity in academic excellence which is the hallmark of any strong university."

On the basis of the PBRF results, the University will receive research funding for the 2007 year of $14.8 million.
