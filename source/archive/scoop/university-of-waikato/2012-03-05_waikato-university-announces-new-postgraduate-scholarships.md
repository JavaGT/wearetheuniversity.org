**Waikato University announces new postgraduate scholarships**

The University of Waikato has announced a new scholarship valued at up to $6,000 for students looking to undertake taught postgraduate study.

Faculty of Education Dean Professor Roger Moltzen announced the Taught Postgraduate Fees Scholarship at a recent scholarships event, saying it was designed to support postgraduate students who are currently wanting to take taught postgrad papers and who plan to head down a research path in the future.

The scholarship will target students studying taught 500 level papers and is available for domestic and international, full and part-time students. About $200,000 has been earmarked for these scholarships in 2012.

“The University of Waikato is committed to supporting and looking to increase postgraduate research,” Professor Moltzen told an audience gathered to celebrate another successful round of Summer Research Scholarships at the University of Waikato.

The university’s Pro Vice-Chancellor Postgraduate, Professor Kay Weaver, says postgraduate students are very important to the culture of a university, and are the nation’s future cutting-edge researchers and academics.

“At Waikato we are committed to providing students with further study opportunities and we encourage them to consider continuing on to our higher research degrees. This scholarship is designed to help students bridge between their undergraduate degree and our research degrees,” Professor Weaver says.

She says the new scholarship completes a suite of postgraduate scholarships available at Waikato. “It complements our existing masters and doctoral scholarships that are research-based. This new one-year scholarship is one of our most accessible scholarships – it is an option for full-time students, people working and studying part-time, or those students who are taking Honours.”

Students already enrolled for A Semester, which begins on March 5, can apply for Round One of the scholarships before March 19.

“Waikato University is already renowned for its excellent range of scholarships,” Professor Weaver says. “I strongly encourage people thinking of embarking upon taught postgraduate papers to consider this opportunity.
