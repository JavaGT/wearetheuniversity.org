Developing New Zealand norms to assess health outcomes

  
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term disability worldwide. Research findings in the past few years have suggested that rates of TBI in New Zealand are far higher than those found in other developed countries, which is a great concern.

University of Waikato masters student Samantha Williams is looking at developing a better understanding of the longer-term impact these injuries have on New Zealanders.

“Evidence from New Zealand has revealed that even following a so-called ‘mild’ injury, nearly half of those affected were experiencing persistent symptoms at one year. Yet, the length of time these difficulties continue following mild injuries remains unexplored,” says Samantha.

“It is important that we gain a more detailed understanding of how TBI impacts people throughout New Zealand, especially since they are so prevalent. The more we understand the effects of brain injuries, the more we can correctly identify them and target treatments to optimize recovery,” she says.

The effects of TBI have been widely discussed in the media, where cases of undiagnosed and untreated head injuries have had catastrophic effects. “In the news we have heard of young men who have experienced TBI, such as concussion, playing rugby and have experienced longer-term cognitive effects,” says Samantha.

While a lot of research has been done in the sports area, so far little information has explored the longer term effects of mild injuries in the general population. “To see how much brain injuries affect longer term health we need to compare those who have experienced a brain injury with those who haven’t. If New Zealanders are suffering so much from this form of injury, the least we can do is study and understand it better, and seek ways to support recovery and educate individuals about what TBI is,” she says.

To help with this research, Samantha is seeking adults who have been free of brain injury and concussion for at least 12 months and who would be willing to complete an online questionnaire about their health and well-being. The answers will remain anonymous and those completing the questionnaire will be eligible to enter a prize draw for a Prezzie card voucher.

If you have any questions about the research, please contact Samantha Williams at NormsforTBI.nz@gmail.com. If you wish to participate in the study, follow this link to the online survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NZnorms
