Latest subject rankings confirm University of Waikato’s rise in international standing

  
With the latest data release from QS World University Rankings the University of Waikato now has 13 disciplines ranked in the top 300 delivered around the world, confirming its growing international reputation.

  
Last year, the overall QS University rankings saw the University of Waikato claim its place among the top 300 universities in the world, out of more than 26,000 universities assessed.

  
University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says the new subject rankings further reinforce University of Waikato’s status as one of the top 1.1% of universities, as well as the continuing growth in excellence, research and teaching.

  
“Yet another outstanding result is an accolade for our academics, who are carrying out groundbreaking research. It also acknowledges our innovative approach to education, and the very high regard employers have for our graduates.”

  
QS rankings are based on a number of factors, including academic reputation, research citations and impact, and employer reputation. The scores cover survey responses from more than 170,000 academics and 158,000 employers worldwide. 1,130 institutions have been ranked across 48 subjects in five subject areas.

  
The University of Waikato is the first choice for more than 12,000 students each year. Its researchers are providing unique perspectives on issues of importance to contemporary society, and answers to some of the key problems being faced by industries, governments and nations around the world.
