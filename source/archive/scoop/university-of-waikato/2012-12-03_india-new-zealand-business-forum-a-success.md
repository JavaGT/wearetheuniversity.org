India-New Zealand business forum a success

More than 100 delegates from India and New Zealand, including business people, government officials and academics, gathered at the University of Waikato to discuss opportunities for the two nations to increase trade and business relations.

Waikato Management School held the inaugural event to encourage growth in business opportunities with India for the Waikato region. The forum’s convenor, Associate Professor Asad Mohsin, says he has received lots of encouraging feedback following the forum.

“We have had lots of interest shown for further forums next year, from other Waikato businesses as well as from India. The High Commissioner of India has also expressed a desire to return.”

Dr Mohsin says the forum achieved all of its objectives. “Overall it was a successful platform for these key people to come together and understand the challenges and the opportunities that exist in doing business in India.”

Despite discussions focusing mainly on the dairy/agribusiness, IT/communications and tourism sectors, Dr Mohsin says there is scope for so much more. “India is the second fastest growing market after China and has a burgeoning middle-class with growing disposable income. India has at least another 20-30 years of solid growth ahead of it.”

By 2015, it is estimated that India will have the capacity to consume more than 118 million tonnes of milk solids. “They will be looking for technical assistance in how to produce milk and its products more efficiently, so there is huge scope for our dairy sector to help.”

Education also has high potential, as India’s predominantly young population looks to up-skill. “In order to meet its higher education needs, India would need another 1000 institutions. This means they will look to well-established learning institutes like Waikato for assistance.”

The University is planning to continue the forum on an annual basis, with plans to be in Delhi next year, Hamilton in 2014 and in Mumbai in 2015.
