**Top University of Waikato honour for kaumātua**

A Tauranga kaumātua who has spent decades working for his people is to receive the University of Waikato’s highest honour.

Morehu Ngatoko Rahipere MNZM will receive an Honorary Doctorate in October from the University of Waikato for his contribution to the University over many years.

Mr Ngatoko Rahipere’s whakapapa extends to two of the principal tribes of the Tauranga Moana region, to Ngāti Ranginui, and Ngāi Te Rangi, and to Ngāti Awa also. His primary hapū affiliations are to Ngāi Tamarāwaho and Ngāti Rangi.

He is widely regarded as an acknowledged leader, an exponent of tribal lore and narratives, a man of mana and a formidable orator. He is a strong advocate of the long-standing relationship between Ngāti Ranginui and the Kīngitanga.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says Mr Ngatoko Rahipere is an example of someone who selflessly gives of his time and skills for the public good.

“He is passionate about the role and power of education to enable people to meet their aspirations and has led many initiatives linked to the University of Waikato, including the establishment of the Maharaia Winiata Research Institute in Tauranga,” Professor Quigley says.

“He was deeply involved in the Te Kotahitanga research programme established under our Faculty of Education and has led by example in many areas - what he has achieved is remarkable,” Professor Quigley says.

Mr Ngatoko Rahipere was instrumental in advancing the return of Mauao (Mount Maunganui) to the people and his expertise and knowledge in tikanga and kawa, has ensured the mountain is protected and its cultural integrity is maintained.

Mr Ngatoko Rahipere was the college kaumātua to Tauranga Boys’ College - progressing the building of a school marae; he supports Tauranga Girls’ College; was central to establishing the partnership between Western Bay of Plenty Primary Health Organisation and Ngāti Ranginui; supports the Māori Health Rūnanga; the Christian Education Trust and the Bethlehem Campus and is actively involved with the kaumātua forum of Tauranga City Council. In essence he has given exemplary service to his community of Tauranga Moana, Professor Quigley says.

Mr Ngatoko Rahipere will receive his Honorary Doctorate at the University of Waikato’s graduation ceremony at Claudelands Events Centre, Hamilton on the afternoon of Tuesday, 20 October.
