Waikato University will host a New Zealand leg of the world’s 48-hour Global Game Jam this January.

Game Jam brings computer enthusiasts together to create video and board games. It encourages experimentation and innovation - participants come together for 48 hours, form teams, and develop games around a theme that is announced at the start of the event.

Established and wannabe game developers are invited to join the New Zealand contingent at the University of Waikato on January 27-29.

Last year 6500 people in 44 countries around the world took part in the third Global Game Jam, building over 1500 games in just 48 hours.

Waikato University has places for up to 40 participants. Organiser and computer science senior lecturer Bill Rogers says the weekend aims to bring together programmers, designers and artists with a wide range of ages and experience levels. Anyone with an interest in building games is encouraged to join.

The major roles in game development are programming, artwork and animation production, but people can also plan, contribute music, work on storylines and test the games. Participants range from senior high school students to IT professionals and independent developers.

Mr Rogers says Waikato University is excited to be hosting the event in New Zealand. \"Waikato has the number one computer science department in the country and it's fitting that innovative gaming people do their creating for the international contest here."

The event culminates with all games being uploaded to the international Game Jam web after voting for a site favourite. Under the rules of Game Jam, team members retain the intellectual property, but the games will be available in the public domain. They will also be available for demonstration at conferences, lectures and in schools.
