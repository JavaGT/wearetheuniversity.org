**Sisters with Masters to graduate together**

Hamilton sisters and University of Waikato masters students Mel and Kim Modlik (Te Āti awa, Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Toa) are set to graduate side by side later this month.

Mel (28) is graduating with a Master of Social Science in Geography, and Kim (25) is graduating with a Master of Arts in English. From New Plymouth, the Modliks moved to Hamilton in 2003 so Mel and Kim could attend Church College of New Zealand. When it came time to begin their undergraduate study, the pair decided to stay in Hamilton.

“Our family and friend connections are really strong here and that was important to us, to be able to study where we had that support,” says Kim.

Kim has a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in Anthropology and English and Mel has a Bachelor of Social Sciences (Hons) in Tourism and Geography from Waikato University.

Mel says one of the things she enjoyed about her study was a trip to Queenstown for five days to research wedding tourism.

“I loved being part of such a close-knit group of students who all became friends. Another thing I loved was that the lecturers at Waikato were really approachable, and easy to talk to and get along with.”

During her honours and masters study, Kim has also tutored and given guest lectures, and is now finishing up a Graduate Diploma of Teaching.

“I enjoyed the teaching aspect of my masters, and this solidified my desire to carry on with my studies and do the teaching diploma.”

And they’ve had huge support from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.

“There’s such a whānau vibe in the English Department and this is one of the reasons I’ve stayed there so long,” says Kim.

Mel and Kim both received a $12,000 Masters Research Scholarship, and Mel was awarded the 2015 Masters Writing Award. She is now in the process of preparing her thesis for publication with her supervisor, Associate Professor Lynda Johnston.

The university’s marae graduation ceremony is from 9.30am at Te Kohinga Mārama Marae on campus on Monday 19 October.
