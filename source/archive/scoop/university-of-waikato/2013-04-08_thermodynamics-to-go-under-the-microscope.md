**Thermodynamics to go under the microscope**

For better or for worse, the story of life on Earth starts with thermodynamics.

It is the interplay of energy, information, evolution and life which is the topic for University of Waikato biologist Professor Vic Arcus’ free public lecture later this month.

During the lecture Professor Arcus will consider the quote from famous Oxford chemist Professor Peter Atkins who said of the second law of thermodynamics that "no other law of science has contributed more to the liberation of the human spirit”.

“I’ll discuss whether the second law of thermodynamics contributes to our spirit or indeed, contributes to life on Earth at all,” says Professor Arcus.

“Thermodynamics is primarily concerned with energy and all of life relies on energy - primarily from the sun. A second major component of life is information. In order to sustain life, we need to pass on information (in our genes) from one generation to the next.”

“Put simply, cells must harvest energy from their environment to live and they must store information in their genes to pass onto the next generation. Evolution then becomes the interplay between energy and information.”

In his career as a Structural Biology and Protein Engineering researcher, Professor Arcus has been involved in ground breaking tuberculosis research, bringing a billion year old bacteria back to life, investigating enzymes from the rumen of cows and much more.

Professor Arcus’ inaugural professorial lecture, Energy, Information, Evolution and Life, takes place on Tuesday 30 April in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts. The Opus Bar is open from 5pm; the lecture begins at 6pm.
