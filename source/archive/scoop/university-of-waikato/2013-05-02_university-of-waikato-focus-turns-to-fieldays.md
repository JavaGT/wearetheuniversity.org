University of Waikato Focus Turns to Fieldays

**University of Waikato Focus Turns to Fieldays**

With just a month to go before the Southern Hemisphere’s largest agricultural showpiece kicks off for the 45th time, the University of Waikato is welcoming the opportunity to once again show off its innovative and groundbreaking agricultural research at Fieldays.

From using microbes to remove excess nitrogen from land to transforming agricultural waste into a valuable commodity, University of Waikato researchers are at the leading edge of agricultural research, with many aspects of that research going on show at the National Agricultural Fieldays, which run at Mystery Creek from 12-15 June.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says it should come as no surprise to see the University of Waikato firmly committed to agricultural research and development.

“We are located in the heart of the most important agricultural region in the country,” he says.

“The University of Waikato has developed enduring partnerships and research collaborations with leading agricultural organisations. Our students undertake internships with these organisations and many go on to have very successful and rewarding careers with them.”

Among the organisations the University works closely with are Fonterra, AgResearch, GNS Science, Landcare Research, Dairy NZ, both the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regional councils and several government departments.

The University has always been a strong supporter of Fieldays, with its first Vice-Chancellor, Sir Don Llewellyn, among the instigators of the hugely successful agricultural expo. That support continues, with the University entering its seventh year as a Strategic Partner of Fieldays.

Prof Crawford says Fieldays gives the University the opportunity to connect with the rural community and showcase research relevant to the agricultural sector. A particular theme of the research at the University is sustainability of the agricultural sector. This covers all aspects of sustainability – scientific, economic, environmental – and the outcomes of the work are aimed at ensuring a strong future for the whole of New Zealand in this critically important sector.

“While much of this research could not have been done outside the laboratory, it has implications for the agricultural sector and we need to make sure we are communicating that to the people who can benefit from the outcomes of our work,” he says.

“Fieldays also gives us the opportunity to catch up with friends, colleagues and alumni from all over New Zealand and around the world, many who make a point of visiting the University stand.”

Prof Crawford says the two organisations – Fieldays and the University of Waikato – provide nearly $1 billion to the Waikato economy each year and play important roles in ensuring the region remains at the forefront of agricultural innovation, development and research.

The theme for this year’s Fieldays is “Getting Down to Business in the Global Economy” and Prof Crawford says it is a topical subject, with the University of Waikato recently signing agreements with key universities in China to enhance important international relationships.

He encourages Fieldays visitors to stop at the University stand and meet some of the researchers to discuss their latest findings.

“We will also have University ambassadors at Fieldays so look out for them and ask them about opportunities available during B Semester,” Prof Crawford says.
