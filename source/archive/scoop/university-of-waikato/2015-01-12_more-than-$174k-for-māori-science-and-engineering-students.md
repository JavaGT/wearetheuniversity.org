**More than $174K in scholarships for Māori science and engineering students**

In 2014, more than $174,000 in scholarships was awarded to Māori Science and Engineering students from the University of Waikato.

The awards, which ranged from $250 to $20,000, gave 17 students a financial boost towards their undergraduate, masters or PhD studies.

The scholarships came from a variety of supporters, including Waikato University, private trusts, iwi and leading New Zealand companies.

“I’m extremely proud to be associated with all of the students within the faculty. The fact that our future scientists and engineers are being recognised for their hard work is awesome. This just goes to show that determination and a clear direction can be academically and financially rewarding. As a result I know that the families are incredibly proud of the achievements of these students and look forward to even greater things in the future,” says Kevin Eastwood, Science & Engineering Māori Student Achievement Coordinator at the University of Waikato.

Master of Science (MSc) student Te Puea Dempsey (Ngati Maniapoto/ Ngapuhi/ Waikato) received two scholarships totalling $30,000, including a Rona and a Rena Research Scholarship. Te Puea is a former student of Melville High School. Caleb Sweeney (Otumoetai College, Ngati Awa/Ngai Te Rangi/Ngati Ranginui) was also the recipient of a $20,000 Rena Research Scholarship.

Multiple scholarships also went to MSc student Kate Mauriohooho (Hamilton Girls’ High School, Ngati Raukawa/Waikato/Ngati Maniapoto/Ngati Tuwharetoa) who received two scholarships, totalling $17,000 and Blaise Forrester-Gauntlet (Kelston Girls’ College, Ngati Ranginui/Ngai Te Rangi) who was awarded $17,700 from four scholarships.
