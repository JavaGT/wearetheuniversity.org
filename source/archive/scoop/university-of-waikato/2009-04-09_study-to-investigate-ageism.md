Study to investigate ageism

A team of researchers led by Professor Ted Zorn from the University of Waikato Management School has received a grant from the Foundation for Research Science and Technology to look at ageism in the community.

The $350,000 a year is for three years and the research will focus on older people's interactions with organisations and businesses and investigate how interactions are impacted or affected by ageism. It will also look at the negative effects of ageism might be counteracted.

The research includes an innovative methodology of training older people to be "co-researchers" - keeping journals of their experiences in a variety of roles, such as employees, customers, investors, and volunteers. In the last year of the project, older people and organisational representatives will come together to consider the initial findings and collaborate to create recommendations for counteracting ageism.

Professor Zorn previously led a five-year FRST-funded investigation into the impacts of information and communication technologies on workplaces and the communities. He is joined in this new project by colleagues from the Department of Management Communication, Mary Simpson and Margaret Richardson, Michael Cameron from Economics, Peggy Koopman-Boyden, Honorary Professor with the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and Juliana Mansvelt from Massey University.
