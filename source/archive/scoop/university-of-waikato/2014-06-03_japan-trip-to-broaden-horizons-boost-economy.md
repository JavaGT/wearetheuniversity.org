**Japan trip to broaden horizons, boost economy**

Three Honours students and a Teaching Fellow from the University of Waikato are among 10 young New Zealand multimedia specialists heading to Japan this month for a fully funded trip aimed at raising the profile and understanding of Japan among young people.

Students Kristy Wright, Stefan Dimitrof and Shawnee Kitson, along with Teaching Fellow Sean Castle, will spend 10 days in Japan from June 22 and visit businesses, government organisations and educational facilities as part of the JENESYS 2.0 programme, launched by the Japanese government last year.

Costs for the visit are covered by the Japanese government, which intends offering the programme to up to 30,000 young people from the Asia/Oceania region.

Among the programme’s objectives are promoting interest in Japan among high achievers in Asia/Pacific countries while raising awareness about Japanese values, promoting mutual understanding and friendship, strengthening diplomatic relations and revitalising the economy in selected areas of Japan.
