Elite BMX biker among Waikato University’s new Hillary Scholars

She’s been riding BMX since she was seven, competing internationally since she was eight, and has now won an elite scholarship to the University of Waikato.

Former New Plymouth Girls’ High student Victoria Hill is one of about 50 new Hillary Scholars at Waikato. The elite BMX rider -- one of only four women in New Zealand at this level -- has been ranked first in Oceania and fifth in the world for points under the sport’s governing body, UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale).

At Waikato Hill will be studying for a bachelor’s degree in sport and leisure, with a double major in psychology, while maintaining her training regime. “I plan to become a police officer, so I want a degree that will help me achieve that goal. That’s why I’ve chosen to major in psychology.”

But first, she has some BMX challenges ahead. “I’d like to get into the top sixteen at the World Championships in Adelaide in July,” she says. “Ultimately, I’m aiming for the 2012 Olympics.” BMX racing became an official medal sport at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

The Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme, offered since 2005, awards scholarships to academic high achievers who show significant leadership qualities and also excel in sport or in the creative and performing arts. The prestigious scholarships provide full university course fees while studying at Waikato, comprehensive support for the recipients’ academic, sporting and/or arts activities, and additional support in leadership and personal development.

Each Hillary Scholar is coached and mentored to help them to balance their sporting and performing arts activities with the demands of their academic programme. Sports players are provided with a personal coach and manager through the university’s partnership arrangements with individual sporting codes. Creative and performing arts scholars are mentored and tutored by experts in their fields.

Hill is also the recipient of a Prime Minister Athlete Scholarship for 2009.
