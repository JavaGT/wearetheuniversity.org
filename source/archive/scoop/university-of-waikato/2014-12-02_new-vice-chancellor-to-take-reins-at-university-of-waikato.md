**New Vice-Chancellor to take the reins at University of Waikato**

A new Vice-Chancellor has been appointed at the University of Waikato – Professor Neil Quigley will lead the organisation from February next year.

Professor Quigley replaces the current Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Crawford, who retires from the position at the end of this month having completed 10 years in the role. The University celebrated its 50th anniversary during 2014.

Professor Quigley is currently Provost at the Victoria University of Wellington. He takes up the role at the University of Waikato on 9 February 2015.

University of Waikato Chancellor Rt Hon Jim Bolger says Professor Quigley has a real passion and enthusiasm for his work. “He’s held many senior roles at Victoria University and comes to us with an impressive track-record of academic and strategic leadership, and ability to formulate and implement meaningful strategies to lift organisational performance.”

Mr Bolger says Professor Quigley is well-placed to continue to build on the University of Waikato’s strong foundations. “We intend our next 50 years to cement the University of Waikato as a force in the region, the tertiary sector and the nation. Professor Quigley understands all the challenges facing the higher education sector and he will be a vital part of our future.”

Professor Quigley has a BA and MA with first class honours from the University of Canterbury, and a PhD from the University of Toronto. He has a substantial publication record in monographs and international academic journals, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Economics in Vietnam.

He holds several board and expert advisory group memberships; in particular he is a Director of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and also a Director of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.

He’s looking forward to taking the reins at the University of Waikato, saying it’s an innovative institution that combines an international reputation with a strong commitment to serving the region. “I see even more potential for the University to develop its distinctive combination of partnership with iwi, commitment to an outstanding student experience, and excellence in teaching and research.”
