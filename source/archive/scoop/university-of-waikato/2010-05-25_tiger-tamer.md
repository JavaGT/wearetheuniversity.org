**Tiger tamer?**

There aren’t many Hamilton bouncers who’ve been up close and personal with a tiger, but University of Waikato student Toby FitzPatrick has done that and more during a year-long placement at Hamilton Zoo as part of his studies.

FitzPatrick is working part-time as a bouncer while he finishes off his Bachelor of Science (Technology) degree, and hopes to graduate later this year.

Waikato’s BSc(Tech) degree includes two compulsory work placements, organised by the Cooperative Education Unit in the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and Fitzpatrick was one of two biology students selected for the zoo placement.

As part of the placement, FitzPatrick spent several weeks observing and recording the pacing behaviour of the Zoo’s male Sumatran tiger Jaka for an animal behaviour project.

“The aim was to pinpoint what was causing Jaka to pace up and down,” says FitzPatrick, a former Spotswood College student from New Plymouth. “Pacing by animals in captivity, like any sort of stereotypic behaviour, is an indicator of stress. It shows that something isn’t quite right with the animal behaviourally, and it can be distressing for zoo visitors as well.”

A Waikato placement student’s study the previous year had found Jaka’s pacing behaviour was linked to expectations of being fed, so the routine had been changed to ensure feeding happened first thing in the morning. FitzPatrick followed up on this study to see if things had improved.

“What I found was that while waiting to be fed was the major cause of the pacing, Jaka was also pacing in anticipation of other interventions with the keeper, such as talks with the public and being shifted between enclosures. Basically, he’d learned the keeper’s routine.”

The solution, says FitzPatrick, is to try and mix things up a bit so it’s not such a set routine.

FitzPatrick says working at the zoo has been an awesome experience. As well as conducting the animal behaviour study, he got to work with small mammals and the savannah animals, such as giraffes and zebra. He was also able to give his family private tours – “I had them all lining up to feed the monkeys!”

He’s now hoping he can build on his experience and land a real zoo keeper’s job. “The hardest part is getting some experience, but thanks to the University of Waikato placement I’ve now got my foot in the door.”

The BSc(Tech) should give him the edge in the job market, he says. “I’ve always been interested in science and animals, but these days a bachelors degree isn’t enough. It’s all about getting work experience. With the Tech degree, the University hooks it all up for you and it’s a good way to get a few things on your CV by the time you graduate.”

The University’s Cooperative Education Unit organises more than 200 work placements each year for Waikato students studying for tech degrees in science and engineering. It’s developed excellent relationships with local and regional employers, many of whom go on to employ Waikato graduates.

Hamilton Zoo director Stephen Standley says the student placements benefit both sides. “We have had excellent students, several of whom have gone on to get employment in the industry. Their’ study topics are worked out with zoo staff, so that they have maximum value to us and the student, and we value the relationship with the university as research opportunities are an important part of our remit.”
