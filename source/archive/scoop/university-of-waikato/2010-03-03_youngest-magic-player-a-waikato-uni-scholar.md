Youngest Magic player a Waikato Uni Scholar

**Youngest Magic player among Waikato University’s new Hillary Scholars**  
  
At just over six foot tall, Amy Christophers towers over most of the other new students at the University of Waikato. But as the newest – and youngest -- member of the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic line-up she’s way down the line for height.

Christophers, who’s 18 and a former Otumoetai College student, is embarking on a Bachelor of Science (Tech) at Waikato, and aims to juggle university study with top-level netball with the support of a prestigious Hillary Scholarship.

The Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme, offered since 2005, awards scholarships to academic high achievers who show significant leadership qualities and also excel in sport or in the creative and performing arts. The scholarships provide full university course fees while studying at Waikato, comprehensive support for the recipients’ academic, sporting and/or arts activities, and additional support in leadership and personal development.

Christophers, who is one of about 50 new Hillary Scholars this year, says the scholarship is a huge help. “Not only on the finance side, but it offers me all kinds of extras for training, such as gym membership and a physical trainer. And the programme will help me keep on track with my studies and my sport.”

The Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme has recently signed a partnership relationship with Netball Bay of Plenty to match its existing partnership with Netball Waikato. Sheryl Dawson, CEO of Netball BOP and acting CEO of the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic franchise, says the new partnership means new opportunities for young netballers in the region. “We encourage young people in our sport in the Bay of Plenty to consider applying for a Hillary Scholarship at the University of Waikato.”

As well as advising on recruitment and selection, Netball BOP works with the Hillary Programme to provide the right support and challenges so that the Hillary Scholars can perform at their best. “I coached Amy as a schoolgirl, and she’s now got a strong team of mentors around her,” says Dawson.

Another member of the Magic team, Laura Langman, is also currently a Hillary Scholar at Waikato.

Christophers knows it’ll be tough going for the next few years. “It was a massive step to get into Magic, but playing netball at this level means I miss out on a lot of social life. That’ll be weird at uni – everyone else will be going out and I’ll be in my room asleep.”
