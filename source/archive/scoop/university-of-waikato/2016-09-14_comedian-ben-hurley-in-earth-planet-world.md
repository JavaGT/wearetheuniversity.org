**Comedian Ben Hurley takes us around the world in 60 minutes finding humour in every single country on the planet!**

The Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts at the University of Waikato is delighted to announce that comedian Ben Hurley will be in Hamilton on Saturday 15th October with his show – **Earth, Planet World.**

Since South Sudan became an independent state in 2011, there are 195 sovereign states on this Earth Planet World, and Ben will touch on each one of them in just 60 minutes. From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, they all have their quirks, and Ben is perfectly placed to show us how funny they all are. You can expect a fast-paced ride; think more bullet train than Auckland traffic, and things will ramp up as we begin the countdown.

Having performed comedy for over 15 years, this show is the biggest challenge Ben has set himself to date. Unlike most shows, which grow out of material that is tried and tested on audiences throughout the year, this show has to be written specifically around this very specific theme.

There may be some disputed countries in this earth planet world, but there’s nothing to dispute about the fact that Ben is the perfect comic to bring this show to its full potential.

Of course, there’s the usual spiel about how we all know him from the TV (he’s been on it lots), his years of experience and, of course, all of those awards. We don’t like to brag or mess about so just note the important ones, 7 Days, The FRED Award and the Billy T Award.
