Floral Notes premieres at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts

Actress and playwright Geraldine Brophy’s new play Floral Notes is premiering in Hamilton next week. It’s a play about two penpals whose lives are enriched when their childhood friendship is rekindled.

Floral Notes is Brophy’s eleventh produced work along and includes music from a song book adapted by Jane Keller, and both women are starring in the two-person show.

The play follows the lives of two women, Iris and Rosemary, who were pen pals as young girls but lost touch years ago. Iris now lives in New York with a peculiar family and leads a busy urban life. Rosemary owns a large lifestyle property, living off the land in small town New Zealand. Through a twist of fate they re-kindle their friendship and Rosemary offers to help Iris transform her New York apartment rooftop into a garden paradise – via email.

It’s Geraldine Brophy’s first foray into the musical genre. Jane Keller has sourced the music which features songs by some of the great 20th century composers.

Floral Notes is directed by Emma Kinane, and the accompaniment will be by pianist Michael Nicholas Williams. “It’s a fabulous play,” says Ms Kinane. “It’s a warm and touching story about new friendships and new beginnings.”  
The production is being presented by the Central North Island Arts Consortium, supported by funding from Creative New Zealand.

It takes place on 6 October at 7.30pm at the Playhouse Theatre in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts at the University of Waikato  
Tickets can be purchases at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts or at Ticketek outlets. Adults tickets $35.
