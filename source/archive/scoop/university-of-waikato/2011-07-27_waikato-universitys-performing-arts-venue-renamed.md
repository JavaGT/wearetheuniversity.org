The Academy of Performing Arts at the University of Waikato will be known as the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts for at least the next 10 years.

  
Last night at the Academy, supporters of Waikato’s top performing arts space gathered to celebrate 10 years since the Academy opened and to welcome on board new principal sponsor Gallagher.

  
People who had supported the Academy when it was still on the drawing board were among the guests at last night’s function, including donors Hamilton City Council, DV Bryant Trust, Trust Waikato and Calder and Lawson. They were joined by other guests including MPs, former Hamilton Mayor Margaret Evans and members of the Waikato arts community.

  
The Gallaghers were in at the beginning too and have now pledged support for another decade through a $2.5 million gift to the University of Waikato, from the Gallagher Group and Dr John and Glenice Gallagher. The money has been earmarked to establish an endowment fund at the university. In recognition of their generosity, the Academy will bear the Gallagher name for the next 10 years and the concert chamber has been renamed in honour of Dr John Gallagher.

The Gallagher brothers, Sir William and John, have honorary doctorates from the University of Waikato acknowledging their work in industry, their contribution to the Waikato region and an association with the university that has lasted more than 20 years.

  
Dr John Gallagher has served on the University Council since 1990, been Pro-Chancellor and Chancellor, has been a chairman of the Waikato University Foundation and is now Patron. He has contributed significantly in time and money to the development of the Don Llewellyn Sports Pavilion and the Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship programme.

  
Sir William Gallagher serves on the Board of WaikatoLink, the University’s commercialisation arm, and has made many significant donations to support projects on campus. He says it’s always satisfying that the success of the Gallagher Group enables his organisation to contribute at a high level, and this new partnership should be beneficial not just to the University, but the wider community too, who make good use of the Academy throughout the year.

  
Director of Development at the University of Waikato Christine Brabender says she hopes the generosity and long term support shown by the Gallaghers will encourage others to be supportive of Waikato University.

  
“This university is always evolving as it strives to deliver a world-class education to students who in turn can be world-class in their chosen careers. Support for scholarships, superior facilities, research activities and the endowment fund really do help our students achieve their full potential. I hope our alumni and friends here in New Zealand and overseas will be inspired by what the Gallaghers have done and consider how they too can contribute to Waikato.”
