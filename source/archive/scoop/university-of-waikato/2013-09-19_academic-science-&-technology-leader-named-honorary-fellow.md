**Academic leader in science and technology named Honorary Fellow**

The University of Waikato has awarded the title of Honorary Fellow to Associate Professor Alan Langdon, a leader in the development of the University’s science and technology programmes and a pioneer in forging links between academic research and local and regional industry.

Director of the Centre for Technology from 1991 to 1997, Dr Langdon provided the academic leadership that saw the Centre become a highly efficient teaching and research unit within the School of Science and Technology.

He played a major role in developing the University of Waikato’s BSc (Technology) and MSc (Technology) programmes and negotiated with employers to set up placements to provide appropriate thesis research topics. An important aspect of this work was establishing effective supervisory panels to manage the University’s involvement in commercially-driven research conducted off-campus.

His development of the MSc (Technology) also meant highly qualified technical staff had a pathway to higher studies. He was instrumental in creating shared appointments for staff with the country’s Crown Research Institutes such as LandCare and with private research institutes such as the then Meat Industry Research Institute of New Zealand.

Dr Langdon became a key figure and pioneer in collaborative teaching and research supervision before this was common practice. During his career he supervised 80 masters and doctoral students, many funded by scholarships and research grants he obtained.

A strong advocate for the University of Waikato in a career spanning 40 years, he was also an outstanding supporter of patenting research findings generated within the university, the most recent being the development of new methods for treating water with high iron contact which saw him become the “poster boy” for student recruitment to the university’s science and technology programmes.

He has also held key administrative roles including Pro-Dean of the School of Science, Director of the Centre for Technology and Chairperson of the Faculty’s Radiation Safety Committee. He was a member of the Faculty Board of Studies, the Audit committee, the Water Research Unit, the Academic Board and the University Council.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the award of Honorary Fellow recognises Dr Langdon’s outstanding career and achievements.

“Dr Langdon has been an invaluable academic leader and advocate for this University and it is with great pleasure I award him the title of Honorary Fellow,” Professor Crawford says. The title was awarded at a function on 18 September.
