Baxter, Hone Tuwhare, R.A.K.Mason, Denis Glover and Charles Brasch. Like Frank Sargeson, Murray grew up in Hamilton. His formative literary experiences come from their shared roots.

His latest volume of poems is _Shaggy Magpie Songs_ (2015) from Auckland University Press. Murray has also been active in experimental and innovative theatre companies (The Living Theatre Troupe, Half Moon Theatre in London, Theatre Action, Town and Country Players and Indian Ink Theatre Company) and for over 25 years taught theatre and drama at the University of Auckland. He works as the dramaturge for Indian Ink Theatre Company, whose latest play, _Kiss the Fish_, was awarded Best New Play of 2014 in the Chapman Tripp Awards.
