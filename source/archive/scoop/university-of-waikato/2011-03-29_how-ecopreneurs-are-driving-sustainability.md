How ‘ecopreneurs’ are driving sustainability

Traditionally, passionate people who wanted to make the world a better place would start a charity or found a non-profit group to sell the idea of change. Today, a growing group of people are using a new business model to sell products that change the world while making a profit.

The motivations driving ‘ecopreneurs’, as they’ve been called, is one of the topics under discussion at the Sustainable Business Network forum being held in Auckland tomorrow \[Wednesday March 30\].

Associate Professor Eva Collins of the University of Waikato Management School and Chris Morrison, founder of All Good Organics and Phoenix Organics, are co-presenting a ‘how-to’ session for businesses interested in a sustainable business model.

Dr Collins says these business leaders are not interested in simply clipping a few social and environmental initiatives on to the same profit-driven model.

“These people are values driven. Economics is important, but it’s not the most important consideration. They see their businesses as a way to achieve social or environmental change.”

Dr Collins has researched sustainable enterprises and the uptake of sustainable practices by more than 700 New Zealand businesses.

Dr Collins says ecopreneurs provide a counter argument to people who only see business as contributing to social and economic problems.

“Ecopreneurs use commerce to change the world, and are driven by community values,” she says. New Zealand examples include Auckland-based green funeral company State of Grace, eco-friendly bottled water supplier Good Water and Kapai salad bars.

“All these firms have built their businesses by redefining their product and adding to the social fabric.”

She acknowledges this approach requires a completely different mindset. “You can’t tack sustainability on to the traditional take, make and waste business model,” she says.

Dr Collins has some tips for would-be ecopreneurs. “There’s a margin for sustainability features, but it’s a small one, so you must be creative. Typically, ecopreneurs start out by developing a niche market with loyal customers willing to pay more for sustainability features.”

Dr Collins says sustainability can’t be an excuse for lack of financial performance.

“If you want to use your business to change the world, then the first rule is that you must stay in business.”

Her conclusion?

“Ecopreneurs know we can’t follow the same models and expect to find better solutions. They are the necessary critical change agents using the power of commerce to create a sustainable future.”
