Hamilton businessmen Michael Crawford, Pat Peoples and Mark Donovan have been appointed as trustees to the University of Waikato Foundation.

Mark Donovan is the CEO-Market for Donovan’s Chocolates and also a Waikato University alumni, having completed a two-year post graduate diploma in management studies at the Waikato Management School in 1998.

The University of Waikato Foundation - Te Pou Taunaki is an independent charitable trust, formed to support and fund the University of Waikato to help it take new New Zealand ideas to the world.

The foundation raises funds to support the strategic objectives of the university, and has recently accepted $1 million donations from ULeisure Limited and the Waikato Student Union for the university’s new $30 million Student Centre. During its last campaign the foundation raised $11 million for the Academy of Performing Arts, UniRec Centre, student scholarships and other projects.

Mr Donovan, Mr Peoples and Mr Crawford will be on the foundation board for up to three years as co-opted trustees. They join the university’s Chancellor, the Rt Hon Jim Bolger; the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Crawford; fellow Hamilton businesspeople Terry Booth, Alastair Calder, Sharon Taylor and Ken Williamson; and Tauranga businesspeople Adrienne von Tunzelmann and John Revington. The board is chaired by Hamilton businessman John Gallagher.
