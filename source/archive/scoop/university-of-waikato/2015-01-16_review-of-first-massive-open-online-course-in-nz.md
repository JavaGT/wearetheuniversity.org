**Emeritus Prof Witten reviews first Massive Open Online Course in New Zealand**

  
Will Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) change the face of tertiary education in the future and what can Digital Cities, locally focussed online networks, mean for the local economy? These are just two of the subjects to be discussed later this month as part of the University of Waikato’s Treasuring the Bay symposium in Tauranga on Friday 23 January.

Emeritus Professor Ian Witten of the Department of Computer Science, University of Waikato will review New Zealand’s first MOOC launched by the Waikato University. With this MOOC the University is making expert knowledge of researchers and teaching staff available in a structured online environment. Professor Witten will describe the MOOC from conception to implementation, including the rewards for the university.

International guest speaker Barry Lerner is the Chief Information Officer of Huawei Technologies, South Pacific. He will discuss the importance of Digital Cities for the local economy. Mr Lerner is a recognised world expert in Digital Cities and has more than 30 years experience in the telecommunications industry.

Other presenters at the symposium will include Professor Chad Hewitt who is the Head of the School of Science in the Faculty of Science and Engineering. His research portfolio revolves around the role humans play in changing the natural world, particularly in marine systems, and how natural science can influence management and policy. He is recognised as a global expert on marine biological invasions and biosecurity governance at national and international levels.

Professor Chris Battershill will discuss the opportunity for marine pharmaceutical research in the Bay of Plenty. There will also be short updates on subjects that were presented at the 2014 symposium such as coastal research, mobilising youth volunteers and Sustainable Backyards.

Organiser Dr Nigel Calder, Partnership and Liaison Manager at the University in Tauranga, says the Treasuring the Bay symposium is an opportunity for the community to engage with experts about coastal research and economic developments taking place in the Bay of Plenty as well as looking at the issues we face.

The symposium is free and the public is welcome to attend. It will be held from 9.00am-3.00pm, Friday 23 January at the Tauranga Yacht and Power Boat Club, 90 Keith Allen Drive, Sulphur Point, Tauranga.
