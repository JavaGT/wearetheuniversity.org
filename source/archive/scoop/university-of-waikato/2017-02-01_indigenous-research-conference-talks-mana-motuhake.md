“We are honoured to have amazing speakers that work with their communiities, challenging colonial and state oppression,” says Dr Pihama.

“We have cutting-edge scholars, activisits and researchers coming together to strategise how we can work across our Indigenous Nations for the wellbeing of our people and the earth.”

Several hundred people are expected to attend the conference with visitors from Australia, Hawaii Canada and America mixing with academics, researchers, students and community representatives from around New Zealand.

_The Conference theme, ‘Mana Motuhake:_ Indigenous Sovereignty’ recognises that around the world Indigenous Nations are engaged in movements that are focused upon the affirmation of peoples as tangata whenua, the people of the land.

“Taking space as Indigenous People to come together and share our work related to Mana Motuhake gives us the opportunity to look at critical concepts such of autonomy, self-determination, independence sovereignty and having authority over our own lives,” says Dr Pihama.
