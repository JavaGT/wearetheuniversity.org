**Psychology Professor recognised for outstanding contributions**

Professor Michael O’Driscoll from the School of Psychology at Waikato University has been recognised for his sustained outstanding contribution in the field of industrial-organisational psychology and the excellence of his body of academic research.

He was recently awarded the prestigious Jamieson Award from the New Zealand Psychological Society (NZPsS), an award that was established in 2006 and is only offered every four years to outstanding contributions to the field of industrial and organisational psychology.

Professor O’Driscoll says he is privileged to have received this recognition for contributions to his field.

“Much of my research work has been conducted in collaboration with research colleagues, both in New Zealand and internationally, and it has been a wonderful experience working with these colleagues, sharing our knowledge and expertise. “

Professor O’Driscoll is a leading New Zealand international and figure in industrial-organisational psychology. He came to New Zealand with a PhD from Flinders University in 1981, after a short period at the University of Papua New Guinea. On arrival he initiated the teaching of industrial organisational psychology at Waikato, and his efforts culminated in the establishment of a graduate-level programme that was inaugurated in 2003.

At the same time he established and developed a broad-based research programme focusing on stress management and work-life balance, which has achieved world-wide recognition for excellence and awareness of social responsibility.

“These experiences have had a marked effect on my own learning and skill development. I am also very grateful to the university and my colleagues in Psychology, for the support and encouragement which I have received during my time at Waikato,” says Professor O’Driscoll.

As an illustration of his commitment to investigate important social issues relating to work in this country, in the past 12 months he has published some nine papers on aspects of family life and work, and on the issue of work-place bullying.

He will be presented with his award at the NZPsS conference dinner which takes place at 7.30pm at Trailways Restaurant in Nelson Sunday 31 August 2014.
