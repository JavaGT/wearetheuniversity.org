**Public lecture on Native American research given at Waikato University**

Waikato University’s Te Kotahi Research Institute (TKRI), in conjunction with the Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori office, are hosting two highly regarded Native American scholars who are giving a public lecture this month.

Professor Karina Walters and Associate Professor Gregory Cajete will present in their speciality areas including historical trauma, traditional knowledge and wellbeing.

Both scholars are being brought to New Zealand by Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga, a Centre of Research Excellence funded by the Tertiary Education Commission, to be a part of their international review board. They will both be hosted by Waikato-Tainui College for Research and Development before their public lecture on campus.

Professor Karina Walters, who is an enrolled member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, founded and directs the university-wide, interdisciplinary Indigenous Wellness Research Institute at the University of Washington.

She is a recipient of the Fulbright Award, and her research focuses on historical, social and cultural determinants of physical and mental health among American Indians and Alaska Natives.

Associate Professor Gregory Cajete, a Tewa Indian from Santa Clara Pueblo New Mexico, is the author of five books on Native American education, history and philosophy.

He is the director of Native American Studies and Associate Professor in the Division of Language, Literacy and Socio-Cultural Studies in the College of Education at the University of New Mexico.

The public lecture will run from 10am to 12.30pm on Friday, 15 November at S block room 1.02. To register, email marley@waikato.ac.nz
