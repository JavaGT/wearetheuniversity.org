**Kiwis to face-off against the Brits the Aussies in Gallagher Great Race**

Cambridge and Sydney Universities have been selected to compete against The University of Waikato in the Gallagher Great Race this year.

Returning for the seventh time is Cambridge University, who are looking to take their fourth win in what is one of Hamilton’s most anticipated events. Also competing is Waikato University and last year’s winners Sydney University.

Last year, Waikato University took on Sydney and Queensland Universities in the men’s race, with Sydney taking the lead over Waikato University and winning the event having competed for the first time.

In the women’s event, Sydney and Melbourne Universities will take on Waikato University for the Bryan Gould Cup. Last year, the Waikato University women’s crew took a convincing lead over their Australian counterparts and are planning to keep the coveted Bryan Gould Cup on home-ground.

Secondary schools from around the country will also take to the waters in the Head of the Waikato challenge, a pre-event to the Gallagher Great Race.

Competing in the boy’s division are Hamilton Boys’ High School, Napier Boy’s High School, St Bede’s College, St John’s College, St Paul’s Collegiate and Tauranga Boys’ High School.

Competing in the girl’s division are Craighead Diocesan School, Hillcrest High School, Sacred Heart Girls’ College, St Peter’s Cambridge, Waikato Diocesan and Westlake Girls’ High School.

The Gallagher Great Race will take place on 8 September on the Waikato River, starting at Ann Street and finishing at the Ferry Bank on Grantham Street.
