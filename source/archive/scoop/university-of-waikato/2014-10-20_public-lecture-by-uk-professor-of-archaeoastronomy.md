**Public Lecture by UK Professor of Archaeoastronomy on Next Friday**

Public lecture by Emeritus Professor of Archaeoastronomy, Clive Ruggles, from the University of Leicester in the UK on next Friday (31 October).

**_Of Calendars and Kings: gods, temples, the Pleiades, and the development of archaic states in Hawai’i_**

In the Hawaiian Islands, unlike other parts of ancient Polynesia, chiefdoms became transformed into archaic states during the centuries between the end of long-distance voyaging and European contact. Archaeoastronomy, the study of beliefs and practices relating to the sky, has recently become relevant to studies of the social, political and ideological factors that contrived to bring this about.

Clive will describe his fieldwork with archaeologist Patrick V. Kirch studying the orientations of temple platforms and their connections with astronomy, the calendar, dry-land agriculture and the emergence of “god-king” cults.

**DATE:** Friday 31 October  
**TIME:** Lecture begins 5:00pm  
**VENUE:** S.G.01 (S Block, University of Waikato)  
**PARKING:** Gate 1, off Knighton Road, Hamilton
