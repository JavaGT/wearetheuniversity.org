What is Adventure?

  
A book just published is set to challenge ideas about adventure.

Adventurous Learning: A Pedagogy for a Changing World by Waikato University Senior Lecturer Dr Mike Brown and Dr Simon Beames from the University of Edinburgh challenges traditionally held views of what “adventurous” means in learning.

The book is aimed at outdoor educators, tertiary students in outdoor recreation and teachers in training.

“Our aim is to talk about adventure in education really broadly. We’ve suggested four main aspects of adventure: authenticity, agency, uncertainty and mastery,” says Dr Brown. “We wanted to look at these concepts rather than focussing on activities such as kayaking or canyoning, as we see the four qualities as being inherent in any adventure.”

Dr Brown says if an activity is physically risky, it needs to be managed closely, and this close management can actually remove any sense of adventure.

“A series of novel activities, might be fun – but they don’t allow students to develop mastery and take responsibility for their learning. Surely this is what parents and teachers want?

“For example during a high ropes course, students don’t have much agency (choice) in this activity as an instructor is telling them what to do every step of the way. The student becomes like a remote-controlled puppet and can’t do anything particularly creative because of safety concerns. So the paradox is that what is called “adventure education” doesn’t contain much adventure at all.”

The book investigates notions of “adventure” and explores how the four dimensions of adventurous learning - authenticity, agency, uncertainty and mastery - can be incorporated into educational practices. Educators are encouraged to adapt and tailor these guidelines for indoor and outdoor teaching.

“We wanted to move away from thinking that adventure equals physical risk-taking. Unfortunately in New Zealand we’ve had two multiple-fatality incidents in the last eight years. If we want learners who are creative and can cope in a changing world, then we need to alter how we teach,” says Dr Brown

Both authors come from practitioner backgrounds and believe in the value of adventure in learning, but are concerned that much of what is sold as adventure in education is actually counter-productive.

The book follows on from Dr Brown’s Pedagogy of Place, which he co-authored with Brian Wattchow in 2011.
