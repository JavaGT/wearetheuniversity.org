**Environmental Research Institute signs Biodiversity Accord**

  
The University of Waikato’s Environmental Research Institute (ERI) joined 19 of New Zealand’s environmental leaders in New Plymouth last week to sign an historic accord.

The Taranaki Biodiversity Forum Accord is a regional response to protecting native plants, animals and habitats.

“The accord presents a great opportunity for the ERI to work with like-minded groups to deliver better biodiversity outcomes for the region,” says Environmental Research Institute Director, and Dean of the University of Waikato’s Faculty of Science & Engineering, Professor Bruce Clarkson.

The signing was witnessed by Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson who said she would be heralding the initiative to other groups around the country.

"This is an Accord that's by, for and between the people who are doing the work on the ground to protect and enhance indigenous biodiversity in the region," says the Taranaki Regional Council Chairman, David MacLeod.

"It's a tremendous achievement for Taranaki and will lead to greater enhancement and protection of the region's native flora and fauna."

Signatories included the Department of Conservation, Forest and Bird, Tiaki Te Mauri O Parininihi Trust, Ngā Motu Marine Reserve Society, the Taranaki Kiwi Trust, and regional and district councils. Waikato University’s Environmental Research Institute was the only research provider to sign the accord.

Professor Bruce Clarkson was accompanied at the signing by ERI staff and former Waikato University students, Catherine Bryan, Toni Cornes and Jackson Efford.
