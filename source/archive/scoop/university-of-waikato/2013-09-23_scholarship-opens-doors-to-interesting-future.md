**Scholarship opens doors to interesting future**

  
He used to work valeting cars. Then he held down a job at The Warehouse. Now Elye Parata has a law degree and is off to Saudi Arabia on a five-year scholarship from King Saud University.

The University of Waikato student graduated in April this year with a Bachelor of Laws, majoring in law and political science specialising in international relations and security studies.

“I’m really grateful to have this scholarship. It is a blessing from God for me,” says the 25-year-old Mormon. “I’m not an A student, I just study hard, and do my best. “

Elye is also grateful to the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission, which has done “99% of the co-ordinating of this for me”. “Their hard work really helped.”

While at King Saud University, Elye will spend two years learning Arabic followed by three years studying for a Bachelor of Arts in Hebrew and French.

As a young fellow, Elye studied texts from many religions and dreamed of one day going to the Middle East. With this scholarship and help from many staff at the University, this dream is about to come true.

The King Saud University scholarship will cover flights, fees, living costs, text books and also a flight home once a year for the duration of the scholarship.

Elye, whose iwi is Ngati Toarangitira, has lived in Hamilton most of his life, went to Church College and chose to study at Waikato because it was near his spiritual home, the Latter Day Saints Temple at Temple View.

He has started a masters degree but will put that on hold while he is in Saudi Arabia. Once he has finished studying in the Middle East, Elye, who has a very clear vision for his future, plans to sign up for military service, probably in the United States.

“In 2007 I set off on my two-year mission with the church to San Diego, which has US Navy bases nearby. I was impressed by the way US military personnel served and were respected in the community.

“I come from a military family. I’ve always wanted to serve in the military. We have to protect our liberty and freedom.”

Following that, Elye plans to complete his masters and a PhD then return to work overseas. With Arabic, Hebrew, law and international relations qualifications and experience, a job resolving conflict back in the Middle East is another dream for this inspired young man.
