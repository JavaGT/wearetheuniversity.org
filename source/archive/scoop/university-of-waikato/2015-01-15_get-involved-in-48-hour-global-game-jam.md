Get involved in 48-hour Global Game Jam

**Get involved in 48-hour Global Game Jam**

“Come and take part” is the message from Computer Science senior lecturer Bill Rogers, the organiser of the Hamilton Global Game Jam (GGJ).

The University of Waikato’s Computer Science Department is hosting a site for the world’s largest game creation event, Global Game Jam - GGJ 2015, from 23-25 January.

In a game jam, participants come together to create video and board games over a 48-hour period working in teams. The GGJ encourages experimentation and innovation, and takes place in the same 48-hour period all over the world. This year organisers expect more than 25,000 people worldwide to take part. The New Zealand game jams run from 5pm Friday, 23 January until the evening of Sunday, 25 January.

“Come and take part because it’s fun,” says Mr Rogers. “It’s a great experience working towards a common goal with a deadline and with people who have similar interests.”

Anyone can take part in a game jam: experienced professionals, senior high school students and game-creator wannabes. Teams will be formed at each of the local jams.

The University will make computer labs and work (and crash) space available, but participants are welcome to bring their own laptops. The University computer labs provide Windows 7, Visual Studio 2010, XNA Studio 4, Game Maker and Blender.

The rules of GGJ preclude participants from using pre-made content (including program code, audio, graphics, models etc) unless it was publicly available at least a month prior to the GGJ.
