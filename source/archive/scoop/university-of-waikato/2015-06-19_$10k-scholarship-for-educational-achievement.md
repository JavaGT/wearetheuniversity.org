**$10k scholarship for higher levels of educational achievement amongst Māori**  
  
University of Waikato science technology student Ashleigh Weatherwall has been awarded a $10000 Whānui Scholarship for Agriculture from Te Pūtea Whakatupu Trust.

The scholarship is intended to encourage and support Māori to be leaders in the Agribusiness Sector with the aim of achieving higher levels of educational achievement amongst Māori; and higher levels of workforce participation by Māori in key sectors of the economy.

It is envisaged that the recipients of this scholarship will be committed to the future economic and social development of Māori, iwi, hapū and whānau.

“It’s fantastic to see so many of our Māori students being recognised for their achievements. These scholarships have opened doors to some great opportunities and we’re working hard to encourage even more students to apply for the awards available,” says Kevin Eastwood, Science & Engineering Māori Student Achievement Coordinator at the University of Waikato.

Ashleigh is currently completing Bachelor of Science (Technology) (BSc(Tech)) majoring in Animal Behaviour and Biological Sciences at Waikato University and plans to do her Master’s at Waikato in the near future.

In 2014, more than $174,000 in scholarships was awarded to Māori Science and Engineering students from the University of Waikato.

The University of Waikato offer a number of scholarships at all degree levels. Current listings can be found online at http://www.waikato.ac.nz/research/scholarships/
