Cleaning begins on University of Waikato campus Lake

**Cleaning begins on University of Waikato campus Lake**

The University of Waikato has begun the clean-up of one of its lakes and creating a wetland area on campus.

The University of Waikato’s lakes are a central point on the university campus and enjoyed by students, staff, visitors, and the university’s neighbours.

However, the shallow lakes have silted up in the past 40 years.

University of Waikato sustainability coordinator Rachael Goddard and freshwater scientist Professor David Hamilton are spearheading the project to remove silt from Oranga Lake (the main lake by the shops) and use it to create a wetland area by the university fields.

“The university is renowned for our beautiful campus, and the lakes are an integral part of that,” says Ms Goddard. “The community surrounding the university enjoy them as much as our visitors and students and it is important that we maintain and look after them.

“Over the last 40 years Oranga Lake has slowly silted up and requires sediment removal and additional planting. On top of making the campus more attractive, this gives us the opportunity to create a small wetland area by the university field which will increase biodiversity on campus, and can be used as an educational tool.”

The work will take place from 14 January to 5 February 2013, during the hours of 7.30am- 5pm.

During this time, if windy, it is possible that a slight smell may emanate from the site, but it is harmless. There may also be noise from pumps operating.

Neighbours have been alerted to the work.
