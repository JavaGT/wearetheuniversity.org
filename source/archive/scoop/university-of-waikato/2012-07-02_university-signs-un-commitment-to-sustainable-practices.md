2 July 2012**  
University of Waikato signs UN commitment to sustainable practices**  
The University of Waikato has signed the United Nations Commitment to Sustainable Practices of Higher Education. The declaration, to which more than 200 universities around the world have pledged, was formally ratified this month at the UN Rio + 20 Conference on Sustainable Development.

The commitment pledges the University of Waikato to further incorporate sustainability into its teaching, research, operations and community outreach.

“We are already committed to a number of environmental sustainability initiatives,” says Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford. “So it seemed a natural step to commit to the UN declaration. I think universities have a key role to play in the pursuit of sustainability.”

The University conducts regular audits on carbon emissions, waste production, travel and energy use. “We have a travel plan, environmental policy and a five-star green rated Student Centre. In addition we are exploring a number of initiatives that we’ll refine and implement over the next three years.”

In the longer term, the University is considering possibilities for collaboration with local and regional councils on organic waste minimisation in the region and opportunities with businesses and city leaders for campaigns and strategies that promote sustainability.

The UN declaration was launched in conjunction with the Secretariat of the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) and the Global Compact Office, in partnership with the Rio+20 Forum.

The University of Waikato Management School is already a partner of PRME and will be hosting their 2013 conference.

“The Management and Science & Engineering Faculties have led the way in our sustainability initiatives and we are working at ways to implement aspects of sustainability into more of our courses” says Professor Crawford. “We are also engaging in research to advance sustainability.”

Professor Crawford says the international connections made through signing the declaration will benefit all the signatories. “There will be opportunities to exchange knowledge and experiences which can then be passed on to students, business and the wider community.”
