**Waikato University partners with Equidays**

The University of Waikato is once again a major partner of Equidays – a national event for all sectors of the equine industry.

Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says being involved in Equidays is a fitting partnership for the university.

“The University of Waikato is a very strong supporter of the region. We are strategic partners at the National Agricultural Fieldays, and it is fitting that we also play our part with Equidays.”

Equidays runs from 2-4 November, and will showcase all aspects of the equine industry, from horse breeding and racing, to recreation and research.

Professor Crawford says Equidays is particularly relevant to the university which has a proud history of involvement and support in the agricultural and equine industry.

“I know that much of the research we showcased at this year’s Fieldays – while aimed at the agricultural sector - has a direct impact on the equine industry. Our work around how climate change affects farms and how to remove impurities from bore water will be of great interest to those involved in the industry here.”

Many Waikato graduates are employed in the equine industry, and the University’s most prestigious scholarship, the Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme, has equine-related scholars.

“At the University of Waikato we are conscious of having a variety of arts and sports within this highly regarded programme,” says Professor Crawford.

“It speaks volumes that we always have a strong showing of equestrian students – they are able to be part of the equine scene in the Waikato region, while studying at an excellent university.”

Equidays takes place from 2-4 November and is held at Hamilton’s Mystery Creek. For information visit the Equidays website.
