**Waikato University Prepares For Kīngitanga Day**

The University of Waikato is gearing up for the fourth Kīngitanga Day - an annual celebration of the relationship between the university and the Kīngitanga.

The University of Waikato has had strong connections with the Kīngitanga and Tainui since the university was founded in 1964 and it is this relationship that the university honours each year through Kīngitanga Day.

Professor Linda Smith, the university’s Pro Vice-Chancellor (Māori), says the calibre of speakers Kīngitanga Day is attracting is testimony to the growing following the event has locally and nationally.

“Our relationship with the Kīngitanga and Waikato-Tainui, but also many other iwi across the country, has always been a fundamental aspect of this university,” says Professor Smith. “And Kīngitanga Day is a great opportunity to strengthen and build on these relationships.”

“It’s our opportunity to celebrate our distinctive heritage and history and it’s also our chance to engage with the wider community.”

This year the university’s Te Kotahi Research Institute will host guest speakers including Dame Claudia Orange, Dr Huirangi Waikerepuru, Moana Jackson and University of Waikato law lecturer Linda Te Aho for a symposium discussing the status, place and relevance of the Treaty of Waitangi in a constitution for Aotearoa.

Throughout the day presentations and seminars take place at the university’s many faculty’s with topics ranging from an overview of growing up in the Kīngitanga movement, to a traditional Māori instrument showcase, a look at Māori science and an exhibit of Māori visual culture and art, among many others.

Kīngitanga Day takes place on 16 May and starts at 9am. All activities are free and open to the public.
