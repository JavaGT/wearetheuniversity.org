A late night phone call can be a worrying thing for any parent.

But John Bell’s folks Allan and Amanda had nothing to worry about when he rang them at about 11.30pm recently.

The former Kaitaia College student had just learned he had been awarded one of only 10 Golden Jubilee Scholarships to the University of Waikato.

“I didn’t think much about it after I had applied but I checked my email about 11pm one night and found out I had got it. I was stoked so I rang my parents at about 11.30pm to tell them. They were both sound asleep,” he says.

The Golden Jubilee Scholarships were awarded as part of the university’s 50th anniversary this year and are worth up to $40,000 each. They have been awarded to students who have demonstrated a high level of academic excellence, leadership potential and community citizenship.

John, who spent his final year of high school at Sacred Heart College in Auckland, will study towards a Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) at Waikato.

“I always wanted to be in business,” he says.

“An old boy at school did a BMS at Waikato and he told me about it so we had a look. We looked at scholarships too. I didn’t really think I would have much chance but I wanted to give it a go.”

John – who represented Northland in rugby while at Kaitaia College and was at Sacred Heart on a rugby scholarship - says while he hopes to continue playing rugby at Waikato, his main priority will be study.

“I want to get high grades when I’m there.”

Given what he’s achieved so far, that shouldn’t be too difficult.
