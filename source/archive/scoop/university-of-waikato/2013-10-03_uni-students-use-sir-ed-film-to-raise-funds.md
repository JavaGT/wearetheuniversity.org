##### Tickets please – Hillary Scholars Luke Coxhead and Sharee Hamilton are organising an exclusive screening to fundraise for the Himalayan Trust.

Students from Waikato University’s Hillary Scholars club are putting their heads together to raise money for the people of Nepal.

Sharee Hamilton and Luke Coxhead are organising an exclusive screening of the movie Beyond the Edge to raise money for the Himalayan Trust – a not-for-profit organisation that assists in health, education, culture and restoration projects in Nepal as well as emergency relief.

Beyond the Edge brings to life the story of Sir Ed’s ascent of Everest with Tenzing Norgay in 1953. The movie uses original colour footage and photographs as well as stunning recreations to relive the day a New Zealander became the first person to climb the world’s highest mountain.

Luke, who is in his final year of a Bachelor of Management studies, says the film is a great opportunity to not only share the experiences of one of New Zealand’s most iconic figures, but to use the opportunity to raise money for the projects Sir Ed started.

“Sir Edmund Hillary’s incredible achievement remains one of the greatest adventure stories of all time. As Hillary Scholars, this movie has special meaning for us. Our values are modelled by Sir Ed’s constant belief in challenging your own limits,” says Luke.

Both Sharee and Luke are a part of the Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship programme, Waikato University’s most prestigious scholarship that is awarded to students who excel in sport or the creative and performing arts.

As part of the programme, scholars fundraise for the Himalayan Trust and they have already had some success with other fundraising projects this year.

“We ran a bake sale earlier in the year raising over $1000 so the proceeds we make from the film will be added to that. This will all go to the Himalayan Trust at the end of the year,” says Sharee, who is studying a conjoint degree in Law and Management.

Beyond the Edge will screen on 13 October at Lido Cinema. The event starts at 5.30pm and nibbles are included for ticket-holders. To purchase a ticket visit http://bit.ly/167puzQ
