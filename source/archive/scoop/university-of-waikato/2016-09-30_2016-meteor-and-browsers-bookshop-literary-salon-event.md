======================================================

**Friday, 30 September 2016, 1:30 pm**  
**Press Release: [University of Waikato](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato)**

The 2016 final Meteor and Browsers Bookshop Literary Salon, next Thursday (October 6th) at 7pm in the Meteor Theatre.

Come along to another intellectual and interesting evening, where writers and readers have a chance to meet, share and converse. Settle back in a comfy chair with a free glass of wine and canapés, while enjoying an exchange of ideas for Stanza Eight! There is an interesting blend of fact and fiction in the four stimulating speakers:

**Dr Steven Toussaint** is Writer in Residence at the University of Waikato and is a graduate of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. Steven’s poems and other writings have appeared in numerous publications. His first full-length collection of poems _The Bellfounder_ was published in 2015.

**Kingsley Field** has spent 35 years as a newspaper journalist in NZ and overseas. A former journalism tutor and media consultant, he is also an author, having published many history books. He currently writes columns, and proof-reads and edits manuscripts for other writers.

In addition to his academic research, **Dr Norman Franke** also produces documentary films and writes poetry. His poetry has been published by the Northern German Broadcasting Cooperation (NDR) and in anthologies in Europe and New Zealand. Norman will be reading some of his latest work.

**Dr Richard Swainson** writes an opinion column for the Waikato Times as well as contributing to the paper's weekly history page. For twenty years an amateur film reviewer on local radio, he now has a regular slot on Radio NZ National. He has previously written beer reviews and was briefly an obituary writer.

Tickets are $15, which includes a free drink and canapés. Tickets are available from the newly re-located Browsers Bookshop or door sales from the Meteor Theatre on October 6th.
