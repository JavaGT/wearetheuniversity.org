University of Waikato performing well

Tertiary Education Commission data released yesterday shows the University of Waikato continues to perform at a high level and deliver value for money.

According to the 2011 Educational Performance Indicators for the tertiary sector, the University of Waikato has scored at or above the university sector median for every indicator.

It’s the third year for which the TEC has published assessments of all tertiary institutions on their course completions, qualification completions, progression and retention for Ministry-funded students.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the performance indicators are broad. “Our performance indicator scores over the past three years show that students at the University of Waikato receive an excellent overall educational experience.”

Detailed information about the university can be found in the annual report, Professor Crawford says, and students wanting more information about studying at Waikato should visit the website: www.waikato.ac.nz.
