**Award for research of importance to women**  

University of Waikato student Kirsty Barber has received a $5000 scholarship for her research into how community mental health organisations can be more effective in helping people reclaim roles in the community.

Barber was awarded the New Horizons for Women Trust Research Award for her PhD research called _‘Realising Our Best Intentions: Vision, Values and Voice in Community Mental Health Organisations’_ which aims to provide a voice for many in the sector to share best practice and talk about what mental health treatments really work.

The New Horizons for Women Trust Research Award aims to assist women undertaking research on issues of importance to women and girls in New Zealand.

Barber’s decision to look at mental health services as a PhD topic came after investigating the effects of particular models of support in mental health services for her masters research, and seeing further scope for study.

“In the past there’s been very much a ‘there’s something wrong with people, and we need to fix them’ mentality in the mental health sector instead, we need to realise that people are more than what they’ve been through and medication alone often isn’t the best response.”

As part of her research Barber interviewed more than 130 people working in community mental health services on their experiences in the sector.

“New Zealand is a leader in adopting a ‘recovery’ model of mental health support as national policy. The model grew out of the idea that people who have been through these experiences have strengths and resourcefulness beyond the effects of illness and distress.”

However for a variety of reasons, she says recovery still does not seem to be embedded in the practice of all mental health organisations. It is these reasons she is investigating.

“What’s coming out of my research is the huge loss of confidence people feel when they enter the mental health system and that loss of confidence is almost as big a barrier to them reclaiming valued roles and a satisfying life.”

The New Horizons for Women Trust also administers the Second Chance Awards, each worth $2500, and given to women without qualifications who are studying at tertiary level. University of Waikato students to receive these include Selina Gyde, Tara Carr and Ahera Carlson.
