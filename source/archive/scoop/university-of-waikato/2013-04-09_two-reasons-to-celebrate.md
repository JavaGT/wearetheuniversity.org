Two reasons to celebrate

Two reasons to celebrate

Ash Puriri is used to being in the spotlight – he’s a veteran of global cruise ship entertainment, an opera singer and songwriter – but today \[Tuesday 9 April\] he’s sharing centre stage with his wife Karleen as they graduate at Waikato University’s Te Kohinga Mārama marae.

Ash of Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Rongomai-wahine and Ngāti Porou is graduating with a Masters in Management Studies and Karleen, Waikato Tainui, will be conferred with a Bachelor of Electronic Commerce. There’ll be plenty of whānau there to support them this afternoon including their four children aged 11 to 16.

The family lived on Australia’s Gold Coast for about ten years, but returned to New Zealand to be closer to whānau. Ash already had a Graduate Diploma in Business and studied an MBA at Auckland University, but was encouraged by academic Sir Tamati Reedy to return to tertiary study. “Sir Tamati has been a mentor of mine and he’s had a long association with Waikato University and the Management School. He said I should follow in his footsteps.”

And not being one to side-step a challenge, Ash completed his masters and is now adviser in Māori and Enterprise Development to the dean at Waikato Management School and studying for his PhD.

He continued working on cruise ships while he studied for his masters. “It worked well. I could study and write in my cabin undisturbed, no phone calls, and as I was studying issues in Māori tourism, the ship provided many opportunities for me to engage with real global tourism issues.”

Meanwhile back in Hamilton Karleen was completing the third year of her BECom. “I used to be a photographer, I had my own business but with rapidly changing technologies, I wanted to learn more about how those technologies were influencing and changing business.”

She became adept at juggling study and four children. “There were plenty of late nights, but I think as an adult student I had a lot more understanding and experience about life and business and that helped my learning.”

Karleen made the most of the opportunities that university offered. She was part of a trio that went to Canada for an international IT student case-competition. “We were the first team from a New Zealand university to take part in the event. The experience was a real-eye opener. We do things a bit differently than the North Americans. We’re more ‘nuts and bolts’, less showy. But we learnt so much by participating.”

Karleen was also a keynote presenter at last year’s FOMA conference. The Federation of Māori Authorities represents over 130 Māori authorities with an estimated natural resource asset value of approximately $37 billion dollars. She spoke about e-commerce and how she sees it impacting Māori business in the next 50 years. “And I hope that’s where my future lies. I’m now looking for work, preferably in iwi development, in a business that’s wanting to move forward in the global economy.”

But she hasn’t dismissed further study. “I feel I’ve still got a lot more to learn. This degree has whetted my appetite for more – just not yet. The time is right for me to be working.”

Ash Puriri began his doctoral study this year. From his research, he plans to develop a model for sustainable Māori tourism enterprise – one that embraces Kaupapa Māori philosophy and doesn’t compromise or commodify Māori culture.

Right now though, it’s just about enjoying their graduation day.
