Cloud security topic of Wellington forum
========================================

**Cloud security topic of Wellington forum**

It’s never been more important to gain control of cloud-based data. At a free forum in Wellington later this month, the STRATUS research group will demonstrate cloud security tools and techniques that will protect data in the cloud and help put New Zealand on the global IT map.

Forum keynote speakers are Security Technologies Returning Accountability, Trust and User-centric Services in the Cloud (STRATUS) Science Leader Dr Ryan Ko from the University of Waikato and Industry Advisory Group chairman Mr Jonathan Miller.

Dr Ko says one of the main objectives of the forum is to engage and familiarise New Zealand industry partners and end-users with the services and products being developed by STRATUS.

“The cloud is part of our everyday life but every time we upload something to the cloud, we lose control of our data and STRATUS is trying to change that. We’re also trying to create a cyber security industry in New Zealand that focuses on user needs and steers away from vendor-centric cloud services,” says Dr Ko.

“The general public is welcome to attend the forum. We want to roll out a series of DYI security tools for cloud users so hearing from the public would be great. We want to understand what everyday people want from security tools. We need their suggestions and feedback.”

Research outcomes presented at the forum will foster relationships between STRATUS and New Zealand industry partners that could lead on to internships, secondment opportunities and other career benefits.

STRATUS is a six-year, $12.2 million cyber security project, funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (MBIE) and executed by a team of leading cloud security researchers and practitioners from University of Waikato, University of Auckland, Unitec Institute of Technology and Cloud Security Alliance (CSA).

The STRATUS Forum and CSA NZ Summit marks the end of the first year of the MBIE-funded research initiative. The forum runs from 10.30am-5pm on 27 November in the MBIE Building, 15 Stout St, Wellington.
