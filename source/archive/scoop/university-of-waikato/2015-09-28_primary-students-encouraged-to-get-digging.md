**Primary students encouraged to get digging**

Future soil scientists are being encouraged to keep digging by two University of Waikato experts.

Soil Science Professor Louis Schipper and his wife Angela, who has a primary teaching background and is a content developer at the Science Learning Hub, have been donating soil science resources to Hamilton primary schools as part of their support for the International Year of Soils.

The resource kits include the award winning children’s book _Sam and Dave Dig a Hole_, along with teaching activities, soil posters and stickers. Their goal is to encourage children to do as the book suggests, dig a hole – and find something spectacular.

The couple have collaborated on soil science resources for young people for more than 20 years.

They have published both print and online materials about soils and helped dig many holes at schools and on Cub Scout camps.

Professor Schipper says it’s enjoyable working with children and he hopes to convince them that earth sciences is an exciting study option.

“We want the best possible students in Earth Sciences because it can be a very challenging and rewarding field of study that attempts to determine how to wisely use the Earth’s precious resources,” he says.
