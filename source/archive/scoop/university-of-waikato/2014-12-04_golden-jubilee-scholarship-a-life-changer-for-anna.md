**Golden Jubilee Scholarship a life-changer for Anna**

Anna Caudwell describes being awarded a Golden Jubilee Scholarship from the University of Waikato as a life-changing experience.

“I was over the moon when I heard I’d got the scholarship,” she says. “It’s probably the happiest I’d ever been. It’s life-changing and such a great opportunity.”

Golden Jubilee Scholarships were awarded for 2015 as part of the University's 50th anniversary. They were given to 10 school-leavers who demonstrated a high level of academic excellence, leadership potential and community citizenship.

More than 200 students applied for the scholarship, which is worth up to $40,000, and as part of the programme, scholars will have opportunities to develop leadership skills through a tailored leadership programme.  
From Otaki, Anna is a year 13 boarder at Feilding High School and is looking forward to starting at Waikato next year.

“I’m ready for the next phase of my life, new experiences, meeting other people and getting into economics and accounting.”

Before being awarded the scholarship, Anna had been looking at studying at either Waikato or Victoria universities.

“But once I heard I had the scholarship, I knew I was coming to Waikato.”

Anna is enrolled at Waikato Management School in a Bachelor of Management Studies majoring in accounting and economics. She plans to become a chartered accountant and work in New Zealand before eventually heading overseas.

While at high school, Anna held several leadership positions. She was the Manawatu Youth Ambassador (community volunteer) and treasurer on the school council. She was a prefect in the L J Wild House school hostel, a house officer, netball coach and tutor for accounting and statistics.

She says the experience gained from these positions helped her understand how to be a successful and effective leader while also helping those around her.

“These positions have taught me how to work effectively in a team, and also built my confidence enough to be able to work individually on certain projects. I have learnt to speak up with my opinions and ideas, but to also be quiet and respectful when somebody else is presenting theirs. I have become more aware of those and the problems of those around me and how to help and assist those in need.”
