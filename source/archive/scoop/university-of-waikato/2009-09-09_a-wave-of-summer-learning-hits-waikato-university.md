A wave of summer learning hits Waikato University

Animation, short digital stories and performing arts – Waikato University’s summer school is on again.

Every year the university opens its doors for six weeks over summer to teach a variety of courses to people wanting university credits or simply wanting the experience of learning.

This year the Hamilton campus runs a course that introduces participants to 3D modelling and animation concepts through self-paced laboratory exercises. The course explores basic keyframing, path animation and the effects of lighting and cameras for rendering.

Writing historical fiction with bestselling New Zealand author Deborah Challinor; an introduction to TV studio management and making short digital stories; Māori performing arts and an introductory course to the Māori language are just some of the other courses offered at the Hamilton campus.

Over in Tauranga, summer school covers a practical music course that focuses on playing musical instruments and singing in a variety of combinations with an opportunity to record. A human development course is also offered.

Courses take place at the Hamilton and Tauranga campuses, with some done online. All courses take place between January 5 and February 26 and vary in length and some have prerequisite learning. For more information, phone 0800 WAIKATO or visit www.waikato.ac.nz/waissa
