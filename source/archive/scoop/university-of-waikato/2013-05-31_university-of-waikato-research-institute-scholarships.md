**University of Waikato Research Institute Scholarships**

The University of Waikato’s six flagship Research Institutes are offering new doctoral and masters scholarships. The Research Institutes support world-class research in environmental science, demography and economic analysis, business and leadership, professional learning and development, education, and Māori and indigenous development. Each institute is offering a doctoral scholarship worth $22,000 a year plus fees for three years’ full time study, and a masters scholarship worth $12,000 that includes a fees component of $3,500.

“Our Research Institutes all support major research platforms that have been successful in winning contestable research funding, and so this is an exciting time for postgraduate research at Waikato University,” says Pro Vice-Chancellor Postgraduate Professor Kay Weaver. “This gives 12 students a fantastic opportunity to work with some of Waikato’s best researchers on relevant and topical issues.”

The Institutes and topics for postgraduate scholarship research are as follows:

The **Environmental Research Institute (ERI)** is offering doctoral and masters scholarships to students intending to research aspects of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal marine or Antarctic ecosystems.

The **Institute for Business Research (IBR)** is offering scholarships to applicants keen to investigate the potential for the small business sector to contribute a sustainable increase to New Zealand’s national income.
