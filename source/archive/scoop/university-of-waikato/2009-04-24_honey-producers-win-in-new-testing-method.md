Honey producers win in new testing method

Honey producers, consumers winners in new testing method

  
Consumers buying manuka honey for its medicinal purposes will soon find it easier to identify the best products.

Waikato University’s Honey Research Unit, which created the world-wide standard to test manuka honey for its unique antibacterial activity, is about to launch a better and more reliable test, complete with its own trademark.

This will allow consumers to easily identify products that have been reliably tested by an independent authority, and rated for the antibacterial activity that is unique to manuka honey but not present in all honey sold as manuka honey.

The move means honey producers can get more accurate testing on the antibacterial rating of their honey, potentially earning them thousands of dollars more per drum. And because the test will be widely available, it will create a bigger and more competitive market for certified honey.

The unique type of antibacterial activity in manuka honey was discovered in research at the University of Waikato in 1982. Evidence shows manuka’s special antibacterial properties are effective at healing wounds, but research also shows that this activity is present in only some manuka honeys.

Professor Peter Molan, who heads the internationally renowned Honey Research Unit at the university, says the existing test compares manuka honey’s antibacterial properties with different concentrations of a standard disinfectant and gives a ranking of 10-30.

However, Prof Molan considers that this test, which has not been upgraded significantly since its inception, throws up too many variables. Many producers have lost money because of the old test, he says. “We know of drums of honey where the margin of error has been worth more than $1000 and the honey producer has missed out on that because variables mean the rating was wrong.”

The new University of Waikato test, developed over the past couple of years, eliminates those variables, and guarantees the batch tested has an activity that is above the stated rating. “It’s far more accurate, far more scientific and is quicker for the producer. It’s going to be quite clear what you are buying. At the moment consumers could be buying a ranking of 15, but in fact it’s less than 13,” Prof Molan says.

The revised test will be commercially available to all honey producers who are selling the genuine active manuka honey. They will now be able to credibly advertise the effectiveness of their honey and that, in turn, means a wider market for consumers, Prof Molan says.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says Prof Molan is the most experienced person in the world regarding manuka’s antibacterial properties. “Peter created this industry – he took what was essentially a waste product - and his discovery and research have made this a $100 million a year industry.”

Prof Crawford says the university did not hesitate to back Prof Molan and the Honey Research Unit’s new test and its trademark because it will further benefit the industry and consumers. “With Peter’s reputation alongside the University of Waikato, consumers and producers are guaranteed quality in the testing regime.”

And Mark Stuart, Chief Executive Officer of WaikatoLink, the university’s commercialisation arm, says that reputation is an important factor. International feedback about manuka honey reinforces just how much of a demand there is for Prof Molan’s expertise and his recommendations, Mr Stuart says. “We know of hard-headed international businesses who are interested in manuka products only because of Peter’s reputation.”

The Bee Products Standard Council says it wants to see a robust management system to give the consumer confidence in the manuka product range and will work with the industry to achieve that. Chairman Jim Edwards says the industry “needs to re-affirm its direction for marketing manuka honey".

The new University of Waikato test is expected to be ready for use in coming weeks and negotiations to licence the test to an independent registered laboratory are nearly complete. Mr Stuart says the new test will be more efficient for the laboratory because the new method removes the need for repeated tests.

He says income generated from industry use of the test via a commercial laboratory will help support further research that will return significant value to the industry.
