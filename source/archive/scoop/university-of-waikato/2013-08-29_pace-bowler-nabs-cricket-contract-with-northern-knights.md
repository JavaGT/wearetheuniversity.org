Pace-bowler nabs cricket contract with Northern Knights

A strong season on the cricket pitch has seen University of Waikato student and right-arm pace-bowler Tony Goodin land a six-month contract with the Northern Knights starting on 1 October.

The former Mount Maunganui College student is now in his final semester of a Bachelor of Sport and Leisure Studies.

Tony says he was “pretty stoked” when he heard about his selection for the Northern Knights.

“It was a lot of hard work but it’s what I’ve always wanted to do. I hope it will lead to playing for New Zealand one day.”

His contract with the Northern Knights is a reflection of the great season Tony has had with Bay of Plenty Cricket, being named Bay of Plenty Cricketer of the Year in 2012-2013 after smashing the club’s all-time most wickets in a season record with 44 wickets in 12 appearances. His performance with Bay of Plenty helped the team retain the coveted Hawke Cup.

Tony started playing cricket “in the back yard with the old man” before going through Kiwi Cricket then on to play for the Mount Maunganui Cricket Club as a junior.

Tony says he is looking forward to his season with the Knights, especially as he and the team’s coach James Pamment go back a long way. Pamment coached him at the Mount Maunganui club when he was only seven years old.

And what he likes most about cricket? “Every game is different and you always have good guys around you.”
