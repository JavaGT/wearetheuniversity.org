Board appointment for senior lecturer
=====================================

**Board appointment for senior lecturer**

University of Waikato Screen and Media Studies senior lecturer Dr Gareth Schott has been appointed to the Government’s Film and Literature Board of Review for three years.

The board reviews publications that have been classified by the Office of Film and Literature Classification.

Publications include, but are not limited to, any film, video recording, DVD, CD Rom, disc, electronic or computer file, book, magazine, newspaper, photograph or sound recording.

The nine member board is appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Internal Affairs.

Dr Schott’s appointment comes on the back of two Marsden grants to study video gaming, including one to research video game classifications.

“My research to-date has aimed to support classification processes by more clearly distinguishing between the different experiences offered by games, compared to film. I have argued for the need to articulate those differences in experience more clearly when informing the public why games have achieved a particular age-restriction.”
