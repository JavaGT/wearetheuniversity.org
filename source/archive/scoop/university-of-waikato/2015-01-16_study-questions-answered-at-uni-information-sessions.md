**Study questions answered at uni information sessions**

Ever thought about studying but didn’t know where to start? Not sure whether computer science or English literature is your thing? With the University of Waikato’s March intake just around the corner, now is the time to look into it.

The University has a range of information sessions in Hamilton, Tauranga, Rotorua and Auckland coming up where faculty staff and recruitment advisers will be available to answer questions about study, discuss study options and help potential uni students make plans for their future.

Group Manager, Future Students Catherine Downes encourages anyone considering study to come along to a session.

“The sessions are a great opportunity to speak one-on-one with University staff who can give advice on study options. Speak to one of our advisers and receive the specialist advice and support you need to start a qualification at the University of Waikato. Sessions are open to anyone thinking about beginning study in March or thinking further ahead to the July intake.”

University of Waikato information sessions are being held on campus in Hamilton on Tuesday, 20 January and 17 February from 10am-6pm at the Student Centre, entry via Gate 5 on Hillcrest Road.

On Thursday, 22 January there is an information session from 9am-6pm at the Information Centre, Windermere Campus, Tauranga. To register for a 30-minute programme planning appointment, email uwt@waikato.ac.nz.
