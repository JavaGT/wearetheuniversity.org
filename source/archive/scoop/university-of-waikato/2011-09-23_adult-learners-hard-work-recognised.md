**Adult learners’ hard work recognised**

Four adult students have been awarded University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor’s Adult Learners Awards.

  
The awards are intended to encourage more adults to access learning opportunities and to celebrate the efforts, academic and personal achievements, and contributions of adult learners. Tracey Kibble, Sharon Cullen, Vicky Taplin and Stephen Wong each received awards of $1500 and a kowhai tree, to symbolise continued growth, in a ceremony in late September.

  
**Tracey Kibble** was diagnosed with breast cancer in her second year of studying towards a Bachelor of Teaching. Throughout her diagnosis, treatment and side effects she remained focused on her studies and continued to achieve high marks, never seeking special consideration from her lecturers. During her studies Tracey also had to look after her husband who suffered a serious stroke, which resulted in a long period of recovery time.

  
**Sharon Cullen** is studying fulltime towards a Bachelor of Teaching while looking after three children. Throughout her studies she and her children have faced health issues and the passing of Sharon’s grandmother, all of which have had significant impacts on her family. Throughout these challenges she has remained focused on her studies, maintaining high grades and being one of the top students in her class.

  
**Vicky Taplin** commutes daily from Whangamata to the University’s Tauranga campus. A straight A student studying towards a Bachelor of Social Work, Vicky has a teenage daughter living at home and this year her adult son, his wife and their two pre-school age children have moved into her home. As Vicky’s daughter-in-law has a degenerative muscular disease, she requires support with looking after her children. Vicky also works with her husband, doing the accounts for the family joinery business.

**Stephen Wong** balances being a husband, father, and worker with studying towards a Bachelor of Social Sciences. He and his young family decided to relocate from Tauranga to Hamilton to pursue his studies. Despite the challenges of a bigger learning environment and the loss of his established support networks, Stephen is flourishing academically. He takes on a mentoring role in class, supporting and encouraging other students, and was recently invited to join the Golden Key Honours Society, a reflection of his high grades.

  
Waikato University has more than 4,800 adult learners, defined as students over the age of 25, who make up 38% of the student body. The awards have been presented since 2001.
