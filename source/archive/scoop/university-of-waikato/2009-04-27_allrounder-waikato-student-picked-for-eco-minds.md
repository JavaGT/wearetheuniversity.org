Mixing it up for Eco-Minds

Management and science isn’t the most typical mix of subjects for a university degree, but for University of Waikato student Rebecca Williamson it’s opened the way to a place at a top youth forum on sustainable development.

Williamson is one of just five New Zealand students who’ve been selected to attend the Asia-Pacific Eco-Minds Sustainable Development Forum, sponsored by Bayer and the United Nationals Environment Programme (UNEP).

They’ll join around 15 students from eight other Asia-Pacific countries for a week of mini lectures, discussions and fact-finding trips on the development of sustainable energy systems, looking specifically at New Zealand as a case study.

The forum will be held in Auckland and Rotorua next month \[May 25-29\].

To win her place, Williamson had to submit a 1,000 word essay on the topic, but she says it’s a great opportunity to bring her twin interests together. “I’m doing a conjoint management and science degree at Waikato, and most people just look blank when I say I’m majoring in chemistry and economics,” she says. “The Eco-Minds forum is the first thing I’ve found where I can mix the two together, and I just thought – yess!”

The former Mt Maunganui College student did chemistry and calculus at school, and was a member of a winning team in the Young Enterprise Scheme. She was tossing up between a degree in science and a degree in management when she saw a flyer for the conjoint degree at Waikato.

“That decided me,” she says. “This degree gives me the chance to develop my skills in both science and management. This year I’ve already completed a summer research scholarship project in chemistry – that was on immobilising metal nanoparticles into fabric, and now I’ve got the opportunity to find out more about sustainable energy options at the Eco-Minds forum.”

Williamson says the week-long forum should be fun: “We’ll have specialists in sustainability as guest speakers, and there’s a competition where we have to come up with ideas for working together to reduce our carbon footprint across the Asia-Pacific region. It’s all about working globally to solve problems.”

Williamson is in her fourth year of the five-year conjoint degree, and says she’s interested in working in the area of environmental policy making when she graduates.
