**Mungo goes to Vietnam**

A University of Waikato law student and talented rugby player has just arrived in Hanoi City for a five-day leadership symposium on social change.

Former Tauranga Boys’ College Head Boy Mungo Mason says the trip to Vietnam is part of his leadership development.

The University Scholars’ Leadership Symposium (USLS) by Humanitarian Affairs UK brings together 1000 of the world’s young leaders to discuss and explore social sustainability and service leadership.

Mungo’s one of four University of Waikato students attending the event.

No stranger to leadership, Mungo’s achieved a lot in his four years at university.

The open-side flanker is known for his skills on the field and has a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship to show for it.

“Right now I’m playing club rugby for Hamilton Old Boys and training hard to make the Waikato Development Squad next season,” says Mungo.

As well as being a student ambassador for the University of Waikato and volunteer sports mentor for the Waikato Academy of Young Achievers, Mungo’s also started a social initiative with two friends that lets university students be charitable in a small way.

“It’s called Flatting for Change and makes donating to social, animal and/or environmental causes more affordable for students,” he says. “It’s all about education, awareness and accessibility.”

Mungo is studying for a Bachelor of Laws with a second major in International Management. He says his qualification paired with experiences such as the USLS are just the things he needs to make positive change happen.

“I’m excited to meet people from all over the world who share my dreams for change but have totally different perspectives on how to make it happen. I think that will be the real eye-opener for me at the symposium and I’m so grateful to the University for supporting me to get there,” says Mungo.

While Mungo’s away, he’ll be logging his experiences through SnapChat, Instagram and Facebook. Follow WaikatoUni on SnapChat to keep up with his adventures.
