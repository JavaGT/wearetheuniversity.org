MEDIA RELEASE  
University of Waikato selected for Technology Transfer Voucher programme

The University of Waikato has been selected by the Ministry of Science and Innovation to be an accredited partner in the government’s Technology Transfer Voucher programme.

The programme, which began last year, provides businesses with 50 per cent funding for research and development to be carried out by an accredited public research organisation.

Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says Waikato has a demonstrated track record in working collaboratively and constructively in new initiatives.

“We already have nearly 400 active research projects and last year attracted $22.8 million in new research funding,” he says. “The voucher programme covers many areas where we have substantial expertise and is a good way to introduce businesses that don’t have a history of engaging with us.”

The programme began with novel materials and manufacturing, health and medical technologies, information, communications and digital technologies and six research partners. It has now been expanded to encompass research in agri-technologies with eight new partners accredited, including Waikato University and AgResearch.

There’s $5 million worth of vouchers earmarked for the programme this year and they can be worth anything from $30,000 to $1 million. Businesses can either nominate their favoured accredited partner or the Ministry can help in finding one the business deems most appropriate.

“With campuses in Hamilton and Tauranga, the University of Waikato connects with businesses across the two regions,” says Professor Crawford. “The Waikato and Bay of Plenty make up a significant component of New Zealand’s economic engine, and when you’re close to the businesses you’re working with, it’s easier to develop good working relationships, create networks and facilitate innovation.”
