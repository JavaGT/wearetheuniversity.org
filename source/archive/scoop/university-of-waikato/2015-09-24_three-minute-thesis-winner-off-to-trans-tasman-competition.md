**Three Minute Thesis winner off to Trans-Tasman competition**

After taking out the University of Waikato’s Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition in 2014, Onyekachi Raymond is about to head off to compete in the Trans-Tasman 3MT on 2 October.

From the Faculty of Science and Engineering, Raymond’s presentation is entitled “The Beauty Without the Beast: A Chemical Search for Beryllium’s Partner”. Beryllium is an indispensable but toxic metal used in high-tech devices such as smartphones and computers. Raymond’s research looks at finding chemical agents that help remove beryllium from these products when they are disposed of.

Raymond will have three minutes to present his research to the audience at the University of Queensland Graduate School in Brisbane.

Raymond, who is from Nigeria, is now two years into his PhD in Chemistry at Waikato University.

“I was really excited to win the 3MT in 2014 and I’m even more excited to have the opportunity to present it in Australia.”

As well as taking first prize worth $3000 in the 2014 competition, Raymond also won the People’s Choice Award, based on audience votes, of $500.

3MT, supported by Prior Blackburn and the University of Waikato Foundation, showcases research being carried out by the University’s PhD students. Presentations are judged on comprehension, engagement and communication.

At this year’s 3MT final, 10 PhD candidates will pitch their research to a lay audience at 7pm on 21 October in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts Concert Chamber. Entry is free. All are welcome.
