**Education delivers first for University of Waikato**

The Faculty of Education has achieved a notable first for the University of Waikato, being ranked in the top 50 in the world in the latest QS Subject Rankings.

Education came in at 46 on the rankings, with four other subjects taught at the University - Computer Science and Info Systems, Economics/Econometrics, Law and Modern Languages – ranked between 101-150.

Faculty of Education Dean Professor Roger Moltzen says the result is due to a lot of dedicated effort from all staff in the faculty.

“This will be a real encouragement for staff. That’s not why we do what we do but it’s good to be recognised for your work.”

Professor Moltzen says the result is especially pleasing as the QS Subject Rankings consider employer responses along with academic surveys and research citations.

“Our employer reputation is very high, which is important to us,” he says.

He puts the improvement on last year’s subject rankings - where education was graded between 51-100 - down to gradual and continued improvement across the faculty and increasingly strong relationships with stakeholder groups, including schools.

“We enjoy a good reputation with the professional groups that we provide graduates to,” he says.

“Our research outputs have also increased, both in quantity and quality and we have developed some strong international partnerships with highly regarded universities.”

Professor Moltzen says the stellar ranking will be an important factor in attracting students, particularly international students.

“We know it (ranking) has an impact internationally but we also know it is a factor for New Zealand students in making decisions about where to study

While rankings can be fickle, Professor Moltzen says he is delighted with the result.

“It’s a prestigious field so it is a significant achievement.”

The QS rankings are generally considered among the most influential of university ranking systems and are based on academic and employer surveys, research citations for each subject area, the ratio of students to staff and the number of international students and staff at the university.
