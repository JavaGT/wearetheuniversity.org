Bringing te reo Māori home

  
A University of Waikato student has started a business to revitalise the Māori language. It’s called Taputapu and specialises in designing Te Reo Māori homewares.

Bachelor in Media and Creative Technologies student Nikki Kennedy came up with the idea when she noticed an absence of the language in modern homes. Around the same time, the university launched its Summer Start-Up Programme (SSUP), and Nikki took it as a sign to apply.

Originally from Gisborne, Nikki says the programme gave her everything she needed to bring her idea to life.

“The SSUP programme ran over 10 weeks and offered a $5000 scholarship, one-on-one mentoring, workshops and all the tools you need to start-up your own company or project,” says the former Lytton High School student.

While her idea required some management and marketing knowledge, not being qualified in that area didn’t put Nikki off. She knew her idea had value and with the right help and support, she could make it successful.

And successful it is. Nikki’s selling out of products weekly through her website www.taputapu.co.nz. But she says her main focus is on her official launch in July as part of Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori (Māori Language Week).

Getting involved with different kaupapa, such as SSUP and Te Āhurutanga student leadership programme, have been highlights of Nikki’s time at university so far.

“These opportunities have introduced me to some incredible people who I may not have known otherwise,” she says.

Along with the SSUP scholarship, the third-year student has received two Māori Excellence Awards, a Te Tohu Paetahi Scholarship and Te Āhurutanga Scholarship.

Her key to success?

“Being passionate about what you study. If you aren’t passionate about it then everything is hard and becomes a drag. I don’t see why anyone would spend their time, energy and money on a qualification that means nothing to them. I’m lucky I’ve found something I love,” she says.

Once she graduates, Nikki wants to run her own company and be her own boss. Thanks to her experiences so far, that dream seems so much more possible.
