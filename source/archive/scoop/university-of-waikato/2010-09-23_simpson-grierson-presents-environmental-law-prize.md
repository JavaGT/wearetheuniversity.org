**Simpson Grierson Presents Environmental Law Prize** **to University of Waikato Student**

21 September 2010: Tyler Buckley achieved the highest mark in the University of Waikato's environmental law paper this year. To secure the Simpson Grierson Environmental Law Prize for 2010, he went through an interview with the firm's judging panel. And clearly this Hamilton student impressed, earning himself the $1,000 award and the praise of Simpson Grierson chairman, Kevin Jaffe.

\"The Environmental Law Prize was established at the University of Waikato in 1992 to encourage excellence in the study of environmental law," said Mr Jaffe. "Tyler Buckley is a deserving recipient, adding this prize to a number he has received at the University over the course of his study."

"Tyler was a Simpson Grierson Scholarship winner in 2009 and we look forward to welcoming him as a law graduate at the firm next year."

Tyler completes his conjoint degree in Law and Social Sciences (majoring in Economics) at the University of Waikato in 2011 and is currently on a student exchange to Denmark. He says that receiving the Simpson Grierson Environmental Law Prize was particularly meaningful to him.

"I was motivated to study environmental law because of the time I spent as a summer clerk in the local government & environment group at Simpson Grierson As a clerk, I received broad exposure to environmental law in practice and this made me want to learn more about the theory."

"I like the fact that environmental law is very much community focused and as a result, is often the subject of media and political discussion. Whether it’s a historical building or a sustainable energy project, people will always have an opinion. As a summer clerk I learnt how prominent the issues can be, when I observed Environment Court proceedings one day and then read about them in the paper the next."

Tyler says he will put his prize money towards the purchase of a return flight to New Zealand next year, so that he can start work at Simpson Grierson in July. Something he says he is "genuinely excited about".
