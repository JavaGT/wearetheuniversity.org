The University of Waikato’s Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) race car will feature in a new exhibit in Waikato Museum’s Exscite interactive science gallery from March 17 to May 9 this year.

The formula-style race car was designed, built and raced by Waikato University students at an international event last December. Following the exhibition, the car will be revised and improved by the student team for the 2014 competition.

**Engineering insight**  
University of Waikato Engineering students worked with Waikato Museum curator Salina Ghazally to develop the display to give Exscite visitors an insight into the project development of the car and the science of racing.

“We are very excited to have the university students’ car here on display. It not only puts in perspective the fundamental physics in race car sports, but also celebrates the calibre of science happening at our local university,” says Ms Ghazally.

University of Waikato senior lecturer in engineering, Dr Mark Lay says the display is a great opportunity to share the work of the University engineering team with the wider community, and hopefully inspire more students to consider engineering as a career.

**Formula SAE racing**  
The car was ranked sixth overall and the top New Zealand entrant among more than 20 competitors from Australia, New Zealand, Japan and England in the annual Formula SAE race in Melbourne on December 10, 2013.

Since 2006 Waikato University team cars have scored well in Formula SAE event categories which include design, cost and manufacturing, presentation, acceleration, skidpad, autocross, fuel economy and endurance events.

**Exscite gallery**  
Exscite science gallery is open seven days from 10am – 4.30pm.
