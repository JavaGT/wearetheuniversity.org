Inaugural Māori scholarships awarded to te reo Māori researchers

Associate Professor Leonie Pihama, Director of Te Kotahi Research Institute has this week announced the recipients of the Inaugural Te Kotahi Research Institute Postgraduate Scholarships. “We are extremely excited to be able to support two Māori scholars with these Inaugural scholarships at the Masters and Doctoral levels,” stated Dr Pihama. The Doctoral Scholarship has been awarded to Pānia Papa (Ngāti Korokī Kahukura) who is undertaking research to develop a new curriculum for the teaching of te reo Māori. The Masters Scholarship has been awarded to Jaime Rolleston (Te Arawa) who has focused her research in the area of te reo Māori revitalisation.

The scholarships have been provided through a decision by the University of Waikato to allocate postgraduate scholarships to each of the Research Institutes within the university, including Te Kotahi Research Institute. The scholarships align to the research focus areas for each Institute.

Senior Māori academic Dr Rangi Matamua also acknowledged the significance of the announcement and the support given to two scholars who are actively contributing to the revitalisation of te reo Māori in a range of fields and communities, “We are very fortunate to have two excellent researchers take up these scholarships. It is particularly pleasant to see that both of them are studying within the te reo Māori arena supporting its revitalisation.” Dr Pihama said it is an exciting development to have the scholarships allocated through the Institute and that it was another step towards meeting the wider vision of both the Institute and the Iwi Board, Te Rōpū Manukura, to increase support for Māori at the University.
