University a finalist in Australasian sustainability awards

  
The University of Waikato has been selected as a finalist in the 2015 Green Gown Awards Australasia.

The University is one of four finalists in the Continuous Improvement – Institutional Change category for its programme “GoingGreen@Waikato”.

The Green Gown Awards were established to recognise sustainability best practice within the tertiary education sector and recognises institutions’ sustainability actions and initiatives. The awards were founded in the UK in 2004 and are now in their fifth year in Australasia. The awards now include Australia, New Zealand, the UK, and French-speaking Europe and Canada.

University of Waikato Environmental & Sustainability Manager Rachael Goddard says the awards are recognition of the sustainability successes that universities and polytechnics achieve.

“GoingGreen@Waikato has helped embed sustainability into all aspects of university activity.

Several thousand people have been involved over the last four years. Waste to landfill and fleet carbon emissions have decreased, while recycling, participation and awareness have increased. Our savings and funding combined have exceeded $200,000.

“The key to success has been the engaging and unique nature of the initiative, by-in from staff and students, and support from stakeholders.”

The Green Gown Awards Australasia are run by Australasian Campuses Towards Sustainability Incorporated Association, a non-profit member-based organisation representing higher and further education institutions within Australia and New Zealand.

Winners will be announced at an awards ceremony on October 22 in Geelong.
