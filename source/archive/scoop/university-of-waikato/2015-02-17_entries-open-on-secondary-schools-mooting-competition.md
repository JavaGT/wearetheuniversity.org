**Entries open on secondary schools mooting competition**

Registrations of interest for the annual University of Waikato Te Piringa – Faculty of Law Secondary Schools’ Mooting competition close on 7 March.

A moot is an exercise employed throughout the world as a tool of legal education. Mooting provides an opportunity for students to argue over an area of uncertainty in the law. Gaining mooting experience can have a positive impact on students’ future career.

Competitors gain valuable experience and training in written and oral communication, public speaking, general research and presentation skills.

Te Piringa – Faculty of Law at the University of Waikato is the only New Zealand university that runs Secondary School Mooting competitions.

Since 2001 the competition has grown to include schools from Hawke’s Bay, Taranaki, Auckland, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty.

To assist schools, teachers and students, Te Piringa –Faculty of Law could organise mooting workshops for participants and could put teams in contact with experienced local Law Practitioners and/or Judges willing to coach teams during preparation phase.

The 2014 Mooting competition was won by Hillcrest High School, with members of the winning team each presented with book vouchers and a $3000 scholarship to assist with the first year of study at Te Piringa - Faculty of Law, University of Waikato.  
The award for Best Individual Mooter went to Corey Vickers from Spotswood College in New Plymouth.
