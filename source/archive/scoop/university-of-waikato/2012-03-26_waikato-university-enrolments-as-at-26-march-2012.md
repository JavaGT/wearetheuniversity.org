**Waikato University enrolments as at 26 March 2012**

The University of Waikato had a total of 9,219 domestic and international Equivalent Full-Time Students after the first few weeks of A Semester 2012.

By March 26, the University had 8,230 Ministry-funded (i.e. domestic) EFTS. This year’s target agreed between the university and the Tertiary Education Commission is 8,550 Ministry-funded EFTS; the university is sitting at 96.1% of that target already.

Full cost international students EFTS are 959 EFTS. Students from nearly 80 countries are studying at Waikato University; the top five nations are China, Saudi Arabia, India, Japan and USA.

A further 30 EFTS have been enrolled in other full cost categories.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says that as was the case last year, new and returning students have enrolled earlier this year to ensure a place at Waikato. The Faculties of Arts and Social Sciences, Education and Computing and Mathematical Sciences have already exceeded their overall Ministry-funded EFTS targets for 2012, reflecting stronger than anticipated demand in those fields.

More domestic and international students are expected to enrol for the B Semester, which starts in July; PhD students enrol throughout the year.

All universities must work to a maximum of 103% of their Ministry-funded EFTS target and Waikato University finished 2011 on 99.6% of its target of 8,694 EFTS.
