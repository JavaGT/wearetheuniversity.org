**Tauranga's Café Scientifique hits record attendees of 150**

September’s Café Scientifique hit a record of 150 people attending the meeting with guest speaker Dr Marcus Wilson, Faculty of Science and Engineering from the University of Waikato. He explained how different patterns of electrical activity in the brain can be seen when someone is sleeping, thinking or under general anaesthetic. He also discussed what is known about electrical signalling, what this means and how it can be measured.

Supported by the University of Waikato, Café Scientifique is a forum for discussing science issues, where anyone can come to explore the latest ideas in science and technology.

The next Café will take place on Tuesday 28 October and will see Dame Anne Salmond present one of four lectures in the 2014 Rutherford Lectures: Experiments across Worlds. She will explore how exchanges between different ways of being, particularly Maori and European, have helped to shape our past and how they might contribute to an innovative and successful society for future generations. Dame Anne Salmond is a renowned author, academic, environmentalist and winner of the 2013 Rutherford Medal.
