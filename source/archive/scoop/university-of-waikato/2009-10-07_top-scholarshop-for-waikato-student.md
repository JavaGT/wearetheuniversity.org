Top Scholarshop For Waikato Student

A University of Waikato computer science student has been awarded a government-funded Top Achiever’s Doctoral Scholarship, worth $92,000 over three years, to fund his PhD studies into better ways to design complex systems.

Simon Ware specialises in an area known as formal methods in computer science, which uses formal mathematical reasoning to verify software is correct, rather than the traditional method of writing software and then testing it to find any errors.  His research focuses on ways to abstract away from, or simplify, complex detail so as to ensure the model matches its specification.

Ware says there are good economic and safety reasons why we need to optimise complex systems to be most efficient -- we all want our trains, for example, to run safely and on time.

Five Waikato students are among the recipients of the 12 Top Achiever’s Doctoral Scholarships awarded this year.
