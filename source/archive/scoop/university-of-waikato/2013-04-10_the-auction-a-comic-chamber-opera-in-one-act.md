**The Auction: A Comic Chamber Opera In One Act**

The University of Waikato Conservatorium of Music presents the world premiere of _The Auction_, a one-act comic opera by composer Janet Jennings, as part of the A Semester Opera Showcase concert.

A PhD graduate of the Conservatorium, Jennings wrote both the libretto as well as the music.

“The opera takes a look at what having (or trying to get) a ‘home’ means to New Zealanders. The auction becomes a crucible in which nine characters are forced to consider how they manage their lives,” says Jennings.

The opera is staged as an on-site auction (mortgagee sale) of a two-bedroom flat in run-down suburb.

Familiar hazards such as the auction process itself, mortgagee sales, pushy real estate agents, leaky buildings, and “property sharks” are all part of the action.

Senior vocal lecturer David Griffiths describes the piece as a delightful excursion into the world of personal and social conflict with some hilarious, unpredictable outcomes.

Janet is directing the production, with Francis Cowan and David Griffiths accompanying on piano.

Janet’s work is familiar to Hamilton concert goers. Her arrangement of Poi E was recently sung and played at Sunset Symphony by the Hamilton Festival Choir and Waikato Symphony Orchestra.

One of Janet’s choral works, Matariki, was recently performed by the Hamilton Civic Choir under conductor Rachael Griffiths-Hughes, and will feature on the choir’s 2013 CD.

The Auction will be performed as part of the Conservatorium of Music Opera Showcase, Friday 12th April 7pm, at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, University of Waikato.
