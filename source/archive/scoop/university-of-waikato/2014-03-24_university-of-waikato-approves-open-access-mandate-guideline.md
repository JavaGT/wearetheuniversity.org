University of Waikato approves Open Access Mandate Guidelines

The University of Waikato has become the first university in New Zealand to approve a mandate around open access to academics’ publications.

The Open Access Mandate Guidelines were approved this month by the University of Waikato’s Academic Board. Under the guidelines, academic staff can disseminate their research as widely as possible, bringing research results out from behind the subscription paywall to be accessed by all.

This puts the University of Waikato at the forefront of the issue among New Zealand institutions, demonstrating a commitment to the concept of open access to knowledge. Freedom to exchange ideas and to publish acquired knowledge are fundamental to the purposes of a university.

University of Waikato faculty are encouraged to deposit the full text of their peer-reviewed academic publications into the University's digital repository, Research Commons. Research Commons has been increasing the visibility and impact of the University’s research activities by making journal articles, conference papers, book chapters, theses and other research work available open access.

Matt McGregor, from Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand based at the Royal Society of New Zealand, says this is an important move by the University of Waikato. “This is a great achievement by Waikato. In passing the mandate, they join other world-class institutions from all over the world in ensuring that the public has free and open access to Waikato's high quality research.”

Mr McGregor says the University of Waikato is leading the way for the New Zealand tertiary sector.

“Waikato University produces an enormous amount of innovative, ground-breaking research. It's great to see the university commit to making this research available to the public.”
