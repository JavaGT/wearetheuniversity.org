Waikato University Finds Its Mystery Man

Efforts to identify and track down the final member of the Class of 1960 for the University of Waikato School of Education’s 50th anniversary celebrations later this year have paid off.

Trevor Brown, who now lives in Auckland, has confirmed he was part of the first-ever intake of 173 trainee teachers to the University of Waikato’s School of Education – then known as the Hamilton Teachers’ College Department of Education.

The University put out a media appeal for information about the mystery man, but Brown was finally tracked down thanks to some intrepid detective work cross-matching data from the old College records and the electoral roll.

Brown, who’s originally from Te Kuiti, enrolled at Hamilton Teachers’ College for the 1960 intake but had to defer his second year until 1962 as a result of an accident on the family farm involving a portable milling saw.

“Trevor has confirmed he was in the photo, looking somewhat like a ‘stuffed shirt’ he thought!” says Terry Stowers, himself part of the 1960 intake, who’s set himself the task of naming everyone in the class photos from 1960, 1961 and 1962. “He wasn’t aware of the planned reunion, and certainly didn’t realise he was a wanted man.”

But Stowers’ task is still not over. There are still another 22 people to be named in the 1961 class intake photo, and a number of others for whom he has names but no contact details.

He’s urging anyone who enrolled at Waikato for teacher training while the Teachers’ College was still based in Melville to contact him as soon as possible. “We want as many people as possible to come to the reunion being held in November, so we’d love to hear from anyone who was part of that group.”

**_If you or someone you know was part of the student intake at the then Hamilton Teachers’ College in 1960 or 1961, please contact Terry Stowers in New Plymouth at terryst@orcon.net.nz_**
