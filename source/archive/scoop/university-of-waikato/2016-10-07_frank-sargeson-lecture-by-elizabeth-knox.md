_Fiction as blender and centrifuge, as the weather inside the house, as maelstrom and wormhole. What we hope it can do to and for us, and where it can take us. In this lecture, the novelist, essayist, and memoirist Elizabeth Knox will talk about the freedoms and strictures of fiction and non-fiction. She’ll explore the notions of subject-matter, audience, and authenticity – then she’ll kick them around the room and talk about getting away with writing crazy stuff, and why anyone would want to. Elizabeth is the author of twelve novels and three novellas._
