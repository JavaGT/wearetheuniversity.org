Brigadier to teach intensive law paper at Waikato

  
The head of legal services at the New Zealand Defence Force will teach a two-day intensive law paper at Waikato University in the middle of the year.

Brigadier Kevin Riordan, the Director General of Defence Legal Services will be at Waikato University in early July, teaching an intensive masters level paper in international criminal law. It’s aimed at masters-level law students, but would also be suitable for people in the armed forces, lawyers, staff in government departments or even police who sometimes find themselves stationed overseas.

Brigadier Riordan’s topic covers international criminal law as derived from legal developments in the past century, and will look at crimes such as torture, sexual violence, use of child soldiers and terror attacks on the civilian population.

He has served in the Middle East, Bosnia, Afghanistan, the Pacific and South East Asia, and has provided advice on all major peacekeeping deployments involving the New Zealand Defence Force.

Waikato University Law School Associate Professor Claire Breen says the two-day paper is part of a suite of four similar papers being taught in late June and early July. The others cover laws of armed conflict, terrorism and international law, and peacekeeping and international law.

Brigadier Riordan’s paper takes place on July 2 and 3. For more information and course cost, email: barbaraw\[at\]waikato.ac.nz.
