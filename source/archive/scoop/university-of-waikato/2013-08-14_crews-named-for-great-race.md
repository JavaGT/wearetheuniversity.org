The Schick Construction University of Cambridge is returning for the seventh time to compete against Caniwi Capital University of Waikato, and reigning champions Foster Construction University of Sydney.

The Caniwi Capital University of Waikato men’s crew includes U23 World Rowing champions Shaun Kirkham, Finn Howard, coxswain Caleb Shepherd and Giacomo Thomas alongside Richard Harrison, Mackenzie Mackie, Paddy McInnes and elite rowers Tobias Wehr-Candler, Jade Uru, and Fergus Fauvel.

Many of the rowers are Sir Edmund Hillary Scholars. The Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme is the most prestigious scholarship offered by the University of Waikato. Students on the programme have their course fees covered, receive specialist coaching and mentoring and take part in personal development and leadership programmes.
