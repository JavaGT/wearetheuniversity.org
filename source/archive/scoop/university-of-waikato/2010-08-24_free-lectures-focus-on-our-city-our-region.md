**Free lectures focus on Our City, Our Region**  

Our City, Our Region is at the heart of a series of free public lectures throughout September at the University of Waikato.

The Spring Lecture Series runs for five weeks and sees different experts discuss a range of topics from development opportunities in the Waikato region to population ageing.

To kick off the lecture series on Wednesday September 1, Labour MP Nanaia Mahuta will discuss the development opportunities that exist in the Waikato region and the gains to be made through seeking engagement with Māori and local iwi.

She is followed on September 7 by Waikato Management School’s Associate Professor Stuart Locke who will look at pathways to sustainable prosperity for the Waikato. He will identify critical issues for the region, including education, governance, resource management, infrastructure and sustainability, and suggest options for advancement.

The CEO of WEL Networks, Dr Julian Elder, will give the third lecture in the series on September 15. Dr Elder will examine new global initiatives aimed at making better use of resources and improving services.

September 22 will see Waikato University’s Population Studies Centre director Professor Natalie Jackson consider the demographic challenges and opportunities in the Waikato region. Her talk will focus on population ageing.
