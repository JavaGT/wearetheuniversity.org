Attitudes on gender and leadership in New Zealand

  
Attitudes towards leaders because of their gender can cause disparities between the success of men and women leaders. This forms the basis of a research project being conducted by a University of Waikato masters student.

Tara Roopra is looking into peoples’ attitudes towards male and female leaders in New Zealand as part of her Master of Applied Organisational Psychology.

“Of late there has been a lot of talk about unconscious bias in the workplace, which is different from blatant sexism and has been found to create a male advantage which affects women pursuing leadership in other countries,” says Ms Roopra.

“What’s needed in New Zealand is research that maps out the difference between what we say compared to what we actually think. New Zealand is a country that has prided itself on equality and of being a world leader in the women’s suffrage. Therefore this research is needed to assess attitudes in New Zealand towards men and women as leaders in the 21 st century.”

Ms Roopra is studying within the Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences under the supervision of Dr Maree Roche and Associate Professor Nicola Starkey.

She is seeking participants to assist her with her research who are at least 16 years of age and are currently in some form of paid employment in New Zealand. Participation in the research is completely anonymous and can be done online.

“Participants can follow a link which will take them to the start of the study, they will be asked to complete a word association task followed by a leadership questionnaire and finally a short demographic survey,” she says.
