Professor Moltzen’s areas of expertise include special education, inclusive education, teaching, learning and the curriculum and human development. In 2005 he was awarded the Prime Minister’s Supreme Tertiary Teaching Excellence Award.

As the new Dean, Professor Moltzen is keen to continue enhancing the Faculty’s strong research culture. His own experience includes leading numerous Ministry of Education research and development contracts.

“The Faculty of Education is highly regarded nationally and internationally for it the quality of its teaching, research, and professional learning and development programmes,” Professor Moltzen says. “Many new opportunities exist for us to build on this work and to enhance our reputation as a world leader in education.
