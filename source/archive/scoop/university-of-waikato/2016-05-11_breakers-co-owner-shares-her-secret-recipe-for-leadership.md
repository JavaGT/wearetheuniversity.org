**Breakers co-owner shares her secret recipe for successful business leadership**

What can you do to make your business as successful as the SkyCity Breakers basketball team? The professional sports team owner Liz Blackwell will reveal the culture and leadership of the Breakers at a free public lecture at the University of Waikato on 27 May.

Mr and Mrs Blackwell have reinvigorated New Zealand basketball since making their investment in the Breakers 11 years ago. With their mentoring and support, the Breakers have developed a reputation for being New Zealand’s most successful sporting franchise both on and off the basketball court.

The team has won four Australian NBL Championship titles in the last five years. And it’s not unusual for the top players of the team to credit their success to the support they’ve received from the owners.

The Breakers team is founded on values that come from the Blackwell family which have enabled the team to become well-respected by Kiwis.

Mrs Blackwell’s vision is to use the vehicle of sport to influence young people in the community, and her philanthropy is far reaching. The Breakers have donated over 15,000 basket balls to over 258 schools. The team also mentors businesses nationwide to share their values and successful ingredients to success.

The Breakers isn’t the only business Mrs Blackwell has a hand in. She also owns New Zealand’s largest supermarket Albany Pak N’ Save, a publishing company named PQ Blackwell and a major shareholder of a book publisher.
