**University marine bike ride part of SeaWeek activities**

The University’s Coastal Marine Field Station staff will lead a coastal bike ride ‘with a difference’ as part of the Marine Station’s annual Open Day on Saturday 7 March in Tauranga.

The family friendly bike ride is part of the national Seaweek and will follow trails around the harbour coastline, and parts of Waikareao Estuary. En route, the University’s Professor Chris Battershill will talk about the area’s biodiversity and numerous ecological points of interest.

Between 12.00-3.00pm, the Marine Station will be open for people to come and learn more about the Bay of Plenty’s thriving marine environment.

Professor Battershill said the open day activities were a chance to engage with the community about what’s going on in our coastal environment, and look at things from a different perspective.

Meet at 9.45am at the Coastal Marine Field Station, Cross Road, Sulphur Point for a 10.00 start.

To register for the ride, please email Nyree Sherlock nyree@waikato.ac.nz (07) 5775376 or (027)286-7454

Seaweek activities run throughout New Zealand from 1-9 March.
