**Fluoridation in Hamilton – Waikato University Q+A Panel**

The University of Waikato is hosting a Google Hangout Q&A session on Monday (14 October) where the public can direct questions to a university panel of experts on the topic “Fluoridation in Hamilton”.

Whether or not to add fluoride to the Hamilton water supply has been a hotly debated topic within the local community over the past few months. The council voted in June to end fluoridation of its water supply but later decided to hold a non-binding referendum at the October local elections.

Regardless of whether local residents have made up their minds on the issue or not, many questions still remain.

The university expert panel is made up of Dr Graham Saunders, Senior Lecturer (inorganic chemistry), Dr Joseph Lane, Senior Lecturer (physical and theoretical chemistry), Dr Michael Mucalo, Senior Lecturer (physical chemistry), Dr Carrie Barber, Clinical Psychology Graduate Programme Director and Dr Alison Campbell, Senior Lecturer (biological sciences).

The Google Hangout is from 12-1pm NZST on Monday, 14 October 2013.  
Watch the Hangout at http://www.waikato.ac.nz/events/hangout/fluoride.shtml  
Send questions to the panel via the university’s Facebook page at facebook.com/waikatouniversity, on Twitter using the hashtag **#uowhangout** or find us on Google+. Once the hangout has started, people will also be able to ask questions via the comments section on the YouTube live hangout.  
The complete hangout will be uploaded to our YouTube channel to watch after it ends – youtube.com/universitywaikato.
