**Winter Lecture Series gets underway**

  
The University of Waikato’s popular Winter Lecture Series gets underway on August 7 with “An Unexpected Result: The Business of Hobbits”. Tourism heads and researchers discuss the benefits to the region of having parts of the _Lord of the Rings_ and _The Hobbit_ movies filmed here. The speakers are Hamilton & Waikato Tourism head Kiri Goulter, Matamata PR Association manager Sue Whiting and the University’s Dr Carolyn Michelle, who has been carrying out worldwide research on perceptions of and reactions to _The Hobbit_. This is the first of four lectures that will be on every Wednesday evening in August. The lectures bring together the latest university research and experts from the community to promote robust discussion on a series of topics.

Subsequent weeks feature lectures on mental health, education and the arts.

The Winter Lecture Series is held in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts. Lectures run 6-7pm, are free and open to the public. For more information, visit http://www.waikato.ac.nz/events/lecture-series/winter-lectures.shtml
