A Hamilton musician has landed a scholarship that covers her uni fees and will help develop her talents as an artist.

Zoe Lapwood, head girl at St Paul’s Collegiate last year, is the recipient of a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship from the University of Waikato – an all-fees paying scholarship that supports students in a chosen discipline, and provides mentoring, personal development and leadership opportunities while they study.

The scholarships are awarded on the basis of leadership, academic excellence, and achievement in a sport or creative and performing art.

Zoe received the scholarship for her musical talents – a discipline she started at the age of seven.

“I was classically trained when I started but in my high school years I became interested in contemporary music. I’ve always loved music and my passion for songwriting came about when I was involved in the Play It Strange competitions.”

She has been taking piano, guitar and singing lessons since primary school, and has spent the last five years working on songwriting.

“I was a finalist in the Lion Foundation Songwriting competition for three years running, and a runner-up in their Peace Songwriting competition. I’ve also performed in the Beatles and Rolling Stones tribute concert in Auckland Town Hall alongside former Opshop front man Jason Kerrison.”

Playing and performing has led to a number of successes, with Zoe being awarded the Adastra Foundation Scholarship for songwriting. She’s also performed on radio, and has professionally recorded several of her songs on CD.

She also got a spot in the limelight at Easter weekend last week, singing the national anthem at the women’s Black Sticks vs Canada hockey match.

Zoe has already started her first semester at the University of Waikato, studying towards a conjoint degree in law and management. She says the Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme is the right pathway for her to concentrate on both her music and studies.

“The Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme will provide me with the support to continue my music and cover the cost of my fees while I study so that’s got to be good.”
