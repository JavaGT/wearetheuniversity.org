New scholarship for Pacific students

New scholarship for Pacific students

  
Pacific people with leadership potential are being encouraged to apply for a new University of Waikato scholarship funded by the estate of the late Morrinsville accountant and farmer Edna Money.

  
The Edna Money Future Pacific Leaders’ Scholarship will provide support for students to achieve academically and develop leadership skills through a tailored leadership and personal development programme.

  
Three scholarships will be offered each year for students undertaking fulltime study. The scholarships are worth $6000 per year for up to three years.

  
They are being funded from a $1 million bequest from the estate of Edna Money, who died last year aged 94.

  
She was a Morrinsville farm owner, accountant and philanthropist and is thought to be one of New Zealand’s first female qualified accountants.

  
The bequest has become part of the University’s Endowment Fund with the interest earned funding the scholarships.

  
Senior Policy Advisor Pacific, Elena Fa’amoe-Timoteo says the financial support offered by the scholarships will be hugely beneficial to the scholarship recipients but the leadership programme will  
provide much wider spin offs.

  
“Having that tailored leadership and personal development programme will help Pacific students develop as leaders and that will benefit entire communities for many years to come,” she says.

  
Applicants should be New Zealand citizens or permanent residents, of Pacific Island descent and enrolling at the University of Waikato for the first time in 2015.

  
Scholarship applications are open until 3 November and more information, including how to apply, is available at:
