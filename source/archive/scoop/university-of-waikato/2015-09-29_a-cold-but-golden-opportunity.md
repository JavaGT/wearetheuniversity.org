**A cold but golden opportunity**

A high-achieving University of Waikato student is preparing for the internship of a lifetime; travelling to Antarctica in February as an Antarctic Youth Ambassador with The Sir Peter Blake Trust and Antarctica New Zealand.

When in Antarctica, Nick Humphries will develop e-learning web applications to help educate future Antarctic travellers about health and safety and environmental considerations.

“From a very young age, I’ve had a passion for software and programming and I want to tie that in with my other passion; the environment. This is an opportunity that enables me to take that first step,” says the former Fiordland College student.

Nick was one of ten students to be awarded a Golden Jubilee School Leaver Scholarship in 2014 to mark the University’s 50th anniversary. These scholarships were awarded to students who demonstrated a high level of academic excellence, leadership potential and community involvement.

Nick is well-known within The Sir Peter Blake Trust, having previously travelled to the Kermadec Islands to assist with the Department of Conservation’s resupply of the island. He’s also helped run their annual Youth Enviro-leaders conference in Rotorua.

“None of this is paid work, but I’m not too worried because I’m being paid in experience, which is so important these days,” he says.

Although studying so far away from home might be daunting for many people, Nick has no regrets about choosing the University of Waikato to study a Bachelor of Engineering, and has enjoyed his first year in Hamilton.

“I’m glad I received the scholarship and came here,” he says. “Waikato has a very positive environment, especially for new students.”
