Royal Society honour for leading Māori scholar at Waikato University

A leading social scientist and Māori scholar at the University of Waikato has been recognised for her work at the Royal Society of New Zealand 2012 Research Honours event held in Auckland last night \[Wednesday November 21\].

Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Pro Vice-Chancellor Māori and Dean of the School of Māori and Pacific Development, was awarded the Dame Joan Metge Medal for her outstanding contribution in inspiring, mentoring and developing the capacity of Māori researchers through teaching and research.

Professor Smith is nationally and internationally recognised as a scholar and trailblazer who has inspired and mentored many Māori and non Māori social scientists. She has worked across disciplines and been responsible for redefining areas of study. Her book Decolonising Methodologies has had a profound influence across the social sciences and has also influenced the humanities and sciences.

Professor Smith has led the development of three Māori research institutes including Ngā Pae O Te Māramatanga Centre for Research Excellence at the University of Auckland, and is now the Director of Te Kotahi Research Institute at the University of Waikato.

“It is always great to be acknowledged by a community of peers and it is especially good as someone who works in the field of kaupapa Māori research to be acknowledged,” says Professor Smith.

The Dame Joan Metge Medal is awarded for excellence and building relationships in the social science research community. Professor Janet Holmes FRSNZ, Chair in Linguistics, Victoria University of Wellington, was also a recipient of the medal for her outstanding contribution to linguistics
