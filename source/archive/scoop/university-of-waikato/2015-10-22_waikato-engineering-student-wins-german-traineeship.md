**Waikato engineering student wins German traineeship**

A University of Waikato engineering student is in Germany after being selected for an all-expenses-paid traineeship at the University of Stuttgart.

Former Hamilton Girls’ High School student Rochelle Molina says she feels lucky to receive a placement with the International Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical Experience (IAESTE).

“Originally I had my doubts about going overseas because I was so busy, but these kinds of opportunities are very rare so I’m definitely excited,” Rochelle says.  
The traineeship acts as Rochelle’s work placement for her Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree.

The third-year student will be overseas until January researching chemical absorption processes and gas cleaning techniques during combustion. The traineeship covers accommodation and living expenses as well as remuneration for her work.

“I’m looking forward to trying different aspects of science and engineering,” she says. “Working in Germany will give me such a different perspective on things.”

Rochelle wanted to study at Waikato because it was close to home and offered courses that focused on all of the science subjects she loved at school.

“I did all the sciences in year 13 and I loved all of them,” she says. “The lecturers at Waikato are really approachable which makes the learning environment positive and supportive.”

Last summer, Rochelle completed a Summer Research Scholarship at Waikato, working in partnership with Golden Koi Industries GP Limited. Her research focused on ways to improve the purity of the collagen that gets extracted from the scales of koi carp.

Rochelle was one of 12 national finalists for the 2014 Eureka! Sir Paul Callaghan Awards, where she presented her research to a public audience and business professionals.

“I didn’t win a special award in the finals but being chosen as a finalist was a great experience,” she says. “I’m now part of the Eureka! alumni community helping promote the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in New Zealand.”

University of Waikato Summer Research Scholarships provide promising undergraduate, final-year honours and first-year master’s degree students the opportunity to experience the challenges and rewards of research. The scholarships are offered in various disciplines from November to February.
