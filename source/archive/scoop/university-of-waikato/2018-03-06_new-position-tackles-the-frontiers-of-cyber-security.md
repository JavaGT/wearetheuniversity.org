New position tackles the frontiers of cyber security

  
The University of Waikato is breaking new ground in cyber security, establishing a new Professorial role that will focus on risk assessment research and delivery, in partnership with a leading Australasian company.

  
Aura Information Security, an independent division of Kordia Ltd, has joined forces with the University to identify cyber threats and prevent potentially catastrophic breaches. The search is underway for exceptional candidates to fill the Aura Professor of Cyber Security position.

  
The University of Waikato has an international reputation for security research, through the New Zealand Institute for Security and Crime Science and its role in the joint Centre for Evidence Based Policing in Wellington, as well as offering Master’s degrees in Security and Crime Science, as well as in Cyber Security.

  
The University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Neil Quigley says the ability for academics to work with industry is vital to growing cyber security capability. “Increasing the focus on the latest in risk assessment with a high-calibre appointment will contribute to the research and teaching already being done at Waikato, as well as changing the cyber landscape.”

Aura’s General Manager Peter Bailey says they are excited about the opportunity to work more closely with the University. “The constant cross-pollination of ideas between academic institutions and commercial business is essential to keep ahead of the rapidly evolving cyber security landscape. This is a unique opportunity to bring these two approaches together."

  
The University of Waikato is ranked in the top 1.1% of universities worldwide and is the university of choice for more than 12,000 students each year. Its researchers are providing unique perspectives on issues of importance to contemporary society, and answers to some of the key problems being faced by industries, governments and nations around the world.
