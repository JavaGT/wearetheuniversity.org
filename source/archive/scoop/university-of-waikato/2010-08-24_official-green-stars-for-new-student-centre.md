Official green stars for new Student Centre
===========================================

**Official green stars for new Student Centre**  

Waikato University’s new Student Centre was officially awarded a five-star rating at a ceremony held on August 19.

The New Zealand Green Building Council presented the university with a certificate, awarded for the environmental and sustainable features of the Student Centre design. It is the first building in the region to be awarded five-stars.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the five-star award is a significant achievement as the Student Centre demonstrates how the university is creating an exceptional experience for students and staff.

“Building sustainably demonstrates how the university is investing in the future,” says Professor Crawford. “Sustainability is a key driver of this university and the Student Centre is a physical manifestation of how we are applying our core values to benefit students, staff and the wider community.”

The $30 million project to turn the existing university Library into a state-of-the-art multifunctional facility is due for completion in mid-2011. The Student Centre will be the social heart of the university campus with places to meet, cafés, shops and relaxation spaces.
