University Nightglow event supports Earth Hour

University Nightglow event supports Earth Hour

  
Waikato University is preparing to again welcome thousands of people for the annual Balloons over Waikato NightGlow event on March 28.

The NightGlow is the culmination of the Balloons over Waikato event, which sees thousands of people flood onto the university’s sports fields to watch the tethered hot air balloons inflate to music.

This year, that’s followed by the international Earth Hour, where people in cities all around the world are encouraged to turn off their lights for an hour to show what could be achieved on global warming. That runs from 8.30pm-9.30pm after the inflation and fireworks have finished.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the university is keen to engage with the Waikato community through events such as this. The university’s health and safety co-ordinator is running health and safety for the entire Balloons event.

And with sustainability as one of Waikato University’s distinctive factors, Prof Crawford is pleased the organisation is able to support Earth Hour.

“We’re a big supporter of looking after the environment and saving energy – it’s something we practice year-round,” he says. “However, we want to make sure we’re being responsible hosts for the NightGlow and Earth Hour, so we will leave some lighting on for people to move around and get home safely.”

Prof Crawford says the university gives a lot of thought about how to save energy, and encourages staff to switch off lights and computers when not in use.

In 2003, the university used a $400,000 loan from the Energy Efficiency Conservation Authority to fund an upgrade of heating, ventilation and airconditioning control systems. “We had aimed to recoup that initial investment through energy savings over six years. By the end of last year, I’m pleased to say that we had already made nearly $900,000 in energy savings – five years into the six-year target.”

The annual Balloons over Waikato NightGlow and Earth Hour takes place on Saturday March 28 on the sports fields at Waikato University. Entertainment begins at 4pm; balloons inflate after 8pm and finish with fireworks at 8.25pm. Earth Hour then runs until 9.30pm. Some roads around the university will be closed, and Environment Waikato is providing several free shuttle buses so people can park-and–ride. Gate 1 (Knighton Rd) and Gate 10 (Silverdale Rd) will be open for parking. For more information: www.balloonsoverwaikato.co.nz
