**High performance squad selection for Nicole**

University of Waikato Hillary scholar Nicole van der Kaay is one of nine athletes selected for Triathlon New Zealand’s 2015 High Performance Squad.

“It’s quite surreal,” says the 18-year-old. “I’m the only junior in the squad.”

From Taupō, the former Taupō Nui A Tia College student has just finished the first year of a Bachelor of Science at Waikato University. She is flatting with friends in Cambridge, and spends hours a day training, making the most of the facilities at the Avantidrome for biking, gym and physio, as well as swimming training in the St Peter’s School pool, and running.

“I love everything about triathlons; the adventure, the thrill, the challenge and pushing the limits. I love meeting and training with like-minded people.”

Nicole started taking part in triathlons when she was at Taupō Intermediate School and carried on at high school. She is now part of the Pathway to Podium programme where athletes receive early education in areas such as nutrition, mental skills and strength and conditioning training.

Last year she was selected for the 2013 Elite Junior World Championships in London, and says it was a great learning experience. She was also selected for the elite champs this year but due to injury, had to withdraw.

She now hopes to be ready for the Kinloch Triathlon in February and a few other races that are qualifiers for next year’s Worlds in Chicago, looking ahead to the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.

Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarships are the University of Waikato’s most prestigious scholarships and are awarded to high academic achievers who are also achieving in the arts or sport. Scholars have their course fees covered, receive specialist coaching and mentoring and take part in personal development and leadership programmes.
