Waikato University set for Kīngitanga Day
=========================================

**Waikato University set for Kīngitanga Day**

  
On Wednesday April 21 the University of Waikato celebrates Kīngitanga Day – an annual celebration of the relationship between the University and the Kīngitanga.

The University of Waikato has had strong connections with the Kīngitanga and Tainui since the university was founded in 1964 and it is this distinctive relationship that the university honours each year through Kīngitanga Day.

Launched last year, Kīngitanga Day is an opportunity for staff and students to celebrate the university’s distinctive heritage, histories and relationships. Classes will be cancelled for the day to give staff and students the chance to participate in the range of activities.

Activities for the event include seminars, panel discussions and presentations from guest speakers and leading academics. Weaving and craft workshops, Māori merchandise and food stalls and a range of entertainment are also planned, including live kapa haka performances and the Waikato Student Union Kīngitanga Royal Carnival.

Kīngitanga Day is held on the King’s birthday; he and his whānau are due to spend the day on campus.  
Celebrations for Kīngitanga Day take place 9am-3.30pm on April 21, with all activities free and open to the public. For more information visit http://www.waikato.ac.nz/events/kingitanga/
