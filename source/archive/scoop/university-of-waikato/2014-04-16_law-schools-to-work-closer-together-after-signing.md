Law Schools to work closer together after signing

The University of Waikato’s Te Piringa - Faculty of Law has signed a letter of intent with the School of Law at China’s Yantai University.

The agreement was signed by University of Waikato Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Alister Jones during a visit to China in early April and sets out ways in which the two institutions will explore opportunities for cooperation.

The agreement also opens the door for students to study at each other’s law school.

Professor Jones says the letter of intent further strengthens the University of Waikato’s already strong links with international universities and will create opportunities for researchers and students from both countries.

The University of Waikato already has agreements with more than 100 universities, reflecting its international connectedness.

Te Piringa – Faculty of Law Dean Professor Brad Morse says he is excited to take the first steps in what he hopes will become a long and mutually beneficial relationship with the “highly regarded” School of Law at Yantai University.

“We are looking forward to hosting law students and visiting scholars from Yantai Law School as well as encouraging our students to study at Yantai and our colleagues to pursue research collaborations with its academic staff,” he says.

“My colleague, Dr Zhixiong Liao, deserves the credit for nurturing this relationship.”

Yantai University was established in 1984 with help from China’s two most prestigious universities, Peking University and Tsinghua University and has about 24,000 students.

In the latest QS Subject rankings, released in February, Te Piringa – Faculty of Law was ranked among the top 150 law schools in the world.
