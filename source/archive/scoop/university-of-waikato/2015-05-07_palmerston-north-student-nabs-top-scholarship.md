A Palmerston North student is one five people to be awarded a $10,000 Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship for 2015.

Hine Te Arorangi Kawana says it’s a real honour, especially as it coincides with the 100th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings.

“I feel proud and hugely appreciative,” she says. “It means a lot to me and my family.”

Hine Te Arorangi is in her first year studying a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Psychology at the University of Waikato. She says the scholarship will be a huge financial help towards her studies.

Growing up, Hine Te Arorangi was heavily involved in her local community. She was a senior leader for her kapa haka group Te Piringa and was often described as an “older sister” to many “I was actually quite shy as kid and would often stand back and just analyse people and their actions,” she says. “This inspired me to explore a career in psychology because I wanted to know why people did certain things.”

To apply for the award, students had to write an essay explaining how their characteristics aligned with those of the 28th Māori Battalion soldiers.

“The characteristic of manaakitanga, caring for others, really stood out to me as it reflects my community upbringing and aspiration to be a psychologist working with youth,” she says.

Hine Te Arorangi enjoyed writing her application. “It was a unique experience to put down on paper all the things I believe in and have succeeded in.”

Although it was a shock at first, Hine Te Arorangi (Rangitāne, Ngāti Raukawa, Te Arawa, Ngā Wairiki, Te Ati-hau-nui-a-Papārangi) has found her transition into university life easy with help from the Māori Students’ Association, Te Waiora o Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato.

“I love being involved in kapa haka again and I have received so much help and support with my studies and meeting new people,” she says.

The Ngārimu VC and 28th (Māori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship fund was established to promote and support Māori education and is administered by the Ministry of Education.
