New Tauranga-based degree on offer

A new Tauranga-based pathway to a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with the University of Waikato is expected to attract a first year intake of up to 60 students and a second year intake of up to 40 students next month. (SUBS February 2010)

The new degree pathway is open to students who enrol at Bay of Plenty Polytechnic in the Diploma in Applied Computing Level 5 (DipAppCompL5) and then Level 6 (DipAppCompL6) following the prescribed degree pathway. If successful, these students will be guaranteed entry to their third (final) degree year at the University of Waikato based in Tauranga.

Up to 40 students who have already completed the Diploma in Information and Communications Technology Level 5 who enrol for a second year of Diploma studies this year in approved degree pathway courses will be eligible for their third degree year at Waikato starting next year.

This is the latest degree pathway to be established at Tauranga under the deed of co-operation signed by the University of Waikato and Bay of Plenty Polytechnic in 2006 to strengthen their commitment to work together to provide high-quality tertiary education and research in the Bay of Plenty region.

Other degree level courses offered in Tauranga under the arrangement include a Bachelor of Tourism, Bachelor of Teaching (Early Childhood Education), Bachelor of Business Analysis and a Bachelor of Management Studies. A Bachelor of Social Work is also available at the university’s Tauranga campus.

There were 781 University of Waikato students studying papers towards formal programmes in Tauranga in 2009, representing an increase in enrolments of 33% from the previous year.

University of Waikato Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Doug Sutton says, “Together with the Polytechnic, we are committed to provide education to meet the growing needs of the region.

“The programmes offered through our partnership enable students to staircase seamlessly between the two institutions from entry level qualifications to degrees. This is a unique relationship that combines the strengths of our two institutions to address identified skill shortages as well as to provide pathways to life-long learning opportunities in the Bay.”
