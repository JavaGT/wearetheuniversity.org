Savvy science goes live

Anything you ever wanted to know about earthquakes, icy ecosystems, body imaging or the role of science in sport will be just a mouse-click away with the launch of a world-first Science Learning Hub, developed at the University of Waikato.

The hub, to be launched tonight (July 2) in Wellington by the Minister of Research, Science and Technology, Steve Maharey, aims to make science come alive for year nine and ten students, by linking science subjects to students’ everyday lives on the online site.

The country’s new, high speed Kiwi Research and Education Advanced Network (KAREN) will also be showcased with live streaming of the hub launch to conferences of biology teachers in Wellington and chemistry teachers in Auckland, and to physics teachers in Dunedin later in the week.

The Science Learning Hub, which links research organisations and schools, takes a multi-media approach to science with easy-to-access video clips of scientists, animations, demonstrations, and up-to-date information and data. Material includes teacher and student resources.

It is the brainchild of the University of Waikato’s Wilf Malcolm Institute of Educational Research and its Centre for Science and Technology Educational Research (CSTER), which have developed the site in collaboration with a national team comprising groups of science and science education experts in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

Dean of the University’s School of Education Professor Alister Jones says the Hub is a world-first.

“It links our world-class science research directly to New Zealand teachers and students. What makes this website unique is that all the content has been specifically developed to support the science curriculum in New Zealand. It’s focused on providing content at the right learning and interest level for students, as well as providing useful teaching tools for classroom teachers,” he said.

“Unlike information that can be gleaned through various web search engines, our content has been developed and reviewed by the top scientists and science educators in their fields. This means students and teachers can have confidence that the information is up-to-date and impartial.”

The Science Learning Hub is based on the highly successful Biotechnology Learning Hub, which was developed by the Wilf Malcolm Institute of Educational Research and CSTER over the last three years.

It will go live to schools in late July or early August initially with four topics: earthquakes, body imaging, icy ecosystems and the role of science in sport, with more topics to be added.

The Government has committed ongoing funding of $2 million a year for the development of a wide range of online resources and expansion to year 11-13 students, and the University of Waikato’s School of Education, recently ranked first in the Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) assessment, will continue to manage the project.

Professor Jones says recent research, commissioned by the Ministry for Research, Science and Technology, into why students choose to study science or opt out highlighted the need for contemporary, New Zealand-based teaching and learning resources.

“We believe the Science Learning Hub will be a very useful tool and will help students to connect what they’re learning in science with its relevance in the world,” Professor Jones said.

“If New Zealand is to achieve its aspiration to be a knowledge-driven society, it is extremely important students understand the important contribution science makes to so many areas.”
