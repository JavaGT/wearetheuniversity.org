**Focus on fracking in law talk**

A visiting law expert will use the controversial fracking process to demonstrate how the use of sustainable development law is evolving to deal with technological change.

Professor Emeritus Charles Marvin from Georgia State University College of Law in Atlanta will deliver his lecture on 16 September at the University of Waikato.

He is a widely published scholar in constitutional, administrative, comparative, public international, environmental and international trade law and is currently a visiting professor at Riga (Latvia) Graduate School of Law in Comparative Constitutional Law and International Trade Law.

His lecture will explain how sustainable development laws are evolving to deal with changes in technology by using fracking as an example of a problematic economic activity.

The lecture is on Tuesday, 16 September at 1pm in A.G.11 at the University of Waikato.
