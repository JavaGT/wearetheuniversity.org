By gully – popular course returns

  
A hugely popular free series on Hamilton gully restoration returns in April – featuring field trips, lectures, boat trips, weed walks and the chance to listen to bats.

Waikato University’s Continuing Education department once again teams up with Hamilton City Council to present the Gully Restoration Series from April 23 to May 30. Last year the series attracted about 300 people.

Hamilton City has more than 5000 pieces of land either within or joining the city’s gullies and natural areas, says the council’s Environmental Policy Adviser, Tim Newton. He says gullies make up 8% of the city area (more than 700ha) and 90% of them are privately owned.

Mr Newton says it’s heartening to see Hamiltonians have embraced the concept of restoring and caring for the city’s gullies. The council’s gully database has grown from nothing in 2000, to 900 members today.

All the sessions are aimed at people planning to embark upon restoration, although those with a general interest are also welcome. University lecturers such as Professor Bruce Clarkson, an expert on restoration ecology, will speak at the introductory lecture, and the university’s Centre for Biodiversity and Ecology Research has also been involved in the planning.

The gully series introductory lecture on April 23 looks at the big picture of gully restoration. “What are we talking about when we look at gully restoration, and what kinds of ecosystems, plants, insects, fish, birds and bats do we have in our gullies?,” Mr Newton says.

Other lectures include a planning session where participants receive an aerial photo of their land and can start planning their gully restoration with the help restoration and design experts.

Mr Newton says people can pick and choose the sessions they’d like to attend. They include a range of field trips to private gullies and walkways; a boat trip along the Waikato River, the city’s biggest gully; a visit to the council’s nursery and university’s herbarium; a trip looking at birds in gullies and how to control rats; a workshop on building steps or tracks, and a walk identifying weeds.

With the exception of the boat trip up the Waikato River which costs $20, all the lectures and trips are free, although registration is essential and numbers are limited on some trips. Priority is given to gully owners and those wanting to help with restorations.
