An examination of homelessness in New Zealand and an inquiry into why young people enjoy violent videogames are among seven projects by University of Waikato researchers to receive support from the Marsden Fund, New Zealand’s funding for ideas-driven research.

The Marsden Fund has announced it will distribute $39.1 million to fund 78 new research projects nationwide, 26 of which are Fast-Start grants for outstanding new researchers. The funding will be spread over two to three years, depending on the project.

“Applications to the Fund are very competitive; with only a small percentage of the total number of applications successful,”said Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford. “I am delighted with the quality and range of University projects that have been funded this year; they constitute some very exciting research, with important applications socially, culturally and environmentally.”

The Marsden Fund-supported projects at Waikato University are:

\- “Interlingual digital libraries for language learning,” Professor Ian Whitten, Computer Science Department, total funding: $538,596

\- “More than bricks and mortar: Homelessness and social reintegration,” Dr Darrin Hodgetts and Ms Linda Nikora, Department of Psychology, total funding: $795,342
