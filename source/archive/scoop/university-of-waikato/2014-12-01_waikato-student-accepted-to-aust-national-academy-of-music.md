**Waikato Student Accepted into Australian National Academy of Music**  
  
Accomplished pianist and University of Waikato music student Andrew Leathwick is soon to make his mark across the ditch having just been accepted into the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM).

“I was over in Melbourne earlier this year to check out a couple of places that I was thinking of studying at next year. I really liked what I saw at ANAM, so I applied online,” says Andrew.

Following the online application, Andrew was invited to attend two auditions, one in Auckland and a second, for a selected few, in Melbourne, as well as undergo an interview with the company director.

“The second audition was rather intense. You were given a piece of music the week prior and then expected to turn up on the day and perform that piece with other musicians you had never met before.

“I was so excited when I received the email to say I had been accepted. It seems like a wonderful place to study and I’m really looking forward to being among the artistic centre that is Melbourne.”

Since the age of nine, Andrew has been playing the piano. He was part of the University of Waikato’s Accelerando Junior Music Academy under the tuition of Katherine Austin before enrolling to study in a Bachelor of Music. Andrew has recently given his final recital for his Master of Music degree, for which he received a standing ovation by the examiners.

“I always thought a lot about what it would be like to have a career in music, but it wasn't until I played _Rachmaninov_, as part of a trio through Accelerando, that it really seemed like a possible pathway. That moment really opened up the world of music to me and was a definite factor in me continuing on to study music at Waikato.”

During his time at Waikato, Andrew has been the winner of many awards and competitions, including the 46th NZ National Concerto Competition, the University of Waikato 2013 Cultural and Arts Person of the Year Award, and the Sir Edmund Hillary Medal.

Katherine Austin, Andrew’s tutor and music mentor at the University of Waikato, is extremely proud of Andrew’s achievement.

“ANAM is one of the very few music institutions in the world which fully funds students for their fees and living expenses. Places are very highly sought after, and it is testament to Andrew's exceptional gifts as a pianist and a musician and the incredibly hard and highly focussed work he has put in over his five years studying music at Waikato, that he has been offered a place in this most elite musical institution,” she says.

“Andrew is leaving his stamp on the University of Waikato, and he is likewise taking our stamp with him! We wish him every success in the world as he goes forth from here,” she adds.

Andrew’s acceptance into ANAM comes with a full scholarship covering fees and living costs and he will take up his place there in early 2015.
