**University of Waikato continues strategic partnership with Fieldays**

The University of Waikato and the NZ National Fieldays Society have signed a further agreement which sees the university enter its eighth year as a Strategic Partner of Fieldays – the largest agribusiness event in the Southern Hemisphere.

Professor Crawford says the partnership “makes sense” as both organisations have always shared a mutual interest in contributing to, and growing, the agricultural sector.

“Being a part of such an agriculturally rich region we are delighted to once again support an event which is at the forefront of agricultural innovation.

“The University has a shared interest with Fieldays in the agricultural sector, from our research which we will be showcasing, to our students who undertake internships with the many agricultural organisations and our graduates who are employed in the agricultural sector.”

Mr Calder says Fieldays is delighted to have the University on board as one of Fieldays’ two strategic partners for the next three years. “The relationship between the University and Fieldays has grown and evolved over the past eight years to the point where we now have a true partnership.”

“We’ve been working with the university over the past 18 months to look at new opportunities to create solutions and outputs that will help advance New Zealand agriculture. Our goal has been to find new ways to showcase each other’s strengths and create a year round relationship rather than just coming together for four days in June.”

“The result is a series of projects we will work on over the next three years that will see Fieldays support the university’s research and work in areas such as agribusiness, earth and water science, as well as helping build awareness of careers in agriculture and the educational pathways available. It is exciting to have a partner that is actively solving problems and providing solutions that advance agriculture, which is one Fieldays’ founding principles,” Mr Calder says.

The agribusiness showpiece takes place each June and attracts around 125,000 visitors and global media attention. This year’s Premier Feature theme is Managing Resources for a Competitive Advantage, and over the four days, the University of Waikato will showcase research which has impacts and implications on the agricultural sector.

Professor Crawford says Fieldays is not only an opportunity to showcase what the University of Waikato does for the region, but it is a chance to connect with other businesses, colleagues and alumni.

“We encourage our staff, students and the wider community to visit our site over the four days. Our researchers will be present, as well as ambassadors, so we welcome everyone to visit our site in the Premier Feature area to see how we are making a difference to land-based industries.”
