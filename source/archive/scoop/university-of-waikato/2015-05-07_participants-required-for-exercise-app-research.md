Participants required for exercise app research

  
Exercise – we either love it or we hate it. And while there’s no denying its long-term benefits, how do we best monitor and incorporate it into our daily lives?

University of Waikato Masters student Rebecca Jenkins is looking at the effectiveness of an app for establishing an exercise regime, as well as the potential positive effects of exercise on mood and “Currently we know there are many reasons to exercise, including for the prevention and reversal of many chronic physical diseases and the psychological benefits, notably low mood and depression,”

“But even when people are aware of these reasons to exercise, many still don't engage in either any or enough. Many people have an intention to do exercise but still don't engage in the health behaviour. This is known as the 'intention-behaviour gap’,” she says.

Ms Jenkins is studying towards her Masters in Psychology in the Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences under the supervision of Drs Carrie Barber and Jo Thakker. She’s chosen to focus her research on the use of exercise apps which can assist with self-regulation and self-monitoring.

“Surprisingly, although there is a prevalence of exercise apps on the market, it hasn’t been determined whether or not they are effective, therefore there’s a need to test this,” she says.

Ms Jenkins is seeking participants aged between 18 and 65 to take part in this research by following a given exercise app to the best of their abilities. The period for using the app is two months and there will be a series of questionnaires to fill out during this time.

“Towards the end I’ll be wanting to know about their experiences using the app and whether or not people liked it and/or found it useful.”

To find out more or if you would like to be involved with this research, please contact Rebecca Jenkins on 027 357 6573 or at rebecca\_jenkins@hotmail.co.nz. All research participants will be entered into the draw to win a $100 grocery voucher.
