Waikato agricultural economist wins top Australian award

An agricultural economist at the University of Waikato has been named Top Young Agronomist by the Australian Society of Agronomy.

Dr Graeme Doole, who divides his time between Waikato and the University of Western Australia, won the award for excellence in agricultural research.

Dr Doole’s research looks at ways to improve farm management systems to overcome the costs associated with environmental regulation and production constraints.

His recent work involves analysing the best use of integrated weed management to slow the development of herbicide resistance in Australian cropping systems, investigating the profitability of alternative means to reduce nitrate leaching from pastures in New Zealand, and exploring ways to reduce the environmental impact of Victorian agriculture.

Dr Doole said the award was recognition of the industry value of his research. “The award recognises my emerging contribution to agriculture throughout Australasia, and the strong influence of prominent, pragmatic scientists on my professional practice, including Professor David Pannell and Professor Ross Kingwell from the University of Western Australia and Dr Michael Robertson of the CSIRO.”

“An exciting opportunity for closer collaboration with DairyNZ has also recently emerged, through which I hope to contribute to important and topical issues that are affecting the New Zealand dairy industry.”

Dr Doole was presented with the award, worth $1,000, at the Australian Society of Agronomy conference held recently at Lincoln University.
