University Of Waikato Celebrates 13 Marsden Fund Winners
========================================================

**Tuesday, 10 November 2020, 4:40 pm**  
**Press Release: [University of Waikato](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Waikato)**

University of Waikato researchers will lead 13 new programmes supported by the Marsden Fund covering topics from the whole disciplinary spectrum.

Over the next three years, their research will help us better understand the natural world (including impacts of climate change and pollution), human health and psychology, and history.

The Marsden Fund supports researchers to work on their best and boldest ideas, to transform understanding, reveal the foundations of knowledge and to create significant impact for New Zealand and the world.

The news comes during Waikato's most successful year ever gaining research investment, including four new research programmes totalling almost $40 million funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research, Professor Bryony James, says the results are a fantastic accolade for these Waikato researchers who are pushing forward fundamental understanding.

“Coupled with our recent successes in the Endeavour Fund, and other funds operated by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, our staff are being supported to advance knowledge across all frontiers, from blue-skies enquiry to the highly applied.

“We are very proud, here at Te Whare Wānanga o Waikato, of how our research and our researchers are going to change the world.”
