**World rankings keep getting better for Waikato**

The University of Waikato has gone up again in world university rankings, climbing 14 places from 2015 and more than 80 places since 2014.

Data released today by the annual Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings show the University of Waikato is now placed 324 in the world – up from 338 in 2015. In 2014 Waikato was ranked in the 401-410 band of universities.

QS ranks universities across a range of areas including reputation, research, teaching, employability and internationalisation.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Neil Quigley says the continued rise in world rankings is a reflection of the University’s ability to adapt to a changing global tertiary landscape and prepare students for a world outside university.

“We know what a significant part rankings play in the decision making process of students, particularly international students, and we are delighted to have QS rank the university in the top 3% of all universities worldwide” says Professor Quigley.

The world rankings announcement comes after another rankings win for the University, which recently received a full five-star rating from QS. The QS Stars Rankings rates universities across a broad range of criteria, including teaching quality and satisfaction, employability, research, internationalisation, facilities, innovation and inclusiveness.

Rankings play a significant part in the perception of the University as a quality teaching and research institution. It also plays a part in reassuring students that their education from the University of Waikato is among the best internationally. It is a particularly important aspect in the decision making process of international students looking to study abroad.
