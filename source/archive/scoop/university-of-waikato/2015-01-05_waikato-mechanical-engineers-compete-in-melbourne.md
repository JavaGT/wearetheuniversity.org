**Waikato mechanical engineers compete in Melbourne**

The University of Waikato Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) team was placed 12th of 26 teams at the Formula SAE- Australasia competition in Melbourne last month.

The competition was held from 11-14 December. The placing took into account static and dynamic events, such as design, business and cost presentations, quality tests and racing events.

The team of Waikato University Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) students including fourth-year students Sam Brien, Todd Carswell, Josh McIntyre, Nick Milne, Ben Sharp and Phillip Ross, had high hopes of a top 10 finish going into the competition, yet experienced setbacks during the scrutineering test and endurance racing event.

During the first two days the team encountered difficulties in the scrutineering round, with the judges requiring the team to strengthen the chassis. “On the third day we passed and scrambled to complete noise, brake and tilt tests - all required to race in the competition,” says team leader Sam Brien.

The team passed the noise, brake and tilt tests with no changes required and were granted a run in the acceleration and skidpad (figure of eight) events, placing 8th and 15th respectively. This was followed by the autocross event, a one flying lap event, in which they placed 10th.

“The final day was the endurance event, which was by far the biggest of all the events and consisted of 22km of racing shared between two drivers.”

Each team had two chances to place their best time. “In the first heat we played it safe, driving slowly and making sure that we finished. During the second heat in the afternoon the drivers gave it everything, but the car overheated in the hot 31 degree Melbourne weather and we were unable to complete the race.”

Based on the first heat the team were placed 14th for the endurance event.

The University of Waikato was one of three New Zealand teams entered in the competition, including a team from The University of Auckland which placed third overall and a team from the University of Canterbury which placed 16th.

The Waikato Formula SAE team was formed in 2006. Each year the team builds an open wheeled single seat-style race car to compete in the Formula SAE competition. This car must comply with the rules outlined by the competition, such as a maximum 600cc engine, 20mm air inlet restrictor and limited track width and wheel base.

Formula SAE is an international competition where university students design and build their own car. Competitions are held across the world, with more than 500 universities taking part.

The team is grateful to all their sponsors with special thanks given to Stainless Design, Waikato Bearings, Progressive Group, Mainfreight Air & Ocean (Hamilton), C&R Developments and MEG.
