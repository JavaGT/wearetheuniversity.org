The scholarships cover overseas study, research or internships ranging from six weeks to two years at undergraduate or postgraduate levels at top institutions in China, Japan, Korea, India and ASEAN countries such as Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia.

Funding of $9 million over five years was provided in Budget 2013 for the Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia as part of the Government’s Internationally Focused Growth Package. In the inaugural PMSA announced in December 2013, three Waikato University students were awarded scholarships.

Applications are now open for the next round of scholarships which close on 30 March 2015.
