Performing with the very best

**Performing with the very best**

A University of Waikato Sir Edmund Hillary scholar is one of six finalists competing in Australia's third largest music competition.

Cello player Sam Lucas will fly to Melbourne at the beginning of October to compete in the Melbourne Recital Centre's Great Romantics Competition.

The competition requires performers to recite works composed between 1810 and 1900, but according to Sam there's more to it than simply learning a piece of work.

“It's more than just being accurate on stage, it's about giving the audience the experience of their lives,” he says.

Having made the cut from 200 initial entrants, Sam is under no illusion as to how difficult the competition will be to win, especially as he is the only string instrument finalist.

"There are three pianists in the final six. They generally have an edge in competitions over other instruments but I'm hoping my experience in competing helps counter this,” he says.

This experience includes Sam's recent success with the four-piece cello group Quattro, who have recently returned from a six-week tour of the United Kingdom. The trip was their reward for winning the 2014 ROSL International Chamber Music Scholarship Competition.

"It was an amazing trip. We had plenty of concerts and lessons with experts. I also had the chance to perform solo at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival; the largest arts festival in the world, so that was unforgettable,” says Sam.

If Sam is successful in Melbourne, he'll win $6000, a contract to have a CD made, and he'll be signed to further concert engagements - which is sure to boost his profile overseas.

Sam was awarded a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship because of his achievements in academia, leadership and his talents in music. The scholarship provides him with professional development opportunities and fees support.
