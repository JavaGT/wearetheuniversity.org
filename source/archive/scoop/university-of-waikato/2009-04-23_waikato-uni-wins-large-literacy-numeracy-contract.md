Waikato Uni wins large literacy, numeracy contract

  
The University of Waikato has won a three-year contract to lead and deliver professional development in adult literacy and numeracy.

The multimillion-dollar contract just announced by Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley will see Waikato University train tutors at polytechnics, wananga, private training establishments and in workplaces. They will deliver leading-edge courses for trainers and develop a knowledge base in the area of adult literacy and numeracy.

The contract between the university and the Tertiary Education Commission is worth between $3 million and $4 million in 2009 and is part of the Government’s commitments to literacy and numeracy.

Waikato University’s School of Education Dean Professor Alister Jones says the contract ensures the university can establish a national programme to help the sector build its capability and to ensure ongoing improvements in literacy and numeracy.

Most jobs have a need for literacy and numeracy but about 43% of Kiwi adults have low literacy, and about 51% have low levels of numeracy. “Being able to read and write and work with numbers is vital to learning new skills and having higher value, higher paid work. It’s also very important to life outside the workplace,” he says.

The aim is to embed literacy and numeracy in programmes delivered at tertiary organisations and train the tutors to also identify when students need help.

“We know that improving literacy and numeracy skills best happens when the learning is closely linked to the learner’s immediate context, learning needs and interests. However this requires well-qualified tutors who can teach literacy and numeracy,” Prof Jones says.

Prof Jones says the Waikato University School of Education project has inherited a team of developers who will train the tertiary tutors and he expects that team will need to expand to about 20 people. The School of Education is also planning to offer specific papers in adult literacy and numeracy education at undergraduate and post-graduate level.

Waikato University Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the School of Education is ranked Number 1 in the country according to government rankings. “This relationship is a tangible example of how excellence in education can be applied nationwide and how we are putting theory into action and making a difference to the lives of New Zealanders.”

TEC Director Tertiary Network David Nicholson says improving tutors’ skills is a long-term and affordable response to adult literacy and numeracy issues. TEC is pleased to be working closely with Waikato University on the initiative, he says. “They have shown that they have the expertise to build professional development across this broad sector, in a meaningful and cost effective way. Having a strong, well respected partner to deliver professional development means the whole sector will benefit.”
