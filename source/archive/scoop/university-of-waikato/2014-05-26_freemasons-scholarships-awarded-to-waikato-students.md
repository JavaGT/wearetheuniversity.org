Freemasons Scholarships awarded to Waikato Students

Four University of Waikato students have been awarded scholarships totalling $28,000 in the latest round of Freemasons scholarships.

Karen Houghton (PhD in microbiology) received $10,000, Anthony Baker (Master of Business Management), Lindi Engelbrecht (Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)) and Alana Scott (Bachelor of Business Management) each received $6000.

In total, 30 students from New Zealand’s eight universities were presented with Freemasons scholarships totalling $208,000. Sir Ray Avery GNZM - pharmaceutical scientist, inventor and social entrepreneur – awarded students their scholarships in Parliament’s Legislative Council Chamber on 20 May.

At the presentation, Sir Ray stressed how important it was to rally talented people.

“No one is as clever as all of us. All great leaders mobilise the skills of everyone into powerful tools to overcome the impossible.”

Freemasons Grand Master John Litton congratulated parents and families of the scholarship

recipients. All recipients are actively involved in volunteering and supporting people in their networks and communities and achieve consistent excellent academic results.

“As Freemasons, we see one of the benefits of education being a greater tolerance of other people’s views and opinions. Already you have shown this to be so,” says Mr Litton.

For the last 36 years, Freemasons New Zealand - through The Freemasons Charity - has funded nearly $4.42 million in scholarships to 1051 students. Its privately funded university scholarship programme is one of New Zealand’s largest.
