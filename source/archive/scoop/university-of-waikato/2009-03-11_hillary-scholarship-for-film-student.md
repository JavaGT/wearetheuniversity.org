Hillary Scholarship for film student who’s gone back to her roots

A focus on finding out more about her East Coast roots has won Waikato University student Bonnie Frires a prestigious Hillary Scholarship – and it’s opened the doors to work on a new film by acclaimed Kiwi actor-director Taika Cohen.

The Tauranga-based East Coaster recently completed her first documentary film about an old church in Raukokore, where her family originates from. The film was an assignment for her honours degree in Screen and Media studies.

“Raukokore Church has been perched on a rugged coastline for 115 years, and it’s the hub of the local community,” says Frires. “My film aims to portray its historical and spiritual importance, and it’s also been a way for me to reconnect with my origins.”

Frires, whose iwi affiliation is Te Whanau A Apanui, is one of about 50 new Hillary Scholars at Waikato. The Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship Programme, offered since 2005, awards scholarships to academic high achievers who show significant leadership qualities and also excel in sport or in the creative and performing arts. The prestigious scholarships provide full university course fees while studying at Waikato, comprehensive support for the recipients’ academic, sporting and/or arts activities, and additional support in leadership and personal development.

“Winning the scholarship is a huge weight off my shoulders,” says Frires. “It means I can complete my honours year without worrying about money. And it’s also given me a sense of achievement in my studies and my chosen career path.”

Frires has now been appointed third assistant director on a new feature film The Volcano, set in Waihau Bay and directed by Taika Cohen (Eagle vs Shark). Shooting begins this month.

“A lot of the cast are children, and my job is to look after them and ensure the film stays on schedule and runs smoothly,” says Frires, who has previously worked as a production assistant on a Dutch film, Bride Flight, which was shot in New Zealand.

She’ll be based on the East Coast until shooting finishes at the end of May “so I’ll be doing my next Honours paper over the internet”.

For the future, Frires is hoping her Honours degree will help secure her work in advertising so she can travel overseas. “But my focus at the moment is work associated with my Maori heritage and culture.”
