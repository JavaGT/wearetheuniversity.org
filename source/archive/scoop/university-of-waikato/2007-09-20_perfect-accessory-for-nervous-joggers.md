Waikato marketing students come up with perfect accessory for nervous joggers

Women joggers can feel safer when they’re out for a run thanks to a clever idea dreamed up by four first-year marketing students at the University of Waikato Management School.

They’ve designed a sweatband with a unique dual alarm system designed to ward off attackers – both human and canine. At the press of a button, the wristband emits two alarms. One is a loud attention-getting alarm noise; the other is a very high-frequency noise that only dogs can hear -- and hate.

“My mum gave me the idea of an alarm in a glove, but we wanted something fashionable that a runner would want to wear,” explains Ruth Pinkerton. “So we came up with Safe-Band.

“Women in our target market frequently fear dog attacks when out running or walking, especially if they have young children with them. You’ve only got to think of recent headlines to realise that dog attacks are a big issue.”

Pinkerton and her teammates Tammy Nottingham, Yi Chiann Chan and Alana Connolly had to come up with a fashion accessory for people or pets for Waikato Management School’s twice-yearly Marketing Trade Show. Teams of first-year students compete to create a new product and put it through the marketing processes of price, packaging, placement, and promotion.

“This ‘hands on’ approach to learning not only gives students a chance to apply the theory from lectures but also encourages their creative thinking, and the result is great ideas like Safe-Band,” says marketing tutor Ariane Tills.

The Safe-Band team is confident they’ve got a marketable product. “The need is out there,” says Alana Connolly. “Everyone we’ve talked to says it’s a good idea.”

Pinkerton’s done her research, and says there’s a lot of concern about safety.  
“We’re targeting active women to start with, but I’ve also interviewed dog walkers who are most keen to get hold of the alarm, particularly if they’ve got small dogs.”

The team have created packaging for their product, designed to hang from a point-of-purchase display, and have set the price at an affordable $20 with a choice of colours and wristband widths.

Safe-Band will be on display at the Marketing Trade Show at 5pm-7pm on Friday 28 September at Waikato Management School. Judges will select Best Product and Best Display winners from more than 55 competing teams.
