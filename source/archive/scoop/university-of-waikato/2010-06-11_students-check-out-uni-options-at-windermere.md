Windermere campus was the place to be on June 10 for those considering tertiary study next semester or in 2011.

As well as checking out free entertainment, food and fun, school students and those considering tertiary study as mature students found out about the courses offered at the University of Waikato and Bay of Plenty Polytechnic at Windermere campus.

Tauranga Boys’ College Year 13 students Anton Holder, Daniel Peeters and Aaron O’Keeffe are all planning to attend the University of Waikato next year, or following a gap year, and say the information about courses was really useful.

“It was good to find out that for some courses you can start here at the Windermere campus for two years and then go to Hamilton, or complete the course here in Tauranga,” says Anton, who is planning to study for a degree in Business Management, majoring in economics.

The three students are planning to complete their study at the Hamilton campus but agree it would definitely be cheaper to stay in Tauranga.
