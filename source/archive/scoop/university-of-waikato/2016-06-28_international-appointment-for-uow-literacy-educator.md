**International appointment for Waikato University literacy educator**

Te Kura Toi Tangata Faculty of Education Senior Lecturer Sue Dymock was appointed as an Academy Fellow of the International Academy for Research in Learning Disabilities this week, joining a group of 300 world leaders engaged in the scientific study of learning disabilities.

Dr Dymock says it's humbling to receive international recognition for the literacy research she has done with New Zealand children. \"Ultimately, my goal is to help children, especially our Kiwi children to develop age-appropriate reading skills. It's very difficult to access the curriculum if you cannot read. It's been my research focus for the past three decades, and I've been fortunate enough to be supported in this pursuit by the faculty and wider University."

To become an Academy Fellow, individuals are nominated by Fellows or Members and are recommended to the Academy Fellows’ Committee, with the nomination considered on the basis of the following criteria:

1\. Is a leading researcher, recognised nationally and/or internationally for his/her contribution to the scientific knowledge and understanding of learning disabilities, and

2\. Has achieved scholarly distinction in the field of learning disabilities, and

3\. Has made a distinguished contribution to learning disabilities research, and

4\. Has published research articles in peer-reviewed journals in the academic literature.

Dr Dymock is looking forward to new international networking opportunities and intends on attending next year's annual conference for the first time.
