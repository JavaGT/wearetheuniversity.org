**Summer Research Scholarships open for student applications**

What do the recovery strategies of elite netballers and the co-digestion of sewage sludge have in common?

They’re two of 60 topics confirmed in the University of Waikato’s next round of Summer Research Scholarships. During the 10-week programme, students take part in full-time research from November 2014 until February 2015 and receive a $5000 scholarship. Now that topics have been confirmed, students can apply to be part of the research projects, with applications closing on 31 August 2014.

The programme is open to students enrolled at a New Zealand or Australian university, and gives promising final year undergraduate, honours year and first-year masters degree students the chance to experience the challenges and rewards of research, working alongside senior University of Waikato academics.

The Summer Research Programme began in 2006 at the University of Waikato. Scholarships are funded by the University, co-funded with University partners or totally externally funded.

The programme begins with a breakfast launch in November. Supervisors provide interim reports on their students and projects half-way through the programme. There is a closing function in February and final reports are available mid-March.

Among the topics being researched this summer are:

• The effects of a novel recovery strategy on performance of elite netballers. Senior Sport and Leisure Studies Lecturer Dr Matt Driller will work with the Waikato Bay of Plenty Magic to study aspects of recovery in Magic players.

• Examining Hamilton City Council’s reversal of policy on water fluoridation.

• Traumatic brain injury in New Zealand: looking at how many people in the Midland Region are admitted to hospital following a head injury as well as determining the main causes of this type of injury.

• Nutrient excretion rates of invasive fish

• Celebrating soils from around the world – their diversity, beauty and resilience

• Enhancing the Māori language online macroniser tool to allow it to accept names (both people and places) and provide a facility to hard code certain decisions on macron placement.
