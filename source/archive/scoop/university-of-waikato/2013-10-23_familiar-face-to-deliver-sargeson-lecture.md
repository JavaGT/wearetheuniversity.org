##### Professor Vincent O’Sullivan

An old friend is returning for this year’s eleventh annual Frank Sargeson Memorial Lecture at the University of Waikato.

Emeritus Professor Vincent O’Sullivan, who worked at the University of Waikato for 10 years from 1968-78, will be presenting his lecture called “_The beach at Stresa, the 'Wheatsheaf' in Soho_.

The lecture will focus on the friendship between Frank Sargeson and Dan Davin, two of the best known living fiction writers in the 1950s and 1960s in New Zealand.  
“Frank and Dan liked each other, and guardedly admired each other's work,” says Professor O’Sullivan. “This lecture considers some of the currents, and cross-currents, of that friendship.”  
Professor O’Sullivan is one of New Zealand’s most important writers. His novel _Let the River Stand_ won the Montana Book Award in 1994, the same year that he held the Katherine Mansfield Memorial Fellowship in Menton.

In 2006 he was awarded the Prime Minister’s Award for literary achievement and he is New Zealand’s current Poet Laureate. Professor O'Sullivan taught English at the University of Waikato and at Victoria University. He now lives in Dunedin.  
Associate Professor Sarah Shieff from the English Programme at Waikato is looking forward to the talk and to welcoming Professor O’Sullivan back to familiar ground when he arrives.

“We’re very honoured that Professor O’Sullivan has agreed to present the Sargeson Lecture this year. It should be a memorable occasion.”

The Frank Sargeson Memorial lecture takes place on Wednesday, October 30 at 5.30pm in S.G.02. There will be light refreshments after the lecture from 6.30pm. The lecture is free and open to the public.
