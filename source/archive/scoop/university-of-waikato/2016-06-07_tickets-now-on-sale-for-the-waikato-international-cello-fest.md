Tickets Now on Sale for the Waikato International Cello Fest 2016

Tickets are now on sale for the Waikato International Cello Fest 2016. Hosted by the University of Waikato, the festival will take place in the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts from 21-28 August. It is the first time an event of this kind has been held in New Zealand.

Attendees have a choice of ticket options for the week-long event which will comprise of six premium concerts featuring international guest cellists, as well as the finals of the inaugural Wallace International Cello Competition, three lunchtime concerts, daily masterclasses and panel discussions.

The international cellists headlining the event are Wolfgang Schmidt, Li-Wei Qin, Philippe Muller, Richard Aaron, Santiago Cañón Valencia, and Edward King. They will be joined by the University’s Conservatorium of Music staff James Tennant, Katherine Austin, Lara Hall, Rachael Griffiths-Hughes, and Francis Cowan, as well as a host of musicians from the University and Waikato musical communities.

Tickets range from $5 for the masterclasses through to $30 for the premium concerts. “This is an incredible opportunity to see some of the world’s finest cellists, along with the most promising cello students from here and overseas, for a very small cost,” says Festival Director and University of Waikato Senior Lecturer of Cello, James Tennant.

Festival patrons also have the option of purchasing a ‘Festival Pass’ for $100, which will give them entry into all events taking place throughout the week, as well as access to a premium seating area in the Academy’s Dr John Gallagher Concert Chamber for the concerts.
