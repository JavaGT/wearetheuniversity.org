**University of Waikato launches 50th anniversary celebrations**

Hundreds of staff are expected to attend the launch of the University of Waikato’s 50th anniversary celebrations on 14 February at the Gallagher Academy for Performing Arts on campus.

The afternoon’s activities will include launching the book _Ko Te Tangata, A History of the University of Waikato, The First Fifty Years_, written by Emeritus Professor Noeline Alcorn, and a premiere viewing of a commemorative DVD.

Guests include former Vice-Chancellors Wilf Malcolm and Bryan Gould, some key founders of the University as well as some staff from the early days.

The event will be hosted by Chancellor Jim Bolger and Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford.

Professor Crawford says the Golden Jubilee year marks what has been an impressive journey over the past half a century.

“I am proud to be celebrating this milestone with current and former staff, whose hard work and dedication have shaped this institution into the world-class university that it is today,” says Professor Crawford.

In the evening, the University is sponsoring the Symphony in the Gardens concert at which James Judd, who has an Honorary Doctorate from the University, will be conducting the Opus Orchestra on the opening night of the Hamilton Gardens Arts Festival.

The University celebrates its 50th anniversary throughout 2014. Former staff and alumni are encouraged to register their interest in events at http://www.waikato.ac.nz/about/50/.

The University is also holding a Community Open Day on Saturday 17 May providing the opportunity for current/former staff, students and the public to celebrate the University’s 50 years.
