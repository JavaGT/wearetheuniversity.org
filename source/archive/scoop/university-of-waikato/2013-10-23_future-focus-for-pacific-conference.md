A day-long Pacific Research Conference being held at the University of Waikato in November will have a firm eye on the future as it tackles three themes of increasing importance to the Pacific region.

The inaugural Kiwa’s Colloquium will be held at the Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts on 12 November and organiser Lora Vaioleti says the subtheme for the event is T+10, or “projecting our talanoa forward ten years”.

Talanoa is a Pacific research methodology involving two-way communication that incorporates often invisible dimensions of western communication such as emotion and spirituality.

“The reason for the future orientation is the complex and interconnected challenges we face as a people and a region in the near to medium future. Decisions for well-being in the face of shifting educational and work needs, as well as planning for the risks of climate change for our Pacific region, must start now.” she says.

The symposium will focus on three key topics: climate change and the Pacific; The Pacific and higher education and working for the Pacific.

Kiwa’s Colloquium will host Dr Malama Meleisea from the National University of Samoa (NUS) as the international keynote speaker. Dr Meleisea is widely recognised for his work under UNESCO developing Cultures of Peace in the Asia-Pacific region, has written widely on the making of modern Samoa, is a Lands and Titles Court Judge and is the Director of the Centre for Samoan Studies at the NUS.

The first HIGH (Harmonising, Investigative, Generative, Healing) Talanoa training workshop will be held at the symposium, hosted by talanoa expert Dr Timote Vaioleti , while a Pacific artist will spend the day creating an artwork exploring the concept of talanoa.

Pacific students will also be presenting their research, with eight students selected to compete for five research grants.

“We are excited to have Pacific students from around New Zealand presenting their work from fields as diverse as biochemistry to education, psychology and climate science.”

“The coming together of regional experts, faculty and student researchers with the wider Pacific community means dialogue will be very much focussed on problem solving and the practical application of Pacific research for the strengthening of Pacific futures,” Ms Vaioleti says.

Registration for the symposium is free, although numbers are limited. For more details visit: www.waikato.ac.nz/smpd/symposium\_form.shtml
