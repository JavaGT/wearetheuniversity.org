**University of Waikato Law Dean to return home to Canada**

The University of Waikato’s Law Dean is returning home to Canada after five years at the helm of Te Piringa – Faculty of Law.

Professor Brad Morse says he’s immensely enjoyed his time at the University of Waikato, but can no longer deny the pull of home. He will finish in his role and return to Canada before the end of the year.

“I have loved my time in Hamilton at the University of Waikato, but the pull of family and friends in Canada is now too strong. I have very much valued the opportunity to serve as Dean of Te Piringa, and I do hope to retain some formal ties with the University of Waikato as I believe it is a world-class institution.”

Professor Morse says he’s proud to have spent five years leading Te Piringa – Faculty of Law, which is highly regarded internationally. "I knew before I came that our Faculty of Law was better respected in many ways overseas than it was in New Zealand for its commitment to teaching law in the far more realistic and broader social, economic and cultural context, for ensuring all students learned principles of negotiation and dispute resolution, and for its unique effort to incorporate tikanga Māori and Treaty issues throughout its curriculum in a way that no other law school does.”

Professor Morse says it has been a personal priority of his to increase the Faculty’s international profile and partnerships. “This has helped contribute to our significant rise in recognition internationally in the past few years.”

He’s disappointed he’ll leave before construction is finished on the University’s Law and Management building, “but it will be a tremendous event for the next Dean, and a milestone that will further enhance the Faculty’s reputation”.

The University’s Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Crawford, has paid tribute to Professor Morse, saying he has made a major contribution to the organisation. “He has been involved in many positive changes within the Faculty in his time with us, and I have valued his input into the wider University community.”

Professor Crawford says Professor Morse’s academic expertise, particularly in the areas related to indigenous law, has been used by many governments internationally. “He is incredibly well regarded around the world and we are lucky to have had him leading a Faculty here at the University of Waikato.”

The university will soon begin a recruitment process for a new Dean. “Professor Morse has set the scene for the next generation of teaching Law at the University of Waikato, and has added a very important international dimension to our activities” Professor Crawford says.
