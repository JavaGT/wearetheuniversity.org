How well do you sing?

Opera diva Dame Malvina Major is hosting a free master class in the first lecture of this year’s University of Waikato Winter Lecture series.

Senior Fellow in Music at the University of Waikato, Dame Malvina will talk about how the voice works, and different ways to use and improve it. She will be joined on stage by one of her top students, Amina Edris, and others not so advanced in their singing careers. The audience will be able to hear how using the right techniques can make a difference to their singing voice.

Dame Malvina was this year was made an Additional Member of the Order of New Zealand and recently celebrated the 21st year of the Dame Malvina Foundation, which was established to assist and develop the skills of young New Zealanders associated with the performing arts and to prepare them for professional careers.

“When I’m asked if anybody can sing – given the right training, I say ‘yes’, because I think anyone can sing for pleasure,” says Dame Malvina. “People with problems identifying tone can train their ears to hear a tune. But then there are people who clearly have a talent and who need to be trained, and that’s where I come in.”

Dame Malvina Major’s lecture is on Wednesday 1 August in the Academy of Performing Arts, and she says it will be an informal event.

“I hope people will ask questions from the floor, as that’s often the best way to get into a subject and give examples. I’m looking forward to it.”

Other lectures throughout August will feature Hamilton Mayor Julie Hardaker and Tainui Group Holdings CEO Mike Pohio, Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland, Professor Bob Evans on sustainable cities, and a food lecture that will feature University of Waikato professors Jacqueline Rowarth and Darrin Hodgetts and local restaurateur David Kerr.
