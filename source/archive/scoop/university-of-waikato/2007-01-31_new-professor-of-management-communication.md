MEDIA RELEASE

New professor of management communication for Waikato Management School

31 January 2007

Dr Kay Weaver has been appointed Professor of Management Communication at the University of Waikato Management School. A former policewoman and journalist, Prof Weaver has written extensively on violence and the media; her most recent book Women and Violence in the Media was published last year.

Her research interests also include public relations analysis, activist campaigns, science communication and use of information communication technologies in rural New Zealand communities.

Her latest research project looks at the impact on the community of installing broadband internet access in Te Pahu, a rural community near Hamilton. “We’re interested in how broadband will change family life, and how it will impact on school kids and people who work from home,” says Prof Weaver.

“Currently Te Pahu is a really physical community, people who live there take part in a lot of shared activities. With broadband, we want to find out if and how that will change.”

Prof Weaver is also active in teaching communication and public relations at undergraduate and post-graduate levels
