Café Scientifique debates economic arguments to help the environment

Tauranga’s Café Scientifique is hosting University of Waikato’s Dr Dan Marsh on March 23 where he will explain how economics can help to achieve a more sustainable New Zealand with better social and environmental outcomes. Economic arguments can actually be used in the environmental debate to help the environment rather than harm it.

Dr Marsh, from the Economics Department, will describe some of the sustainability research being carried out by economists at the University of Waikato. Dr Marsh is an environmental economist whose research interests involve the economics of water quality and non-market valuation. He is particularly interested in helping policy makers to understand both the costs and the benefits of changes in the quality of environmental and natural resources as they develop environmental policies and regulations.

Café Scientifique is on Monday, March 23. Doors are open from 6.30pm for a 7pm start at the Tauranga Yacht and Power Boat Club, 90 Keith Allen Drive, Sulphur Point, Tauranga. Entry is $5 and refreshments are provided.
