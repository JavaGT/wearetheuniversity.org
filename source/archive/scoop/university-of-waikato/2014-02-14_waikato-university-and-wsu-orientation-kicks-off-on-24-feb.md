On Wednesday 26 February, a pōwhiri at the University’s Te Kohinga Mārama Marae on campus will be held 10am to mark the beginning of the academic year. On Thursday 27 February at 2.30pm, international students head off on an Amazing Race event around the campus.

From Sunday 2 March the Waikato Students’ Union begins its ORI2014 programme with the annual pool party to kick off a week that includes bands, performances, comedians, bodypainting, the meat pie mile, a movie on the Village Green, prize giveaways, Zombie Zumba and a mini-Olympics.

A major highlight of the festivities will be the Clubs Day on Wednesday 5 March where over 40 student clubs will showcase a diverse range of interests, including languages and culture, sports and hobbies, politics and academic pursuits.

Finally, on Saturday 8 March the University and WSU will jointly host their first family day targeting students with young families and including a picnic, a magician and some games and giveaways.

Group Manager Student Experience and Administration Mary-Jane Waddington says students come to Waikato for more than just an education, they come for the full student experience.

“O-week plays an essential part in student life, particularly for new students undertaking study for the first time. The University prides itself on the pastoral care it provides, ensuring students feel welcome on the campus, which will be their home for the near future.”
