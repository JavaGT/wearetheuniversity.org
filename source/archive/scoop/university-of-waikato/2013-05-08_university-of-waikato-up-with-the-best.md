**University of Waikato up with the best**

The quality of a University of Waikato education has been recognised globally with six subject areas taught at the University assessed as being among the best in the world.

Of the six, two subjects – Law and Education – are ranked in the top 100 worldwide in the QS Universities Subject Rankings, which assess nearly 3000 universities on the quality of 30 different subject areas.

Computer Science, Economics and Econometrics, History and Geography and are also ranked in the top 200 of the rankings, which are released today by British company Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). The QS rankings are generally considered among the most influential of university ranking systems and are based on academic and employer surveys, research citations for each subject area, the ratio of students to staff and the number of international students and staff at the university.

University of Waikato Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Crawford says the results reflect the university’s focus on continual improvement, with just four subjects ranked in the top 200 in 2012 and one in the top 100.

“These results are in line with expectations that the University of Waikato will continue to make its presence felt on a global scale,” he says.

“While we are a young university, we have come a long way in a relatively short time. To be acknowledged as being among the best in the world in six subjects is gratifying and just reward for the hard work of staff throughout the organisation, but particularly in the recognised subject areas.”

Within the rankings, Geography has improved from being ranked between 151-200 to between 101-150, while education improves from 101-150 to 51-100.

Law, which didn’t make the top 200 in 2012, leaps straight into the top 100 while computer science and history are ranked in the top 200 for the first time.

Aside from the subject rankings, the QS University Rankings and Times Higher Education rankings both place the University of Waikato in the top two percent of universities in the world and in the top 100 for universities under 50 years old.
