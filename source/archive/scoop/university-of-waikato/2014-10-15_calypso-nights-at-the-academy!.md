**Monday 27th October, 8pm**  
Playhouse Theatre, Gallagher Academy of Performing Arts, University of Waikato

**“This is a side-splitting, feel-good production, oozing originality out of every comical pore - I’ve never seen anything quite like it.”** (Edinburgh Fringe review)  
The Academy is delighted to host Barnie Duncan’s award-winning one man show **“Calypso Nights”** on Labour Day in the Playhouse at the Academy.

In “Calypso Nights” our host Juan Vesuvius uses two turntables, a microphone, vinyl records, maracas and a beautiful handmade shirt to cover the history of Calypso, Soca, Kim Jong Un, beauty pageants and female pleasure.

It’s a show that has delighted audiences and won awards at the Auckland Comedy Festival in 2013, and more recently at the 2014 Edinburgh Fringe Festival where it won the "Fringe Genius" Skinny Award for Most Original Show 2014.

**5 Stars \*\*\*\*\*** ‘This isn’t theatre. This isn’t really comedy either. It’s somewhere in between… A genre-defying riot that is so far removed from the usual festival fare, you won’t be able to contain the grinning.’ (The Skinny, Edinburgh)

**5 Stars \*\*\*\*\*** ‘As I write this review, my jaw aches from the amount of laughing I did during Barnie Duncan’s performance of ‘Calypso Nights’. This is a side-splitting, feel-good production, oozing originality out of every comical pore - I’ve never seen anything quite like it.’ (Ed Fringe Review)
