Helen Clark raises profile of level crossing accidents

When Helen Clark says we need more research to understand why there are so many railway level crossing accidents in New Zealand, you might expect people to sit up and take notice.

“Well, the name stands out,” admits Clark’s student namesake, who graduates from the University of Waikato this week \[May 7\] with an honours degree in psychology.

A former student at Hamilton’s Sacred Heart Girls’ College, Helen Elizabeth Clark (even the middle name’s the same) says she and the other Helen also have mothers with the same name – and it’s all led to a fair bit of teasing over the years, particularly once the other Helen became prime minister.

But while the other Helen takes up the reins of power at the UNDP in New York, Clark will be embarking on her Masters research – looking at whether visual illusions might contribute to accidents on railway level crossings.

Her research is part of a wider, Marsden-funded vision science project, led by Associate Professor John Perrone of the Traffic & Road Safety Research Group at the University of Waikato. The Marsden project is looking at the role of eye movements in our perception of the speed of moving objects (such as trains).

“I’ll be using state-of-the-art eye tracking equipment to test people’s responses to computer simulations of an approaching train at a typical rural crossing where there are no barriers,” says Clark. “Then I plan to compare their responses to similar situations involving approaching cars and motorcycles.”

One theory Clark plans to test is that the narrow shape of an oncoming train, like that of a motorcycle, creates a visual illusion that causes people to misjudge the speed of approach.

Clark says she chose the topic because she wanted a project with some practical relevance, and because there’s very little research available on this area. “We don’t know a lot about the cause of level crossing accidents. Perhaps people underestimate the speed of trains, or perhaps New Zealand drivers are just very impatient.”

Clark spent six years in the workforce before she came to university, and believes she was better prepared to tackle tertiary level study because of it. “When I left school I was so over the study thing, and I think I saw university an extension of school.”

Now with an honours degree under her belt, she’s considering further research after she completes her Masters, and may go on to a doctorate. And she’s not averse to trading a little on her name. “One thing about having a famous name, people don’t forget you,” she says.
