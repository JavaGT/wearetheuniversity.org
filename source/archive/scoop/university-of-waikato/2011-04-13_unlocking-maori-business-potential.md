Unlocking Maori Business Potential

Research capabilities and innovations to help unlock Māori business potential are being showcased this week at an event hosted by the University of Waikato, its commercialisation arm, WaikatoLink, and Te Kotahi Research Institute.

Māori governance models, new ways to sustainably harvest high-value marine bioresources, and a project to bring broadband to the Ureweras are among the research projects on display at the Universities-Business Partnerships event on Kingitanga Day (Thursday April 14).

Spearheaded by Universities New Zealand, the initiative is part of a year-long series of events to bring universities and businesses closer together.

All eight universities are represented at the events, which are sponsored by the Tertiary Education Commission and supported by Business New Zealand and the Universities Commercialisation Offices of New Zealand.

Speakers at the University of Waikato event include Science and Innovation Minister Dr Wayne Mapp, Materoa Dodd of the Federation of Māori Authorities, and Rhonda Kite of Kiwa Media Group.

A panel of guest speakers in the afternoon will consider the context of Māori innovation and how to connect with research and development.
