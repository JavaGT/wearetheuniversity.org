**Flautist Best Performance At New Zealand Woodwind Competition**

Waikato University music student Lauren Grout has taken first place at the New Zealand Woodwind Competition, held at Westlake Girls High School on the 15 and 16 September.

Lauren entered in the tertiary section, where she performed a 25 minute programme and an unaccompanied piece in the final where the judges ultimately chose her as the winner over 15 other competitors in her category.

Lauren, a 3rd year music student who has been playing the flute for 10 years, says she was quite anxious before performing as she changed her programme a couple of days before the competition after checking the rules again carefully.

“I felt my initial performance wasn’t as good as I would have like, but I thought I played very well during the final round.”

The talented musician also claimed Best Performance of a New Zealand Work on the night with her Concerto for flute composed by Anthony Ritchie.

Her prizes included $2,000 for first place in the tertiary section and $100 voucher and a free 12 month library membership for Best Performance of a New Zealand Work.

Lauren plans to use the prize money towards her future career. “I’m hoping to use the prize money to help fund a trip overseas to audition at schools in Europe.”

Waikato University clarinettist Nathaniel Smorti also competed, giving a highly commendable performance and making it to the final round.

The music programme will be celebrating their 25 year anniversary this October and there will be a concert on the 13 and 14 October to mark the occasion.
