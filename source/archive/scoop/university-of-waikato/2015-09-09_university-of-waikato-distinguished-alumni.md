**Hinewehi Mohi MNZM**

Hinewehi Mohi shot to fame singing the national anthem in te reo Māori at a 1999 Rugby World Cup game in Twickenham. That same year, she released her first album _Oceania_. A critical success, _Oceania_ was the first Māori language album to be released internationally.

Since then, Ms Mohi has released two more albums and was a semi-finalist in 2013’s New Zealander of the Year. In 2008 she was named a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her services to Māori.

Following the birth of her daughter Hineraukatauri, who has cerebal palsy, Ms Mohi established the Raukatauri Music Therapy Centre in 2004 to support children and their families with music therapy.

Ms Mohi has also had a successful career in television production as a researcher, presenter, director and producer for nearly 30 years. She continues to produce programming for mainstream and Māori television through the production company she owns with her husband.

Ms Mohi has a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Māori. She graduated in 1985.

**Rob Waddell ONZM**

Rob Waddell burst on to the elite rowing scene in 1995 when he won the single sculls title at the New Zealand championships. In the following two years, he won the world championships in Germany and Canada and graduated from the University of Waikato in 1998 with a Bachelor of Management Studies with honours, majoring in marketing and Japanese.

At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney Mr Waddell won New Zealand’s only gold medal. That same year he won his third Halberg Award, making him the first person to win the Sportsperson of the Year Award three years in a row.

After a break from rowing, Mr Waddell took to yachting, joining Team New Zealand as a grinder and competing in the 2003, 2007 and 2013 America’s Cup campaigns.

Mr Waddell gives his time to several sporting and community bodies, including chairing the Home of Cycling Trust and working with the Halberg Trust helping children in sport.

Next year, Mr Waddell will lead the New Zealand team to the Olympic Games in Rio as Chef de Mission.
