**Three way partnership adds up for business and accounting students**

A new agreement between three tertiary institutions provides an improved pathway for access to business and accounting qualifications.

The agreement was signed earlier this month between the University of Waikato, the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic (BoPP) and China’s Yantai University.

The agreement will set up a four-year degree made up of two years studying for a Diploma of Accounting or International Trade at Yantai University followed by a one-year business diploma at BoPP and a further year to complete a Bachelor of Business Administration at the University of Waikato.

The agreement was signed during a visit to China by a powerful trade and education delegation from Tauranga, including Mayor Stuart Crosby, University of Waikato Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Alister Jones, Bay of Plenty Polytechnic Chief Executive Alan Hampton, Education Tauranga chairman Graeme Lind and others from the education sector.

Professor Jones says the agreement builds on the longstanding and strong relationship between Tauranga and Yantai and forms another important connection between the University of Waikato and the Bay of Plenty.

“We consider the Bay of Plenty an important part of the University of Waikato and over time we will see more of these relationships being forged, providing access to an increasingly diverse range of courses in Tauranga,” he says.

“That will mean more students studying in Tauranga, providing a valuable boost to the local economy.”

The University of Waikato currently contributes more than 40 jobs and $8 million in annual GDP to the Bay of Plenty economy. In 2013, the University of Waikato had 836 students enrolled in courses delivered in Tauranga.

Yantai University was established in 1984 with help from China’s two most prestigious universities, Peking University and Tsinghua University and has about 24,000 students.
