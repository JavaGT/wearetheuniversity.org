The Freemasons scholarships, which have been awarded to university students since 1992, recognise students who are academic high achievers and are also actively involved in the community.

Melanie Haeata, who is completing a Master of Social Sciences degree, was awarded $10,000, and $6,000 amounts were awarded to Claire Mulholland, who is completing a Bachelor of Science degree; Vanessa Cameron-Lewis and Irene Lichtwark, who are completing a Bachelor of Social Sciences (Honours) degree; and, Steven Rae, who is completing a Bachelor of Management Studies (Honours) and Bachelor of Science degree.
