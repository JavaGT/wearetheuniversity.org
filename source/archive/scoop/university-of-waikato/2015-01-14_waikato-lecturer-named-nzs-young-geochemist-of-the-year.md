**Waikato lecturer named NZ’s young geochemist of the year**

University of Waikato Earth Scientist Dr Shaun Barker has been awarded the Werner F Giggenbach Prize which names him as the young geochemist of the year for New Zealand.

The prize was awarded to Dr Barker for the most outstanding publication in the field of geochemistry.

The publication details his work on the application of measuring stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios around hydrothermal ore deposits. The ratios can be used to understand the origin and evolution of the hydrothermal systems, as well as provide information that companies can use to better explore and discover ore deposits.

“This is an example of applied research that is being actively utilised by mining companies in their day-to-day exploration activities in North and South America, Australia, Europe, Africa and Asia. This demonstrates the study’s significance and practical application around the world, and the value of university-led research to end users,” says Dr Barker.

The Werner F Giggenbach Prize for Geochemistry was awarded at the recent annual Geo Society of New Zealand (GSNZ) Conference.
