Future of cyber security featured in Winter Lecture Series

  
With the cyber security market expected to grow to US$94 billion by 2017, the University of Waikato will take a look at the future of online security at this year’s Winter Lecture Winter Lecture Series

The University of Waikato Winter Lecture Series is an annual free public lecture series held every Wednesday in August. It is a focused and relevant series designed to inspire robust discussion on topical issues. This year, each lecture will have a forward-looking  
element as the University of Waikato celebrates its 50th and open to the public.

Cyber security and cloud computing

Speaking at the lecture on 13 August, Dr Ryan Ko is a Senior Lecturer in the University of Waikato’s Faculty of Computing and Mathematical Sciences and head of the new Cyber Security Lab.

With the world’s increasing dependence on information technology and the global rise of threats to cyber security, Dr Ko’s work focuses on testing and verifying new tools to help mitigate threats to online security, and teaching a new wave of cyber security specialists.

An acknowledged expert in the area of cloud computing, Dr Ko has concerns about the provenance of data stored in the cloud environment. “What happens to your data, who copies it, and who has access to it? There’s a growing need for governance around the lifecycle of data stored in the cloud.”

Dr Ko will use his time on stage to also share some of the projects the graduate students in the Cyber Security Lab are working on. “It’s pretty cool stuff,” he says.
