**New law internship is one of a kind**

Law students at the University of Waikato will have the chance to work on real cases as part of a new law internship programme – the first of its kind in New Zealand – established between the University’s Te Piringa – Faculty of Law, and the Police Prosecution Service (PPS).

Third- and fourth-year law students, who have completed the third year Crimes paper, are eligible to undertake the internship programme which runs during the University’s summer school period (November to February).

Wayne Rumbles, Senior Lecturer at Te Piringa – Faculty of Law, says the internship provides students with the chance to work on real police cases.

“This programme is unique in that it gives students real hands-on experience with a prosecutor, following a case, including spending time in court, and doing real work and submissions.”

Students in the programme spend six weeks working on a number of cases, under the guidance of a mentor, in a town or city within the central North Island. They then spend another six weeks writing a research paper following on from their case work.

Mr Rumbles says because of the unique opportunity and limited numbers, the internship is highly contested and may be expanded in the future.
