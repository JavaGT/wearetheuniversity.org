She is followed on September 2 by former ASB Chief Economist Anthony Byett who now runs his own blog fxmatters. He speaks on: The NZ Dollar: Its Role in Coping with the Global Economic Crisis and the Influence of the Crisis on its Future.

On September 9 the speaker is Ralph Lattimore, a senior fellow at the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research, and an adjunct professor at Victoria University. He looks at: The New World Trade Architecture: Looking Through the Global Recession.
