Labour desperate, student union foolish

Labour desperate, student union foolish

Labour's student loan policy has presented Labour as desperate and the student union fawning and out of touch, says Young Nationals President Jamie Simpson.

"Students are not stupid. They will not fall for this bribe. Students want lower taxes, an end to the Treaty grievance industry, better roads, and some decent law enforcement - just like the rest of mainstream New Zealand.

"Labour's announcement is nothing more than a grossly irresponsible election year bribe. Rather then reduce student debt, as Labour claims, the figure will balloon.

Mr Simpson also says Labour's announcement has shown just how party political NZUSA is.

"NZUSA issued its press release half an hour before Labour's announcement.

Not only is it clearly disinterested in the long term future of students, it’s in the Labour Party's pocket.

"National is committed to long term sustainable government. Labour is prepared to sell-out future generations just to keep its grubby hands in the Treasury lolly box,” Mr Simpson says.
