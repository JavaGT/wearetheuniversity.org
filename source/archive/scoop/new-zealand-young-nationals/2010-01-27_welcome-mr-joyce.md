Welcome Mr Joyce

New Zealand Young Nats  
26 January 2010                   Media Statement

Welcome Mr Joyce  
 

Young Nats welcome today’s announcement of the appointment of Hon Steven Joyce as the new Tertiary Education Minister. 

“This year is going to be a particularly important year for all tertiary students as Parliament will be discussing the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill,” says Daniel Fielding, Young Nats President.

“The Young Nats are committed to supporting the Bill, currently tertiary students remain the only group in society still forced to join a union. Students don't have a choice - they're compelled to be a 'card carrying' union member”.

“This Bill will ensure a system of voluntary student union membership where it is an opt-in choice, not an opt-out alternative.”

\"We call on the Minister to show his support for the Bill."

Young Nats would also like to thank Hon Anna Tolley for her contribution as Tertiary Education Minister.

  
ENDS
