Young Nats call on NZUSA to stop the scaremongering

  
The New Zealand Young Nationals strongly endorse the Education and Science Select Committee’s recommendations on the Freedom of Association Amendment Bill.

“Respect for human rights and common sense has prevailed. The bill and the proposed amendments ensures that students will have a choice whether they want to join unions on campus” says Young Nats President Daniel Fielding..

“The NZUSA have outlandishly claimed that the bill will be the end of student unions and student life on campuses. The bill merely removes the compulsory element from student unions, and will ensure that unions are accountable to their members, offering services that are actually wanted by their membership.”

The Young Nats strongly support student associations at our tertiary institutions and encourage student involvement on our campuses. But being forced to join a union in order to enrol as a student is wrong.

“If University lecturers want to join unions then they can actively make that choice without being compelled to, same with public servants, manufacturers, and engineers. Like the rest of society students are smart enough to make that choice for themselves.

“This Bill will also go a long way to bring back financial accountability to student unions, so in the future those student who chose to join a union won't have to experience what the students at Whitireia Polytechnic have recently endured.

“How can the NZUSA be against a Bill that upholds fundamental human rights, that will provide accountability and reduce the chance of students becoming victims of fraud from their own student unions?” says Daniel Fielding.

This Government is giving choice back to students, and for that it should be applauded.
