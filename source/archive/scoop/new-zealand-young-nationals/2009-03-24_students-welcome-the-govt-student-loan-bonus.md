Students welcome the Govt Student Loan Bonus

Students' Association is wrong – Students welcome the Government Student Loan Bonus

  
This week National’s popular student loan policy promised during the 2008 Election Campaign was delivered on, and included additional inclusion of students living overseas.

From 1 April students will receive a bonus; voluntary repayments over $500 will receive an extra 10 per cent write off from the government.

NZUSA have come out lambasting the policy, despite overwhelming support from students across the country.

As the supposed united national voice for students, NZUSA is critical of the announcement when in fact it has been welcomed across the board.

"NZUSA as an organisation continues to show their complete disregard for the actual opinions of the students it claims to represent" says Young Nats President Alex Mitchell.

"This fresh approach by the National-led government puts incentives in the right place. Shorter repayment times will mean graduates with student loans will be debt-free earlier.

“These comments from NZUSA are typical of an organisation where the diverse views of students play a secondary role to the personal political opinions of the officeholders.

"Not only are students forced to be members of the organisation, but views not necessarily their own are published in their name without consultation.

"Here is a policy based on sound principles that helps to address the serious issue of debt repayment – and typically the reaction from NZUSA is negative.

"It is essential that NZUSA support all policy that assists students, and for once puts ideology to the side”
