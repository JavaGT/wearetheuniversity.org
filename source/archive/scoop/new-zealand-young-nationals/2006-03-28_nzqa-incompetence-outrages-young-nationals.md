NZQA Incompetence Outrages Young Nationals

NZQA Incompetence Outrages Young Nationals

Press Release 28 February 2006

New Zealand Young Nationals: Northern Region

The Northern Region Young Nationals are blaming the Labour Government for NZQA's continual bungling of Scholarship results, particularly those of students from Auckland schools.

"The latest debacle which has seen two King's College students pass by 'making things up' or not studying is likely only the surface of problems at NZQA" says Northern Region Deputy Chair, Jamie Turner.

'The assertions of successive Labour Education Ministers that they are dealing with the problem have clearly been discredited. When student's education and futures are at stake, Ministers paying lip service to the problem simply won't cut it' he says.

Northern Region Chair, Daniel Fielding, is echoing his Deputy's calls.

"Despite attempts by the Government to address the problems at NZQA, exam results this year have only exposed yet more incompetence" says Fielding.

"This Government seems unable to register the gravity of the situation. If I were Steve Maharey, I would be extremely embarrassed."

Both also express concern at what this apparently ongoing theme might mean for this year's students.

"But since Labour Education Ministers' statements now appear worthless, any further assurances will certainly be met with scepticism" says Fielding and Turner.
