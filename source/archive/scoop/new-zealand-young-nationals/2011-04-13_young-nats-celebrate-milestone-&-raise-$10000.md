### 75 Years Young – Young Nats celebrate milestone and raise $10,000 for the Canterbury Student Army

On Saturday night hundreds of Young Nats were joined by the Prime Minister Rt. Hon John Key, former Prime Minister Rt. Hon Dame Jenny Shipley, former National Party Leader Dr. Don Brash, Members of Parliament and businesses and community leaders, at the Auckland War Memorial Museum to celebrate the Young Nats 75th Anniversary.

“It was a terrific night to reflect and celebrate 75 years as New Zealand’s oldest political youth movement”, says Young Nats President Daniel Fielding.

“The Ball also gave us a unique opportunity to do something special and highlight the remarkable contribution young people make to our country.

“We held a charity auction to raise funds for the UC Student Volunteer Army in Christchurch to aid their rebuild effort.”

The charity auction raised over $10,000 for the UC Student Volunteer Army who will use these funds for their ongoing work in Canterbury.

“The choice to support the UC Student Volunteer Army was an easy one, it’s about young people backing each other. We couldn’t think of any greater way than to use our networks, ideas and abilities to support those in Christchurch who need our help most”, says Mr Fielding.

“I would like to thank everyone who has joined the Young Nats journey over the last 75 years, the team who put the Ball together, and especially to all those who gave generous support to the auction for the UC Student Volunteer Army.”
