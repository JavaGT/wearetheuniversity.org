Union games leave Students Behind

**Union games leave Students Behind**

Young Nationals are standing up for students, parents and taxpayers as trade unions begin work to undermine core public services in New Zealand, such as Education.

Today students up and down the country were subjected to the start of the PPTA’s rolling attack on our nation’s education system after the PPTA refused to negotiate rewards for teachers.

Core public services such as education are being undermined by unions in order to advance the politically-motivated games of Kate Gainsford and other union leaders. This does not empower young New Zealanders to realise their dreams and goals and only leaves good teachers out in the cold.

Unions such as the PPTA lack the professionalism and focus to effectively negotiate rewards for top teachers who liberate students through providing these skills every day.

“Education is a key investment. All students deserve a stable environment where they can develop internationally competitive and innovative skills” says Young Nationals Vice President, Zach Castles.

Young Nationals believe quality teachers deserve better representation.

“War with the public is not the answer. If Kate Gainsford really does care about education why hasn’t she talked to the students she is affecting face-to-face instead of hiding behind extravagant full-page letters to the herald?” says Castles.

“We are calling on the government to stand by its commitment to workplace reform and to explore a range of viable alternatives which protect students and reward top teachers. Individual contracts, Performance Based Pay and Bulk funding are only some of the initiatives that could be implemented if we are to give students and teachers the respect they deserve”.
