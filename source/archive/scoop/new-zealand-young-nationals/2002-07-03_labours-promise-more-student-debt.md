Labour's Promise: More Student Debt
===================================

**Wednesday, 3 July 2002, 9:45 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Young Nationals](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals)**

2 July 2002

"An exercise in irrelevancy designed to convince students that student debt is not ballooning out of control," was how Grant Tyrrell, Young Nationals Chair, described the Labour Tertiary release today.

"Under the current government - which campaigned on reducing student debt - students now owe over $5 billion dollars. In just two and a half years of Labour government there has been an increase of over two billion dollars.

"If Labour were serious about bringing student debt under control they would do more than nebulous promises relating to allowance availability.

"National will be releasing its policy very shortly and will focus on keeping graduates in New Zealand and reducing the debt burden.

"National is the only party that will deliver for students and graduates," Grant Tyrrell concluded.
