An opt-in Choice, not an opt-out Alternative
============================================

**Thursday, 24 September 2009, 9:28 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Young Nationals](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Young_Nationals)**

  
23 September 2009                   Media Statement

Student Union Membership:

  
An opt-in Choice, not an opt-out Alternative  
   
   
Young Nats welcome the news that the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill has won the support of Parliament and will now head to Select Committee.  
   
"We congratulate every Member of Parliament who supported this bill through to the next stage," says Daniel Fielding, Young Nats President.  
    
"Currently students remain the only group in society still forced to join a union. Students don't have a choice - they're compelled to be a 'card carrying' union member.  
   
“We strongly support student associations at our tertiary institutions and encourage student involvement on our campuses. Many of our members are involved in student association activities and university campus life"  
   
“But being forced to pay a union membership levy - in fact having to join the union in order to enrol as a student - is at odds with the way every other sector of society is treated”  
   
"This is a debate which needs to be had. We look forward to the select committee's consideration."  
   
ENDS
