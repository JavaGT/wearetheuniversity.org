Young Nats support calls for compulsory financial literacy

The New Zealand Young Nats support renewed calls for compulsory financial literacy in New Zealand schools.

A study conducted by the Westpac Massey University Financial Education Centre has once again identified the lack of financial skills amongst young people as a serious challenge for our future workforce.

The Young Nats have been strong advocates for compulsory financial literacy in secondary schools for a number of years, with the widely supported policy proposed at the 2014 National Party conference.

“Financial skills are essential for young people entering the workplace and supporting themselves for the first time. Our secondary schools need to be doing their part to help prepare young people for the realities they face once they are out on their own.” Young Nats Policy Chair, Ben Bell says

“The Young Nats stand firm on our established view that compulsory financial literacy is a necessary measure, and we encourage the government to take bold steps and help ensure that this generation of New Zealanders are financially competent.”
