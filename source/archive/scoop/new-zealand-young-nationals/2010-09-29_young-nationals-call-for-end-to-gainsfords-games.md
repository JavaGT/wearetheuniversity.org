Young Nationals call for End to Gainsford’s Games

  
The New Zealand Young Nationals are concerned at PPTA President, Kate Gainsford’s latest threats of lockouts and strikes that seek to undermine the educational quality that our students deserve.

Announcements by Gainsford yesterday of the potential for lockouts in conjunction with eight planned strikes in term four will damage the achievement and opportunities of New Zealand students.

“The politically-motivated games being played by Kate Gainsford and the PPTA are a disgraceful attempt to undermine the government’s solutions to providing quality education for all students and must end”, says Young Nats Vice President, Zach Castles.

“It’s time for Gainsford and the PPTA to acknowledge that their agenda is putting the education of thousands of young New Zealanders at risk.”

We need to honour the work and energy that good teachers contribute to education which transforms and grows the minds of thousands of New Zealand students every day.

“We are appealing to the PPTA to acknowledge that all New Zealanders are behind them in providing quality education to students, we have a government that is willing and enthusiastic to work for an outcome that safeguards and protects the futures and opportunities of young New Zealanders”.
