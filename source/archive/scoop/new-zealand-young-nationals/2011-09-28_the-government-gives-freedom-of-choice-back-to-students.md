**The Government gives freedom of choice back to students**

Young Nats welcome the passing of the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill by Parliament today.

“Today the Government has given freedom of choice back to students,” says Daniel Fielding, Young Nats President.

“Students will no longer be the only group in society still forced to join a union. Students will now have a choice – rather then being compelled to be a 'card carrying' union member.”

“This law won’t see the end of student unions, merely by removing the compulsory element student unions will now have to be accountable to their members and offer services that are actually wanted if they want to retain their membership.”

The Young Nats would particularly like to thank Hon. Heather Roy, Louise Upston and all the National MPs on the Education and Science Select Committee for their support.

“The Young Nats will continue to strongly support student associations at our tertiary institutions and encourage student involvement on our campuses,” says Daniel Fielding.
