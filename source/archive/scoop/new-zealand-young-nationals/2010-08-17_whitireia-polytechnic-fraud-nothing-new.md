Whitireia Polytechnic Fraud – Nothing New

The Young Nats renew their call on the Hon Steven Joyce to support legislation that will give students a choice as to whether they join a student union.

The Freedom of Association Bill, currently before the Education Select Committee, if passed will make membership of student unions voluntary.

“The news that a police investigation has begun into fraud allegations totaling $750,000 from Whitireia Polytechnic students' association funds is nothing new, but merely the latest example in a long history of fraud, financial waste and irresponsibility by student unions,” says Daniel Fielding, Young Nats President.

“The plain reality is compulsory membership removes accountability from student unions, whose incomes are forcibly guaranteed regardless of services provided or actions taken.

"The sad thing is students are the ones who are losing out. Students are forced to pay a levy regardless of whether they will use the services their fee provides and these levies add an estimated $10m to student debt every year.

“Our support is with the students of Whitireia who are demanding answers and have signed a petition calling for fresh elections.

"While voluntary membership won’t solve all the problems it will introduce a system of financial accountability for student unions.

"We believe this Government has a responsibility to give choice back to students," says Daniel Fielding.
