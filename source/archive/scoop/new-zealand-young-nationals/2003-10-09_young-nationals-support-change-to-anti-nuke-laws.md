Young Nationals support change to anti-nuke laws

Young Nationals support change to anti-nuke legislation

"An affront to democracy and free speech" was how New Zealand Young Nationals Chairman Jamie Simpson described protesters who prevented US Ambassador Swindells from delivering his important speech yesterday at Victoria University.

"The New Zealand Young Nationals are impressed with the clarity of Ambassador Swindells' analysis of the US/New Zealand relationship and unequivocally back the call for New Zealand to revisit the nuclear issue.

"It is time for New Zealand to address the nuclear issue and look to the future.

"It is in New Zealand's interests to create a mutually beneficial trade and defence relationship with our 'very good friends' and former ally, the United States. It is nonsensical that the barrier between our countries is a hysterical confusion between nuclear power and nuclear weapons. The United States are asking the question, but Prime Minister Helen Clark is not listening.

"It is a continuing slap in the face to an old ally and friend," Jamie Simpson says.

"The New Zealand Young Nationals continue to support the amendment of the nuclear free legislation that would allow our allies' nuclear powered vessels to visit and will be prevailing this point upon the current National Party review on the issue," Jamie Simpson concluded.
