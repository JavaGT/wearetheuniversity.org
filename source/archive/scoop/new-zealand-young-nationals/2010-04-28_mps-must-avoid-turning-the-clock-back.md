MPs must avoid turning the clock back
=====================================

**Young Nats call on MPs to avoid turning the clock back  
**  
“In 1999, the right decision was made. Turning back the clock and raising the ‘drinking age’ doesn’t solve the actual problem” Young Nats Southern Region Chairman Liam Kernaghan said today.

“The cliché is still as relevant as it was back in 1999; the issue isn’t at what age we drink – it’s how we drink. Instead of employing a nanny-state approach to law making, what we should be doing is placing more of the onus on personal responsibility. Obviously the current laws are not enough of a deterrent when it comes to drinking.”

In 1999, Parliament voted to change the age of purchase from 20 to 18. 59 MPs voted to make it 18, and 55 of them voted to retain 20. The previous law had numerous exemptions to it, so in fact 18 year olds had been able to legally drink alcohol in licensed premises for many decades.

"There are real problems caused by alcohol in society. To raise the purchase age to 20 wouldn’t solve these problems. The reality is, if 18 and 19 year olds want to drink, there are avenues around such a purchase age. What the Government needs to do is look at those issues, instead of unfairly disadvantaging those who do drink in moderation.”

“Students at Otago know how to have a good time, and most people keep their drinking under control. The situations which get out of hand need attention, and those responsible need tougher penalties.”

According to 2006 statistics from the A.L.A.C. website, 65% of heavy drinkers are over 30 years old, and 46% of heavy drinkers earn more than $50,000.

"It's not just youth who are binge drinking. The report amounts to a grandiose "political finger pointing" at youth because it's easier to use us as a scapegoat."

Closing times of “effectively 2am" won’t solve the problem either. “Most people want to enjoy their night out, and shutting everything down effectively at 2am will curb that. What we'll see is more teenagers on the streets causing problems.”

“We’ve been allowed to vote, marry, smoke, buy instant kiwi tickets and join the army for a reason. At 18 we’re supposed to be reasoned adults. Let’s use the same ratio on drinking, and instead of infringing on those responsible mature teens, target where help is really needed”.

The Young Nats have teamed up with Young Labour, Young Greens and ACT on Campus to fight the law commission proposals and Keep it 18. "We intend to fight to make sure this discrimination doesn’t make it to the Governor General.”
