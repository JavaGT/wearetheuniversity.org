Exam delaysdue to Labour’s mismanagement

University delays exams due to Labour’s mismanagement

The Northern Region Young Nationals are outraged that the University of Auckland has had to reschedule exams as a result of Auckland’s power cut last Monday.

“Exams that had been scheduled for Monday have now been postponed to the 27th of June. This delay has meant some students now face the considerable inconvenience of sitting their exam much later than they had planned” says Northern Region Chair, Daniel Fielding.

“While the University should be given due credit for making alternative arrangements for students who are unable to sit their exam on the 27th, this simply opens a Pandora’s box.”

Fielding says that not only will students from other part of the country have to pay extra to reschedule their flights home, but students sitting their exams on separate days will now be able to discuss what was in them.

“This has the potential to undermine the credibility of exam results” says Fielding.

Northern Region Deputy Chair, Jamie Turner, says neither students nor the University should be blamed.

Turner says that Labour’s interest free student loans seem to have come at a cost – an inability to provide adequate infrastructure to power the University.

“It is unforgivable of Labour to promise something as lucrative as interest free student loans, and then fail to provide the infrastructure the use of student loans needs!”

“If destroying the reputation of our largest University is what Labour calls ‘economic transformation’, then God help us. Labour needs to start paying greater attention to the spin-off effects of their mismanagement.”
