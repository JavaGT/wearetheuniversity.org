Students Association fails students again

"NZUSA has again shown a complete disregard for the actual opinions of the students it claims to represent" says New Zealand Young Nationals President, Jamie Simpson.

Only ninety minutes after the release of National's student loan policy, the New Zealand Students Association had blindly criticised the policy, claiming students do not see it as being effective.

"The comments by the union are typical of an organisation where student's views play a secondary role to the personal political opinions of the officeholders."

Not only are students forced to be members of the organisation, but views not necessarily their own are published in their name without consultation.

"Our organisation welcomes relief for those struggling with large student loans after graduation. Here is a policy based on sound principles which addresses the 460,000 people in New Zealand who currently have, or who will graduate with student loans", says Mr Simpson.

"NZUSA has its head in the clouds - it continues to pursue unrealistic goals and its members will continue to be disappointed".

"National's policy is one I whole-heartedly support, and shows Don Brash and the National's Party's commitment to easing the tax burden on some of our best and brightest - giving them greater incentives to stay in New Zealand" says Jamie Simpson.
