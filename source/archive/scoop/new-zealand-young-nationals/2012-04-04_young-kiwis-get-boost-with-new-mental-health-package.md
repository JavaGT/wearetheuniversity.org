**Young Kiwis get boost with New Mental Health Package**

The New Zealand Young Nationals have welcomed the $62 million package to support young Kiwis affected by mental illness, announced today by Prime Minister John Key.

“This transformative package led by the Prime Minister marks a change our organisation has been pushing for, for over a year,” says Young Nats spokesperson, Sean Topham.

“We seized the opportunity to raise this issue at the National Party Conference in 2011, where we proposed the need to prioritise funding into areas relating to youth mental health.”

The initiatives outlined by the Prime Minister include tailored services, both online and in Schools, to help young Kiwis confronted with mental health problems.

“One in five of our peers will experience some form of mental health problem as they transition through their teenage years, this package will make a meaningful difference as it provides better, faster and more modern assistance.

“Far too many of our friends and families have had to face the tragic effects mental illnesses can have on young people

“We are proud to have brought this issue to the table and grateful that our Prime Minister is leading initiatives to improve the lives of thousands of young Kiwis affected by mental health problems,” says Sean Topham.
