Student Union Decision Shows Labour Full Of Communists

Young Nationals today expressed disappointment at Labours decision to repeal the Education Amendment Act 1998, which gives students the right to decide whether they wish to have voluntary or compulsory membership of student unions.

'The communists in Labour are clearly running the show!', said Nationals Youth Vice President Daniel Gordon.

'This decision is loopy, and it stinks of old-fashioned pandering to the radical student groups - who have always been a powerful force in the Labour and Alliance parties.'

'It is obvious the ultra-left faction of the Labour Party is running the government. Only a government full of communists would repeal legislation that not only gives students the right to decide what they spend their money on, but has been embraced by students as the only fair way of deciding how to run the associations.'

'The legislation, enacted in 1998, not only works but is fair. It means that students can decide whether they value the right to choose, or whether they value compulsory membership. 2 of the 5 major universities have gone to a voluntary system as a result, and despite claims that the world was going to end, there is still life at these campuses. Students at both Auckland and Waikato Universities, who now have a voluntary system, have not starved. Activities and clubs still exist, and all essential services are still available to everyone. The only difference is that the various communist student radicals who fill these associations, now have to justify themselves and their spending.'

'The majority of students will not benefit in the slightest from Labours decision. Indeed, the only people who opposed the 1998 legislation were the self-interested student union flunkies themselves. These are the same people who been known to chain themselves to public toilets, occupy university registry buildings and demand free food and blankets while doing so, and use student money to buy jetboats and fly to conferences overseas'

'This decision is further evidence of Labours high-handed 'we know best' attitude to students. Helen Clark has already demonstrated as Prime Minister that you are not allowed to disagree with her if you work for the public service.'

'This principle is being extended further -- if you are student, you cannot disagree with Helen. You WILL join a student union, and your money WILL be spent on buying jetboats, and if you don't like it, Helen will give you a detention!!', concluded Daniel Gordon.

Ends.
