Helen Is To Honesty What Rodney Is To The Rumba

  
The Northern Region Young Nationals are to unveil a set of new promotional stickers at Auckland University’s second semester orientation week on Monday the 17th of July.

“Vote Labour: Cheer for the Wallabies in 2016 – an apt summation of the current situation under this tired Labour Government” says Northern Region Chair, Daniel Fielding.

“With several National Party MP’s attending on Monday, including John Key and Wayne Mapp, the day looks set to be a ripper” he says.

Northern Region Deputy Chair, Jamie Turner, says that the stickers will no doubt ruffle a few feathers in the Young Labour camp.

“These stickers provide a humorous look at the state of New Zealand under Labour. We really want to bring politics to a level that is more comfortable for University students” says Turner.

“Labour is not only taxing our talent, but they are also making Australia a better place. I challenge Labour to find their sense of humour and see the utterly comical situation they have created.”
