Young Nationals Oppose Changes To The Drinking Age
==================================================

Young Nationals have strongly criticised the suggestion that the drinking age be raised.

"Phil Goff and Helen Clark voted against standardising the drinking age to 18 and have been looking for an excuse to raise it ever since," said Young National’s Chair Daniel Gordon.

"We would not be seeing the current problems of binge drinking by teenagers to such an extent if the liquor laws were being enforced properly. Bottle stores and bars need to be tougher on ID, and the police need to be adequately funded to enforce the law."

"The police can only do so much. Why are the teenagers out so late in the first place? Why do parents seem to have little or no control over their teenagers actions? "

"The drinking age is a separate issue to binge drinking by teenagers, and needs to be addressed within the existing law rather than forcing through another wholesale law change. Raising the drinking age again would be a disaster. It would force thousands of responsible drinkers out onto the streets, and lead to even more binge drinking.”

"Phil Goff and Helen Clark should not let a minority of trouble makers ruin the system for the vast majority of young, responsible drinkers."

"There are many responsible people out enjoying a social drink and it is a minority spoiling it for the rest.”

“Young Nationals strongly support the status quo. I urge all MP's to support enforcement of the current law rather than making unnecessary changes to it," concluded Daniel Gordon.
