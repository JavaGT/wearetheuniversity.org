YOUNG NATS SHOW COMMITMENT TO EQUALITY

Young Nationals at their annual policy conference have come out strongly in favour of equal rights for same sex couples, and the decriminalisation of solicitation.

In an impassioned debate, the conference resolved that \"Young Nationals firmly support equal rights for same sex couples in all areas of New Zealand law."

The conference overwhelmingly supported the policy, wanting to show a real commitment to an inclusive and diverse society. Previous Young Nationals policy has been for same sex couples to have equal rights to de facto heterosexual couples. This goes further in not specifically excluding marriage and adoption.

"We congratulate leader Jenny Shipley, who kick started the debate on the issue by deciding to have the Justice Ministry in 1999 review all existing discrimination for same sex couples under New Zealand law," said National's Youth Vice President Daniel Gordon.

In a related debate, Young Nationals also resolved "that solicitation by sex workers be decriminalised." The main issue here was the hypocrisy of the current law, where it is legal for quote "clients" to ask for sex for money, but not for "workers" to offer sex for money. This anomaly is anachronistic and should have been changed years ago. We urge the Labour Alliance minority government to introduce legislation to end this discrimination as soon as possible.

"I am proud of this years conference, which has demonstrated that Young Nationals are committed to advancing both economically liberal and socially liberal policies," concluded Daniel Gordon.
