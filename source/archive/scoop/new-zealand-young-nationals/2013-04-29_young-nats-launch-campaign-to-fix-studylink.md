Young Nats launch campaign to fix StudyLink

The Young Nats have launched a campaign seeking feedback from students on problems they have had with StudyLink.

“We have set up a website for students to tell us about their experiences with StudyLink and how they might improve it. We will be compiling this feedback and presenting it to Tertiary Education Minister, Steven Joyce and Associate Minister for Social Development, Chester Borrows” says Young Nats President, Sean Topham.

Problems with StudyLink have been extensively talked about by students, and now's the time to act. The Young Nats are aiming to collate and clarify these concerns in order to lobby for decent solutions.

“Whether it’s speed, user friendliness, or woes with the application process, this is a chance for students to have a vent, share their views and be listened to" says Topham.

"This is a grassroots opportunity for students to express their concerns about StudyLink, and for those concerns to be acted on."
