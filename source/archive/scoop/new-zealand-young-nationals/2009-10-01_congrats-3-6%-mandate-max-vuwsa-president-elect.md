Media Statement

Congrats 3.6% Mandate Max, VUWSA President-Elect

For Immediate distribution

Victoria University Young Nats congratulate Max Hardy, recently elected VUWSA president for 2010.

"We congratulate Max for his top effort in securing a majority for the win," says Christian Lambert, Vic Uni Young Nats President.

"It's interesting though - VUWSA, the student union to which every student is compelled to belong, boasts a membership of 22,333 students.

"Yet an overwhelming 94% of these 22,333 members also didn't vote in this annual election, despite the fact VUWSA voting is electronic and accessible. This poor turnout means that Max only won 3.6% of all eligible votes in VUWSA.

"You'd think with ballot papers distributed directly to every member's personal email that more union members would've voted.

"It raises the question - why haven't more voted?

"These 22,333 members don't get to decide whether they want to be a part of the Student Union - under current legislation, they are forced to be a member and pay a union fee of $131.90 if they want to enrol as a student," says Christian.

"Currently students remain the only group in society still forced to join a union.

"However, when all is said and done we look forward to mandated 3.6% Max's leadership next year - as compelled 'card carrying' union members we don't have a choice otherwise.

"Max is on the record promising to fight against allowing students the decision of whether they would like to be part of the Union. During the campaign he also acknowledged that if his views ran contrary to the majority he will go with what the students wanted. We do wonder where he stands given the 3.6% mandate and 6.5% turnout.

"We look forward to see him come through on his rhetoric to stand for services, not politics."

**Fun Facts and Figures:**

6.5% number of students who voted for VUWSA President  
6.5% currently the number Phil-in-who Goff is polling at  
3.6% number of students who voted for Max  
3.6% the margin of error the Phil-in-who Goff poll might have - but not likely
