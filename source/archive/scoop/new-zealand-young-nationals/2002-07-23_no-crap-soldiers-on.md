NO CRAP soldiers on.

The controversial youth political website www.nocrap.org.nz http://www.nocrap.org.nz/ has received it's second complaint to the Electoral Commission, with claims the site encourages violence and features inappropriate language and content.\*

"The complainants are taking themselves far too seriously," says spokesperson Jamie Simpson. "Anyone with a sense of humour can appreciate this site. We have no intentions of removing any of the offending content.

"The site is all about making politics less boring and serious, and more interesting for young people."

The site was built by a group of young people from around the country who believe that National is the best choice this election.

"The internet is one of the most effective ways to reach people and get our message across. So far the site has been a huge success, with over a hundred thousand hits and overwhelmingly positive feedback."

The entertaining and provocative site features a guide to all political parties, jokes, satire, competitions, photos and interactive polls. The site is updated regularly.

To whom it may concern

I would like to lay a complaint over the National Party's youth website "No Crap." In particular I would like to know whether the following content is acceptable for an official political website:

\-Jokes about Bill Clinton and oral sex  
\-A sexually suggestive picture of MP George Hawkins  
\-Use of profanities, including the F and S words  
\-A link to a "picture of a man with a huge cock"

I do not believe this kind of garbage should be allowed to be published in the buildup to a general election.

Yours sincerely

Subject: Questionable content on website run by National party

Hello,

I'm writing in regards to some content located at http://www.nocrap.org.nz/hippies.htm which is a site being run by the National Party as part of their campaign. I'm particularly concerned about how this particular page seems to be advocating the use of violence as an effective means of expressing your opinion.

Thanks,  
xxxx
