**New model for tertiary funding good for students**

The New Zealand Young Nats support the Hon Steven Joyce’s performance linked funding proposal as a new model for tertiary education providers.

“This sensible approach to funding will provide incentives for educators to continually improve the educational performance of students,” says Daniel Fielding, Young Nats President.

“But it also ensures that students can be confident that they are getting a quality degree and their opportunities after study are maximised.”

The proposal will base 5% of providers funding from 2012 on four key indicators.

These are course completion, qualification completion, progression to higher study, and the number of student’s retained in study.

The financial incentives to providers to continually improve their performance, and provide an environment that maximises course completion and ensures the quality of the courses being taught is beneficial to both the taxpayer and students.
