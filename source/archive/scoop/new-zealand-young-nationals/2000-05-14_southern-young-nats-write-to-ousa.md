PRESS RELEASE

For Immediate Delivery  
13 May 2000

  
OPEN LETTER TO OUSA EXECUTIVE

  
Running OUSA is a million dollar per annum business, not a power game for students. The instability that has ripped through the Executive, coupled with the ongoing budgetary problems, is unacceptable and must be urgently rectified.

The current constitutional crisis highlights the improvements needed in the running of OUSA. Given that no mediator has been appointed to resolve the ongoing rift between the Executive and the President, it is not surprising that there has not been a satisfactory resolution.

Pointing the finger of blame is futile. Resolving this crisis is of paramount importance for the membership, and effective administration, of OUSA. The Southern Young Nationals wish to offer their services in mediation of this issue, in a hope that a satisfactory outcome can be reached for OUSA members, the Executive, and President.
