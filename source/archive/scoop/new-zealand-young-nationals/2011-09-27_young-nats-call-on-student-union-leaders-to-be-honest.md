Young Nats call on student union leaders to be honest.

The Young Nats are calling on all student union leaders to be honest  
when talking to students - and the media - about Voluntary Student  
Union Membership.

"This is a debate about fundamental basics. Its about giving students  
a choice in whether they sign up or don't sign up to a union," says  
Daniel Fielding, Young Nats President.

“Throughout the debate on voluntary union membership we've seen vacant  
rhetoric and partisan politics from those who believe in compelling  
union membership.”

“But the tactics we've seen in the last few days have really beggars  
belief. Going around lecture theatres scaremongering students is not  
getting on with the job they were elected to do."

"The Young Nats strongly support student associations at our tertiary  
institutions and encourage student involvement on our campuses - that  
is, where students want to be involved."

"We call on the student union leaders to represent the facts, not the  
fiction," says Daniel Fielding.
