Labour must not be alone

Labour must have a coalition partner after the next election says Lincoln University Students’ Association President, Greg Henderson.

“From the polling and after the latest NBR study, it seems as though Labour may be able to form a government without a coalition partner,” said Henderson.

“In order for students to get the best deal possible, the coalition partner that is chosen must have a prioritised Tertiary Education Policy,” said Henderson, “this is what I am going to be fighting for and what the whole country needs if a Knowledge Society is to exist.”

“The country, if it wants to grow into a strong economy, must vote education in the upcoming election,” said Henderson, “we look forward to any government who treats students well and is serious about a knowledge economy.”
