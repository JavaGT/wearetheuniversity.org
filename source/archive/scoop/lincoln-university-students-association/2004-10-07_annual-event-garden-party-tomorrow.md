Lincoln University Students’ Association to host annual event ‘Garden Party’ tomorrow

The Lincoln University Students’ Association annual event, the Garden Party will be held tomorrow, the 8th of October after months of planning and preparation.

Campus events manager Stephen Firth, the organiser of the Garden Party this year, is hoping for ‘good weather and lots of fun, safe fun that is.’

The garden party has been held as Lincoln University Students’ Associations’ annual event for at least 15 years, and has enjoyed amazing successes including infamous shenanigans from Lincoln students.

‘Generally students dress up in teams, and so the crowds are diverse to say the least!’ said one Lincoln Student.

‘It is always held on the last day of lectures, so most lecturers take pity and schedule their exam reviews the day before garden party, sometimes you even see your lecturers there!’ said another Lincoln student.

‘Garden party is the one event everyone looks forward to, the rest of the university almost shuts down for it.’ said another excited student.

This year the renowned Dunedin band Dejavoodoo will be playing, with a couple of other local bands, and tickets are open to anyone who wants to come, at $15 they are a bargain.
