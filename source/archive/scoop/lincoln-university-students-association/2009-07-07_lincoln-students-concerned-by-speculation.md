Lincoln Students concerned by speculation

Lincoln Students concerned by speculation.  
Tuesday 7th July 2009,  
Press Release: Lincoln University Students’ Association.

With recent failed “amalgamation” talks with CRI AgResearch, speculation on merging with other universities, and today the $1.3M deficit surfacing in the Lincoln University 2008 Annual Report, students are today voicing real concerns over the state and future of the institution they study at.

“I’m concerned these deficits and falling student numbers are going to be used as a reason for the university to hike my fees, with no real increases in quality” says Resource Studies student Katie. “Whatever comes next, the university needs to keep its commitments to current students without charging us more for the same outcome”.

Courtney, a recent Environmental Management Graduate is worried about how mergers or speculative publicity might reduce the credibility of her degree. “Mixed messages are extremely unfair on students or those looking to come to Lincoln as the credibility and stability of the university are the basis of our future careers and employability”.

  
The Lincoln University Students Association President, Megan Harte, in talking with students, sees merit in investigating all future options that benefit students, and welcomes involvement and transparency in whatever is on the books for the university. Pete, a 3rd year Environmental Science student says the university needs to “consult students through the entire process, communicating will yield the better results, instead of keeping us in the dark about everything”.

“The most important thing in any future discussions is safeguarding and furthering the quality of educational experience for students and the reputation of the degrees they are pursuing” says Miss Harte. “That is a conversation for all of us to have, not just behind closed doors”
