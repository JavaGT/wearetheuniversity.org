Students Want Return From 3.4% Fee Increase
===========================================

Lincoln students want something back from 3.4% fee increase.

Lincoln University voted a week ago at a Council meeting to increase domestic student fees for 2004 by an average of 3.4%.

"I think students will be angry and disappointed that they will end up paying in some instances 100's of dollars more in fees next year without good reason." Said Andrew Kirton, Lincoln University Students' Association President.

Mr. Kirton is calling on the university to now give something back to students, in the form of new facilities, new services or an increase in academic quality.

"Otherwise the fee increase becomes yet another revenue generating exercise to impress Wellington at the expense of students." Kirton said.

Mr. Kirton warned the University not to be drawn into a "zombie-like mentality" of annual fee increases without reason.

"Students can and will get angry very quickly if Lincoln continues to put revenue before their welfare and education." Kirton said.

"The University has cited the need to meet revenue projections as the main driver behind the fee increase - cold comfort for the students actually sitting in the lecture theatres paying all this extra money just so the university management look good." Kirton said.
