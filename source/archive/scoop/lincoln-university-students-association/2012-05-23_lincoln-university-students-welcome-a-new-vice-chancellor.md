Lincoln University Students Welcome a New Vice Chancellor

**Lincoln University Students Welcome a New Vice Chancellor**

Lincoln University students officially welcomed their new Vice Chancellor, Dr Andy West, today in a special ceremony. The event took place on campus with over 50 student representatives in attendance.

The Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA) felt that it was important for students _themselves_ to be able to welcome Dr West to the campus and have the opportunity to talk with him one on one.

LUSA President Kent Lloyd comments “We (LUSA) saw this occasion as a way to engage students with the Vice Chancellor and in turn continue to build strong relationships between the students and the University’s management”.

The Welcome also served as an indication of things to come. “It is important that we as students and LUSA have a healthy relationship with the University, and Dr West seems keen to ensure this happens” said Lloyd.

The event was very student-centric, with many of the student groups on campus being represented. The Food Appreciation Club catered for the event and other attendees included representatives from many other clubs which are also supported by the Association. Other student groups, including Te Awhioraki, the Maori Students’ Association, some Class Representatives and Future Leaders were also present.

“The students welcome was a great success, and it was good to see students and the Vice Chancellor talking like they were old friends. With many changes taking place on campus, LUSA looks forward to further engagement with Dr West as the year continues”, concluded Lloyd.
