Students Celebrate at Lincoln University's Annual Garden Party

Almost 2000 students let their hair loose as they revelled at the 2010 Lincoln University Garden Party today. Organised by the Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA), this annual celebration is the last large-scale event on the LUSA calendar for the year.

“Garden Party has become an institution at Lincoln University and is the highlight of the year for many students”, says Lincoln University Students’ Association President, Ivy Harper. “The event is so well organised and involves a huge number of people including staff and students. Garden Party has its own unique atmosphere and is known for its creative, inspired and sometimes very ‘original’ costumes with many students spending weeks on their design”, says Ivy Harper.

This year the top music billing went to bands Elemeno P, Computers Want Me Dead, Kidz in Space, and The Checks with DJ Enriched in full support. Students praised Garden Party for its organization and atmosphere with many students visiting from other universities.

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field says, “Garden Party is a colourful and enjoyable event that marks the end of lectures and allows students to let off steam before examination preparation begins. The University appreciates the role played by the Lincoln University Students’ Association in organising the Garden Party and prioritising host responsibility requirements”.  
“As a Students’ Association, LUSA tries very hard to target different sectors of the student community and many of our events such as Winterfest, International Night and Garden Party succeed in doing this. Garden Party is the opportunity for students to relax and have fun after a long year of study. This year has been particularly trying for a number of reasons”, says Ivy Harper.

The Association has been beset this year with a number of challenges including issues surrounding the recent Canterbury earthquake, and the long-running Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill, which if passed will have a devastating impact on students associations throughout New Zealand.

“This week we have continued to raise awareness and highlight to students and staff the effects of the Bill as it heads into the Second reading”, says Ivy Harper. Events like Garden Party, International Night and many other events and services that LUSA (like other associations) will be compromised or cease to exist should the Bill be passed. “It would be interesting to see how much money such events like Garden Party actually bring to the local economy and when you consider the number of universities and polytechnics throughout New Zealand, that’s a lot of money going back into the community”, says Ivy Harper. The Association urges the Government to reconsider their stance on the Bill.
