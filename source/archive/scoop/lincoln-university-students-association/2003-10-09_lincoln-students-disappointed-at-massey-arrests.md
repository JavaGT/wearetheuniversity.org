Lincoln students disappointed at Massey arrests

Lincoln students disappointed at Massey arrests.

Lincoln University students are disappointed at the arrest of students during a protest against fee increases today at Massey University.

“Given what supposed protesters have gotten away with lately, arresting a group of students protesting fee increases at a public institution is disgraceful. The acting Massey Vice Chancellor should be ashamed of himself.” Kirton said.

Kirton said that the fee issue will not go away and students around the country will not be deterred by these arrests.

“Students will not be prevented from exercising their democratic right to protest by anyone. We feel there is absolutely no justification for fee increases, and surely we have a right to voice this opinion without persecution.” Kirton said.
