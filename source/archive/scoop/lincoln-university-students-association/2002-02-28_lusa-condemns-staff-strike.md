LUSA Condemns Staff Strike
==========================

**Press Release: [Lincoln University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Lincoln_University_Students_Association)**

Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA) has today condemned the Academic Staff strike to be held on March 4th.

“We understand where the staff are coming from and we understand the need for quality in education for students,” said LUSA President Greg Henderson. “We do not however believe that the staff are using the correct methods to lobby for their pay raise.”

“The government is the group that funds Tertiary Education and the government is the group that should be lobbied,” said Henderson. “We do not believe that there is enough money within Lincoln University for the management to be able to afford the rise in pay that has been demanded by the staff union.”

“Quality of education is paramount and unless the government does something to increase funding of the system, we are going to get institutions offering sub-class degrees,” Henderson concluded.
