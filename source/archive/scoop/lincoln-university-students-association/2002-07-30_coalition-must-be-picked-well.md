Coalition must be picked well

Potential coalition partners or partnerships must be picked very well Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA) said today.

“In the wake of the election it seems as though no strict coalitions will be formed,” said Association President Greg Henderson.

“The United Future Party cannot work with the Green Party due to policy incompatibilities and the Government will not last if Labour co-aligns with the Green Party due to the moratorium on Genetic Modification,” said Henderson.

“There are several areas of concern for this Association, some of them specifically are Universal Allowances, Tertiary Funding, Genetic Modification and Cannabis,” said Henderson, “these areas must be remembered if any coalitions or relationships are formed.”

“LUSA looks forward to working with any government,” said Henderson, “any government must remember that students are the foundation of society and the government must remember to correctly fund the education system in light of this.”
