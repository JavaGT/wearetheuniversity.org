Students outraged at International student fees increase at Lincoln University

Students are outraged that Lincoln University has increased international student fees for 2005 without any regard for the impact on international students and their families.

"The University has shown complete disregard for international students and their families by further increasing international fees which are already set at exorbitant levels," said Josephine Newman, President of the Lincoln University Students' Association.

The fee increases are between 4.8 and 13.9 percent which is well above the rate of inflation.

"The fee increase is a greedy cash grab by the University who consider international students as cash cows to increase the University coffers, not real people engaged in a process of study and cultural exchange."

The fee increase comes after Lincoln University removed certainty for International students by scrapping Grandparenting of international student fees in 2004.

"Students are calling on the Lincoln University Council to reverse its decision to increase international student fees and re-introduce Grandparenting of international student fees," said Newman.

The Lincoln University Students' Association in conjunction with the New Zealand Students' Association will be hosting an international student's conference early next month to discuss how to win the campaign for Grandparenting of international student fees.
