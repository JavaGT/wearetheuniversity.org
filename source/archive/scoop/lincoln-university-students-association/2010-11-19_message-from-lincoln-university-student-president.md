Message from Lincoln University Student President

The Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA) welcomes students from Telford Rural Polytechnic, following the announcement yesterday by Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce that Lincoln University and Telford will merge. “Obviously negotiations have been in progress for a number of weeks and we are yet to work through the finer details with the University, but we extend a warm welcome to Telford students,” says Association President Ivy Harper.

The Association acknowledges the potential for students to progress at all levels from secondary school through to postgraduate research, and supports the merger on this basis. “Given that this merger will provide staircasing opportunities, LUSA supports this initiative, as it has obvious benefits for students” says Ivy Harper.

“Whilst LUSA welcomes the merger to support Lincoln University moving forward, there needs to be a wider public debate on the provision of tertiary education,” says Ivy Harper. The recent announcement of the proposal to merge Tairāwhiti Polytechnic and the Eastern Institute of Technology suggests the rationalization of Polytechnic across the sector. The approval to merge Lincoln University and Telford may see further merger proposals between Universities and Polytechnics in the future.
