Lincoln University Students Celebrate at Annual Garden Party
============================================================

Wearable Arts was the theme for the day as over 2500 students let their hair loose while they revelled at the 2011 Lincoln University Garden Party despite showers and a cool easterly. Organised by the Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA), this annual celebration is the last large-scale event on the LUSA calendar for the year.

“The end of the main academic year would not be complete without our annual Garden Party”, says Association President, Ivy Harper. “We have been planning for weeks and the day is going well despite the cooler weather”, notes Harper.

The acts at Garden Party this year include Midnight Youth, Minuit, Merchants of Flow and Maya Vanya. Students praised Garden Party for its organization and atmosphere with many students visiting from other universities.

“Obviously we are delighted that our students are able to participate in Garden Party after what have been such trying times for so many people in the region. Lincoln hosted a number of tertiary institutions earlier in the year and many of these students have returned including students from Canterbury and Christchurch Polytechnic“, says Harper.

The Association has been beset this year by a number of challenges issues related to the ongoing earthquakes and the long running Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill, which passed on 28 September amid a flurry of activity and protests from students throughout New Zealand.

“Students in Canterbury are continuing to face challenges as a result of the huge number of earthquakes. The passing of two pieces of legislation, the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill and the Education Amendment Bill No.4 which looks at compulsory Student Services Levies will also have a huge impact on all students. While LUSA will continue to support, advocate and represent students, the services that it provides and indeed that many student associations provide throughout New Zealand will be compromised now that these Bills have passed”, contends Harper.

“Our Vice-Chancellor, Roger Field has been very supportive of the Association and the Association’s stance against the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Act and it is hoped that this support will continue as we head into a new environment”, declares Harper.
