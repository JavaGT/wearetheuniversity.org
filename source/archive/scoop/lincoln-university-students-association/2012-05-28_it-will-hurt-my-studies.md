**‘It Will Hurt My Studies’**

The 2012 Budget leaves students with a tough decision as to whether they will or won’t seek a higher qualification, and whether or not they will stay in New Zealand at the conclusion of it. The Lincoln University Students’ Association (LUSA) has talked with students who are making these decisions.

LUSA President Kent Lloyd commented that “the decision to study at a post-grad level has now got even harder; these students study long hours and in many cases cannot afford to work part-time as well.”

Tim Gale, 30, is studying a Masters of Natural Resource Management, after completing a Bachelor of Environment Management and Planning at Lincoln University. Tim currently receives a Student Allowance and works one day a week.

Tim comments “I could work more (for income), but this would lead to an un-balanced lifestyle and would greatly affect my studies.” Further to this, he questioned where he would find an extra day to work with his already busy timetable. “The Masters programme is pretty full on” said Gale.

Tim questioned these changes and commented “if I knew these changes where coming into effect, I might not have started a Masters qualification. The personal costs of studying are getting higher, but I would question whether the benefits are increasing as well?”

Finally Tim concluded “the financial options overseas are starting to look better and better as a way to payback my loan.”

Jess Rae, 32, is studying a graduate entry Bachelor of Landscape Architecture and is looking to continue onto a Masters in Landscape Architecture at Lincoln University. Jess currently receives a Student Allowance and relies on this to live.

“(Landscape) Architecture has a big work load. In any average week we put 70 plus hours of work in and there is just no time for part time work if you want to get good marks” commented Rae.

Jess has been living off her Student Allowance and savings, but these changes could lead her to drop out as the costs will be too high. “I would look for other funding, but otherwise I would have to drop out” concluded Rae.

Lloyd comments “it is disappointing what Tim and Jess are considering given these changes. Our post graduates finding work offshore or incomplete qualifications are not good for New Zealand.”

“It is already a tough financial decision to study at a tertiary level, but it has immense benefits for our country. LUSA is not happy with the changes in the Budget for student support and we think New Zealand will suffer from it as our best and brightest continue to move offshore” concluded Lloyd.
