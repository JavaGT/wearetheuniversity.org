Ideas for a Free Society
========================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Business Roundtable](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Business_Roundtable)**

Ideas for a Free Society

The New Zealand Business Roundtable today launched the distribution of Ideas for a Free Society, a CD with a collection of texts about individual, social, economic and political freedom. More than 250 copies of the CD have been sent to businesspeople, universities, and media throughout New Zealand.

Ideas for a Free Society was compiled by the International Policy Network, a UK-based organisation dedicated to encouraging better public understanding of the role of the institutions of a free society in social and economic development.

“The CD is designed for those who are interested in the economic and political arrangements that lead to growth and prosperity and have the capacity to eliminate poverty”, said Roger Kerr, executive director of the New Zealand Business Roundtable.

The Business Roundtable has supported the project by purchasing the rights to produce a number of CDs for distribution to interested individuals and organisations in New Zealand.

Copies of the Ideas for a Free Society CD are available for purchase through the New Zealand Business Roundtable website: www.nzbr.org.nz
