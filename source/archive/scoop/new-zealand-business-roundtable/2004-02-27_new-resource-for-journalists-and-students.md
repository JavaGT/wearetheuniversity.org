Business Roundtable Launches New Resource for Journalists and Students

The New Zealand Business Roundtable today launched a new online resource designed for journalists, students, and others interested in public policy issues.

The Policy Backgrounder series will cover a variety of topics and present relevant economic analysis and research.

"The Business Roundtable has always sought to establish a strong research base to its policy advocacy," executive director Roger Kerr said today.

"The Policy Backgrounder series is a logical extension of our work, providing readers with an easy-to-access, thorough review of topical issues, and an extensive list of recommended reading."

Six Policy Backgrounders have so far been commissioned from independent authors, covering issues ranging from the minimum wage to US welfare reforms. They will be released over the coming months.

Today, the Business Roundtable published the first of these documents, examining Pay Equity.

Written by Wellington-based economist Justin Coutts of the Law and Economics Consulting Group, this document addresses the question: Are pay equity policies to close the 'pay gap' between men and women desirable?

This Policy Backgrounder is available from today on the NZBR website: www.nzbr.org.nz
