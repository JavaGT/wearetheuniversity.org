**Privatisation Expert to Speak at Business Roundtable Forum**

_Global Trends In Privatisation: Lessons for Maximising Economic gains_

US-based privatisation expert Professor William Megginson will address an audience of chief executives, politicians and academics at a CEO forum hosted by the New Zealand Business Roundtable in Wellington on Monday 8 August at 5.30pm.

Business Roundtable executive director Roger Kerr described Professor Megginson as one of the world’s leading academic authorities and researchers on privatisation of state-owned enterprises. He said the visit is of particular interest given the government’s stated intention to sell shareholdings in some state assets.

Professor Megginson is Professor and Rainbolt Chair in Finance at the University of Oklahoma’s Michael F. Price College of Business, and was named a George Lynn Cross Research Professor in April 2010. He is also executive director of _Privatisation Barometer,_ a thinktank promoting privatisation choices based on sound research.

His research has been frequently cited in academic and professional publications including the _Journal of Economic Literature_, the _Journal of Finance_, the _Journal of Financial Economics_, the _Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis_, and _Foreign Policy_. Articles he has written have been downloaded over 37,000 times from the Social Sciences Research Network, and his books and articles have been cited over 7,700 times.

Professor Megginson has served as a privatisation consultant for the New York Stock Exchange, the OECD, the IMF, the World Federation of Exchanges, and the World Bank. Prior to entering academia in 1986, he worked as a petroleum chemist at the world’s largest styrene monomer plant and at the largest independent petroleum refinery in the United States.
