Business Roundtable Backgrounder On Immigration
===============================================

Business Roundtable Releases Policy Backgrounder On Immigration

New Zealand should consider auctioning some portion of residence permits granted in any given year, according to a new Policy Backgrounder released by the Business Roundtable today.

The recommendation is contained in a new Business Roundtable Policy Backgrounder entitled Immigration Policy, which was prepared by Hayden Glass of the Law and Economics Consulting Group. The Policy Backgrounder will be available from today on the Business Roundtable website (www.nzbr.org.nz).

The Policy Backgrounder series is an online resource designed for journalists, students, and others interested in public policy issues.

“Immigration Policy discusses key issues facing decision-makers in formulating New Zealand’s immigration policy and it does so in an accessible manner, said Business Roundtable policy advisor Norman LaRocque.

The Policy Backgrounder argues there is no magic formula for determining the optimal size of New Zealand’s population or the ‘right’ number of migrants in any given year. It recommends that immigration policy be stable, transparent and predictable and that New Zealand should consider auctioning some portion of residence permits granted in any given year. This, according to the Policy Backgrounder, would allow New Zealand residents to capture more of the total benefits of immigration.
