**New Zealand’s Top University Debaters Go Head to Head in Business Roundtable’s Big Social Issues Debates**

  
The New Zealand Business Roundtable is hosting the _Big Social Issues Debates_, a national university debating tournament beginning in secondary schools on March 15 and finishing with a grand final to be hosted by Minister for Social Development Hon Paula Bennett on 24 March at the Academy Galleries in Wellington starting at 5.30pm.

The top debaters from Otago, Canterbury, Victoria and Auckland universities will face off on some of the key social issues facing New Zealand, with moots on education, welfare, health, crime and superannuation.

Six heats will be held in secondary schools in Wellington and Auckland. The two semi finals will be held at events for young professionals and students in Wellington on 18 March at Mac’s Brewery, and in Auckland on 23 March at the Gus Fisher Gallery, both starting at 5.30pm and followed by panel discussions featuring experts on the topics.

Among the topics to be debated are:

• _Student Loans Are a Rort on the Taxpayer_

• _Our Liquor Laws are a Licence to Swill_

• _Our Police Ought to be Armed_

• _It’s Too Easy to Get into University_

• _It’s a Role of the State to Provide Moral Guidance_

Business Roundtable Chairman Rob McLeod said the debates were intended to draw out the issues and encourage young people to take an interest in important public policy issues.
