New Zealand Business Roundtable Hosts Liquor Debate

The New Zealand Business Roundtable is hosting an evening of debate and discussion on the current review of the liquor laws on Wednesday, 2 December. The event will be held at the Academy Galleries, in Wellington from 5.30pm to 7.00pm to an audience of young professionals and students.

Two top Victoria University debating teams will face off over the moot Our Liquor Laws are a Licence to Swill. The debate will be followed by a panel discussion chaired by Roger Kerr with Greg O’Connor, President, New Zealand Police Association and Liz Read, Corporate Affairs Director, Lion Nathan.

Business Roundtable Chairman Rob McLeod said the debate was intended to draw out the issues and encourage discussion.

“The Business Roundtable has an ongoing commitment to promoting quality debate on important public policy issues that face New Zealand”, said Mr McLeod. “Our aim is to provide a lively forum for stimulating thinking and discussion.”

The event is a prelude for The Big Social Issues Debates, a New Zealand-wide university debating tournament being held early next year by the Business Roundtable.
