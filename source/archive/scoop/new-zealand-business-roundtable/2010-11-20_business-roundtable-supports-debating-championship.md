**Business Roundtable Supports World Class Debating Championship**

The Business Roundtable is proud to continue its association with debating in New Zealand by sponsoring the Grand Final of the British Parliamentary Debating Championships to be hosted by Hon Chris Finlayson on behalf of the Victoria University Debating Society at the Legislative Council Chamber on Sunday 21 November from 5.30pm.

There are 33 teams from New Zealand and Australia, including former World Championship Grand Finalists, who will compete for the Vice Chancellor's Cup, while the best speaker will be awarded the David Lange Cup.

Executive director Roger Kerr said the Business Roundtable was very pleased to sponsor the debates.

“The calibre of the debaters is superb. I’ve seen a number of them in action at the Business Roundtable’s Big Social Issues Debates tournament earlier this year and at the last British Parliamentary Debating Championships which we also sponsored.”

“The Business Roundtable became involved in debating because we believe in the importance of fostering vibrant debate and discussion on important issues. These young men and women do that exceptionally well and we’re very pleased to support them”, said Mr Kerr.

The preliminary rounds and the semi finals will be held at the Victoria University Law School before the final at Parliament. All debates are open to the public.

The Business Roundtable’s Big Social Issues Debates tournament, which is generously supported by the Friedlander Foundation, will be held in March 2011. The 2010 competition saw four teams from New Zealand’s top four universities compete in nine debates on New Zealand public policy issues in Auckland and Wellington. The heats were held in secondary schools and the finals at after-five functions for young professionals.
