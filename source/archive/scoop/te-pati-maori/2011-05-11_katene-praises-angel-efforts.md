Katene praises "angel" efforts

Rahui Katene is welcoming a new initiative by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to provide free meals to students at Linwood College in Christchurch who travel long distances every day to get to school as a result of the recent earthquake.

"Sometimes we take for granted the simple things like whether or not our children in Christchurch are eating well, so I am really pleased with the wok the church is doing," the Maori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga said.

"The church's initiative is part of the enormous band of angels who have been doing so much to restore and rebuild the heart and the soul of Christchurch."

Mrs Katene also praised the efforts of Pastor Steve Hira, who set up a food distribution site for families in Aranui, and continues to provide support to them.

"We are blessed to have people like Pastor Hira - he has sacrificed his paid employment to help those in need.

"I want these volunteers to know that their efforts to keep our students and families warm and nourished have not gone unoticed. They are angels and in it for the long term."
