**He Aituā: Te Orohi Paul**

_Tēnei te poroporoaki ki te tuahine ki a Te Orohi Paul, koia tērā kua riro ki a Hine-nui-te-pō. Mai i te orokohanga o te Pāti Māori, koia tērā i whakapau kaha mō te pāti nei, a, ko mātou tērā kua whiwhi i ngā painga. He kanohi kitea, he ringa raupā, he taituarā, he toka tūmoana, kua katohia e te ringa kaha o aituā. Kua ngū te waha, kua moe ngā whatu, kua ea ngā mahi. E mōteatea ana te ngākau, moe mai, okioki mai rā._

"We are devastated by the loss of Te Orohi Paul. She has been a stalwart supporter of the Māori Party since its inception and one of my guiding lights," says Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.

"She has shared her sharp mind and big heart with all of us and we miss her tremendously."

Te Orohi Paul from Mataatua waka stood as a Māori Party candidate in the 2005, 2008 and 2011 General Elections and was also appointed to one of the most senior levels in the party as Vice President Wahine from 2008 to 2011. Her whānau has contributed at a branch, electorate and national level.

She has an extensive professional background in serving Māori people in the health, social services and education sector and she operated a consultancy company called Atea Maioha Trust with her husband Hakopa. Te Orohi and her husband have earned a unique place in our nation's story through establishing the first kaupapa driven alcohol and drug treatment centre, Te Ārai Rauhanga collective.

She has been a member of Raukura Hauora o Tainui since 1997 and made a significant contribution to treatment models in residential alcohol and drug services, IHC, health promotion and primary health services. She has also assisted a number of tertiary education providers in preparing students for work.

Te Orohi and her husband Hakopa Paul were en route to their annual White Ribbon motorbike ride which starts in the South Island to raise awareness about stopping family violence when Te Orohi was taken to hospital.

“Te Orohi had an infectious laugh; an enthusiastic outlook and a genuine love for people that endeared her to all,” says Māori Co-leader Marama Fox.

“Her leadership was inspirational both at a whānau level and nationwide. While so many groups around Aotearoa will be shell-shocked by this loss, the sense of grief will be profoundly felt in the lives of her mother, her husband Hakopa, sister and brothers, children and mokopuna.”

She is at Taheke Marae near Rotorua tonight and she will be taken to Uiraroa Marae in Te Teko on Friday before her burial on Sunday. Te Orohi Paul (nee Tawera) was in her late 50s.
