**The Hon Tariana Turia**  
  
**Maori Party MP for Te Tai Hauauru**  
  
**11 August 2010**  

Te Tai Hauauru MP, Tariana Turia, has expressed her sadness that Parliament will lose the distinctive presence of Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.

“I have greatly enjoyed working alongside Luamanuvao over the last decade, in both the caucus and the chamber” said Mrs Turia.

“We have shared our enthusiasm for the amazing contribution made by the communities of Aotearoa; both of us having had the privilege of serving as Ministers for the Community and Voluntary Sector”.

“I have greatly valued the genuine leadership that Luamanuvao has brought to many issues, the most recent being her private members bill to grant greater rights to the families of those seeking or undergoing treatment in the mental health sector”.

“My heartfelt congratulations go out to her, in securing this new role as Assistant Vice Chancellor, Pasifika at Victoria University”.

“We will miss her creative energy; her vivacious spirit and her enormous generosity” said Mrs Turia.

“But I have every confidence that Pasifika students and their families will greatly benefit from her vision and her passion for Pacific development. The Maori Party wishes her well in her new career”.
