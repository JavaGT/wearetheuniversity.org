**Speech to Canterbury Men’s Centre and Male Survivors of Sexual Abuse Trust**

**Christchurch**

**_Wednesday, 21 April 2016_**

There is a saying: Mā te whakarongo me te titiro ka puta mai te kōrero, mā te kōrero ka mārama – From listening and watching we can discuss issues, from discussion we gain enlightenment and understanding.

And in this regard, I commend Ken Clearwater; the Canterbury Men’s Centre and Male Survivors of Sexual Abuse Trust for the initiative you have taken in organising this day.

I’d also like to acknowledge fellow members of Parliament, Labour MP Kelvin Davis, Green MP Jan Logie and National MP Matt Doocey for their advocacy on this important kaupapa.

Too often the issues of abuse and violence that impact on our boys and men are overlooked with a focus on men as perpetrators rather than also acknowledging the significant numbers of male survivors.

Today is all about refocusing and addressing the imbalance.

There are four particular issues I bring to you this morning at international, national, and at a community level.

The first is the most recent. A week ago today, Parliament passed the Māori Language (Te Reo Māori) Bill establishing a legislative precedent that has attracted interest from indigenous scholars across the world.

The new law represents a significant constitutional change, being enacted in both te reo Māori and English, with the Māori language taking precedence. This is the first time for such recognition to be entrenched in law.

It states that Māori language is an official language of New Zealand; it is the foundation of Māori culture and identity; it enhances the lives of iwi and Māori; and that knowledge and use of te reo will be sustained through transmission of the language from generation to generation, and by daily communication in the community.

The second issue, was the tabling of the report, _Investing in New Zealand’s children and their families._

Amongst its recommendations the panel has noted that the love and care required by children and young people can only be provided through individuals and families not through organisations or the State.

But it goes further to note that all New Zealanders can have a role in providing love, care and support to vulnerable children, young people and their families.

It identifies that Whānau Ora has a role in assisting whānau to develop a stronger understanding of their own strengths and that strategic partnering with iwi is required to improve outcomes for vulnerable Māori children.

The third event of national significance was the recent Tāne Ora conference held in Blenheim in March.

I think it is absolutely critical that we walk the talk; that we really communicate with one another.

Tāne Ora had a focus on strategy and leadership, strengthening tāne, exploring the opportunities of collective impact.

We must always make space for the things that are too often unsaid.

We must provide opportunities by which as men, we talk about our health and wellbeing in a meaningful way, give our lives the serious attention they deserve.

And the fourth event, was the sentencing of a sixty year old man in the Kaikōura community, convicted of fourteen charges related to sexual offending against complainants abused as children.

As the media flocked to gain comment, another man spoke out about the court case, saying:

“Acts of violence done to one person, always reflect on the wider whānau, whether that be as perpetrators or survivors. We must all speak up and stand together, to support our whānau to be strong, to be safe and to be well.”

That man, who challenged us all to speak up, is Tā Mark Solomon. I mihi to him today, for his leadership, his courage and his strength in confronting the issues of violence that have traumatised our communities for far too long.

There were many others in the courtroom that day of sentencing, but two I want to mention are the kuia, Kiwa Hutchens and her daughter, Tania Mataki.

Both women have led a lifelong campaign in taking action to combat the enduring crisis of abuse that damages every member of the whānau in which offending takes place.

Like Tā Mark, they were related to the offender, who stood in the docks.

Prior to sentencing, they had made their position clear to him: the greater good of the whānau compelled them to support those who had been offended against; and to make it clear, leadership was required to turn the tide.

So all of these things are on my mind.

As a father of two sons; and soon to be a grandfather of no doubt the most beautiful boy that has ever been born, I have a responsibility; a moral obligation, but most of all a driving love that led me to be with you today.

I want my voice to join with yours, in saying that intimidation, sexual abuse, physical, emotional, psychological, financial violence has no place in the lives of our families.

We must be determined to fight with all our collective power, anyone who seeks to erode the confidence and courage of the boys and men in our lives.

There is no excuse, ever, for violence to be experienced on any scale, in any setting.

Institutions of the state – police cells, prison yards, youth residences, family homes, school playgrounds, psychiatric institutions, are duty charged with creating and maintaining safe and healthy environments.

Equally, the institution of the family has an eternal responsibility to keep homes safe; to search for healing when hurt has occurred; to prevent opportunities for violence to occur.

I truly believe that all of us can dig deep to find the bold, brave place within that enable us to stand like the kuia or the knight, to speak our truth and demand safety for all our whānau.

It is about learning from the impact of Whānau Ora, to know that success is more likely when we build on the strengths of families; when we learn from local solutions as to how to make a change that will last.

It is from listening to the inspiration of other men, who have shown us that Tāne Ora is a legitimate goal; that collective ownership is required to invest in the health and wellbeing of men as fathers, brothers, sons and members of families.

And it is through knowing that as Māori, so often the answers that fit best are those passed from generations before us, in the language of our tūpuna, in the thinking from time immemorial.

The wonderful thing about looking and listening to the shakers and movers around us is to see the changes occurring in the context of wellbeing for boys and men.

On 20th May, here in Christchurch, there is a one day workshop singularly focused on strategies for kaimahi and for whānau, in the field of sexual abuse prevention.

The Whānau Ora Commissioning Agency, Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu, has recently invested in a series of five initiatives in Invercargill, Dunedin, Kaikōura and Motueka, under the concept of Te Punanga Haumaru.

Te Punanga Haumaru is literally a place to rest and restore, a safe place where we can be warm and secure.

The Punanga Haumaru projects are trying to give expression to one of the seven Whānau Ora outcomes that is that whānau will be cohesive, resilient and nurturing.

Another one of their approaches has been in supporting Te Puna Oranga, who are giving a voice to resilience and healing through a series of visual cards that enable whānau to support whānau through adverse life events.

I have no interest in laying blame.

What we know is that whether we call a person an offender or a survivor, the strength of a loving supportive whānau around you can never be under-estimated.

As we have become more disconnected, it is the core values from te Ao Māori that provide us with that knowledge to lean on in challenging the abuse and violence.

Values like whanaungatanga, manaakitanga and wairuatanga.

And that brings me back to Whānau Ora, to the Reo Māori Bill; to the leadership of Tā Mark and Whaea Kiwa; to the challenge of children in care.

It is about stepping up, learning from the stories passed on, recognising the collective strength of returning to the family, healing from within.

The greatest thing we can do for our men and boys is to promote the value of Tāne Ora; live by the promise of Whānau Ora and be bold and brave enough to speak up when it counts.
