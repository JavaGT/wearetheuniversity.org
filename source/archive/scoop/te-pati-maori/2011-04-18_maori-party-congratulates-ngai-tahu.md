**Rahui Katene, MP for Te Tai Tonga**  
**Maori Party congratulates Ngai Tahu on ‘Entrepreneurial Courage’**  
**Monday 18 April 2011**

The Maori Party has today commended Ngai Tahu Holdings in its decision to take an equity stake in Agria’s holding company. _\[Agria is the vehicle that launched the partial takeover for PGG Wrightson, New Zealand’s largest rural services company\]._

“Iwi frequently remind us that they are the ‘natural partner’ for Government – they are one group that we know will never leave New Zealand and it therefore makes great sense to value their investment potential” said Rahui Katene.

“Ngai Tahu Holdings has earnt a distinguished investment profile through its achievements in a range of South Island commercial, tourism, seafood, property and rural ventures. This profile makes them an ideal business partner which the Agria Singapore Group and the Chinese multi-billion dollar company, New Hope, have recognised”.

“It is really exciting to see our iwi developing global relationships with such confidence” said Mrs Katene. "And the Maori Party wants to both encourage and recognise the leadership that iwi are demonstrating in investing in New Zealand'.

"I am so proud to see the way in which the Ngai Tahu spirit continues to impress, despite the obvious challenges of the Canterbury Earthquake impacting significantly on their business" said Mrs Katene.

“Despite great adversity Ngai Tahu has demonstrated ‘entrepreneurial courage’ in taking up an investment opportunity that will benefit their stakeholders as well, of course, as the greater rural sector in New Zealand – and logically therefore the national economy” said Rahui Katene.

“It is also commendable that Ngai Tahu Holdings is conducting commercial negotiations within the context of its kaupapa – seeking to achieve an environmental sustainable rural business model as part of its rural strategy” said Mrs Katene.

“There will be all eyes on Ngai Tahu Holdings as we watch the impact of their emerging growth strategy for the rural sector”.
