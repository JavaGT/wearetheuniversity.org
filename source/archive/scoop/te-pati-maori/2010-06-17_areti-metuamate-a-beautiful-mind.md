**Areti Metuamate: A beautiful mind**

Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia is praising Areti Metuamate for being selected as one of the 100 brightest young people in Australia.

"As uri of Tahiti, Rarotonga as well as tangata whenua, Areti takes a global perspective across the broad issues of social policy issues. And we all should be proud of his latest achievement," Mrs Turia said.

"There are more than three million young people in Australia, thousands of whom applied to be selected and along comes this young man from Aotearoa.

"I am sure Areti's Ngati Raukawa, Ngati Kauwhata and Tainui-Waikato people will be very proud of him.

"I first met Areti when he was the head prefect at Hato Paora. He's an energetic and highly motivated young man who will excel in whatever area he decides."

The 25-year-old former ministerial secretary and Freyberg scholar is living in Canberra completing a masters degree at the Australian National University. He was one of 100 young people selected from across Australia to participate in the major summit, Brightest Young Minds (BYM) 2010.

Summit organisers selected the brightest young people not only on their academic ability, but based on the attributes of leadership, passion, creativity, initiative, intelligence, charisma, communication and perseverance.
