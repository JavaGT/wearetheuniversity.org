Speech: Turia - Early Childhood
===============================

**Nancy Winter Early Childhood Centre, Raetihi**  
**Hon Tariana Turia, MP for Te Tai Hauauru**  
**Friday 12 November 2010; 10am**

I am delighted to return here to the Nancy Winter early childhood centre. I remember the opening on the 1st April 2007 as being a wonderful day – a day to share in the pride of this great community; to admire the transformation that had taken place at this centre; and an occasion to cherish our children and all those who make them who they are.

I expect nothing less of today.

Today is a time to congratulate and celebrate Viv Hoeta for her success in graduating with a Diploma in Early Childhood Teacher. If ever there was a time to dare; to make a difference; to embark on something worthwhile it is now.

And I want to just share a few thoughts about the remarkable journey that Viv has gone through, to get to today.

When the Nancy Winter centre was opened back in 2007 Viv was one of the first teachers appointed, and has been a valued and significant member of your teaching team.

Viv puts into practice that concept – to the world you may be just one person; but to one person you may be the world.

She has invested herself in each and every child that comes here; making them feel wonderful, and on top of the world. And isn’t that what we want for every child?

But the wonderful thing about Viv is that she takes that same attitude into each and every area of her rich and busy life.

She is a passionate and enthusiastic advocate of the Phoenix players.

She is the Chairperson of the Raetihi School Board of Trustees.

She has been a devoted supporter in the church; she has been a model parent in the investment she has given back to the community through her mahi with kohanga, kura kaupapa and Ruapehu College. And she was a much valued member of the Waimarino Child, Youth and Family Panel over the years.

And I want to mihi to Stella for the influence and inspiration that she and Darcy have clearly laid, in helping Viv to forge new pathways ahead.

One of the former First Ladies of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt, once said, ‘the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams’.

It is a brilliant concept that I think Viv has demonstrated in her journey.

And I want to acknowledge it has not been without challenge. She started off working in the kindergarten in Ohakune and in Community Health; while undertaking study at Massey University and then Whitireia Polytechnic and eventually the last year at Open Polytechnic.

At the same time as she working, and taking on further education, she was fully involved in many aspects of the community; as well as being a fulltime wife, mother, daughter and whanau member.

Her dedication and her pursuit of her diploma has reflected the beauty of her dreams that have driven her onwards, and so today, I take this time to congratulate her, and to honour her for her hard work.

Finally, I want to just pay a special tribute to the effervescent Lynne Pope; the legacy of Nancy Winter; and the strength and solidarity of the team at this centre; who have provided such a fantastic opportunity for our whanau in Raetihi.

You are all living proof of the African proverb – it takes a village to raise a child. This little village of Raetihi is all the better for your commitment and the magic you weave at this centre. Thank you.
