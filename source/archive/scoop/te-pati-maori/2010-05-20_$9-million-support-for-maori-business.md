======================================

**MEDIA STATEMENT**  
**Hon Dr Pita Sharples**  
**Co-Leader of the M**a**ori Party**  
**Embargoed until 3pm on 20 May 2010**

**$9 million: Support for M**a**ori business**

The Maori Party’s desire to see entrepreneurship and enterprise in the Maori economy will be given a lift because of the $9 million secured by Maori Party co-leader Dr Pita Sharples, who negotiated the funding in his capacity as Minister of Maori Affairs.

Budget 2010 provides support in several areas for Maori business to contribute to the economic recovery and help Maori get ahead under their own steam.

“We recognise that there is untapped entrepreneurial talent out there among our people and these funds should, among other things, help bring that talent to the fore.

“We also know that iwi are major contributors to the economy, and owners of large natural resources, so these funds will also support them to investment in tourism, geothermal, water power plants and other schemes,” Dr Sharples said.

“Maori economic growth is good for Maori and good for the nation."

$4.5 million of new money has been allocated to grow Maori productivity and export growth, and to support Maori innovation. A significant amount of this money will be put into developing units and training to up skill Maori working for Maori in the primary sector.

“The Maori asset base is concentrated in dairy, tourism, meat, wood and seafood – most of New Zealand’s key export earners. There are huge potential economic returns from our investment in skills and training for Maori in the primary sector.

“Key drivers of growth for Maori in the ‘innovation economy’ include the creation of knowledge and innovation, technological advances, research and development, and education and skills,” Dr Sharples said.

The other $4.5 million has been set aside for initiatives currently being developed to strengthen and promote Maori tourism.

“Maori culture offers a unique dimension for New Zealand’s tourism industry so any strengthening of the leadership in the Maori tourism sector will be of benefit."

Other Budget 2010 initiatives included developing a ‘Brand Maori’ to gain premium prices for Maori-produced goods exported to niche markets and support for a delegation of Maori business leaders at the World Expo in Shanghai, to be funded from existing allocations.

Iwi and Maori were also likely to benefit from the $1.5 million for iwi/Maori partnerships to identify priorities in science.
