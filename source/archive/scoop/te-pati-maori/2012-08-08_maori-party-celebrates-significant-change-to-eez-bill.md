Maori Party Celebrates Significant Change to EEZ Bill

The Maori Party is today congratulating Hon Amy Adams for making a significant change to the purpose clause of the Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf (Environmental Effects) Bill.

“In earlier versions of the Bill, environmental protection and economic development were given equal weighting. Initially we were concerned that economic interests would win out over environmental management principles in the implementation of this Bill, so we are extremely pleased to see this has now changed to incorporate concepts of "sustainable management" in Section 5 of the Resource Management Act.

“We commend groups such as Te Ohu Kaimoana, Ngāti Porou fisheries, Port Nicholson Trust, Kahungunu ki Wairarapa, Ngāti Ruanui, Waikato-Tainui, Ngāi Tahu, Ngāti Wai, Ngāti Kahungunu for making submissions which in turn created a change that will further protect our moana, and our resources.”

“Kaitiakitanga or guardianship is but one of our roles as tangata whenua. That includes protection of our waters and natural environment. The changes to the Bill give us further confidence that our environmental interests will be protected.”

“We met with the Minister in July to discuss our concerns on this particular clause, and we are pleased that our advocacy has meant such a significant refocus.”

“We congratulate Minister Adams for taking on the advice sent in by the many groups who advocated for strengthening the environmental protection principles within this Bill, and we will be looking forward to seeing how this Bill progresses through Parliament.”

ENDS
