'Urgent Need To Address Post-School Pathways For Rangatahi Maori' Says Sharples

Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader and Tertiary Education spokesperson for the Maori Party

Today’s announcement of $9.7m being allocated to eleven new projects funded under the Innovation and Development Fund was welcomed by Tertiary Education spokesperson for the Maori Party, Dr Pita Sharples.

“The Maori Party is pleased to see an emphasis on providing opportunities for supporting Maori academic staff, included in the mix” said Dr Sharples.

Massey University has been selected to lead a project called MANU-AO, Maori Academic Network across Universities in Aotearoa.

“It has not, however, escaped our attention that out of 45 projects funded in the tertiary sector, there are only four projects with a particular focus on Maori”.

“The latest Census results remind us that Maori are a very young population” said Dr Sharples.

The median age of Maori is 22.7 years; compared to 35.9 years for the total population.

“In particular, we are mindful of the significant group of young Maori in that school-leaver age range, that are ripe and ready to take advantage of innovation” said Dr Sharples.

35.4% of Maori are aged under 15 years; compared to 21.5% for the total population.

“The Maori Party expects that Government should be looking at every strategy to actively engage with young Maori, and to invest in tertiary education pathways that will nurture our indigenous talent” said Dr Sharples.

“While we look forward to the work from the Centre for Maori Innovation and Development (Auckland University of Technology); and Te Mata o te Tau Academy for Maori Research and Scholarship (Massey University); we know that there are many other projects; and tertiary education providers waiting in the wings, that this fund could have supported” said Dr Sharples. "Including of course, the incredible work going on across the three wananga".

“We await with baited breath, yet again, ‘new ways of investing in tertiary education’ promised by the Government today” said Dr Sharples.

“It is one thing to boast about how well Maori are doing in the Government’s report card” said Dr Sharples.

“It is quite another to address the unacceptably high rate of Maori student expulsions and suspensions. Students with little education and skills who at best can only look forward to life entangled in the welfare net. What we are looking for now, is solid evidence and funding, that builds on the momentum of the burgeoning young Maori population; and makes a priority for our people to be part of the future growth of Aotearoa”.
