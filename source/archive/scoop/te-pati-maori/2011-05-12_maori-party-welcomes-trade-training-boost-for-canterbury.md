**Maori Party Welcomes Trade Training boost for Canterbury**

**Rahui Katene, MP for Te Tai Tonga**  
**Thursday 12 May 2011**

Te Tai Tonga MP Rahui Katene is thrilled that today’s announcements from tertiary education Minister Steven Joyce will enable additional support for Maori trainees.

“Current figures suggest that there are some 500 young Maori (aged between 16-24 years) in the Canterbury region receiving the unemployment benefit as of the end of April” said Mrs Katene.

“The announcement today of an additional $42 million for trade training, is a huge boost to the morale and motivation of young Maori in this region, with the promise of at least 200 placements for Maori anticipated in the construction sector”.

“I want to commend Maori Affairs Minister, Dr Pita Sharples, for his initiative and his commitment to this _take_, since the first earthquake in September last year”

“This is great news that Maori will directly benefit from training and employment opportunities emerging in the Canterbury Recovery”.

“We are also very committed towards establishing the expectation that the capability and leadership of local Maori will be valued in the building and construction industries”.

“The Maori Party, Ngai Tahu and the Iwi Maori Recovery Network have been tireless advocates of a proactive response to the earthquake recovery and today’s announcements reflect the fruits of all of our labour paying off” said Mrs Katene.

"And as for the challenge from Paula Bennett that I have been particularly 'pushy' in calling for jobs for our young - well I'm proud to own up to that! Employment is just so vital to income, to self-esteem, to that sense of making a productive contribution to our community, and I will continue to push to ensure the disproportionately high levels of Maori unemployment are addressed".
