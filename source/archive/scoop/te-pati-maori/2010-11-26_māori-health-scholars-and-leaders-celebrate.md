**Māori health scholars and leaders celebrate**

Five Māori men and women celebrated at a special event in Wellington today hosted by Minister Tariana Turia. Surrounded by whānau and representatives from national Māori organisations, three Te Apa Māreikura Award recipients and two John McLeod scholars were acknowledged for their exceptional academic and community achievements.

Two prestigious John McLeod Scholarships, worth $10,000 are named for the late Dr John McLeod who was renown, nationally and internationally for his work in public health and his significant contribution toward improving Māori health status. These scholarships are awarded annually to applicants to the Ministry of Health’s Hauora Māori scholarship programme and given to individuals who have achieved outstanding academic success in Māori health. This year’s John McLeod scholars are Phillip Tane (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Maniapoto) who is studying at the University of Auckland and Hōri Barsdell (Ngāti Awa, Te Whakatōhea, Ngāi Te Rangi and Te Arawa) who is studying at the university of Otago.

Te Apa Māreikura Awards have recently been established under the Hauora Māori programme to commemorate four prominent Maori community leaders, Rongo WiRepa, Anne Delamare, Denis Simpson and Bill Katene, for their contribution to the improvement of Maori health. Recipients of the Te Apa Mareikura Awards, also worth $10,000, have demonstrated competencies in community health, strong connections to and involvement with the community, proven leadership ability, effective community networks and academic performance that contributed to future Māori health gains.

This year’s Te Apa Māreikura Awards go to New Plymouth based, Matiu Julian (Te Āti Haunui a Pāpārangi, Ngā Ruahine) Whanganui based Pirihira Roberts (Te Arawa, Ngā Ruahine, Te Āti Haunui a Pāpārangi) and Whakatane based Harata Te Amo-Simeon (Ngāi Tūhoe, Rongomaiwahine, Ngāti Awa).
