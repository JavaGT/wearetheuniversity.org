Young Orator Heads To Youth Parliament

People say that Turei-Hamiora Ormsby of Ngati Porou and Upokorehe is an “extraordinary orator” and that’s a talent he will undoubtedly be putting to use in this year’s Youth Parliament.

The soon-to-be 16-year-old at Hutt Valley High School was selected by Maori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga, Rahui Katene, to be one of 122 youths to take part in the two-day Youth Parliament which starts on July 6.

Last year Turei-Hamiora gained the highest mark in the country for te reo Maori which won him one of NZQA’s top subject scholarship awards. He also took out the 2009 prestigious Maori speech competition (Nga Manu Korero) for the Hutt Valley, Wairarapa and Wellington region.

“There were several very talented candidates for me to choose from but Turei-Hamiora had it all – he is articulate, bright, got a whole lot of networks, is very interested in politics and he was part of my campaign team back in 2008,” Mrs Katene said.

At present, Turei-Hamiora is focusing on music, including traditional Maori music, and he hopes to one day go to university in Haiwaii.

The initiative will see the youths share their views with the country’s decision-makers and bring the voice of their communities.
