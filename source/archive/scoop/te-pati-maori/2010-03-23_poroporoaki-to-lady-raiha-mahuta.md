E te piki amokura o Nga Puhi, kua katohia nei koe e te ringa kaha o aitua.

E kore e mutu nga mihi ki a koe me ou whiwhinga i te ao turoa nei.

Haere ki to iwi, ki te nuinga o te tangata, oti atu e.

  
Today, the tears of Tongariro will flow into the Whanganui River. The connection we make as river people is an intimate one, in which through whakapapa we are bound together.

The Waikato Iti, which is a source of the great Waikato River starts on Tongariro maunga. Both the Whangaehu and the Whanganui headwaters are diverted into the Waikato catchment. Physically, culturally, spiritually, our connections will always be strong.

We mourn the loss of Lady Raiha Mahuta – a kuia rangatira, who has devoted so much of her life to nurturing the lifeforce of her children, her mokopuna and all those who come after her.

Her name will be forever linked with the legacy of protection and preservation of the Waikato River. I stand first today, as uri of Whanganui and Whangaehu, to honour Lady Raiha for the generosity of spirit she expressed towards us.

We have much to treasure in her contribution; we have much to grieve. We are all in awe of the sheer tenacity of her role, the respect she engendered from the Crown; the strength of her commitment to principles, as co-negotiator on the Waikato River Settlement for Waikato-Tainui.

She has done so much to protect and preserve the tribal and cultural heritage of Tainui – and for that, this nation is indebted to her.

In the example she has modelled for Tainui, she has also blazed a pathway ahead for other iwi, including my own

It was through the grace of the late Queen, Dame te Atairangikaahu; the late Sir Robert Mahuta, and Lady Raiha that our claim before the Tribunal was heard first, of all the big river claims.

Lady Raiha and Tukuroirangi Morgan have also been instrumental in providing support for the Whanganui river settlement, including sending people down to provide advice to our technicians.

They supported us in many ways – and in turn we shared our appreciation of their generosity in helping them to establish tira hoe waka along their river.

So close is the relationship between Whanganui and Waikato; that Dame Te Ata bestowed upon our old people the honour of naming her mokopuna, Ngawai hono i te po – daughter of Kingi Tuheitia; and also Amaia; the daughter of Tipa; Lady Raiha and Sir Robert’s daughter.

These connections – lifelong, tribally bound, and personally linked, are ones that we will treasure forever. When we see them, we will remember Raiha.

But there are other associations I want to mention.

Raiha and I were part of the national employment network during the 80s – working on Maori access and Maori business development. We were both engaged in job creation in our respective rohe and it was through that capacity that I developed a huge admiration for her which continues to this day.

Raiha was very involved in Tainui’s response to the high unemployment at that time, including running a number of programmes within Waikato.

The thing that I liked most about her was that she was a true visionary; able to see a pathway forward; and then put the energy and the determination in to make it happen. She was hard working; extremely committed to her people; and would stop at nothing to make the difference.

Finally, I want to extend our love and our support, from the Maori Party, to the whanau, hapu, iwi whom Lady Raiha leaves behind.

Lady Raiha was extremely aware of the enormous sacrifice that her husband, the late Sir Robert made, in the commitment he made to the people, a commitment that essentially he gave his life for.

Lady Raiha was determined that her whanau would continue to function, and indeed to succeed in every aspect of their world. She was literally the heartbeat of her whanau.

And so today, our aroha goes out to her children, particularly our colleague Nanaia, her mokopuna, the people of Tainui and also her Ngapuhi people in Kawakawa.

Today the tears of Ruapehu join with those of Tainui, Ngati Manu, Ngati Rangi and te iwi Maori katoa. We mourn the loss of a rare and distinguished leader within the Kingitanga; a devoted wife; a proud mother; an adoring grandmother.
