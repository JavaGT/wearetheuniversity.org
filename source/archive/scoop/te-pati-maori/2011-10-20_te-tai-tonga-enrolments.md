**Te Tai Tonga Enrolments**

Te Tai Tonga MP Rāhui Kātene is reminding constituents affected by the Christchurch and Canterbury earthquakes that they are able to remain on the Te Tai Tonga roll if they are temporarily situated elsewhere in the country.

\"While I have been out door-knocking around Christchurch the last couple of weekends, I've came across many people unaware that their whanau were able to remain on the Te Tai Tonga roll, even though they are not currently living in Christchurch."

"If you have temporarily left Christchurch and Canterbury due to the earthquakes, but intend to return, you are still entitled to be on the Te Tai Tonga roll" said Mrs Kātene.

"If you have permanently moved out of the Te Tai Tonga boundaries then you must enrol on the local electorate you now reside in."

"I encourage all constituents of Te Tai Tonga, whether temporarily relocated or not, to enrol. You will not be able to vote on Election Day if you are not enrolled."

To enrol go to [www.elections.org.nz](http://www.elections.org.nz/), or ring 0800 36 76 56. For more information visit: [http://www.elections.org.nz/enrolment/cantabrians-you-can-still-have-your-say.html](http://www.elections.org.nz/enrolment/cantabrians-you-can-still-have-your-say.html).
