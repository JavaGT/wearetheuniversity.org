Turia welcomes collective effort to save longfin eels

Tariana Turia has welcomed the initiative of iwi, a coalition of environmental groups and Massey University researchers to protect the endemic endangered longfin eel.

“I support the call for a moratorium on the commercial fishing of long-fin eels in order to restore the population to full health,” Mrs Turia said.

“The native long-finned eels are now endangered and face critical risk from loss of habitat and poor water quality, let alone commercial exploitation.

“We have the chance to prevent this iconic tuna species from being extinct."

Improving water quality, removing wall barriers and ceasing the commercial harvesting of eels and other fish are all steps that we can take to halt the decline of the threatened longfin eel.”

“I commend Manaaki Tuna (the Massey University Tuna Research and Restoration Group), Forest and Bird, Greenpeace, the Environment and Conservation Organisations of NZ; and a growing number of iwi groups for their efforts in seeking to protect the tuna population.

“I will be taking my concerns to Hon Phil Heatley, Minister of Fisheries, to ask him to immediately review the commercial harvesting of this threatened, endemic species.”

ENDS
