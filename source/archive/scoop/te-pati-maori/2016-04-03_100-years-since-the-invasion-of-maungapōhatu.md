Māori Party commemorate 100 years since the invasion of Maungapōhatu

  
02 April 2016

The Māori Party is marking the centenary of the invasion of Maungapōhatu with a vow to continue calling for public recognition of the New Zealand Land Wars.  
Māori Party Co-leader, Te Ururoa Flavell, who is attending the commemoration ceremony at Maungapōhatu Marae says “I am here to join with Tamakaimoana and Tūhoe to remember the events that unfolded and the impact it has had on the people economically and socially.”

“The re-enactment of the events of the invasion have exposed spectators to the realities Rua Kenana’s people faced a century ago and gave them a personal connection to the mistreatment, deceit and destruction that took place. As a country, we turn a blind eye on our history and that needs to stop,” he says.  
Māori Party Co-leader, Marama Fox, says it is important New Zealanders know the history Aotearoa is founded on.

“We celebrate things such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes, which are huge money makers for retailers, yet our tamariki do not have the option of learning about the historic events that shaped Aotearoa. It saddens me that not all New Zealanders know about our past, both good and bad,” she says.  
The Māori Party supports the Land Wars petition presented to Parliament by students from Ōtorohanga College.

“We are committed to seeing Māori history and Te Tiriti o Waitangi taught in schools. As part of our policies moving forward, we are devoted to supporting civics education and Māori history being made compulsory subjects,” says Mrs Fox.

Te Ururoa Flavell says “We are supporting the call for a day of national remembrance of the New Zealand Wars as well as promoting Parihaka Day – a day to commemorate the peaceful resistance by the people of Parihaka. Our country will be far better off by having an understanding of our history, and also an appreciation and respect for the impact war has had on tribes such as Tūhoe.”
