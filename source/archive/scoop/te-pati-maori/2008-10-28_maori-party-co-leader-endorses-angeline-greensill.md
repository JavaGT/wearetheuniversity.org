Maori Party Co-leader Endorses Angeline Greensill

Tuesday 28 October 2008 Hon Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party

Tariana Turia has spoken out today in support of Hauraki-Waikato candidate, Angeline Greensill.

"The campaign for that seat is running neck-to-neck, and we're encouraging all of our supporters to talk to their whanau about enrolling, about voting, and of course about supporting someone who will make a huge difference for all people across Hauraki-Waikato".

"I'm really looking forward to Angeline coming in to Parliament, and for someone of her calibre and talents being able to be of influence" said Mrs Turia.

"As a long time environmental activist, Angeline brings a real passion for the land with her" said Mrs Turia. "Her experience as a lawyer and a Waikato University lecturer and her well established reputation for standing up for her people, placed her at the top of our party list, after the four current MPs".

"We are really proud of Angeline and know that she will make a great MP for the people of Hauraki-Waikato" ended Mrs Turia.
