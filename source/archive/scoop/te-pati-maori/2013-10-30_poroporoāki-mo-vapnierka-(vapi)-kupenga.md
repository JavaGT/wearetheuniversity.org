**Poroporoāki mo Vapnierka (Vapi) Kupenga**

_Aue e te tuahine, kua ngaro atu koe i tenei ao_  
_Hoki atu ki tua o te ārai_  
_Hoki atu ki ōu tupuna_  
_Moe mai i runga i tō moenga roa e hine, moe mai, moe mai, moe mai rā_

It is with sadness that the Māori Party farewell the vivacious and staunch daughter of Ngāti Porou, Vapi Kupenga.

“Vapi was an amazing woman. She is well known for her aroha for people, her tireless advocacy for Maori, and for her particular Ngāti Porou flair,” said Tariana Turia.

“She was never afraid to speak her mind. She had a sharp intellect, and an equally sharp tongue, but you always knew where you stood with her, and that is a quality I always admired.”

Dr. Pita Sharples said “Vapi walked in so many different spaces with ease and confidence. She has been a secondary school teacher, a University lecturer, a broadcaster, and a consultant. She has worked in education for many years, and there is a whole generation of rangatahi who have learnt from her and with her. A beautiful speaker of te reo Māori, she also helped to create a body of Māori language resources for use by this generation and future generations.”

“She was passionate about politics, and ran for parliament in Tāmaki Makaurau. She would have made a formidable MP, in fact I would have quite enjoyed seeing her in action – it would have been an amazing sight.”

“She lived in Auckland for many years, and during her time there chaired Te Taura Here o Ngāti Porou ki Tāmaki Makaurau. She epitomised a staunch Ngāti Porou woman, always proud of her iwi, and always pleased to share that passion with anyone and everyone.”

“During her time in Auckland, she was kōkā, and Nanny to everyone. Always welcoming, always opening her arms and finding people to awhi. She was a beautiful singer, and her knowledge of history was always amazing. She was a connection home for many, and a valuable source of mātauranga Māori,” said Dr. Sharples.

“She truly has had an amazing life. Her children and her mokopuna are a testament to her wonderful character. She will be sorely missed,” said Te Ururoa Flavell.

“We mourn her loss, and extend our heartfelt aroha to her whanau and the communities within which she walked.”
