Passing of Corrections Officer, Jason Palmer
============================================

**Wednesday, 19 May 2010, 9:51 am**  
**Speech: [The Maori Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party)**

**Hon Dr Pita Sharples (Co-Leader – Maori Party):**  
**The Passing of Corrections Officer, Jason Palmer**  
**Tuesday 18 May 2010; 2.10pm**

Tena koe Mr Speaker, I rise on behalf of the Maori Party to mark the passing of Corrections Officer Jason Palmer who was tragically killed this last weekend while on duty at Spring Hill Prison.

And as I do so, my thoughts are also with the students from Kings College who are today dealing with the death of a third student since February. We think of those young students, reeling from the shock of losing a friend well before their time.

I acknowledge also Te Ururoa’s Flavell’s family who has lost a niece, and my own family who have a ‘mate’ at home.

I want to firstly acknowledge Jason’s work colleagues who are still required to go about their duties – prisons never stop – despite having to come to terms with what has happened and deal with the great loss they must feel.

The importance of their role, in helping to keep our communities safe is often overlooked until something like this tragedy happens.

We pause for a moment to reflect on the appreciation that we owe to all those who choose to work on behalf of the Government, sometimes placing themselves in sites of danger.

This House has paid our respects on many occasions to those in the armed forces, those in the police force, and today, sadly the Department of Corrections joins that tragic roll of honour.

Jason had his life ahead of him.

By all accounts he could have gone far in Corrections. He was known as an officer who was keen to learn. He was a professional and carried himself as such. Jason was held in high regard by his fellow officers for his personal integrity. He wanted to be the best that he could be.

Sadly this attack put pay to Jason’s ambitions and robbed Corrections of a valued Corrections Officer. This is a tragic waste of a life.

There are some very real issues that emerge out of this tragic incident –

\- issues related to the protection of Corrections staff;

\- and the concerns that always appear at a time like this around the appropriate location and supervision of inmates.

  
It is only right that those issues are addressed –

\- for the ongoing security of the staff specifically at Spring Hill but far wider across the Corrections facilities;

\- for the protection of all those who inhabit our prisons;

\- and most importantly for Jason’s family who today grieve for the loss of a cherished son, brother, father and husband.

Today is not the time to debate the whys and what-fors. It is a time for tears, for regret, for tributes to be heard.

Anyone who listened to National Radio this morning would have heard the aching despair of a mother mourning her son.

In her interview Ada Palmer referred to her daughter-in-law, as a Princess, representing the courage and the generosity of the New Zealand spirit in allowing this son of American soil to be returned home.

Our thoughts are these two women bound inextricably in grief; their children and to all the families today who are suffering the loss of dearly loved sons. We extend our love and our sincere sympathy at such a difficult time.

  
Na reira, kei te rangatira, haere koutou e nga mate.

Haere ki te Atua i te rangi, hei whariki ma matou

Haere, haere, haere.

ENDS
