POROPOROAKI: New Amsterdam Reedy

  
E te rangatira, e te pou o te mātauranga tahito, haere. Haere atu koe i te huanui, te ara kua papatauria e te tapuwae kauika tangata. Takoto mai i te urunga e kore e nekehia, i te moenga e kore e hikitia. Moe mai rā i te poho o Ranginui e tū iho nei.

The Māori Party mourns the loss of New Amsterdam Reedy (Ngāti Porou – Te Aitanga a Mate, Putaanga, Te Whānau a Tūwhakairiora, Ngāti Uepohatu).

“Amster was greatly loved by all of our whānau for his gentle expression of wairuatanga; his scholarly wisdom and his incredible knowledge of the gifts inherent in whakapapa,” said Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Māori Party.

“Whānau throughout Aotearoa have benefitted from his generosity in sharing Te Oriori a Tuteremoana with us; guiding us in the practice of maioha – a commitment to a new-born child from all the whānau. What I loved most about Amster was his all-encompassing love for whānau; and his pride and passion in sharing our cultural practices as the most important framework we could ever take on in life.

“He has been present at many births, reciting oriori during the birthing process and celebrating the arrival of tamariki mokopuna as one of the most important traditions to revive in our society,” said Mrs Turia.

“Amster epitomised Whānau Ora in action,” said Te Ururoa Flavell, Co-leader of the Māori Party.

“His knowledge of tikanga, whakatauakī, mōteatea, pōpō, waiata and karakia was instrumental in guiding tangata whenua, as well as a huge range of public and private sector agencies. His work as a philosopher, a tohunga, a consultant, a teacher and a koroua has been revolutionary in its impact on this nation. “From Head Prefect of Ngata Memorial College, to the Department of Education, to his own consultancy, Ngā Kete o te Mātauranga, Amster’s leadership has educated generations of New Zealanders about the value of kaupapa and tikanga Māori.”

“Amster has had a particular influence in his leadership on the New Zealand Olympic Committee’s Māori Advisory Group” said Dr Pita Sharples, Minister of Māori Affairs. “He was a vital part of our Commonwealth and Olympic strategic teams including at Athens, Torino, Melbourne, Turin, and Beijing, where his practical application of tikanga Māori inspired and motivated our elite sports champions.

“We pay tribute today to a truly beautiful man who has been so generous with his learning; and so loving in his practice. Our aroha is with his whānau who have suffered such a profound loss of this indigenous champion for our time.”
