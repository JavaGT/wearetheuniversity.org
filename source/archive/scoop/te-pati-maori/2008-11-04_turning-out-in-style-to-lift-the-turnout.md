Turning out in Style to lift the Turnout

Hone Harawira and Rahui Katene

Tuesday 4 November 2008

The Maori Party is taking its message to the streets of the capital today, in a bold move to lift turnout in the Maori electorates.

“Voter turnout is a huge issue for the Maori electorates” said Hone Harawira.

The average turnout across the Maori electorates in 2005 was 67.07% compared to a general electorate average of 82.01%.

“In fact even the highest turnout amongst Maori electorates, my own electorate of Te Tai Tokerau (69.7%) was still lower than the lowest general electorate (Mangere on 72.89%)” said Harawira.

“So this election, we have made a real point of being visible – flying the flag of democracy in Murupara, Flaxmere, Otautahi, Otaki” said Rahui Katene, candidate for Te Tai Tonga.

\"You might have seen us - we've been on street corners, standing on busy intersections, flying our flags, and hopefully prompting the people to think....what on earth are they doing that for?"

"With only four full days left until New Zealanders goes to the polls, strong measures are required" said Harawira.

“So today, we’re taking on three electorates – Te Tai Hauauru, Te Tai Tonga and Ikaroa Rawhiti – to fly our flags on a ka-koi (car convoy) through the streets” said Mrs Katene.

“We’re also hoping our message to come on board, attracts our rangatahi” said Mrs Katene.

Young people are another group with low levels of electoral engagement. Over half of the people who should be enrolled to vote but are not are under the age of 25.

“Waving the flag is a powerful visual argument to lift the voter turnout, to encourage democratic participation, and to be seen on the scene” said Katene.
