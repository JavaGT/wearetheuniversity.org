Greensill Supports our Tertiary Warriors

Wednesday 24 September 2008

“Government needs to fully support Maori tertiary students,” says Angeline Greensill, Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato.

Greensill attended Te Huinga Tauira, the conference of Maori University and Polytechnic Students, in Hamilton over the weekend.

Greensill stated, “The Maori Party will continue to push for a universal student allowance, to lift the levels of hardship grants available and we will be investigating other options to support students who have been struggling since the demise of Manaaki Tauira.”

“Manaaki Tauira helped thousands of our people over the years. Its loss caused a $7m blow to all Maori tertiary students,” said Mrs Greensill.

“We’ve been sitting down with student leaders to discuss the needs of Maori tertiary students. The main cry is for financial support, especially from low and middle income students.”

“Education benefits whānau and the country. We are committed to supporting all who seek to tertiary learning”.
