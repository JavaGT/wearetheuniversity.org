Government Deletes Gender Along with Treaty from draft Curriculum

Te Ururoa Flavell, Education Spokesperson for the Maori Party Wednesday 2 August 2006

"Kua tangohia a Hine ki waho a te Marautanga. He orite tenei mahi taurekareka, ki tera i mahia ki nga mätäpono o Te Tiriti o Waitangi. I tangohia e kuare" ta te korero a Te Ururoa Flavell.

The Maori Party today continued its questions of the Government, about another set of deletions, this time pertaining to women.

Te Ururoa Flavell, Education Spokesperson for the Maori Party, asked questions in the House of the Minister of Women's Affairs, Hon. Lianne Dalziel. "This Government is hell-bent on a path of destruction" said Mr Flavell.

"First we had the confiscation of all confiscations, with the Foreshore and Seabed legislation".

"We have had apologies for confiscations, and the deceitful behaviour of the Crown in the treaty justice area".

"Last week, we saw Labour cuddling up to NZ First by endorsing their actions to delete the Treaty principles from all legislation"

"This week, that directive has taken seed in the books of our nations' school rooms, by removing the Treaty from the principles and key areas of the new draft curriculum".

"Today we have seen the hatchet has now fallen on our girls and boys - in the decision to remove any commitment to gender equity through the deletion of the 'gender inclusive curriculum'.

"As a former teacher and Principal, I think it critical that the educational needs, experiences, interests and values of all students, both male and female, are explicitly covered for in all parts of our programme".

Questions Asked in the House of the Minister of Women's Affairs from Te Ururoa Flavell

\* What advice was sought from her Ministry to permit the removal of the words, 'a gender inclusive curriculum - which acknowledges and includes the eduational needs and experiences of girls equally with those of boys' from the new draft curriculum statement; or like the deletion of the Treaty of Waitangi, does she believe that 'not talking' about the gender of Maori and non-Maori students enhances gender equity?
