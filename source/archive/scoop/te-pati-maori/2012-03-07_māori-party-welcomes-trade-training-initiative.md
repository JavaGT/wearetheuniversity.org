**Māori Party welcomes Trade Training initiative**

Maori Party rangatahi spokesperson, Te Ururoa Flavell, is welcoming today’s announcements to increase the numbers of job and skills training places as supporting the focus on employment and training outlined in the [relationship accord.](http://www.national.org.nz/PDF_Government/Maori_Party_agreement-11_Dec.pdf)

“The number of trainees this year has tripled since last year, and this is expected to rise with another five academies set to be established,” said Mr Flavell.

“Our particular drive is on ensuring that Maori and Pasifika rangatahi are able to benefit from the new jobs and skills training places and trade training apprenticeships.”

The Government has also agreed that they will work with the Maori Party to progress the establishment of skills and trades-based academies.

“We see today’s [announcement](http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/thousands-benefit-youth-guarantee) by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, Hon Steven Joyce and the Minister of Education, Hon Hekia Parata as paving the way to a more prosperous economic future for all New Zealanders,” ends Mr Flavell.
