**Qantas vision truly inspiring – Maori Party**

Education Spokesperson for the Māori Party has commended the vision and the commitment to indigenous education demonstrated by Qantas in setting up a partnership with the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation.

“This is truly inspiring stuff.

“It is heartening to see a commercial enterprise partnering with indigenous people in supporting their education and employment aspirations”.

“The joint venture announced today will enable indigenous Australians opportunity to participate in education programmes, to benefit from job-readiness workshops and career planning, and to be supported by mentors and scholarships”.

The partnership, as part of the Reconciliation Action Plan, also provides for supported travel for staff and students, ‘experience visits’, a volunteering programme and aviation specific opportunities.

“It would be exciting to see such a venture replicated here in Aotearoa” said Flavell. “Qantas is enabling indigenous students to truly fly high – to have goals in sight and the means by which they can be achieved. We congratulate both Qantas and the Australian Indigenous Education Foundation for this initiative”.
