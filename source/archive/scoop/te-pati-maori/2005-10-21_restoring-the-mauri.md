'Restoring the Mauri';

Te Ururoa Flavell; Maori Party Member for Waiariki

Friday 21 October 2005

"The Maori Party congratulates Landcare Research and the Kaupapa Taiao unit of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu, in their innovative journey around Christchurch, Banks Peninsula and South Canterbury to draw attention to the damage to our natural environment" stated Te Ururoa Flavell of the Maori Party.

“It is a great idea to help us all open our eyes to the damage going on all around us in the degradation of our natural resources”.

The hikoi involves visits to marae and restoration sites which represent community and iwi-led projects to ‘reclothe’ the environment. The hikoi started at Rehua Marae on Wednesday 19th October and ends this Saturday at Waihao Marae and Te Punatarakao Wetland in Timaru.

“The positive example of this hikoi is a practical way to share the sites of significance of Papatipu Runanga with others in the wider community” said Mr Flavell.

“Aotearoa needs more examples like this, of finding ways to improve and restore the environment, and to assist resource management”.

“The Maori Party commends Kaupapa Taiao and Landcare Research in truly making the difference for a clean, green, sustainable environment”.

  
Te Ururoa Flavell is Member of Waiariki for the Maori Party. He has also been appointed to the role of Maori Party Whip, and buddy MP for Te Tai Tonga electorate. He will be attending the opening of the wharekai at Whakatu Marae in Nelson, on Saturday 22 October in this capacity.
