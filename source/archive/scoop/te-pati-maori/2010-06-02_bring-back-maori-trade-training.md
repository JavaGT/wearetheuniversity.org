Bring back Maori trade training

**Bring back Maori trade training**

The Maori Party says the answer to tackling the skills deficit among so many Maori youth lays in reviving the successful Maori trade training schemes that produced thousands of Maori carpenters, electricians, plumbers and other trades people from the 1960s to the 1980s.

“We welcome Wira Gardiner’s comment that he regrets disestablishing those schemes and that on reflection they should have been stepped up to encourage Maori achievement,” Maori Party tertiary spokesperson Te Ururoa Flavell said.

“The secondary school system is failing too many Maori youth today and as a result they are leaving school too early, without any qualifications and finding it hard to get jobs.

“Fixing that education system isn’t going to happen right away, but what can happen right now is the Tertiary Minister making a commitment to bring back a scheme that worked.”

The Maori Party’s tertiary education policy included investing in trade training and apprenticeships developed and delivered in conjunction with key industry sectors to up skill workers and address skill shortages.
