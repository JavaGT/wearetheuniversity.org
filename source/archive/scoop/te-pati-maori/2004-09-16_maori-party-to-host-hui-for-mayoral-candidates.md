Maori Party to host Hui for mayoral candidates in Tamaki Makaurau (Auckland)

The Maori Party is wanting to encourage tangata whenua to vote in the local body elections in Tamaki Makaurau (Auckland).

“We are supporting our people and the wider public to make informed choices in this year’s local body elections, by hosting a series of events” said Dr. Pita Sharples, the Co-Leader of the Maori Party, who will be facilitating the Hui.

Dr. Sharples has invited the key mayoral and local body candidates in Auckland City, Manukau City and Waitakere City respectively to speak at three Hui.

Dr. Sharples noted, “The Hui will provide members of the Maori Party with an opportunity to listen to, and ask questions of, the mayoral candidates”.

The Maori Party is also extending the invitation to the general public.
