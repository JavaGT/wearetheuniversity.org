Turia: Resistance - response to neo-liberalism
==============================================

**Wednesday, 15 August 2007, 10:45 am**  
**Speech: [The Maori Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party)**

Tuesday 14 August; 6pm-7.30pm

Lecture Theatre 3; Government Buildings, Law School, 15 Lambton Quay, VUW Pipitea Campus

Panel Discussion: Resistance - an indigenous response to neo-liberalism

  
Seven weeks ago, on a cold Tuesday night in central Wellington, people from all walks of life crowded into two lecture theatres, squashed together to hear someone the Rolling Stones named the ‘sweet black angel’.

Hundreds were turned away from the lecture of a lifetime – Professor Angela Davis, the quintessential voice of resistance.

And so I think of her, as I welcome us all here tonight, with her challenge, that

“Revolution is a serious thing, the most serious thing about a revolutionary's life. When one commits oneself to the struggle, it must be for a lifetime”.

Tonight we celebrate lifetime activists, academics and leaders who have come together as Maori, to challenge the global domination of neo-liberalism.

The publication, Resistance: An indigenous response to neo-liberalism, starts from the premise that Aotearoa is one of the world leaders of neo-liberalism.

This book provides us all with a chance to consider what part we play as individuals and as collectives, in challenging the relentless advancement of so-called ‘free-trade’; the new right, of colonisation.

As I was thinking about this panel tonight – I looked up the interpretation of ‘resistance’ in Te Matatiki – the resource of contemporary Maori words.

It defined the capacity to resist as ‘kaha papare’ to turn aside, to ward off.

And it made me think of all the everyday people who have been warding off neo-liberal practices in controlling lives; the everyday heroes who demonstrate kaha papare in all that they do.

Resistance (the book) tells us that neo-liberalism is challenged simply from Maori living – and from maintaining alternative world views.

And so I think about eight year old Te Punawai Hotu, with help from Mum, who wrote to the local paper a couple of weeks back, saying “Actions speak louder than shallow words from media commentators who blame all Maori and treat Maori as a dirty word”.

For Te Punawai, Maori living is the ultimate act of resistance – as she urges us all to do as she suggests, concluding that “my whanau and I will continue to make a positive difference in this world as Maori and as citizens of Aotearoa”.

I think, too, about TVNZ security guard Louis Rawnsley, who was fired from his post of 24 years, for a comment he made to talkback guest, Christine Rankin that her comments were over the top, and “it was a bit harsh to blame all Maori for the actions of four idiots”.

I think about our own friend Hone Harawira, who has chosen to defy the code of silence that politicians are meant to adhere to – in failing to ignore the oppressive, paternalistic, military interventions of the Howard Government.

I am heartened by the knowledge that “When one commits oneself to the struggle, it must be for a lifetime”.

Tonight is a night to cherish three of our everyday heroes who have truly committed to the life time struggle–

\- Dr Maria Bargh, of Te Arawa and Ngati Awa;

\- Dr Alice Te Punga Somerville, Te Atiawa ki Waiwhetu; and

\- Moana Jackson of Ngati Kahungunu and Ngati Porou.

I know we are in very good hands as I open the floor – to the sweet black angels of Aotearoa; whom we all know, are committed, as Te Punawai and her whanau are, to making a positive difference in this world as Maori and as citizens of Aotearoa.
