Rahui Katene Highlights significance of Southern Relationship

Te Tai Tonga MP, Rahui Katene, has today praised the initiative of the seven runaka in the Southern Region for the significance of a relationship agreement with the Southern DHB.

“This agreement reflects the emerging maturity in the Treaty relationship as all parties agree to work together to make vital improvements for Maori health gain in Otago and Southland” said Mrs Katene.

“I am delighted at the vision of the seven runaka - Oraka Aparima Runaka; Te Runanga o Awarua; Waihopai Runaka; Hokonui Runanga, Te Runanga o Otakou, Kati Huirapa Runaka ki Puketeraki and Te Runanga o Moeraki – and the good faith demonstrated by Southern DHB in looking to consolidate and formalise progress on their relationship” said Mrs Katene.

“Today’s signing of the agreement, to be known as ‘Te Hauora o Murihiku me Araiteuru’ is the latest in a series of steps to advance Maori representation in advancing outcomes for local Maori throughout the rohe”.

“Ngai Tahu and the Southern DHB can be proud that they are making tangible progress in working together to address health disparities between Maori and other New Zealanders”.

“As the local MP I congratulate all players and wish the Southern DHB Iwi Governance Committee continued strength in making meaningful decisions to improve Maori health”.

NB: The agreement will be signed by key representatives of each of the Southern Region's seven runaka and the Southern DHB Chairman Joe Butterfield in the boardroom at Dunedin Hospital, Tuesday 31 May 2011, 9.30am
