Ports of Auckland: Hon Dr Pita Sharples
=======================================

The Hon Dr Pita Sharples  
Maori Party Co-Leader | MP for Tamaki Makaurau  
Thursday 12 January 2012

**Ports of Auckland: Hon Dr Pita Sharples**

MP for Tamaki Makaurau is concerned at the impact of the concerning conflict around the Ports of Auckland on the livelihood of thousands of workers.

“The ongoing dispute is already having an adverse impact on our economic prospects, as demonstrated by Maersk Line and Fonterra’s decision to re-route its trade to Tauranga and Napier ports, and the recent actions of ships who have bypassed the port in response to the uncertainty of the industrial climate”.

“My thoughts are with the workers and their families. While the mediation proceeds between port management and the unions, the workers will be facing the inevitable anxiety about job security and future prospects”.

“I have written to the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment; Hon Steven Joyce; and the Minister for Labour; Hon Kate Wilkinson, for assurance that the employment opportunities for the affected workers are on their radar”.

“While there has been employment growth in Auckland, worst case scenario is that if the dispute is not resolved, we are looking at a substantial employment impact.

My particular concern is for our young Maori workers. In the September 2011 quarter, the unemployment rate for Maori young people (15-24 year olds) was 25.7%. The last thing we want to do is threaten job prospects for this group”.
