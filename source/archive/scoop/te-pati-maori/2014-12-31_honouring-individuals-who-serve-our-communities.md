**Honouring individuals who serve our communities**

The Māori Party celebrates the incredible contribution and sacrifices made by a noble cast of hundreds, honoured in the 2015 New Year’s Honours.

“Topping the list is our own Dame Tariana Turia, and some distinguished Knights, including the creative genius of Sir Ian Athfield; the passionate dedication of educator, Brother Pat Lynch and the heroic champion of social justice, Peter Williams QC. Their contributions have done much to shape the social fabric of New Zealand, and we appreciate their efforts on our behalf,” says Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.

“We are particularly indebted to the lifelong activism of Rob Cooper who has been awarded the CNZM for his unique advocacy in the health field. Rob’s leadership is legendary – both as a champion of decolonisation; the inspiration behind the growth of Maori health providers, and in influencing and shaping thinking in Catholic communities and beyond,” says Mr Flavell.

“We congratulate Dr Monty Soutar in the recognition accorded him for developing Māori historical research specialising in military history; Kukupu Tirikatene in advancing Māori educational outcomes, Barbara Greer for services to health on the West Coast of the South Island and Colleen Urlich for services to Māori art; all whom have been recognised with the ONZM,” says Marama Fox, Māori Party Co-leader.

“I am delighted to see the award of MNZM given to Dr Huhana Hickey honouring her for her passionate advocacy in the disability sector; Roma Hippolite for his contribution to Maori communities and in particular in health; and the energetic enthusiasm of Victoria Manning for her efforts in supporting New Zealand Deaf. The Māori Party is also very proud that Aroha Campbell has been recognised with a QSM for her multiple successes as an entrepreneur; efforts which have always acknowledged and given back to her community as a Trustee of Tauhara North no 2. I have to say I am very proud of the recognition to our local heroes across Ikaroa Rawhiti including Hinetaina (Budgie) McIlroy of Tolaga Bay for her services to the community and Teariki Mei of Wairoa for over forty years of leadership," says Mrs Fox.

The Māori Party Co-leaders salute Hoana Pearson for her contribution to Māori education; Chris Hill – a respected leader within Mana whenua ki Mohua for her services to healthcare; and Wayne Hurunui for more than three decades of voluntary service to the Shannon Volunteer Fire Brigade. They also pay homage to Prabodh Mishra for the dedicated efforts in supporting the Ministry of Education; the Kōhanga Reo National Trust and Te Papa Tongarewa.

“New Years honours is an ideal opportunity for all of us to look around Aotearoa, and to say thank you for the immense sacrifice of services given so willingly in the name of our nation," says Mr Flavell.

"The New Zealand Honours are the ultimate expression of the gift of manaakitanga, given by so many, for our benefit. Ngā mihi aroha ki a koutou katoa,” says Mrs Fox.

ENDS.
