Turia: Women in Armed Forces Bill
=================================

Human Rights (Women in Armed Forces) Amendment Bill  
Second Reading; Thursday 29 March 2007  
Tariana Turia, Co-leader, Maori Party

One would think that this Bill is a fairly straight-forward procedure. And indeed, in today’s times, one would want to think that most New Zealanders wouldn’t even blink twice at a proposal to amend the Human Rights Act to remove an exemption allowing discrimination against women.

But I’d say to them, think again.

We have been surprised at the energy that this Bill has generated amongst some sectors about a proposal to ensure that there are no impediments to prevent women from serving in active combat positions. This despite the fact that women have served in the armed forces since 1914.

However, the resistance to women serving in active combat roles has been such that it has not been until 2000 that the restrictions preventing such a possibility were lifted.

This House will be aware that we, the Maori Party, take very seriously our responsibility to look deeply into our own tikanga and histories to understand the context of any legislation that passes through this Parliament.

Case study of Heni Pore  
And so it was that I looked into the experiences of Heni Te Kiri Karamu, of Ngati Uenuku-kopako and Ngati Hinepare iwi of Te Arawa, to give some insight into women serving at the front line of combat. Heni descended from Ngatoro-i-rangi of Te Arawa waka, and was born probably around 14 November 1840 – literally born into the foundation of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

Fluent in Maori, English and French, Heni, later known as Heni Pore; became an assistant teacher and a governess at the Three Kings Native Institution, a boarding school for Maori children.

Heni Te Kiri Karamu and her family supported the King movement of Waikato when the Settler Government declared war in July 1863. They fought with Ngati Koheriki, a section of Ngati Paoa led by Wi Koka.

The following year, Heni Te Kiri Karamu and Ngati Koheriki joined the King's forces at Te Tiki-o-Te-Ihinga-rangi pa at Maungatautari.

But her contribution is probably most renowned for her involvement in the battle at Pukehinahina, or Gate Pa, on 29 April 1864. Heni was recognised as a woman warrior, a wahine toa, and refused to leave her brother, Neri.

Records of the time make for interesting reading, including accounts which report that when the wounded from British troops were left abandoned in the pa, they were treated with compassion by the defenders. Indeed, Heni Te Kiri Karamu gave water to Colonel Booth and other wounded men.

So impressed were the Brits with the chivalrous conduct of Maori at Gate Pa; that to this day, there is a stained-glass window in the chapel at Lichfield Palace, England; which commemorates the heroic actions of tangata whenua.

Mr Speaker, these are our stories, our histories, our background of revered ancestors who fought with strength and valour on behalf of their people.

The legendary adventures of the daring Heni Te Kiri Karamu demonstrates that our women have been leaders in combat; leaders in peace; leaders at the front line; and leaders who tended the wounded.

Women employed in the Armed Forces in 2007  
143 years after the Battle of Gate Pa and as of July 2006, we had 2555 women employed in the New Zealand Defence Force – the majority in the Regular force (1469) or as civilians (1086).

Of course it is not just the 2555 women in the current forces that we are thinking of with our votes today – but also the women of our future.

We noted with great interest that five of the six submitters to the select committee supported the Bill; namely:  
\* the Human Rights Foundation;  
\* the NZ Federation of Business and Professional Women;  
\* the Human Rights Commission,  
\* the National Advisory Council on the Employment of Women; and  
\* the National Council of Women.

It was their view that the proposals being debated today will enable women to legitimately enjoy the same employment opportunities as men.

Compliance with UN Conventions  
They also pointed out that the removal of the legal exemption will enable New Zealand to fully ratify its obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women; also known as CEDAW.

Mr Speaker, this House will know that our record at the United Nations is at an all time low.

Just last month, the Human Rights Commission released its report to the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (the CERD report). The report, Tui Tui Tuituia; Race Relations in 2006, pointed out the significant challenges this nation faces due to persisting social and economic inequality between different ethnic groups.

In March last year, the report by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was tabled at the UN's Human Rights Commission - alerting the UN to the significant disparities between Maori and non-Maori in employment, health, housing, education, the criminal justice system, and in portrayal in the media.

And so in the midst of such dismal reports, the opportunity for this Bill to enable compliance with international law; creating a chance for New Zealand to fully ratify its obligations under the United Nations Convention; has to be supported.

Of Peace and War  
Finally, Mr Speaker, I draw the attention of this House to the submission from the Human Rights Foundation of Aotearoa and I quote;

“the Foundation emphasises that conflict situations are routinely associated with severe human rights violations, as both cause and effect, particularly against women and children, and are inherently undesirable.”.

We, the Maori Party, cannot ignore the irony that in the midst of passionate debate about the role that physical violence plays in exerting control; we are now debating to allow women to willingly go into war; expressing tacit support for women to be in active armed combat.  
And we remind the House of the value that we would measure the role of armed forces within the context of a Genuine Progress Index.  
We remind the House, that for the price of nineteen days of global military expenditure the world could benefit from access to adequate food, clean water and safe sewers, basic health care, reproductive health care for women, and basic education.  
Every dollar that is spent by the military, could be a dollar used to promote life, not death.

We know that there are other debates that should be had about the association of women with the armed forces.  
\* the fact that women are disproportionately harmed by militarism and war;  
\* the fact that violence against families increases dramatically in war zones;  
\* and the fact that war and military power emphasize a belief that violence can solve problems; that might is right.

  
The Maori Party will support this Bill. It allows legislation to be updated to fit with changes in practice; it allows compliance with international law and indeed, supporting the notion of women in active combat is consistent with the tikanga and the histories of some hapū and iwi.

But we leave one thought with this House, about this issue of military power – a thought which takes its origins from an African proverb; and I quote:

Until lions have their historians, tales of the hunt shall always glorify the hunter.

And we wonder – who tells the stories of power and control? Who judges the victors and the victims? Who are the unnamed casualties of war and how consistently do we remind ourselves of the need for peace?

When will we be able to learn from the example of Te Whiti o Rongomai and Tohu Kakahi – pacifists of Parihaka?

I think of the words of Te Whiti in 1880, who told his people, “though some, in darkness of heart, seeing their land ravished, might wish to take arms and kill the aggressors, I say it must not be so”.

These are words of inspiration that provide us with a message of hope to guide our future activities. Let us not forget them.

  
ENDS
