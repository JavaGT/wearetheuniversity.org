Mana Maori, Mana Hawai'i – heading for Honolulu

Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader, Maori Party

10 January 2007

Dr Pita Sharples, co-leader of the Maori Party, leaves tomorrow (11 January) to attend the Hui Ho'ohawai'i Assembly Retreat in Honolulu. The assembly is made up of some fifty Hawaiian cultural leaders and educators who have been described as the ‘movers and shakers’ of Kamehameha Schools.

Dr Sharples has been specially invited to the Assembly to speak of the Maori experiences and the challenges and victories experienced in advancing Maori education and cultural revitalization.

“I was greatly honoured to be invited to speak at such a significant hui for Ho'okahua - Hawaiian Cultural Development” said Dr Sharples.

“This is an exciting time for Kamehameha Schools as they prepare for their first Hawai’ian cultural centre to be constructed (Ka'iwakiloumoku). They are preparing curriculum, planning how to invest their resources, and manage lands in ways which will re-establish their traditional perspectives”.

“Kamehameha is a major player in education and Hawai’ian cultural preservation” stated Dr Sharples. “It will be extremely rewarding to be part of a conversation in which we can share our stories about the revitalization of te reo Maori and the promotion and renaissance of Maori cultural development”.

“My focus in speaking at the hui will be on ‘Mana Maori; Maori Hawai’i’” said Dr Sharples.

“I am aware that the Kamehameha schools are currently in the midst of a complex legal challenge around their Hawai'ian preference admissions policy” said Dr Sharples.

“Although a recent decision by the Ninth Circuit Court last month was in their favour, it is anticipated that the case is headed towards the US. Supreme Court. The Maori Party will be keen to learn how the education-centred legacy of Princess Pauahi survives this latest attack”.

“There are other items that are bound to emerge at the Assembly, which we will be interested in observing” said Dr Sharples. “Most of these issues relate to what could be called ‘cultural collision’. I am told that there may be discussion around issues of spirituality (traditional, Christian, other), indigenous vs. western assessment, the role and value of Hawaiian language, Hawaiian vs. western world views”.

“The similarities between the experiences of our peoples will, I am sure, provide for a very effective dialogue” said Dr Sharples. "The Maori Party appreciates the opportunity to learn from such an important encounter".

Background Information  
Kamehameha is a private school system founded in 1887 by Princess Pauahi Bishop (great-granddaughter of King Kamehameha the Great) for students of Hawaiian ancestry. The school's endowment includes some 10% of Hawai'i's land which produces revenue to support three campuses (one on each of the largest islands, Hawai'i, Maui and O'ahu). Kamehameha Schools also provide educational support to Hawaiian learners in the public school system, charter schools and Hawaiian immersion schools.

In the Doe v Kamehameha Schools case, the United States Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Kamehameha’s preference policy is legally justified and a permissible remedy for a specific people (5 December 2006).
