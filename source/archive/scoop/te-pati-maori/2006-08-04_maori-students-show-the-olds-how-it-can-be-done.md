Maori Students Show the Olds How it can be done

A Rangatahi Business Competition held in Waikato last night has been promoted by Hone Harawira as the way to go.

The Rangatahi Business Competition was run by Te Ranga Ngaku, the Maori Management Student Network at the University of Waikato Management School for six schools within the Waikato rohe - Te Kura o Te Kaokaoroa o Patetere, Fraser High School, Fairfield College, Melville High School, Hillcrest High School and Cambridge High School.

"I've been hearing all these reports today about what a great night it was" said Hone Harawira, Business and Employment spokesperson for the Maori Party.

"Te Ranga Ngaku has a commitment to encouraging Maori students within the Waikato region" said Mr Harawira. "I understand they've been working with the schools all year, helping to ensure their aspirations are set on high, that the world's their oyster".

"It's exactly the type of kick-ass attitude we want for our rangatahi - to know that business and enterprise are within their reach, that they can foot it in the business environment, and that their talents are what this country needs in our future".

"And in fact it's such a good idea, I'm going to steal it and take it up North" ended Hone Harawira, MP for Te Tai Tokerau.

Staff from the Maori Party met up with the mentors from Te Ranga Ngaku when they visited Parliament earlier this year, and have been watching their development with great interest.
