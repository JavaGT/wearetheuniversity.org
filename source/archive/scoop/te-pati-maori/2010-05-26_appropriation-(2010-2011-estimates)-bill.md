Appropriation (2010/2011 Estimates) Bill
========================================

**Wednesday, 26 May 2010, 3:48 pm**  
**Speech: [The Maori Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party)**

**Appropriation (2010/2011 Estimates) Bill**  
**Rahui Katene, MP for Te Tai Tonga**  
**Wednesday 26 May 2010; 3.15pm**

The Maori population is a young population, the median age barely reaching 23 years, compared to 36.4 years in the total population.

Putting it another way, some 34% of the Maori population is under the age of fifteen.

This demographic profile brings with it a special set of priorities which we look for in the Budget announcements made last Thursday.

When we combine the disproportionately low median income (in mid 2008 this was $500 a week compared to $537 for the total population) it provides a particular context for this debate.

In the health arena, an additional $51 million was allocated to meet the pressure of the _Very Low Cost Access_ programme and other primary healthcare services.

Why is this important?

A very low cost access payment is to support practices that maintain very low fees; practices that typically serve high need communities.

On top of this, of course, we would expect that the $1.4 billion extra funding for District Health Boards will also include interventions which reduce health inequalities.

When constituents walk in my door, the two biggest issues that they seek help with are either health or education.

In education, I think one of the unsung good news stories of this year’s Budget has been the injection of another $1.9 billion over four years, including a four percent increase in operational funding for schools.

The challenge is, however, to look past the generalities and see what support is available to meet the areas of highest need and greatest demand.  
I am therefore really pleased that an additional $91.8 million is being invested in early childhood education participation for families in areas which are under-represented.

The focus is on ensuring that the families in most need get access to these services.

The 91 million dollars has been earmarked for Maori, Pasifika and low income areas out of the total investment of $107 million.

There has been a lot said about what could at the very least be described as a contentious decision in this year’s Budget about early childhood education.

But if there was any doubt as to the value of investment being allocated to Maori participation, this week’s report from the Education Review Office proved without doubt how vital it is to support and promote early childhood education opportunities for Maori.

The _Success for Maori Children in Early Childhood Services_ released on Monday, reported that nearly two-thirds of early childhood teachers were not focused on helping Maori to become _“competent and confident learners”_ and more than half of the services were failing to respond adequately to the expectations of whanau Maori.

One of the most pragmatic findings was that playgroups, playcentres, kindergartens and other services were failing to set Maori education in a Maori context.

It’s not breaking news – but all the research tells us that children are taught best when the context makes sense to them. For tamariki Maori, that context is one which responds to them as Maori.

The ERO report concluded that there were some key things that centres could do to increase the responsiveness of their service to whanau. They could  
\- look at how they consulted whanau;  
\- they could ensure they incorporated Maori perspectives into education;  
\- they could provide more professional development for educators and managers in working with Maori;  
\- and they could evaluate the impact of their programmes for Maori.

Mr Speaker, I come back to my starting point of how the Budget responds to the particular and unique needs of the Maori population.

And while I am in the education sector I want to also draw attention to the  
\- additional $48 million going into Youth Guarantee which will raise the number of places available next year from 2000 to 2500;  
\- another $8.4 million going to help kura retain their secondary school students;  
\- and another $126 million for help Maori medium schools develop tools to assess the progress of their students.

These are all important initiatives which will help to ensure rangatahi Maori are participating, achieving and succeeding in school.

It will help to pave the way for future employment and further education opportunities, and in that respect, help to build a stronger workforce to face our future.

Another key initiative that was introduced in Budget 2010 was the investment of $91 million for a new Quality Services Fund for Non-government organisations.

This is a really important mechanism for supporting our community groups; helping to enhance their capacity and capability; and respond to the unique needs of communities across the country.

Finally, I want to make some comments about what we may call the unfailing test of a civilisation – and that is how we treat our most vulnerable, our young and our old.

Part of the Budget package of course includes increases of 2.02 percent for all main benefits, for NZ Superannuation, for Veterans Pensions and for CPI adjusted Government Superannuation fund.

That’s important of course in that it helps to provide immediate compensation for the rise in GST.

But for those who received superannuation or a veterans pension there will also be a tax cut on top of the compensation for GST, thereby increasing their after tax income quite considerably.

While such a lot has been said about GST and tax cuts, I received an email yesterday which brought everything back into perspective about Budget 2010.

Moyra Bramley, responding to one of the releases we issued on Budget Day, shared some of her own unique brand of wisdom to guide our thinking about the difference that Budget Day makes.

She said, and I quote:

_I understand the reasoning behind the increase in GST and accept we all have to tighten our belts for the sake of those who have no jobs , no fathers or mothers to raise the kids, and although it s going to be hard, there is a way to better the lot of those who will be affected most._  
  
_If you have a plot of land and most do wherever they are living, then plant some vegetables. Take cooking lessons and learn to make meals out of nothing. Nourishing meals do not need expensive cuts or expensive ingredients. Op shops have awesome clothing for a few dollars for everyone of all sizes. Shoes at $2 per pair._  
  
_So it is just a matter of reprioritising where your money gives you the best value._  
  
_But in this country, no one should go hungry or without clothing if they spend their benefits wisely and most of all stop smoking and drinking. Buy food for your babies instead._  
  
_I am so pleased I taught my kids to cook at an early age, even my boys and now they have no problems stretching the dollar”._

Mr Speaker, I chose to quote extensively from Moyra’s message to us because so often, the greatest advice comes not from the experts and the purchase advisors – but actually from those wise souls all around us who have been through it and are still going through it

The reality is, there will always be those who say that there is not enough in the Government’s budget for them. My brief overview of some of the essentials of Budget 2010 prove without doubt that there are some great initiatives included in this year’s approach, which really focus on those most in need.

But there is also the evergreen message that ultimately, no matter how great our wealth the biggest difference made can be in making the most of our resources; and investing in the value of collective responsibility. It’s all about whanau ora.
