### **Disciplinary and Disputes Committee of the Maori Party**

  

**Sunday 30 January 2011; Pem Bird; President of the Maori Party**  

Maori Party President, Pem Bird, has released the names of the members comprising the Disciplinary and Disputes Committee of the Maori Party.

The Disciplinary and Disputes Committee will meet on Wednesday 9 February 2011 to consider a complaint made against Maori Party MP Hone Harawira, by Maori Party whip, Te Ururoa Flavell. This hui, will be preceded by a confidential kanohi-ki-te-kanohi meeting on 1 February.

The Disciplinary and Disputes Committee is chaired by Maori Party co-vice president, Te Orohi Paul, and is comprised of five members: Donna Gardiner, Matiu Dickson; Gordon Paku and Ken Mair (brief pen-portraits attached).

“Between this group of five we are confident that the process the Committee must undertake will be done so with the greatest impartiality and the utmost respect for process” said Mr Bird.

“The membership includes a wide diversity of tribal wisdom, and expertise across the education; health; social services, and the justice sector.

“There is also a very strong level of knowledge about community development, with experience across whanau, hapu and iwi a common feature in the backgrounds of each of the five members of the committee”.

“And as to be expected, there is particular and impressive expertise in the committee membership in matters of legal proficiency; dispute resolution and cultural competency”.

“All of these skills are both essential in working within the tikanga framework of the Maori Party constitution; and will be vital in the disputes process”.

“Four of the members have been key figures in both National Council representation, and in electorate management positions (specifically in Ikaroa Rawhiti; Tamaki Makaurau; Te Tai Hauauru and Waiariki) since the foundation of the Maori Party in 2004, and the fifth member, Matiu Dickson, brings in an external independence to the committee”.

“All parties look forward to a swift and effective resolution of the issues, based on the kaupapa of the Maori Party” said Mr Bird. “The quality of the membership of the Disciplinary and Disputes Committee gives me great confidence that the process will be able to seek resolution of the matters”.
