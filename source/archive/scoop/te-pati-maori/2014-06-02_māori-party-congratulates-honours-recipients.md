**Māori Party congratulates Queen's Birthday Honours Recipients for 2014**

Maori Party MPs have congratulated the individuals, whanau, hapu and iwi who have been recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours for 2014 for their exemplary contribution to Maori development.

“There is a clear theme of Maori excellence demonstrated through the leadership and inspiration we see in every sphere of enterprise, including education, health, arts, culture, te reo, sports and the judiciary” said Hon Tariana Turia. “Topping the list is Dame Justice Lowell-Goddard, believed to be the first tangata whenua appointed to the High Court; one of the first New Zealand women to be appointed Queen's Counsel, a former Chair of the Independent Police Conduct Authority, and an expert member of the UN Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture” said Mrs Turia.

“We are thrilled to commend three new Companions– Professor Jonathan Mane-Wheoki; Distinguished Professor Hingangaroa Smith; and Dr Huirangi Waikerepuru said Dr Pita Sharples. "Professor Mane-Wheoki was appointed head of Elam School of Fine Arts at the University of Auckland; is an art historian, architectural historian, cultural historian and curator. Professor Smith and Dr Waikerepuru have played a significant role in language revitaliation; with Graham being co-founder or the national Centre for Maori Development and Advancement of Research Excellence, and as CEO of Te Whare Wananga o Awanuiarangi. Te Huirangi has been a driving force behind Te Reo O Taranaki; a leading figure in two major Waitangi Tribunal claims; which resulted in the formation of the Maori Broadcasting Agency, and later Maori Television".
