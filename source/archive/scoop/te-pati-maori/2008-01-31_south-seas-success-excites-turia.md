South Seas Success Excites Turia

Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party

Thursday 31 January 2008

The opening of the 2008 Year for South Seas Film and Television School in Glenfield Auckland, was an opportunity to celebrate the incredible potential of young New Zealanders participating in the broadcasting industry, says Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party.

Mrs Turia attended the powhiri this morning for South Seas –a leading film, television, onscreen acting and animation training institution.

“It was really exciting to see some hundred New Zealand students, and another seventy international students, eager to take up a part in the industry” said Mrs Turia.

“And it was a huge buzz to know that some 36 of these students are Maori – and that 75% of those students are fluent in te reo rangatira” said Mrs Turia. “It is obvious that our rangatahi Maori are going to be a significant force to be reckoned with, as directors, actors, producers, animators in a high-growth industry like film and television”.

“I was told that in 2001, there were only six Maori students enrolled in the programme – and only one of those with proficiency in te reo Maori” said Mrs Turia. “It is a huge credit to our kura kaupapa Maori, our wananga, and indeed all of our whanau that are supporting our up and coming stars in film and television”.

“Indeed, what struck me, was to see the pride that our kuia and koroheke, had in accompanying their young mokopuna, to start a new career pathway”.

“The morning was also an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made to Maori broadcasting by Te Aitanga-a-Mahaki and Tuhoe man, Haare Williams” said Mrs Turia.

“Haare is someone who has dedicated his life to education, to health, to broadcasting, to preserving our cultural heritage, to iwi development and to excellence in arts” said Mrs Turia. “The students of South Seas are indeed fortunate to be mentored by someone who is so precious to the industry”.

“This morning was an opportunity to celebrate the potential our young people have for success in the industries of tomorrow” said Mrs Turia.

“After all of the recent focus on youth crime, it was really disappointing that there appeared to be no television cameras present to show the nation another picture of our young people” said Mrs Turia. “And of course, it was particularly disappointing that Maori Television wasn’t there to celebrate with us the glorious potential of this new intake to the industry”.
