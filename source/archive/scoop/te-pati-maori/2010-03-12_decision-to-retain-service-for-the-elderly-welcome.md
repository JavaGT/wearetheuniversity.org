Decision to retain service for the elderly welcome

**Decision to retain service for the elderly welcomed**

The Maori Party welcomes the Government's assurance today that it will not be cutting [SuperGold Card](http://www.supergold.govt.nz/) public transport services.

“The SuperGold Card scheme is a valued and much needed service for people over 65,” Maori Party senior citizens spokesperson Tariana Turia said.

“I welcome Steven Joyce’s assurance that the ‘government is totally committed to the SuperGold Card, including the transport concession.’

“There are tens of thousands of elderly people who may not be able to drive, who are on low incomes and who need to get from A to B to get food, visit relatives in hospital and play a role in their communities. I know that the SuperGold Card was a great source of relief for these people, in helping to improve the quality of their life.”

Mrs Turia said she was fully supportive of the review if the focus is on ensuring the longevity of the SuperGold Card services.

“Our elderly people are a taonga and their wisdom and guidance is crucial in building strong and healthy communities. I have supported the SuperGold card in that it allows them freedom to contribute to their communities."
