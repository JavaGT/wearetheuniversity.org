Maori Party expresses sorrow at death of DPA President

Hon Tariana Turia, Associate Minister of Health  
Thursday 5 February 2009

Maori Party co-leader, and disability issues spokesperson, Tariana Turia, has today spoken of the great loss suffered with the shock death of Disabled Persons Assembly President, Eamon Daly.

“Eamon was intimately involved in many areas of academic research, with particular expertise as an ethicist” said Mrs Turia. “He was a keen scholar – having studied at the University of California, Berkeley and the London School of Economics, while also lecturing in philosophy and ethics”.

“He combined that study with a passion to support and empower disabled persons to live the lives they want to live”said Mrs Turia.

“It is one of those truly sad ironies that just as Aotearoa ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, we were to lose someone who has been so vital in the pathway towards implementation”.

“The Maori Party extends our great sorrow to his family, the Disabled Persons Assembly and the wider community, at such a difficult time”.

ENDS
