=======================================

Media release for immediate use

Rise of young politicians continues with new electorate candidate for Māori Party.

Tasha Hohaia has been selected by the Māori Party to stand for the Manurewa electorate in the 2017 General Election.

Currently the young professional is a Student Voice and Advocacy Facilitator in the tertiary sector.

Being Māori and Pakeha of Ngā Puhi descent, she has grown up in Auckland with a varied background in community development. A tertiary education in Law and Arts, with her long-term involvement in the New Zealand music scene, Hohaia has continually found creative ways of engagement across a range of demographics. She has toured nationally as a recording artist with a vision to promote positive messages for young audiences.

However it is her work in the tertiary sector that has seen her thrive in creating educational opportunities for the South Auckland community.

“I’m excited for the opportunity to stand for the Maori Party, for the Manurewa electorate, and for a fresh wave of vision. For me, it represents a space for connectedness, aroha, and care. I believe vision is as big as heart capacity, and I’ve learnt to lead, listen and love people”.

The young candidate has complete support from Maori Party president Tukoroirangi Morgan, “Tasha is a dynamic young leader who brings a fresh approach to advocacy and caring for Maori, Pasifika and young people. Her appreciation for diversity is valued and we look forward to engaging a younger audience in this year’s election”.
