Pariroa marae – 115 Year Celebration  
Hon Tariana Turia, MP for Te Tai Hauauru  
Wednesday 7 October 2009

  
A week ago there was an article in the Taranaki Daily News entitled ‘Honour for little-known Pariroa Marae’. Included within the article was a comment from someone who has given his every waking moment to making this day happen, Hemi Ngarewa.

In touching humility, this respected kaumatua admitted that for the purposes of today’s event, 'they would probably need to erect direction signs because many people do not know this marae'.

I hasten to suggest that by the end of today, Pariroa Pa will be the name on everyone’s lips, for a whole bunch of reasons.

Pariroa will be known as the oldest marae in the rohe of Ngati Ruanui. This is a marae with a proud history of over 115 years – a legacy that takes us back to 1894 when this pa's founding rangatira Tutange Waionui, travelled across the river from Hukatere and settled with his wife, Ngaati.

Today we celebrate Tutange and Ngaati –and we honour their uri who are gathered here today as the living memory of their ancestors – estimates suggest there are at least 2000 mokopuna who bear their whakapapa.

The son of Maruera and Inuata, Tutange was born at Ohaewai. He was renown for his close quarter combat, he fought alongside Titokowaru and is forever immortalised as the crouching warrior with taiaha poised that graced our one shilling coin.

And so today is a day to honour the achievements of a legendary warrior of the Taranaki wars of 1868-9.

Pariroa Marae was therefore a thoroughly appropriate place for the Crown to come to in June 2003, when the former Minister, Margaret Wilson, publically apologised on behalf of the Crown for historical injustices against Ngati Ruanui.

It was at this very pa that the Crown acknowledged that their action in confiscating almost ninety thousand hectares of tribute estate in the 1800s, caused suffering and hardship over successive generations.

But there are other memories associated with the legacy of Tutange Waionui. Tutange is also remembered as a sophisticated diplomat; a revered politician – skills that have clearly been passed down over the generations including to your current deputy mayor for South Taranaki, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer.

Indeed if you look into the reports of the Native Affairs Committee in 1888, some 121 years ago, you will find petition number 340 from Tutange Waionui and 28 others.

The petition asks that restrictions against fishing in the Patea River should be removed as the fish caught there are a source of sustenance to the natives.

Two decades after that, there is another petition from Tutange Waionui and 46 others – this one states quite simply, that the fishing grounds in the Patea district should be returned to them.

When we look at the taonga presented today, in the form of the handwritten letters of this distinguished tupuna, it is evident that not only was he a proud advocate for the people of Ngati Tupito and Ngatiringi, but he was also a skilled negotiator who stood his ground –steadfastly rejecting the alienation of tribal land by lease, sale or mortgage.

Over the centuries these same skills have been replicated in many ways.

I think back to a decade ago at the passing of kaumatua Hoani John Heremaia.

At his passing, the tributes were overwhelming – they spoke of his gifts as a flamboyant orator, who represented South Taranaki in New York during the Te Maori exhibition. They remembered it was Hoani Heremaia who was chosen to bless the new Taranaki frigate in the 1980s.

And in perhaps the most controversial battle of all, he was remembered for making Pariroa marae alcohol free – despite great opposition. It was a war that he took great pride in fighting –recognising the enormous social cost associated with alcohol.

I could spend much longer than the programme would allow – tracing all of the achievements and successes of the uri of this marae – but suffice to say Pariroa Pa has a distinctive reputation that we honour, we treasure, and we celebrate today.

But there is one more achievement that I want to recognise today – and that is the enthusiasm and the energy with which you are embracing the concept of whanau ora.

I look around us today - and I see the faces of Ngati Ruanui, Tangahoe, Pakakohe, Nga Ruahine a Rangi, Nga Rauru, Ngati Ruanui Tahua, - indeed representatives of the iwi and hapu throughout Taranaki.

And I mihi to you all for the act of kotahitanga, the expression of manaakitanga, the respect for whakawhanaungatanga that is being demonstrated in this event.

Ultimately you are the living memories of those who have passed before us – and the promise of those to come.

It is your connections binding you together that will provide the strength and the resilience that will enable the people to endure.

The presence of your kohanga reo and kura kaupapa provide for us the anticipation of a future in which the name of Pariroa Marae will be one spoken with pride.

The presence of Patea Maori Club, of the kapa haka, encourage us to know the waiata of this marae will continue to be sung; the culture and the heritage will continue to flourish.

The presence of the Government, the South Taranaki District Council, and the wide range of community members all tell us your future is in great hands.

I congratulate you all on this significant occasion, I thank all of you for your hospitality and your commitment to ensuring the history of your people is forever protected.

And I am so very proud to celebrate with you this very historic occasion to honour Pariroa Marae for all you have achieved, and hope to achieve for the next thousand years.

ENDS
