The Maori Party is doing its bit to fly the flag
================================================

Sunday 3 February 2008

The Maori Party is doing its bit to help people to fly the tino rangatiratanga flag.

The Maori Party is selling tino rangatiratanga car flags in a pack which includes both the tino rangatiratanga flag and the Maori Party flag. The flags clip onto a car window.

"The flags can flow all over the country" says Waiariki MP, Te Ururoa Flavell.

"We wanted to promote them in Waitangi week as a contribution to Waitangi week" said Flavell.

"We were also happy to support the "5 days of tino' campaign to fly the tino rangatiratanga flag" said Te Tai Tokerau MP, Hone Harawira.

"We celebrate the legacy of Te Kawariki which some eighteen years ago, introduced the distinctive rangatiratanga flag" said Hone Harawira.

"This year in particular, we treasure the unfolding of new life that is represented in the curling frond shape of the koru (on the flag)" said Harawira. "It represents renewal and hope for the future - aspirations which tangata whenua are proud to promote as we prepare for Election 2008".

"With the tino rangatiratanga flag on one side, and the Maori Party flag proudly flying on the other, tangata whenua will be driving the highways in style" said Harawira.

The 2008 candidates for the Maori Party elected to date are:

\- Hone Harawira (Te Tai Tokerau);

\- Tariana Turia (Te Tai Hauauru);

\- Angeline Greensill (Hauraki-Waikato);

\- Te Ururoa Flavell (Waiariki) and

\- Dr Pita Sharples (Tamaki Makaurau).

The candidates for Ikaroa Rawhiti and Te Tai Tonga will be elected by mid March 2008.
