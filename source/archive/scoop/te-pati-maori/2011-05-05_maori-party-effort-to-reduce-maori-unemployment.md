Maori Party effort to reduce Maori unemployment

**Maori Party effort to reduce Maori unemployment**

An initiative made possible because of the Maori Party’s influence in Government has resulted in jobs for 250 Maori people who were previously unemployed.

“The Maori economic development work our leader Dr Pita Sharples is doing in his capacity as Maori Affairs Minister has proven that we can move our people, especially youth, out of unemployment,” Maori Party MP Rahui Katene said.

“Of course there are thousands of Maori who need training and jobs and there will be no quick fix to the bigger issue of unemployment, but our party is absolutely committed to making sure the work we do in Parliament will have bread and butter benefits for our people.”

Dr Sharples’ Maori economic development work has already seen 1500 Maori get training.

Mrs Katene acknowledged that businesses must grow if jobs are to be created.
