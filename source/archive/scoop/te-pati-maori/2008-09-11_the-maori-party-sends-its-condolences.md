The Maori Party sends its condolences

“On behalf of members, supporters, families and friends, we send our deepest condolences to the family of the Police Officer killed last night in Mangere” said a sombre candidate for Hauraki-Waikato, Angeline Greensill.

“The nation will awake to this tragic news and we send our support to all involved” said Mrs Greensill.

“We, as a community, rally in defence of officers dismantling the insidious P-trade, especially when dealers operate in neighbourhoods with children, our elderly and families”.

Mrs Greensill stated “At this stage, we are uncertain of the details but do express our heart-felt sympathy and support to the Police community and to the immediate and extended whanau of the officers involved.”
