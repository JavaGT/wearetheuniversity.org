Te Ururoa Flavell

MP for Waiariki

Nga Potiki and Tauranga City Council Collaboration praised by Flavell

Local MP for Waiariki, Te Ururoa Flavell, is proud of the progress achieved in tonight's first reading of the Mount Maunganui Borough Reclamation and Empowering Act Repeal Bill.

“I want to particularly recognise the leadership of Sandy Tuhakaraina (Ngā Potiki) and Matire Duncan and Victoria Kingi (Ngā Potiki Resource Management Unit) in helping get this Bill to the House.

“Through the efforts of Ngā Potiki, in co-operation with Ngaiterangi; Ngāti Ranginui and Ngāti Pūkenga, we have made a significant advance in repealing legislation which was essentially offensive to all iwi within the region- as well as distasteful to the wider community”.

“The reclamation of the landscape and the associated sewerage disposal scheme – gave rise to the discharge of human waste into the pristine waters of Te Tahuna o Rangataua.

“The discharge of effluent was the focus of community opposition for over forty years. Many of the local kaumātua were particularly upset at the construction of an easement to enable the discharge of effluent into the ocean, which trampled through the sacred burial grounds (urupa) of Papamoa”.

“This Bill demonstrates the power of Parliament to work in the best interests of our community. There has been a strong relationship between Tauranga City Council, Ngā Potiki, and the local MPs and I am sure we are all pleased that the aspirations of our constituency in relation to Te Tahuna o Rangataua are finally being realised.

The Mount Maunganui Borough Reclamation and Empowering Act Repeal Bill passed at its first reading tonight. Submissions will now be called for by the Local Government and Environment select committee.
