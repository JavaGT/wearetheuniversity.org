### Wood Processing industry needs all our support says Turia

Maori Party co-leader, Tariana Turia, has congratulated the National Distribution Union for its Six Point Plan to help the wood processing industry.

“Whanau in Te Tai Hauauru, are suffering the immediate impacts of the loss of eighty jobs at Winstone Pulp International's Tangiwai Mill - and are desperately in need of support – as are, of course, the whanau of mill workers in Matawhero (near Gisborne) and Kawerau, who are in a similar position”.

“The Six Point Plan places priority on support for workers, while also emphasizing strategic alliances with MFAT, NZTE, the wood processing industry, industry representatives, companies and unions”.

“Government must take up our responsibility to invest in research, in innovation and in economic solutions which will increase productivity and economic growth”.

“We are particularly in favour of the proposal to use local lumber materials for Canterbury reconstruction work – and we would hope local labour will also be promoted in the vital construction task ahead”.

“I will be writing to the Forestry Minister, David Carter, indicating the support of the Maori Party for a bold new plan to help the wood processing industry” ended Mrs Turia.
