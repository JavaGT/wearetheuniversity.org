**Māori Party Celebrates Diverse Talents of those honoured**

“The selfless dedication and lifelong sacrifice of so many leaders throughout our community is acknowledged in the Queens’ Birthday 2012 Awards’ says Tariana Turia, co-leader of the Māori Party.

“We are all so proud of **Dame June Mariu** who is loved and respected in so many areas of education and community development.

“The first Māori woman to captain the Silver Ferns, June also represented New Zealand in indoor basketball and was a North Island representative in softball. During her Presidency of the Māori Women’s Welfare League, she established the Aotearoa Māori Netball Oranga Healthy Lifestyles Initiative.

“She has given so much to netball – and I am sure she’ll be just as thrilled that **Robyn Broughton**, ONZM, and **Temepara George**, MNZM, are also being honoured for their dedication to the game”.

“She is known as an inspirational teacher, mentor, coach; a foundation trustee of Hoani Waititi marae; former Chair of Te Whānau o Waipareira Trust; a member of Te Kahui Mana Ririki and a member of the Waitakere taskforce against family violence; and an enormous range of Commissions and Boards both in Auckland and nationwide”.

“Whaea June is never happier than in the heart of her community. This is a wonderful 80th birthday tribute to her devotion to the people for well over 50 years”.

“It is also very timely to honour **John Spencer**, CNZM, who has just been appointed to board of Raukawa Iwi Development LTD (RIDL), the commercial arm of South Waikato based iwi Raukawa. Mr Spencer is currently the Chairman of Tainui Group Holdings Limited (TGHL), Kiwi rail Limited, WEL Networks Ltd and is a director of Dispute Resolutions Services Ltd

“I was privileged to attend the signing of the Deed of Settlement at Aotearoa Marae in Te Awamutu on Saturday” said Mrs Turia “Raukawa are at an exciting point of their development and the impressive skills and commercial acumen of Mr Spencer will be much valued.

Ngāi Tahu/Ngāi Tuahuriri woman, **Jane Huria**, CNZM, has a vast range of skills and experience across law, financial markets and corporate governance.

“As well as her contribution across boards such as ACC, Legal Service Agency, and the Institute of Directors, Jane has played a crucial role in helping to advance social wellbeing for our whanau in her role as Chair of He Oranga Pounamu. She’s a thoroughly positive, enthusiastic and motivated person who never fails to impress with her energy and zest for life”.

It is also entirely right that **Traci Houpapa,** MNZM, is recognised for her successful leadership of New Zealand’s largest Māori Business network, the Federation of Māori Authorities. Under her strategic guidance, the $10 billion asset base of FOMA members has continued to contribute positively to Māori economic growth”.

“I am delighted that **Ruahine (Roni) Albert and Ariana Simpson** have been recognised for the ground-breaking work they have pioneered since they opened Te Whakaruruhau Māori Women’s Refuge in Hamilton over 25 years ago; New Zealand’s first refuge for Māori women.  
“These two women have been leading the way through a whānau-focused approach to help whānau be safe from abusive relationships. Their work extends past emergency accommodation to post crisis support and early intervention for families struggling to break the cycle of violence”.

“We are proud to acknowledge **Lewis Moeau and Hiria Hape** who have been honoured with the Queens Service Order for their devoted support to Government agencies, Ministers and Governor Generals alike; in their expert way in which they have guided the Crown in adhering to the protocols appropriate to whānau, hapū and iwi”.

“It is also fantastic to see **Joe Harawira** (QSM) honoured for his courage and perseverance as part of Sawmill Workers Against Poisons (SWAP). Joe, along with other SWAP members, galvanised research into the debilitating effects of Pentachlorophenol (PCP) on whānau and on the environment. This honour is a fitting tribute to the heroic campaign Joe mobilised for the people and land of Ngāti Awa”.
