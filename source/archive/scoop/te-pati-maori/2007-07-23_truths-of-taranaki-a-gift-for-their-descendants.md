Truths of Taranaki a Gift for their Descendants

Tariana Turia, Member of Parliament for Te Tai Hauauru

Monday 23 July 2007

  
Tariana Turia today congratulated Karangaora and the ‘gatherers of stories’ for the priceless gift they have created for generations to come.

Matarakau – Nga korero mo nga rongoa o Taranaki, healing stories of Taranaki was being launched at Te Niho in Parihaka Pa today at 10am.

“The stories are powerful voices in what Queenie Rikihana refers to as ‘strategic conversations, a journey of a thousand years’” said Mrs Turia.

‘The learning they share from the worlds of their ancestors will guide the pathways of the mokopuna to come” said Mrs Turia.

“The days gone by come to life – the discipline and hard work ethic of life on the farm; the rituals around kaimoana; the sharing of kai from their gardens with other whanau” said Mrs Turia.

“Woven throughout the stories, the people talk of the vital role that mirimiri, romiromi, rongoa and karakia play in holistic and preventive health, and in spiritual wellbeing” said Mrs Turia.

“When we think of the levels of unwellness prevalent in so many of our whanau with diabetes, cancer, respiratory issues and the like, the learnings that Matarakau opens up, in areas of self-awareness and self-healing, will be invaluable”.

“The strength of rongoa as natural healing is given life through stories of gathering plants and medicinal herbs, as well as the restorative values of whakapapa, of whenua, of whanaungatanga” said Mrs Turia.

“As Kato Luke explains, ‘Where we can stand on our whenua, this is the healing. Hokia ki to whenua tuturu'”.

“This is a very important book which reminds us all of the practices and tikanga which sustain our health, our comfort and our community strength” said Mrs Turia.

“It reinforces the power of indigenous healing knowledge and the enduring relevance of nga taonga o nga tipuna (the treasures of our ancestors)”.

“And importantly it is a Taranaki-tuturu kaupapa” said Mrs Turia.  
“It is whanau, hapu, iwi energy in action – the interviewers and the interviewees, the photography, film-making, story-telling, research, and the stories all belong to Taranaki – and as such, I truly congratulate them all on the treasures they have woven together in this one project”.
