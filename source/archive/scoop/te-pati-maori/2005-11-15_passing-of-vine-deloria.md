'Passing of Vine Deloria - an intellectual beacon amongst indigenous people' says Tariana Turia, Co-lealder, Maori Party

"The passing of Vine Deloria, Jr. a prominent Native American scholar, whose research, writings, and teaching have encompassed history, law, religious studies, and political science is indeed a sad occasion for the international indigenous community," said Tariana Turia co-leader of the Maori Party, on the death yesterday of a favourite son of the Standing Rock Sioux.

Hailed by Time magazine as "one of the eleven great religious thinkers of the twentieth century", Vine Deloria a retired Professor Emeritus of history at the University of Colorado and the author of many highly praised books, including Red Earth, White Lies, and God is Red "shone as an intellectual beacon amongst indigenous people". said Mrs Turia.

"While I never met Dr. Deloria" said Mrs Turia, "I have always been inspired by his keen intellect and his absolute commitment to articulating the world view of his people which as a result inspired other indigenous scholars and activists, including tangata whenua here in Aotearoa".

"Having often used his thoughts in my speeches over the years, my thoughts are with his family at this time".

Na reira, e te rangatira Vine, takahia te ara a o matua tipuna. Waihotia ko matau kei muri e takatu nei.
