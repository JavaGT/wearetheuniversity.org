Māori Party congratulates the New Plymouth District Council

  
The Māori Party congratulates the New Plymouth District Council (NPDC) for its foresight in the establishment of a Māori ward this week.

“This is a giant leap forward for democracy for tāngata whenua in the northern Taranaki district and will ensure that a Māori voice is heard at the Council table,” says Co-leader Tariana Turia.

“When Māori are the minority in any community it is vital that there is a guaranteed pathway for an independent Māori voice. We congratulate the NPDC who now join Environment Bay of Plenty and the Waikato Regional Council who also have Māori representation in their arrangements,” says Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.

“It is heartening to see more local bodies taking such as inclusive approach so that Māori can participate in the decision-making process. I encourage the citizens of the NPDC to embrace this decision and see a Māori voice at the table as crucial to democracy.”
