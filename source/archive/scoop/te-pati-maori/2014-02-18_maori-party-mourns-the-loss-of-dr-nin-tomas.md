**Maori Party mourns the loss of Dr. Nin Tomas**

_E te uri o Te Hiku o te Ika, o Te Rarawa, o Ngati Kahu, o Ngapuhi nui tonu –_  
_E te whaea o te ture, te kaitiaki o nga tikanga Maori, te toa o te reo Maori –_  
_E te kaokao awhi, te ringa awhina i nga tauira Maori e whai atu ana i o tapuwae –_  
_Haere atu ra, haere atu ra!_  
_E hoki to tinana ki to ukaipo, e hoki to wairua i te ara whanui a Tane, ki te Reinga, ki te Rerenga Wairua, ki Hawaiki ra ano. Ka maumahara tonu tatou ki to kaha, ki to aroha, ki to manaaki i te tini o nga tauira o te ture. Waiho ma ratou nga take nunui o te iwi e hapai, e kokiri._  
_Heoi ano ta matou, he tangi atu i konei, me te aroha ki to tama, ki to whanau, ki o iwi._  
_Moe mai ra, moe mai ra._

The Maori Party is saddened by the loss of Dr Nin Tomas (Ngati Kuri, Te Rarawa, Ngapuhi), a mother, a law expert, a staunch advocate for kaupapa Maori including te reo Maori and a wonderful mentor to many Maori law graduates.

“Nin was a stalwart of our community. She made us all so proud when she became the first Maori to gain a PhD in Law. She was passionate about all things Maori and was tireless in her support for Maori law students. The contribution she has made to our Maori communities is immeasurable,” says Tariana Turia.

Dr Pita Sharples says Nin was not only well regarded in the law community she was also a passionate advocate for te reo Maori.

“She provided critical support for the claims on Maori language and broadcasting to the Privy Council through organising voluntary legal advice in the early nineties. She was also part of a group who established one of the first kohanga reo in Auckland, Te Kohanga Reo o Waiatarau. Whenever there was a kaupapa that involved our reo, our tikanga and our people she was there,” says Dr Sharples.

Te Ururoa Flavell says Nin had an astute legal mind with a particular talent in working through some of the more complex sensitivities around tikanga such as the protocols around the treatment of tupapaku.

“Nin has also been a determined campaigner for the proper application of the Resource Management Act and particularly in protecting threatened flora and fauna icon species.”

“We send our deepest sympathies to her whanau and in particular to her son Dr Inia Tomas. She will be sadly missed,” says Mr Flavell.
