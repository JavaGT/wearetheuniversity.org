Maori Party President congratulates Parliamentary team

The President of the Maori Party, Professor Whatarangi Winiata, today congratulated the leaders and members of the party’s Parliamentary caucus on their top rating in the annual TransTasman review of MPs’ performance.

“At the final Maori Party hui for 2009, held today in Hauraki-Waikato (Hamilton), the National Council expressed a motion of appreciation for the work of the five Maori Party members of parliament” said Professor Winiata.

“The TransTasman newsletter clearly thinks our caucus is a cut above the rest. On average they scored 5.2 out of ten, compared with National’s 5.06 and Labour’s 3.9,” said Professor Winiata.

“The two co-leaders scored 7 each, and Te Ururoa Flavell and Rahui Katene were both above average on 6.

“It is especially gratifying to read the comments and analysis about those two MPs,” said Professor Winiata. “It is good to see their hard work behind the scenes, in the House and on Select Committees being properly recognised,” he said.

“Unfortunately the same cannot be said of TransTasman’s view of Hone Harawira. They have allowed recent controversies to overshadow Hone’s very real contribution to Parliament over the year.

“By securing a Select Committee inquiry into the tobacco industry, for example, Hone could save countless lives and millions of health dollars for many years into the future – and this deserves recognition.

“The National Council gave a rousing round of applause to their parliamentary caucus” said Professor Winiata.

“The Caucus has had a remarkable year achieving significant progress in moving towards the repeal of the Foreshore and Seabed Act; negotiating unprecedented gains in Budget 2009 and the Emissions Trading Scheme, progressing the Whanau Ora policy; and to top it off, gaining support for the national Maori Flag to fly on Waitangi Day”.

"While they have been putting the hours in for these big ticket items, they have continued to hold down heavy Ministerial posts; cabinet committee, select committee and house duty responsibilities; and continuing to return regularly to their constituents”,

“We are all proud of their dedicated commitment towards advancing kaupapa Maori in the best interests of the nation”.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* What TransTasman said:

Pita Sharples (7/10) ‘Still the mana man despite sometimes losing the plot. Strong bond with John Key overcame problems which could have derailed the support agreement. Essetial presence for the future of the party.’

Tariana Turia (7/10) Proved her value again this year. Careful and cautious attitude probably doesn’t impress activists but she’s got a firm grip on the realities of politics and how to make deals for Maori.’

Te Ururoa Flavell (6/10) ‘Carried a heavy load in Pariament where his party maintained its record of speaking on every bill. Respected MP avoids useless rhetoric and makes a bigger contribution than is probably apparent.’

Rahui Katene (6/10) ‘Showed how effective a first-term MP can be. Shared House duties with Flavell, getting her head around difficult bills and making sense of them. Doesn’t lose sight of why she’s there.’
