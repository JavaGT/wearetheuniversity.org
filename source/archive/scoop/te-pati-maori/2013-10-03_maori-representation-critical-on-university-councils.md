Maori representation critical on University Councils

**Maori representation critical on University Councils**

The Maori Party are calling for assurances that Maori student representation will be supported on to councils of tertiary institutions after changes to the makeup of University and Wananga councils were announced yesterday.

Tariana Turia, Maori Party Co-Leader said “Maori learner voices must be represented at all levels of decision making if we are to support educational success for Maori.”

“The changes announced yesterday will remove requirements to ensure specific groups, such as students, are represented on tertiary councils. Instead, institutions will now decide for themselves how their councils will be made up.”

Te Ururoa Flavell, Maori Party Co-Leader said “in light of the slow erosion of student representation over the years, perpetuated through legislation such as voluntary student membership (VSM), and through institutional policy we believe that something needs to change. Students need a voice on council.”

“Tertiary providers who are now responsible for making that decision need to step up and provide a place for student representation, and particularly Maori student representation.”

Dr. Pita Sharples, MP for Tamaki Makaurau said “the Treaty of Waitangi is in the Education Act (1989), which guides the makeup of councils. We are yet to see the Treaty fully realised in practice outside of the Wananga sector.”

“We support the Lincoln University Council structure, which has both mana whenua and Maori student representation. We implore all other University councils to follow the same leadership.”
