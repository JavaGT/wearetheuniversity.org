Policy, Research and Decision-Making
====================================

**Wednesday, 20 October 2010, 11:17 am**  
**Speech: [The Maori Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party)**

**MAI Doctoral Conference; Tuesday 19th October 2010; 7.30pm** **Powhakangahau Address; Te Herenga Waka** **Te Ururoa Flavell; Education Spokesperson** **He Rangi Tā Matawhānui: Visualising Wider Horizons.** **Policy, Research and Decision-Making**

As I started thinking about what I would say to you last night, I have to admit to being slightly weary. Weary in the sense that I always feel uncomfortable in talking to people who are more qualified than me. But in my defence, I have life experience on my side so hope you cut me some slack.

Aside from that I am weary in the sense of being rather tired and suffering from a lack of sleep which is partly of my own making.

Over the weekend I was running a wänanga for Te Pua Wananga o Te Arawa which had us hit the sack at midnight Friday, rising at dawn to karakia which was a part of our learning, through to midnight again, and up at 4am to go to support Ngati Whakaue as they shifted the tupuna Pukaki, the whakairo on the back of the 20 cent coin to a place to be worked on because of deterioration.

We finished that then back to the wänanga for breakfast; we continued on until 11.00am and most headed home. For me though, I had to head to an iwi meeting. I arrived at 11.30am and left early at 4.00pm!!! That is how we sometimes do things.

I give you that interesting background to my weekend as the backdrop to some ideas for you to consider at this conference.

As many of you know, sometimes in the rigour of matauranga Maori there is little time for sleep; no pity for those who are struggling to stay awake.

So when I thought about the prospect of talking to some eighty or so PhD students at the annual Māori and Indigenous doctoral students' conference, I thought this was one group that would probably have no sympathy for me.

In order to get where you are today, you have already demonstrated you have the perseverance; the discipline and the sheer resolve of mind and spirit. I am sure getting any sleep at times has challenged you just as it has me over these last few days.

And so before I go too far, I want simply to acknowledge all of you here tonight; to recognise the different communities, research and cultural worlds that you have come from; and to congratulate you for the amazing success you have already achieved.

You are our pool of new “change agents” – and I am privileged to be in your company.

I say that in all sincerity; because I truly believe that the research directions that you will champion will help to establish national and global trends; will enhance cross-sector and cross-disciplinary relationships and will carve out wider horizons which are shaped and steered by Maori and indigenous view points.

As a case in point, I want to just refer to the Fulbright exchanges that are currently taking place in the United States with two of our leading Maori scholars.

Dr Leonie Pihama (Te Atiawa, Nga Mahanga a Tairi, Ngati Mahanga) will spend five months at the University of Washington in Seattle researching impacts of historical and intergenerational trauma on the health and wellbeing of colonised indigenous peoples.

Dr Chellie Spiller (Ngati Kahungunu) from AUT University, will spend four months at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts expanding upon her doctoral research into how Maori businesses work to create spiritual, cultural, social, environmental and economic well-being.

What I really like about both of these scholarship programmes, is that they are testing out our own indigenous experiences alongside the wisdom and guidance of Native American eyes.

They are also both important developments in advancing our understanding and appreciation of wellness in its fullest definition. Dr Pihama for instance, will spend time at the University of Washington's Indigenous Wellness Research Institute.

I had the honour of attending the special ceremony at the Permanent Forum in New York in May of this year, when Dr Pita Sharples advised the World that New Zealand would sign up to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People.

Many of our indigenous allies across the globe had been astounded when the Labour Government refused to sign up to such an important and aspirational document.

If I take some of the articles that are perhaps most relevant to the kaupapa of this conference, it is difficult to understand what caused such concern from the Labour caucus.

Article 11. Indigenous peoples have the right to practise and revitalize their cultural traditions and customs. This includes the right to maintain, protect and develop the past, present and future manifestations of their cultures, such as archaeological and historical sites, artefacts, designs, ceremonies, technologies and visual and performing arts and literature.

Or

Article 31: They also have the right to maintain, control, protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage, traditional knowledge, and traditional cultural expressions.

  
The focus of this hui, He Rangi Tā Matawhānui: Visualising Wider Horizons, reminds us and encourages us to keep our sights firmly fixed on the widest possible view.

That is, that we promote the importance of research and investment in • supporting outcomes for tangata whenua; • on thinking of how we can contribute back to the collective prosperity of whanau, hapu and iwi; • of extending Maori research capability and evolving Maori knowledge in a way which will benefit tangata whenua.

The Maori Party is very aware that in past years, there have been issues associated with both FoRST and MoRST, in terms of there being insufficient budget to achieve Maori research goals.

Maori researchers have spoken to us about their concerns with the processes used to determine funding allocated to achieve Maori research goals – what was called the Maori Knowledge and Development Research output class.

And they have told us about their frustration with respective Ministers who have not sought sufficient levels of advice from Maori researchers.

This is where I believe we need to work together, to ensure we are doing everything we can advance the interests of Te Tiriti partner, the Treaty partner.

And I mean working together across the education sector.

  
As an example, I’d be interested to understand how strong the relationship is, between current Maori Research Institutes and wänanga.

It would seem to me, that there are some immediate points of connection which could be a powerful foundation for such a relationship, such as how best to actively promote:

• Curriculum change within educational institutions, relevant to current Maori cultural values and aspirations;

• User friendly Maori cultural pedagogy and techniques for education for all people of Aotearoa at all levels; or

• Consolidation of kaupapa Maori research methods to build critical mass.

The work that Nga Pae o te Maramatanga is doing, in focusing on the potential of Maori communities provides a clear model for all tertiary institutions.

Similarly, the Māori and Indigenous programme (MAI) - the nationally organised network of key sites throughout New Zealand; and Te Pae Whakatairanga Hiranga - the Capability Building programme of Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga; are both approaches which I think are advancing our own unique signature to the policy and research framework of Aotearoa.

  
And I put to you, that just as you are developing relationships with your indigenous counterparts overseas and at home in an academic environment, that there would also be an amazing opportunity for us to work together, Maori and indigenous researchers, and the Maori Party.

Earlier, I referred to you as the new “change agents”. I do this with all Maori groups across the education sector. I say it to the students of the Te Wananga o Aotearoa - Bachelor of Education and their students of the Bachelor of Social Science classes and I say it to you, our educational elite.

You have the ability to make serious positive change for our people. Why?? Because you are “educated”, you have a qualification and our people expect that people like yourselves have answers and even in some cases give a lead.

You have been privileged to have had information that most will not have access to. You are expected to know about the world. The mere fact that you have been to university alone places you in a privileged position.

Knowing about the world is to know about politics too alongside your study on the reproductive development of the kina because this is where decisions are made on a day to day basis on the lives of our people.

The assumptions are of course that you: • Are able to give an opinion of advice • Want to assist the people • And the people will believe in you to give that advice. For many, you may be the “smart, know it all ihu hupe”

The question is whether you do use your matauranga. Some of us do not for various reasons. Why? • Because you do not want to • You have not made the connection about the influence you could have • It is not quite the right time.

For whatever reason, I would like you all to break out of it and ask you to consider upskilling on the political situation. That is not to say that you should vote Maori Party (although highly intelligent ones do!!) but it is asks you to get involved in either educating our people or contributing in one way or another and not financially (although our party is broke as well!!).

Amongst you we have the intellectual grunt that could provide us with some advice I am sure on all sorts of matters so it comes down to whether the motivation is there or not.

As I understand it, MAI is focused on the accelerated development of Māori and Indigenous Doctoral graduates in the national interest.

The Maori Party is passionately committed to the possibility of being able to promote policies that advance the survival of the people; to enable the people to grow and flourish. That might be a dramatic statement but in the end whether we are talking education, or any other topic, that is exactly what it comes down to.

It may well be to our mutual advantage, therefore, to work together on a shared strategy for advancement.

Take for instance, our policy on tertiary tuition fees.

The Maori Party advocates for zero tertiary tuition fees to students or that government grants be available to pay fees. Not only is education understood as a front-end investment into the future, matauranga Maori is a taonga tuku iho for tangata whenua guaranteed protection in Article 2 of Te Tiriti o Waitangi. This unrestricted right to access education is extended to all New Zealanders as an expression of manaakitanga.

I want to really emphasize that the Maori Party totally appreciates the importance and necessity of tertiary education to the nation’s future development.

Our vision is to invest in the creative innovation and unique strengths that tangata whenua offer to the culture, economy and society over all – as well as responding to the specific priorities and aspirations of whanau, hapu and iwi.

Can I make a plug for going home to contribute as well? I recognise that going home comes with some hazards. Sometimes we are the worst ones for dealing to our own. It does sometimes mean starting with contributions of washing dishes, sweeping floors but all of that is preparation for when our people need you and that time may not be far away.

Finally, I want to reiterate that between us, I believe we can create a very successful partnership which will help to advance the aspirations and interests of tangata whenua in the best interests of the nation.
