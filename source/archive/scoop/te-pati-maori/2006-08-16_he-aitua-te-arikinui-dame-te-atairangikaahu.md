He Aitua: Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu Tuesday 15 August 2006

Dr Pita Sharples and Tariana Turia; Co-leaders, Maori Party

Mokau ki runga, Tamaki ki raro, ko Mangatoatoa ki waenganui. Pare Waikato, Pare Hauraki, Te Kaokao-roa o Patetere, te taonga o te mate Te Ata, ko koe tenei i tenei wa. I whanau mai tatau i o tatau matua, ka takahi tatau i nga ara o te ao mamae, kei mua i a tatau ko te mate ara te tuturutanga o te ora, kua takahi ake, kua tae ake koe ki te paepae e kore nei e rangonahia te karanga o mamae.

Kua tangaohia e te po, te mokopuna o te motu, kei te tu pani nga taniwha o te awa i te wehetanga ake o tenei rangatira i kai ngakau ki tona iwi ki nga taonga hoki o nehera.

No reira e Te Ata koutou katoa o nga kawai o Tainui e moe mai na i te moe o makariri i te po, takoto ake. Kei te tangi te motu kei te tangi te Moana-nui a-kiwa, kei te tangi hoki enei uri o Whanganui, o Kahungunu, o Te Arawa, o Ngapuhi.

The passing of the 'heart of the Maori people' was honoured tonight, in the tributes of the Maori Party. He Aitua: Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu Tuesday 15 August 2006

Kua tangaohia e te po, te mokopuna o te motu, kei te tu pani nga taniwha o te awa i te wehetanga ake o tenei rangatira i kai ngakau ki tona iwi ki nga taonga hoki o nehera.

No reira e Te Ata koutou katoa o nga kawai o Tainui e moe mai na i te moe o makariri i te po, takoto ake. Kei te tangi te motu kei te tangi te Moana-nui a-kiwa, kei te tangi hoki enei uri o Whanganui, o Kahungunu, o Te Arawa, o Ngapuhi.

The passing of the 'heart of the Maori people' was honoured tonight, in the tributes of the Maori Party.

"Te Arikinui was a person who led with humility and was always distinguished by her grace" said Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party.

"Everyone looked up to her - whether they be political - whether they be members of whanau" said Mrs Turia. " She was an immense presence in our lives; her dignity, her compassion and her visionary influence will be a huge loss to Maoridom".

"The contribution she made as Patron of the Maori Women's Welfare League, of the National Kohanga Reo Trust; of Nga Puna Waihanga was unique and will be always treasured".

"She inspired us to believe in ourselves, to love and nurture our children, and to always treasure our whanau" said Mrs Turia.

"She was greatly loved by us all, and we know the huge sorrow that will be felt by our people, as the news starts to be passed on" said Mrs Turia.

"Te Arikinui shone in any event - she inspired the respect of world leaders such as Nelson Mandela, diplomats, prime ministers, presidents, Pacific leaders and indigenous leaders - as well as being utterly loved at home" said Dr Pita Sharples.

"She was a unifying person - she brought people together through her genuine warmth, her astute leadership and her ever generous manaaki" said Dr Sharples. "Her gentle wisdom earnt her the highest esteem where-ever she went".

"Although the international royalty always considered her with the utmost respect, Te Arikinui was characteristically modest, absolutely in her element at every Koroneihana, where she was cherished among people at all levels".

"Our heartfelt thoughts are with her husband, her children, her mokopuna and indeed all her people at this deeply sad time" ended Dr Sharples.
