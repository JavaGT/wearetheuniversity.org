Get on the Bus and Vote Maori Party

“News that Labour is offering free off-peak public transport for Hamilton-based kaumatua is wonderful” said Angeline Greensill, Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato.

“The country is faced with major climate issues and we all need to support initiatives that reverse environmental damage”.

“Many superannuitants have been asking for more value from their SuperGold Card and though this is a little late, it will be appreciated” said Greensill.

“Some kaumatua intend to use this new facility to board buses and attend the Maori Party launch this Saturday at Frankton Markets, so we are thankful they are now able to join”.
