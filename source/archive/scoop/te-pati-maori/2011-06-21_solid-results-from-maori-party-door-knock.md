Solid results from Maori Party door knock
=========================================

**MEDIA STATEMENT**

**Ken Mair**

**Maori Party co-vice president**

**21 June 2011**

Ken Mair, Maori Party Co Vice President, is ‘quietly optimistic’ after a weekend of solid results coming through from an intensive ‘door-knock’ of Te Tai Tokerau constituents based in the Auckland end of the electorate.

“Our team of workers knocked on the doors of 1794 electors, living in Te Atatu Peninsula, Henderson, Sunnyvale and Massey over the weekend” said Mr Mair..

“Once we have taken off those not at home (806) and those no longer living at that address (301), the results of the 687 residents have revealed a completely different story than what some commentators are still relying on _(the ‘Native Affairs’ poll taken over 500 voters, from the period 2-9 June)._

“The message that has been coming through to us is that the people believe their vote will be wasted unless they elect a representative who will be working with the Government, putting forward the voice of Te Tai Tokerau”..

“With two of the candidates effectively consigned to the opposition benches, the message is clear – vote Solomon Tipene if you want Te Tai Tokerau to be able to influence Government”.

“As with all the polls, this most recent survey reminds us just how important the undecided voter will be at the ballot box on Saturday” ended Mr Mair.

Results from 687 eligible voters taken over weekend of 18-19 June

**287 (41.8%) will vote for Solomon Tipene**

154 (22.4%) will vote for another candidate.

224 (32.6%) Undecided

22 (3.2%) refused to respond, or not interested.
