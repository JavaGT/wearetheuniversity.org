Poroporoaki - Morvin Te Anatipa Simon

  
E te uri o Hinengakau, e te reo reka o te awa tupua, e te matua Morvin, kei te mamae, kei te tangi te ngakau ki a koe kua wehe atu nei. E kore to kanohi e kitea, engari to reo ka rangona tonutia e waiata mai ana ki nga topito o te motu, heke iho ki nga uri whakatupu. Haere, haere, haere ra. E te whanau pani, ka nui te aroha ki a koutou.

  
The passing, today, of Te Anatipa Morvin Simon is being lamented by the Māori Party.

Morvin Te Anatipa Simon (Te Atihaunui a Paparangi, Ngāti Apa, Tūwharetoa) was born at Kaiwhaiki Marae on the Whanganui River. He was educated at Upokongaro School and Hato Paora Māori Boys College before going on to study philosophy and sociology at Holy Name College in Christchurch and Māori language and Oral Literature at Victoria and Massey Universities.

“The unique combination of all of these influences was seen in the incredible repertoire of compositions which made your heart soar, lifted your spirits and then moved you to tears,” said Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Māori Party.

“Like te awa tupua, his waiata could move from tempestuous rapids to smooth waters that caress your every trouble away. E riporipo ana ngā wai – the one comfort we can turn to is to know the river flows on, and the melodies will be taken up by all our mokopuna to lift our hearts at this time of sorrow.”

“Morvin created the magical sound we now associate with Hato Paora College; with Ngā Paerangi and of course the beautiful harmonies of St Peters Chanel.”

“Morvin was a distinguished composer, choirmaster, and kapa haka leader. Whether it be over three decades of leadership for the Hato Paora boys; generations of families who have demonstrated their talents at the annual Hui Aranga, or the more recent initiative of Te Taikura o Te Awa Tupua, his tutelage has brought out the most exquisite singing and polished performances that leave audiences in absolute awe.”

“In November 2012, Morvin was acknowledged with an honorary bachelor degree in Māori performing arts from Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiarangi,” said Dr Pita Sharples. “It was an historic event because both Morvin and Dr Ngapo Wehi were honoured for their outstanding contribution to kapa haka at the very first national symposium celebrating haka excellence.”

“In the Queen’s Birthday list last year, Morvin and his lifelong soulmate, Titikura Simon, were awarded MNZM and QSM honours for services to Māori,” said Te Ururoa Flavell, Co-leader. “Morvin was also an accomplished writer. His penmanship of publications such as Te Kōhanga Reo, he ahurewa mana; Pakaitore; He Whakaaro hei kōrero; Taku Whare E – are all components of a rich legacy he leaves behind.”

“Morvin was a cultural advisor, a te reo Māori tutor, a historian, a passionate follower of the Māramatanga, and most important of all a father of eleven children and close to fifty mokopuna.”

“One of his most enduring songs is that known as Te Aroha which inspires those singing it to uphold the values of love, faith and peace amongst us all. We think today of all those who are grieving, and we extend our sympathies to them all. In Morvin’s own words, ‘ma te aroha tatau e putikitia.’”
