Maori Party in support of Buddy Day
===================================

MEDIA STATEMENT  

  
**The Hon Tariana Turia**  
**Maori Party Co-Leader | MP for Te Tai Hauauru**  
**18 November 2011**

  
Maori Party Co-leader, Tariana Turia, has praised the initiative of Waikato-Tainui working alongside of a range of other organisations throughout the rohe, to hold _Buddy Day_ in support of children.

"I commend the initiative of the iwi to come out in support of the focus on the wellbeing of our tamariki".

“And I want to also acknowledge the vision and commitment of WEL Energy Trust, Lion Foundation, Bryant Trust, Hamilton, Te Puni Kokiri, Longveld Engineering, PSP Plastic and Convex Plastic who together with Waikato-Tainui have made such a solid stand in establishing the _Child Abuse Awareness Day_ being held throughout Hamilton today”.

“Of course, it can not be just a one day thing, and I hope that ‘Buddy Day’ is just one initiative which will keep our conversations about our tamariki at the top of our agenda, whether it be on the paepae, in the school yard, in our homes”.

“But I congratulate the team who conceived this concept – the ‘life-size cut-outs’ being a stimulus to get us all thinking and talking about how do we care for our tamariki and our mokopuna?”.

“Ultimately, community awareness is the key to identifying how we tackle such an enormous ‘ngarara’ within our midst”.

"We have to free our minds, and be open to every possibility - and be aware of the complex range of issues associated with abuse and neglect. Inaction is not an option. We must think collectively and comprehensively about how we can all take enduring actions to prevent any more incidence of violence across our communities".

"That is why the Maori Party always operates from the basis of whanau - all of us must own this - and work together to make change happen.

“We believe that our collective focus must be on Whanau Ora – what is it that keeps us well, that restores our spirits and nurtures our potential”.

“The Maori Party seeks to introduce a Cross-Government Accord (a ‘wellbeing framework’) to keep whānau free from all forms of violence; including physical, economic, sexual and racist and including prevention of elder abuse and neglect”.
