Ae Marika! 5 August 2008

Hone Harawira

Member of Parliament for Tai Tokerau

  
**100 not out**

Amongst other things I was supposed to do on Saturday, I missed going to a special celebration for a very special kuia. Nina Subritzky turned 100 on Saturday, and I was supposed to deliver a special message to her. I missed the occasion, but I won’t miss getting the message to her (and thousands of others now, thanks to the Northland Age.

  
**  
Tena koe whaea**

Heoi ano, ko wai ahau hei tuhi reta ki tënei o nga tino kuia o Ngati Kuri, o Ngati Rehia ano hoki. E te whäea, me mihi whanui atu ki a koe, kua tae ora mai ki te kotahi rau tau. Me mihi atu ki a koe e kawe tonu nei i nga mohioranga o aua wa. Kua ngaro katoa o hoa, no reira, me mihi ki a rätou kua tae ke atu ki tena tua o te ärai. E nga mate, haere, haere, hoki atu ra. Hoki mai ki a tätou, ki a koe e te tino kuia e Nina, tena koe, huri noa, kia ora tätou katoa.

Whaea Nina, amongst a people who number more than half a million, you have achieved a great age, 100 years old, and on this day, we gather to honour you, to spoil you, and to celebrate your life.

Born in Te Hapua in 1908 to Tame Romana of Ngati Kuri, and Ngahuia Parangi of Ngati Rehia from Te Tii, you were raised in a time when the world was not much different from that which our tupuna knew when first they came to these blessed shores, and in 1936 you married Arthur (Waata) Subritzky, Ngati Kuri also, born and raised as well in Te Hapua.

We know that you came to Ngataki to work in the gumfields and to run your farm in the 1940s, and that you gave birth to 10 children, who themselves gave you (at least) 54 grandchildren, and, I am reliably informed, countless great and great-great grandchildren.

We honour you for the years you shared with your husband, and for the children you have raised, seven of whom you survive today.

We honour you for your fierce and proud independence, for your years of dedicated service to the building of Waiora Marae, for your life-long commitment to the Maori Women’s Welfare League, for your support for your church, and for your love of your people.

You honour us with your presence amongst us, and we join with your extended family, your friends, and your iwi, in celebrating your life today.

ENDS
