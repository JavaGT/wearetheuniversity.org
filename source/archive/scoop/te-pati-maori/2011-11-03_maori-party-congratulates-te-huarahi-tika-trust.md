**Maori Party congratulates Te Huarahi Tika Trust**

Maori Party Co-leader Dr Pita Sharples has congratulated _Te Huarahi Tika Trust_ on the release of the first te reo Maori smartphone, and the announcement of scholarships to encourage Maori into the ICT industry.

"These are hugely significant Maori initiatives in the digital and ICT sector," said Dr Sharples. "These announcements lay the foundations for an even brighter future," he said.

"A 2degrees smartphone, with all its menus and options in te reo Maori, symbolises Maori participation in cutting-edge technology, and the use of our language as an everyday part of modern life.

"Te Huarahi Tika Trust and Hautaki Ltd have helped change the digital communications landscape in Aotearoa, and contributed over $2 billion to our economy, with the launch of 2degrees.

It all came about through the determination of the trustees to create a pathway for Maori into the ICT industry, with a bold strategy, shrewd partnerships, persistent lobbying and careful investments.

“I’m really proud of the leadership they have demonsrated in positioning tangata whenua right at the forefront of progress within the telecommunications world.

"The ICT scholarships they announced, reflect the growing need for qualified Maori to take up some incredible opportunities.
