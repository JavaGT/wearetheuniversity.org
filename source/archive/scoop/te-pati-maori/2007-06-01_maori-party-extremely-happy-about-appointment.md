Maori Party Extremely Happy about Appointment of Hapi

Tariana Turia; Co-leader and Fisheries Spokesperson for the Maori Party

Friday 1 June 2007

The Maori Party is thrilled to congratulate Robin Hapi on his appointment as Director and Chairperson of the Board of Aotearoa Fisheries Ltd; and Chairperson of Sealord.

“It would be hard to find a more qualified person than Robin Hapi for these significant roles” said Tariana Turia. “In addition to his impressive sector expertise, Robin has excelled in many areas of public sector policy and governance” said Mrs Turia.

“He also has a strong reputation of utilising his academic and analytical success to leverage presence and influence within the fishing industry” said Mrs Turia. "He is clearly committed to having a viable and sustainable fishing industry and we wish him well in his ongoing pursuit of this goal".

“I am sure there will be many Maori throughout Aotearoa who will be celebrating these appointments” said Mrs Turia. “Hato Paora old-boys; Ngati Kahungunu iwi members; and of course the very many groups involved in Maori fisheries development and iwi economic development will be commending the vision of Te Ohu Kaimoana (AFL) and Sealord shareholders.

“We are at an extremely sensitive point in our history” said Mrs Turia. “We are facing the complex negotiations between the power and authority of iwi, as written into the Treaty of Waitangi; and the relationship with the Crown”.

“Despite the protestations of the current Government, the Maori fishing sector is aware that the integrity of the 1992 Fisheries Settlement Assets is being threatened by the Shared Fisheries proposals” said Mrs Turia.

“Robin Hapi will play a critical role in preserving the successful allocation and future protection of the Maori Commercial Fisheries Settlement”.
