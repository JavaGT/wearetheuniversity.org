Press Release

Minister addresses Stanford University Māori Bootcamp

Māori Affairs Minister Hon Dr Pita Sharples urges Māori business leaders to hold steadfast to our traditions as the Maori economy grows.

Dr Sharples spoke today at the Māori Bootcamp being held this week at Stanford University. The Bootcamp is focused on Māori in primary industries and exposes leaders to world-leading business perspectives.

He told the group of more than 30 leaders that Maori economic development is not just about business nous, but the ability to maintain and apply our traditions, and take our whanau, hapu, and communities with them through their business journeys.

Dr. Sharples said “when Māori think of long term investment, we aren’t just thinking of ourselves.”

“The actions we undertake today reflect on our future generations, as well as on our ancestors. We are one and the same, and therefore development today needs to honour both the past and the future.”

“To do that, I believe we must take our whanau and communities on the business journey with us. It’s about remembering who we are, and the uniqueness that we have to offer in business – and that’s our Maori edge.”

The Bootcamp was an initiative by public and private enterprises with a contribution from each participant. Dr. Sharples, who addressed the group today, said that growing our knowledge base will support the growth of the Maori ‘taniwha’ economy.

Dr. Sharples said “knowledge is key to our development. It’s important that our Maori leaders have access to international learning, so they can apply that learning in our own contexts in New Zealand.”

“The group who are here at Stanford University represent the brightest minds of Maori business. It’s very exciting to see the development that is happening, not only amongst Maori businesses, but also among our people and our communities.”

“My message to this group was simple, but important. Always remember where they come from, and who they take with them on their journey to success,” said Dr. Sharples.
