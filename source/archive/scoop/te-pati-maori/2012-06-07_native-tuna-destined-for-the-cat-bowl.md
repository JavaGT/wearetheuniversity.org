Native Tuna Destined for the Cat-bowl

Waiariki MP, Te Ururoa Flavell, has spoken out in reaction to today’s revelations (on Radio NZ) that Addiction Foods of Te Puke is exporting products based on our endangered native long-finned tuna for cat food in the United States.

“The native long-finned eels face critical risk from loss of habitat and poor water quality, let alone commercial exploitation to enable fine dining for American cats” said Mr Flavell.

“Our greatest efforts should be put into preventing this iconic tuna species from becoming extinct"

“To this end the Māori Party has supported the initiative of iwi, environmental groups and Massey University researchers to protect the endemic endangered long fin eel; and has reinforced its earlier call for a rāhui (Moratorium) on the commercial harvest of the tuna”.

“We have welcomed the monitoring and research role undertaken by Manaaki Tuna (the Massey University Tuna Research and Restoration Group), and the commitment by iwi, Māori fishery representatives and environmental groups to protect this taonga species”.

“The news that Addiction Foods is reproducing long fin eels for swanky cat food for the States, while we know the long fin eel population is on the decline, is unacceptable and we will be taking up this issue immediately with Minister Carter (as Minister for Primary Industries).
