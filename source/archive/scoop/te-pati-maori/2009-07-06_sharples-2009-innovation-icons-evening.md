Sharples: 2009 Innovation Icons Evening
=======================================

**2009 Innovation Icons Evening: Atamira Maori in the City 2009**

**Hon Dr Pita Sharples; Minister of Maori Affairs  
Saturday 4 July 2009; 8pm**

The 4th of July is an appropriate day to be thinking about icons.

In the last ten days the world has mourned the loss of two legends, American stars who have been crowned with the title Icon.

One appeared on a TV show for a year; provoked a mass shopping frenzy on her brand of shampoo and even today, her pin-up poster from 1976 is the bestseller of all time; with more than 12 million copies sold.

Another one introduced some complex dance moves, created a string of world best-selling records, (_Thriller_ is still registering as the worlds’ best-selling album of all time); and was inducted into the Guiness Book of Records as the most successful entertainer of all time.

So what does it take to become an icon?

Is it about putting on a pair of red togs, a gold-plated military jacket, a single white glove?

Or is it something about the personal strength of the message, the innovation that is associated with them, the unique sense of character that endures on, long after their initial mark is made?

Mikaere Hakihana was a legacy amongst Maori, long before his death. In fact, if you’ve been a regular fan at Te Matatini over the years, you might have noticed more than a few waiata derived from the inspiration of Michael Jackson melodies.

He was the first black artist to get a video on MTV; every marae had our kids imitating the Moonwalk and the Robot; and even if the King of Pop may have been ambiguous about whether he was “_Black or White”,_ there was a consistent energy and a brilliance in his music that encouraged us to believe _“we are the world”._

Despite his failings, (on which the world’s media are fixated), there is no denial that he was an Icon to many, an entrepreneur, a legend.

So how does the all-American story relate to us here, in Aotearoa?

What is our indigenous brand of Maori creativity and enterprise?

Who are our legends – what are the enduring qualities of entertainers like House of Shem, Herbs, DJ Pouroufessor, Cornerstone Roots?

How are we expressing our indigeneity in the innovations and initiatives we present to the world?

Before we even think about today’s successes, I think it’s important to remember the journey we’ve been on to get here.

In our world, our past informs our present and shapes our future; i nga wa o mua.

Our history is one of enterprise and entrepreneurial success.

In 1820, Hongi Hika and the younger chief Waikato of Rangihoua travelled to Cambridge to work with Professor Samuel Lee on a compilation of a book entitled, _A grammar and vocabulary of the language of New Zealand._ That book laid the orthographic foundations of written Maori; and was an early example of innovation twenty years before Te Tiriti o Waitangi was signed.

Tangata whenua started trading with Europeans from the late 19th century.

We demonstrated considerable passion for the acquisition of technology – the adaptation of agriculture and shipping methods, the adoption of books and use of publishing as three strong examples.

We were also quick off the mark in terms of taking up opportunities to provide vital goods and services once the settlers arrived in town.

And our tipuna exhibited a sharp business acumen that was reported as far back as 1877, in Pratt’s ‘_Colonial experiences or incidents and reminiscences of 34 years in New Zealand’_. Pratt said, and I quote

_“they were remarkably shrewd at driving a bargain, had a very appreciative opinion of their commodities and a critical knowledge of the value of the utu (money) and the goods taken in exchange”._

As our histories report, Maori flourished economically for at least the first decade of European settlement.

There were significant purchases of flourmills, sailing ships and schooners; Maori were exporting produce to Australia and other countries and indeed our entrepreneurial abilities were so superior that we dominated a large share of the commerce throughout the country.

Up until the 1860s, here in Tamaki Makaurau for instance, Maori controlled a high proportion of the trade and had our own trading fleet.

This then, is our beginnings. And what great beginnings they were.

But this is more than just a tale of great economic prosperity.

We can all take great pride in acknowledging the generous contribution of tangata whenua to the founding and building of Auckland, the gifts of land and the protection and hospitality offered to explorers, whalers, missionaries and settlers since their arrival in this land. That is manaakitanga at its strongest –the expression of hospitality by mana whenua.

We all know the story that followed - the impact of colonization; the dismantling of communities, the disintegration of economic wealth; the loss of resources; the effects of land alienation on tribal strength.

That context makes what has taken place at Atamira 2009 even more remarkable.

These last few days have been about sheer talent, the exurberance of the creative spirit, and the power of the innovation sector.

We started off with a Maori Business Breakfast organized by the Employers and Manufacturers Association – a chance for some of the shakers, makers and movers here in Tamaki Makaurau to get together and celebrate.

According to Te Puni Kokiri’s report, _Measuring Maori Entrepreneurship_, of the 21 thousand Maori entrepreneurs recorded in 2006, nearly six thousand of them came from Auckland.

And should we be surprised?

The National Maori Innovation Summit has featured many of them.

There’s been an incredible wealth of artists, weavers, musicians, performers, designers, scientists, researchers, icons of technology, experts of innovation.

I want to particularly single out three Young Enterprise Scheme businesses for special mention.

I’m thinking of _Te Whare Kura o te Rawhiti Roa_ from Whangarei, exhibiting under the company name of Kotahi Maori. You’ve probably seen their flash t-shirts proudly promoting our whakatauki.

There’s _Aorere College_ from Auckland, with the company name secure. They have produced the military-style dog tag necklaces with the message ‘Make a Stand’ – to promote the message of preventing unwanted teenage pregnancy by being aware of safe sex.

And there’s _Te Whanau o Tupuranga_ – Clover Park Middle School – featuring under the company name of Whakapiri Company. They have produced a CD compilation of fifteen waiata, all of them compositions relevant to the kura.

The Young Enterprise Scheme is a fantastic initiative for students to experience the roles and responsibilities of the business world – having a taste of the challenges for communications and marketing managers, for finance directors, for designers, for business planners, for companies.

And if you think about it, there are many of the qualities of the icons I referred to earlier – the importance of having a message; the unique quality of their identity; the innovation that meets the market need.

But there is something else which is so important to the Maori edge.

These young inventers and business leaders are not just showing they have the goods to navigate the innovation economy – to access and adopt new technologies, to develop new output from the existing resources.

They are also developing high-value Maori-brand products, which will enable Maori to be distinguished in the global market place.

And it is this distinctive feature which takes me to the theme of this night – the Eye of the Needle.

We remember the wisdom and the prophetic guidance of Potatau te Wherowhero,

_Kotahi te kohao o te ngira e kuhuna ai te miro ma, te miro pango, te miro whero. I muri, kia mau ki te aroha, ki te ture, ki te whakapono_

_Through the eyes of the needle pass the white threads, the black threads and the red threads. Afterwards, looking to the past as you progress, hold firmly to your love, the law and your faith._

These words of advice from a revered rangatira are as relevant today as they were at his coronation in 1858.

He encouraged us to be strong together, to value kotahitanga, while at the same time respecting the opportunity of multiple pathways. It is a message of cohesiveness, of valuing collective goals, of treasuring both unity and diversity.

Exactly how important these words have been, is to look at the range of agencies and initiatives which have been inspired by the message.

Just last Friday, the New Zealand Defence Force renewed the lifeforce of the national marae, Rongomaraeroa o Nga Hau e Wha in Waiouru. The Whakarite ceremony featured a renovated entranceway, the red tomokanga, which is named Te Ngira and represents all the soldiers within Ngati Tumatauenga joining together as one strand and passing through the eye of the needle.

Over on Waiheke Island, their primary school features a logo based on the prophecy – celebrating the eye of the needle as the symbol of untied humanity.

Across town at the airport, the marae, Te Manukanuka o Hoturoa includes Te Kohao o te Ngira as the gateway in to the whare tupuna.

At Waikato University the web-based resource for professional development for staff is called Te Kowhao in their inspiration to achieve collective excellence.

And at Kirikiriroa marae, the kohanga takes the same motivation – just to name a few.

It tells us al, that Maori economic and social development is intricately linked with our kaupapa, our tikanga, our tribal traditions, our moteatea, our waiata, our whakatauaki.

This is the essence of who we are.

But what is so exciting, as these different agencies reflect, is that the time-honoured truths which have served us so well for centuries are also providing us with the basis to transform our future.

If innovation is about creating new economic value by creating, adopting and adapting knowledge into new improved products and services, then Maori have been doing for mai ra ano.

We have been the future makers, the drivers of change, the researchers, the thinkers, the knowledge cadets, long before they became part of the innovation economy.

And this is what we celebrate tonight, as we also reflect on the incredible success of so many Maori businesses, of whanau leaders, of tribal champions who are breaking new ground in the creation of positive economic outcomes and business opportunities.

As Minister of Maori Affairs, it does the heart good to come to a night like tonight.

I want to congratulate Ngati Whatua o Orakei Corporate for hosting such a brilliant celebration of homegrown talent and enterprise.

And I acknowledge too, the support of Te Puni Kokiri, the Ports of Auckland and the Aotearoa Credit Union in this inaugural event tonight.

I am so proud to see so many Maori here who are excelling in the fields of science and technological innovation.

I know it’s not enough – but nights like tonight – inspire us all to go out there and encourage all of our mokopuna to start thinking about the multiple pathways ahead of them, and how we can support them to take their own stand on the Atamira.

Indeed, this event, in celebrating our past, our present, our future, is just about the best Thriller in Town. There is nothing that can Beat It. All I can say, is don’t stop till we get enough.

For this is our world; we are our world.

And I better stop, before the sparkly white glove comes out and my shoes begin to dance.
