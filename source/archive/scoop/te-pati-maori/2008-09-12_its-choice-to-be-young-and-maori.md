It’s choice to be young and Maori

“It’s great that young people have taken the initiative to get politically active and involved” said Angeline Greensill, Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato. “I am looking forward to tonight’s Maori Side Tour here in Hamilton and encourage rangatahi to pick up the message and to get on the roll and vote”.

“The Maori Side Tour is a nation-wide music showcase including House of Shem, Cornerstone Roots, Native Sons and Anatonio and is a positive way to show the nation that it is choice to be young and Maori” says Mrs Greensill, an avid music fan.

The Maori Side Tour will travel through six of the seven Māori Electorates and starts in Hamilton this evening. This first gig features House of Shem and Cornerstone Roots, alongside Native Sons and Anatonio.

"It was fabulous timing that the Prime Minister announced the election date today (8 November); to truly kick off the Maori Side Tour in grand style" said Angeline Greensill.

The tour then moves through to Rotorua at the Lake House Hotel on 13 September (tomorrow). The tour ventures to the big smoke of Auckland at the Carlton Bar Newmarket on Friday 19 September - where it is joined by the sultry sounds of Miss Black and the hip-hop master DJ Poroufessor.

Then continuing up to Whangarei on 20 September, the Onerahi Tavern will be rocked by the previous artists, as well as the Sons of Zion. On 26 September at Latitude Live, Napier will go off to Hope Road, Nga Morehu and David Grace and Matiu Huki will join the tour at the Loaded Hog in Levin on 27 September.

“Music is a powerful vehicle to encourage young people to get involved in this year’s election and to help shape the world in which we all live” said Mrs Green. “Participation rates in the political process amongst young Maori can be improved and the best people to encourage engagement in politics are young Maori themselves.”
