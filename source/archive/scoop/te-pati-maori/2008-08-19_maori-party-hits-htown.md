The Maori Party MPs and candidates are hitting the road this week, in their ongoing commitment to return to the people, kanohi ki te kanohi.

Last  week the Maori Party MPs  used their recess from Parliament to travel around Ikaroa Rawhiti, to hear, first hand, the concerns of the people - the issues which drive Maori Party policy.

Tomorrow they arrive in the Hauraki-Waikato electorate where they will visit schools, participate in political forums, attend the Koroneihana  at Turangawaewae, meet  and listen to communities in the Waikato area before heading to South Auckland to visit councils , employers, and workplaces. 

 “People are excited that the Maori Party MP’s are  coming to H’town.  They  are looking forward  to  actually meeting and welcoming  Tariana, Pita, Te Ururoa  and Hone into their place and tabling their concerns about issues such as  sub-standard housing ,health and matters around the coming election”,  says Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato, Angeline Greensill . 

The road show, which begins in Hamilton on Tuesday morning, moves to Ngaruawahia  on Wednesday and will end  with a dinner  in  Papakura on Thursday evening.
