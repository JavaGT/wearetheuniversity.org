The pride and passion of kapa haka - Tariana Turia

The Hon Tariana Turia Maori Party Co-Leader | MP for Te Tai Hauauru

Local Te Tai Hauauru MP, Tariana Turia, was very proud to see the level of talent and absolute pride demonstrated by the taiohi performers involved in Te Whanganui a Tara secondary school kapa haka competitions, held today at Te Rauparaha Arena in her electorate in Porirua.

"My congratulations go to Te Kura Maori o Porirua who took out first place in the competitions today" said Mrs Turia. "This is a fabulous achievement for Te Kura Maori o Porirua who have just celebrated ten years since they were established - nga mihi aroha ki a koutou".

"It was great to see kura coming together, to share their love of kapa haka" said Mrs Turia.

"That undeniable strength that comes through the pursuit of kotahitanga, was seen in the second place getters (St Patricks, St Catherines College and Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Nga Mokopuna - Seatoun joining together) and third place (Te Rahui Kura : Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Whakatipuranga Rua Mano, Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Te Rito and Otaki College - also from Te Tai Hauauru electorate).

"I have to say that as a Nanny I was especially proud of my mokopuna who performed, for the very first time, in Te Haeata Awatea (Wellington and Wellington Girls Colleges which were placed fourth)".

"And in my mind - that is one of the greatest achievements that kapa haka brings in our whanau - that unbelievable pride and joy in the expression of the very essence of who we are".
