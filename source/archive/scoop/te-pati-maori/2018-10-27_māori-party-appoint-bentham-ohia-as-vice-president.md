Māori Party appoint Bentham Ohia as Vice-President (Tāne)

The Māori Party has announced Bentham Ohia as their Vice-President (Tāne), following the resignation of Hon Te Ururoa Flavell in August 2018.

“Bentham is a pivotal addition to our team. He is a kaupapa-driven whānau man, with a strong reputation of service to our communities. He is also a long-time supporter of the Party and we are excited to have him on board” says Māori Party President Che Wilson.

Bentham worked for Te Wānanga o Aotearoa for 20 years as Deputy Chief Executive Officer and then Chief Executive Officer. He is currently the President of Advancement of Māori Opportunity AMO and a board member of Americans for Indian Opportunity AIO. Bentham completed his MBA at the University of Waikato following a period tutoring in te reo Māori at the University of Otago and teaching at Te Wharekura o Rakaumangamanga in Huntly. In 2010 he was awarded the Te Arikinui Te Atairangikaahu Lifetime achievement award from the University of Waikato.

“We love the long term outlook Bentham promotes. At the 40th anniversary of the Ngāti Rārua Ātiawa Iwi Trust, Bentham spoke passionately about the whānau transformation project they established in 2014 (“no whanau left behind”) in preparation for 2033. That’s the type of focus that we know will be so helpful in consolidating our strategy moving forward” said Che Wilson.

“It is a privilege for me and my whānau to be appointed to this role. My late father Dr Monte Ohia was a founding member of the Māori Party and I want to carry on his legacy” says Bentham Ohia.

Bentham is currently a Director of Puata Hou Trust, a whānau business he operates with his wife Kate Cherrington; and is also the Lead Lecturer for the University of Canterbury Masters in Māori and Indigenous Leadership programme. They have two children; Tuakoi and Tahuaroa and have been blessed to care for many whāngai.

Bentham is of Ngāi Te Rangi, Ngāti Pūkenga, Ngāti Ranginui, Ngāti Te Roro o Te Rangi (Te Arawa), Te Āti Awa, and Ngāti Rārua descent.
