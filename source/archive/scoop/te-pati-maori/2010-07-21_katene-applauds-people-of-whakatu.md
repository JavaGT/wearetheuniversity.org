**Katene applauds people of Whakatu**

Maori Party MP for Te Tai Tonga Rahui Katene is applauding a Maori incorporation and marae in Nelson for getting recognition from the Human Rights Commission for running two of the country’s 12 best workplaces.

“The Government and many other employers could learn a thing or two from the people of Wakatu Incorporation and Whakatu Marae,” Mrs Katene said.

“I’m so proud of the progress they have made by pumping young blood into the veins of their boardroom and helping to keep our young girls in school for longer.

“Since the 1960s the people of Whakatu Marae have been on a journey to address, restore and enhance the mana and tapu of their whanau and it is pleasing to see that their hard work has been acknowledged today.”

The marae umbrellas six iwi: Ngati Koata, Ngati Kuia, Ngati Toa Rangatira, Ngati Rarua, Ngati Tama and Te Ati Awa.

In the largest work project ever undertaken by the commission of 3000 employers and employees across the country, the incorporation’s associate director scheme and the marae's Wonderful Wahine programme were highlighted as two of 12 best "good ideas and best practice" workplaces.

The associate director scheme encourages a continuous pool of young talent to one day run the incorporation while the wahine programme, run in conjunction with Nayland College, girls are encouraged to stay at school longer and work on career opportunities.
