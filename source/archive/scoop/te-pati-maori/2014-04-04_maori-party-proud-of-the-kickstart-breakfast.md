Maori Party Proud of the Kickstart Breakfast  

The Maori Party is proud to see thousands of whanau are better off with the success of the Kickstart Breakfast in schools.

Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell says “Over 25,000 children are taking part in Kick Start each week, thanks to the Maori Party/National Party joint venture with Fonterra and Sanitarium and a wonderful network of community volunteers and supporters. “Now all schools are able to join up, primary, intermediate and secondary, irrespective of decile rating.

“100 more schools have joined just this year, making a total of 722 schools. 1.6 million breakfasts so far is making a real difference, and that number is growing rapidly.

“Tackling poverty has always been a priority for the Maori Party, and we specified that as a key milestone in our Relationship Accord with the National Party,” said Co-leader Tariana Turia.

“Under our Whanau Ora kaupapa, we think government should empower whanau to look after each other, especially their children. However, not all whanau are able to do that immediately, and this practical help is an investment in a better start for their school day; a better start to life”.

“A healthy breakfast helps children to focus on their learning and enjoy their school day better, and educated children are better able to realise their full potential.

“There’s been a lot of snap, crackle, pop about the concept of breakfasts in schools. Instead of just making headlines, the Maori Party is pleased that we’re actually making a difference, by being able to put in place the means for every child in a New Zealand school to start school each day, ready to learn”.

“We offered our support for a Breakfasts in Schools Bill promoted by Hone Harawira, which has been on-again/off again on Mr Harawira’s agenda since it first made it onto the order paper in November 2012” said Mr Flavell. “We note that it was withdrawn at the last minute three times now, for reasons best known to Mr Harawira.

“We aren’t prepared to let the children wait and wonder. We’re really pleased that through our relationship with the Government, there are now 25,000 kids who are benefitting from the Kick Start programme up and running,” he said
