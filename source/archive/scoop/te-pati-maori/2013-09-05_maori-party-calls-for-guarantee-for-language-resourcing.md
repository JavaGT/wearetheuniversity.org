Maori Party calls for guarantee from Government for Maori and English language resourcing for schools

The Maori Party says the demise of Learning Media – Te Pou Taki Korero is a sad day for New Zealand children and schools and is calling on the Ministry of Education to confirm how they will ensure that students learning in te reo Maori and English will continue to be resourced to do so.

“We’d like to acknowledge all those writers, editors, artists and designers who over the decades have made a huge contribution to the production of resources for the children of New Zealand - from the old School Publications division of the Department of Education days to Learning Media -Te Pou Taki Korero – under the Ministry of Education. In particular we would like to acknowledge those involved in the production of Maori language resources which have assisted the growing number of Maori children learning in te reo Maori and which has also made a great contribution in the revitalisation of the language.”

“From its inception Learning Media - Te Pou Taki Korero has played a big role in enabling our tamariki to see their own experiences in the stories they read – in English and Maori. Our concern now is that we continue to cherish our rich cultural heritage by promoting identity and language through literacy. Literacy comes through seeing your stories in print and picture.”

“We expect that the Ministry of Education which promotes the concept of ‘Maori succeeding as Maori’ will guarantee to continue to fund resources in Maori and English that reflect the lives of all our tamariki.”
