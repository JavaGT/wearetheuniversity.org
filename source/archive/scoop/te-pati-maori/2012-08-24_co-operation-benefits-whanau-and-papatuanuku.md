Co-operation Benefits Whanau and Papatuanuku
============================================

**Press Release: [The Maori Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party)**

Te Ururoa Flavell  
MP for Waiariki

24th August 2012

**Co-operation Benefits Whanau and Papatuanuku**

Last night Te Ururoa Flavell expressed the Māori Party’s support for measures to look after families, Māori farmers and the environment. Following the first reading of the Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Scheme) Amendment Bill, the Māori Party voted for proposed amendments that will take another step that looks toward cleaning up our environment and making sure the interests of New Zealand whanau are protected.

“Māori have a very strong interest in the ETS. This Bill has a substantial impact on Māori farmers, Iwi investment in geothermal generation, electricity and petrol prices for our whanau and Treaty Settlements that include forestry land. It impacts Māori in almost every walk of life.”

“Since 2009, the Māori Party has been taking action to ensure close consultation and good dialogue on Māori interests concerning the ETS. We have been working to gain benefits that will bolster households and families – halving the impact of power and petrol price charges and securing insulation for thousands of low-income households.”

“We are pleased to see the Government has included offsetting for pre-1990 forest which is part of our Relationship Accord. We are also happy our representations alongside those of Iwi/Maori around the motu have been recognised making available the pre-1990 second tranche of allocation for those Iwi/Maori forestry owners who do not take up off-setting."

“The Māori Party wants to see further changes to the Bill. We will not forget the environment – this Bill was initially put forward to improve our environment first and foremost. We will fight for the amendments that bring this back to the foreground, taking the focus off units and measurements and putting it back on Papatuanuku.”

“We will also continue to fight for Iwi/Maori rights and interests in regard to the ETS – after all, given that Iwi/Maori own up to 50% of New Zealand forestry, they are essential to covering the carbon costs of New Zealand.”

ENDS
