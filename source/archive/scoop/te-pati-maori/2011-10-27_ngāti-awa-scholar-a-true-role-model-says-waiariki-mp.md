Ngāti Awa scholar a true role-model says Waiariki MP

Māori Party MP for Te Waiariki, Te Ururoa Flavell, is delighted to hear of the success Ngati Awa scholar Natalie Ramarihia Coates has achieved after being awarded the Fulbright Award to continue her studies in indigenous law and human rights at Harvard University.

“The opportunity to attend such a prestigious university is every top-scholar's dream, Natalie must be congratulated on her hard work and commitment to make this dream a reality” said Flavell.

“Natalie’s whānau would no doubt be very proud of their mokopuna, and I can’t help but be reminded of her koroua Te Wharekaihua who himself contributed tremendously to the development of Pahipoto and of Ngati Awa whānui.”

The Fulbright Award is sponsored by Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga - Centre of Research Excellence who supports research of relevance to Maori communities with a vision to realise the creative potential of Māori communities and to bring about positive change and transformation in the nation and wider world. The Fulbright scholarship programme provides scholars with the unique opportunity of participating in an international educational and cultural exchange.

“It is fantastic to see the creative potential of our home-grown indigenous intellectuals at the highest echelons of western academia, nō reira, tēnei te mihi nui kia koe Natalie.” ends Flavell.
