Māori Party Announce Policy To Transform Education System
=========================================================

**Wednesday, 16 September 2020, 10:15 am**  
**Press Release: [The Maori Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party)**

The Māori Party has today announced their education and training policy, which will transform the way tamariki Māori are educated in Aotearoa through resourcing and valuing kaupapa Māori education, overhauling the mainstream Pākehā system, and creating pathways for school leavers.

“The Māori Party vision for education is to ensure that all tamariki are supported to be themselves and receive high-quality education that sets them on the pathway to achieve their dreams, regardless of where they go to school,” said Co-leader and Te Tai Hauāuru candidate Debbie Ngarewa-Packer.

“Fundamental change is required to ensure that Māori can fulfil their potential. No one can realise their aspirations unless they know who they are, where they come from, and are proud of their culture and heritage.

“We know that Māori parents want Māori environments for their tamariki as that is the only way they can be sure that their tamariki will be safe and empowered to be who they are. The Māori Party will ensure that Māori medium education is funded and resourced through equity-based funding models.

“Due to a huge range of factors including availability and resourcing, most Māori children are still in mainstream education. That’s why we have policy to overhaul the mainstream Pākehā system and support Māori students and teachers by tackling inequity, racism and the digital divide head on.

“For young people leaving school and not going on to tertiary education, there are too few pathways into well-paid employment. We will put a major focus on increasing placements in apprenticeships, training schemes, and cadetships,” said Mrs Ngarewa-Packer.
