**IronMāori MP leads by example**

**04 December 2015**

Waiariki MP Te Ururoa Flavell is gearing up to compete in the IronMāori half Ironman event tomorrow.

He’s looking forward to joining thousands of other participants in the two kilometre swim, 90 kilometre bike ride and 21.1 kilometre run.

“It is an inspirational Māori event which encourages everyone, particularly our people to give it a go,” he says.

“It doesn’t matter about a person’s age or level of fitness it is about participation.”

This year will be the fourth consecutive time Mr Flavell has taken part in the event.

“I love it. I enjoy the whānau atmosphere of IronMāori. It is Whānau Ora in action,” he says.

The Māori Party is focussed on creating and enabling families to lead healthy lives.

“It is important I lead by example so hopefully I can inspire some of our whānau to become active and perhaps create a healthier family environment,” he says.

The IronMāori event gets underway at 6:15am at Pandora Pond in Napier tomorrow.
