Ratana Festivities a Time for Getting Real says Turia

Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party

Wednesday 24 January 2007

As Morehu throughout Aotearoa gather at Ratana Pa, Tariana Turia has recalled the impact of Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana, as a man of the people, who never lost sight of their real needs and values.

“Anyone who spends time at the Pa, whether in the tents or sharing kai, will be faced with the reality of our people’s lives” said Mrs Turia.

“We remember the message of TW Ratana, that through upholding our spiritual beliefs and honouring Te Tiriti o Waitangi, our people will advance”.

“And although the political rhetoric of the day has made considerable fanfare about how well we are doing, I think it is important to open our eyes to the reality of the situation for so many Maori”.

“I was interested in the analysis presented by Maori academic, Dr Rawiri Taonui, who has suggested that the hype around so-called increases in Maori earnings could hide real problems” said Mrs Turia. Dr Taonui's analysis is consistent with what we in the Maori Party find on a regular basis in our electorates.

While Census data reveals that the median income for Maori aged 15 years and over; is $20,900, Dr Taonui, Head of Canterbury University's school of Maori and Indigenous studies, has warned that an emerging Maori middle class may be hiding low working-class income amongst Maori people.

“We can not ignore, of course, the disparity between all other New Zealanders, who enjoy a median income of $24,400” said Mrs Turia.

"And although there has been much talk of how well Maori are doing, it must be remembered that the median wage of $20,900 per annum for Maori equates to $10.04 per hour - which is still well less than the current minimum adult wage of $10.25 per hour".

“We are also extremely mindful of the persistent over-representation of Maori in health statistics such as diabetes; lung and heart disease; and life-expectancy which simply reflect the grip of poverty; the effects of economic violence upon living standards”.

“These ongoing statistics; our experience in greeting our people, door-to-door prior to the last election; our tours around the koata (the four quarters); all reinforce the importance of holding true to TW Ratana’s pledge, to work ‘mo te iwi Maori’, in order “that all may know that the Treaty of Waitangi is operative; also to preserve the ties of brotherhood between Pakeha and Maori for all time”.
