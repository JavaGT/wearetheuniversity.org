Maori Party List  
Professor Whatarangi Winiata, Friday 22 August 2008

President of the Maori Party, Professor Whatarangi Winiata, has announced the Maori Party list which represents an impressive field of 19 candidates ready, willing and able to lead Aotearoa into the future.

“Our list leads off with our seven candidates, who have taken on the responsibility of standing in the seven Maori seats as the Maori Partner in Parliament” said Professor Winiata.

“The Nation’s tikanga Maori house will be strengthened through the expertise and lifetime experience of Naida Glavish and Iritana Tawhiwhirangi” said Professor Winiata.

“Naida Glavish, the ‘kia ora lady’ has been an advocate for tangata whenua since that day in 1984 when, as a humble toll operator, she challenged the might of the Post Office to use our own reo” said Professor Winiata.

“The distinguished Iritana Tawhiwhirangi has an international reputation for her pioneering role in establishing Te Kohanga Reo National Trust”.

“We are delighted with the fresh, young talent of Hector Matthews, Amokura Panoho, Te Orohi Paul, Te Awanuiarangi Black, and Bronwyn Yates”.

“Hector and Te Orohi have particular strength in the health sector. Hector is currently the Executive Director of Maori and Pacific Health for Canterbury District Health Board; and Te Orohi has a strong management background in Raukura Hauora o Tainui; while Amokura Panoho is known for her work in tourism, business mentoring and economic development”.

“Educational excellence is also a feature of our list. Te Awanuiarangi Black is skilled in Matauranga Maori – one of his achievements is having written over 8000 dictionary entries for Te Matapuna (Maori language dictionary). Our passionate interest in literacy as a vehicle for excellence is recognized by the selection of Bronwyn Yates (Chief Executive, Literacy Aotearoa)”.

“Grant Hawke and Mereana Pitman are well known throughout the motu; Grant for his skills in Treaty Negotiations and his position as kaumatua/ cultural heritage advisor for ERMA and Greenpeace NZ; while Mereana has devoted many years of her life to strengthening our capacity to respond to the challenge of family violence”.

“Richard Orzecki brings enormous skills in the information technology sector – currently chairing the NZ Maori internet society; and Georgina Haremate-Crawford brings to our list a background in justice and business management”.

“Josie Peita came to the attention of the media this year when her daughter was crowned Miss World NZ. “As a classroom teacher, she has dedicated her life to inspiring and encouraging our young to aim for the stars – what better metaphor could there be for the Maori Party – facing the future with enthusiasm”.
