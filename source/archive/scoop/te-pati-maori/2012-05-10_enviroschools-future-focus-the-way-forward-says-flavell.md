Enviroschools “future focus” the way forward says Flavell

The Māori Party is claiming a major success with the fulfilment of another of its key policies, today’s announcement of Budget funding for Enviroschools and Te Aho Turoa (the Māori-immersion approach).

“When we met at the negotiating table, we insisted that the Government should retain and resource the Enviroschools/Kura-taiao,” said education spokesperson Te Ururoa Flavell.

“With a successful network of 825 schools, kura and early childhood centres involved in Enviroschools and Te Aho Tū Roa, it was definitely worth fighting for after funding was cut in 2010,” he adds.

“One of the core values of the Maori Party is kaitiakitanga, and we believe that nurturing this value in our tamariki is an important part of nurturing our future.”

“In the last term of Government, we were able to insist that interim funding be provided to keep the scheme alive; and in our 2011 Relationship Accord, the Māori Party secured a commitment from the National Party to restore longer-term funding.”

“We are passionate about our environment, and our support for Enviroschools, and Te Aho Turoa reflects this commitment. This organisation provides a valuable service for our tamariki, and sets out ways that an environmental/kaitiaki philosophy can be applied in Māori-immersion education, because they reflect a world view that is very consistent with Māori values,” he said.

“Enviroschools and Te Aho Turoa have a future focus – involving schools, students, their whānau and communities in practical programmes for sustainable living,” ends Mr Flavell.
