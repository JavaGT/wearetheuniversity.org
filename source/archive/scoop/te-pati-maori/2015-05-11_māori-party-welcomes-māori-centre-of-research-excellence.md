**Māori Party Welcomes Māori Centre of Research Excellence**

The Māori Party is pleased that funding for a Māori Centre of Research Excellence (CoRE) for the next five years has been confirmed. Ngā Pae o Te Māramatanga was announced as one of the four new CoRE to receive funding by the Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister, Steven Joyce yesterday.

“The Māori Party secured $20m over 2016 to 2020 in the 2014 Budget to ensure the Government established a dedicated Māori-focused CoRE. It’s satisfying to see this funding allocated,” says Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.

Three groups submitted a bid for the Māori CoRE fund, and Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga based at the University of Auckland was confirmed as the successful applicant.

“A Māori research centre ensures that we have an institution dedicated to reclaiming our traditional knowledge and making research relevant to the development of our communities,” says Mr Flavell.

Ngā Pae o Te Māramatanga undertakes and invests in research concerning mātauranga Māori (Māori knowledges), Māori assets and Māori people.

Over the past decade, Ngā Pae has supported more than 500 Māori PhD graduates to complete research with whānau, hapū, iwi, Māori and indigenous communities here and abroad.

Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox says, “Ngā Pae has made a huge contribution to Māori and indigenous scholarship in Aotearoa and around the world.”

“I’m proud that the Māori Party has been able to secure the continuation of a Māori Centre of Research Excellence at a time when Māori development is on such a roll,” says Mrs Fox.
