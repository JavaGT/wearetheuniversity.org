Māori Party shocked by the death of law lecturer, Matiu Dickson

Kei te tuakana, Matiu Dickson, te tangata kapa haka, te tangata whakatau i te ngākau, te kaiako, te tangata kawe i ngā tikanga o tōna marae o ngā iwi o Tauranga Moana okioki mai rā.

The Māori Party is devastated by the sudden death of law lecturer, Matiu Dickson.

“We send our thoughts and prayers to his wife and whānau, as well as to his iwi of Ngāi Te Rangi and Te Whakatōhea,” says Māori Party Co-leader, Marama Fox.

Te Ururoa Flavell, who will be attending his tangi, says “My heart broke hearing of the sudden death of a close friend. Matiu Dickson and I flatted together when I first left school and we both attended university together. I will never forget him and will cherish the wonderful memories I have of an articulate and intelligent man”.

“He inspired people to think outside the box. He took a special interest in legal education, advocacy for rangatahi, as well as looking at Māori legal issues. Over his 20 years teaching at Waikato University, he inspired many students”, says Marama Fox.

Te Ururoa Flavell says Mr Dickson will be remembered for his work as a tribal leader, who chaired Te Rūnanga o Kirikiriroa, and was also a treaty negotiator for the Ngāi Te Rangi Treaty Settlement Claim.

Marama Fox also paid homage to his skill as an expert in kapa haka and tikanga Māori.

“He will be sorely missed by many facets of Te Ao Māori as a well-educated man, who was always willing to share his knowledge”, she says.
