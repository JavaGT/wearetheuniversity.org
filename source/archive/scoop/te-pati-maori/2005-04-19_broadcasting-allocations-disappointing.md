Broadcasting Allocations Disappointing

Tariana Turia - Co-leader, Maori Party

The Maori Party appreciates the gesture of support evident in the decision by the Electoral Commission to award $125,000 in funding, and seven minutes in total time, for the Broadcasting allocation.

“Two polls announced over the weekend, the Marae Digipoll, and a Massey University survey which indicated that 11% of all voters were likely to vote for the Maori Party, demonstrate the high level of interest that the Maori Party is attracting across the nation”.

“Given these exciting poll results, and the current demographic profile that Maori comprise 15% of the population, we had expected that we would receive more than 4% of the total broadcasting allocation”.

“However, although it is at best conservative, we also appreciate any funding that will assist in being able to share our vision with the peoples of Aotearoa”

“The Maori Party remains committed to an electoral strategy which places priority on the concept of ‘kanohi ki te kanohi’, (face to face), as the key way of bringing the party to the people”.

“We know that $125,000 probably only buys us a couple of minutes of TV airtime while conversations across the country give us an important chance to listen to views which may influence the future direction of this nation”

It is an opportunity that our candidates are keen to begin as soon as possible”.
