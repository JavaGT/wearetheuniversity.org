### Maori Party welcomes ‘visionary’ Constitutional Advisory Panel

The Maori Party spokesperson on constitutional issues, Rahui Katene, is excited by the breadth and vision of the tangata whenua members appointed to the constitutional advisory panel.

“This is a major milestone and a fantastic achievement for the Maori Party” said Mrs Katene.

“The five Maori appointees represent a group of people who will truly engage our communities, and be able to advocate for Maori aspirations.”

“Our constitutional pathway is in good hands, when we consider the calibre represented by Ta Tipene O’Regan (Kai Tahu), who has significant experience in Treaty and governance work, working alongside Dr. Ranginui Walker, one of our premier historians and authors; Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith, a leading Maori researcher and academic; Dr. Leonie Pihama a staunch advocate for kaupapa Maori with particular expertise in the politics of Maori representation and the outstanding talent of Hinurewa Poutu – a young woman schooled in the teachings of both Te Ao tawhito and Te Ao hurihuri.” said Mrs Katene.

“Tangata whenua have been waiting a long time, for an enduring conversation about Te Tiriti o Waitangi as the foundation of government, of parliament and indeed our national identity.

"We are very proud of the quality of the panel appointees announced today. Together, the team of twelve will be well placed to mobilise and inspire conversations about our evolving constitutional framework".
