**Interactive writing tool for study of Te Reo an award-winner**

Award-winning designers of new software aimed at improving the teaching of Maori have been congratulated by Minister of Education Chris Carter and Minister of Māori Affairs and Associate Education Minister Parekura Horomia.

The developers and designers of _Te Tuhi ā-Hiko_ won the prestigious Telecom Users Association of New Zealand Business Internet Award 2007 for Education.

_Te Tuhi ā-Hiko_ (Digital Writing Tool) is the first interactive writing tool designed specifically for students learning te reo Māori.  
  
“_Te Tuhi ā-Hiko_ takes an innovative and exciting approach to enhancing students’ writing in te reo, which was recognised by the TUANZ award judges,” Chris Carter said.

“When I joined the Prime Minister to launch the New Zealand curriculum last week we talked about the need for all young people to have the best opportunity possible to achieve to their full potential and this resource is a real contribution to that goal.”

_Te Tuhi ā-Hiko_ CD-ROM supports Māori medium students in years 5–8 and incorporates visual and audio elements to enhance the learning experience. It was created to appeal to the students. Whakairo (carvings) are used as the navigation icons throughout the resource and are a metaphor for the journey that a piece of writing takes as it is developed.

“I expect it to make a considerable impact in Māori medium education,” said Parekura Horomia.

“This tool will assist Maori students to develop skills in writing te reo and will contribute to outcomes in the draft partner curriculum for Maori medium teaching and learning which I will be releasing for consultation later this week.”
