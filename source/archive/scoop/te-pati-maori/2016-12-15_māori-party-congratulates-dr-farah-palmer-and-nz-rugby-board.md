Māori Party congratulates Dr Farah Palmer and NZ Rugby Board

The Māori Party has welcomed the decision to appoint Dr Farah Rangikoepa Palmer as the Māori representative on New Zealand Rugby Board.

“Today is a great day for rugby and an even better day for women,” says co-leader Marama Fox.

"NZ Rugby should be congratulated for its decision and foresight to appoint Dr Palmer to its Board. Farah epitomises mana wahine. Her experience and leadership in many spheres, both on and off the paddock, are testament to the value she will bring to her new role.”

Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell says “Dr Palmer’s Tainui and Ngāti Maniapoto people will be rightly proud of her, as will Māori sports communities throughout the country.”

“Having been a Black Fern with a brilliant playing record, as well as a former member on the NZ Māori Rugby Board, we know the future of the sport is in good hands.”

“I have every confidence that she will do a great job representing the interests of not only Māori but of women, children and everyone else who loves our national sport."

Dr Palmer is a senior lecturer in Massey University's school of management and director in the university's Māori business and leadership centre. In 2007, she was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the New Year's Honours for services to women's rugby and sport.

Dr Palmer replaces Wayne Peters who was the previous Māori representative on NZ Rugby.
