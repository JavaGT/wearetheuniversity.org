Remembering the Battle at Rangiriri, 150 years on

The Maori Party is joining with the many New Zealanders who are today remembering the battle at Rangiriri, one of the major battles in the New Zealand land wars which took place 150 years ago.

“The battle at Rangiriri took place on the 20th of November 1863. It was a stand-off between 1400 British soldiers, and around 500 Maori who sought to protect their lands from invasion, confiscation and alienation. This battle took more lives than any other encounter during the Waikato land wars, and is significant in that it was a turning point for British settlers in their quest for land in Aotearoa,” said Maori Party Co-leader, Te Ururoa Flavell.

“For tangata whenua this battle typifies the sorrow and loss caused by colonisation, but also the passion and vigour with which our tupuna fought against the theft of their lands, and injustice in Aotearoa.”

“While we have come a long way in the relations between Maori and Pakeha, today serves as a reminder of the significant injustices which took place here in Aotearoa.”

“The alienation of Maori from their lands, alongside a history of colonial oppression by Parliament has had a direct impact on the wellbeing of tangata whenua, and our ability to succeed socially, culturally, and economically, the consequences of which can still be seen today,” said Mr. Flavell.

“That is why over these many years Maori have sought to re-establish their rangatiratanga, to ensure acknowledgement of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and to seek equality of outcomes for our whanau, tamariki and mokopuna.”

“This is exactly the reason why the Maori Party was established. That is exactly the reason why many Maori initiatives have developed over the years.”

“New Zealanders have a duty to remember these histories, no matter how painful, because these are the things which have shaped the nation we have today. These are the things which have shaped the people of Aotearoa.”

“Today I honour all of those who fell in the battle at Rangiriri, and I acknowledge how far we have come together as peoples – however, I also remember the challenge that lies before us as tangata whenua, and the role that the Maori Party must play in continuing the work of our tupuna in seeking equality, justice and recognition for whanau, hapu, iwi - tangata whenua,” said Mr. Flavell.
