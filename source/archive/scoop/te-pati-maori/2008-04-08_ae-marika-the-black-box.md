THE BLACK BOX

A couple weeks ago I went to the World Indigenous Television Broadcasting Conference in Auckland – a splendiferous affair held at the Aotea Centre, hosted by Maori Television and attended by delegates from Wales, Saami, Canada, Hawaii, Taiwan and Indigenous Australia.

Maori TV also used the opportunity to launch ‘Te Reo’ the world’s first ever 100% Māori language television channel, which will be on air three hours a day, seven days a week from 8-11pm on Freeview 24 and apparently also on SKY (somewhere).

Everyone appreciated the opportunity to get together and discuss common problems and solutions and share ideas. A great conference, but way too expensive! At $1700 for the three days, the only Maori who could attend were sponsored to be there.

Certainly nobody from TEHIKU TV could afford to be there, nor any senior students from high schools and wharekura around Auckland, nor anyone else interested in indigenous TV. And that was a real pity because ordinary Maori will not now have an opportunity to go to another one of these hui for at least another 10 years. Take note MTS.

  
THANKS

Last week during General Debate, I farewelled one of our security guards who had just passed away, thanked Nandor for being an inspiration to me, in and out of Parliament, and said happy birthday to my mum as well.

And one Pakeha guy wrote back to say:

“I wanted to acknowledge your speech in the House today (in regards to the security guard who passed away and to Nandor Tanzcos). I was listening while I was on my way to Auckland.”

“More often than not, I get angry and frustrated at the way members carry on. Today though, something was different and it was your speech. While I didn't quite get to tears it was close, and at the conclusion, I turned off the stereo to reflect on what you had just said - in particular, acknowledging people while we still can.”

“Hone - it's fair to say that while I don’t agree with everything you say or do, your speech today has raised your mana in my eyes.”

It’s nice getting the chance to say nice things about others, and it’s even nicer knowing that other people appreciate it.
