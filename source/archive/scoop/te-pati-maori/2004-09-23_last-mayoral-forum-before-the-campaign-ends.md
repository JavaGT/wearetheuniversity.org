Last Mayoral Forum before the campaign ends.

Dear All,

This advisory is remind you that sarting this Sunday we have three mayoral meetings in Auckland, Manukau and Waitakere. The first one is on Sunday at 2pm (details below). Dick Hubbard and Christine Flectcher have confirmed and we awaiting confirmation from John Banks but we are confident that he will attend.

At 7pm on Monday night in Manukau (details below) Sir Barry Curtis, Len Brown and Dick Quax will speak. Bob Harvey and other ticket leaders will speak in Waitakere on Tueday night at 7pm.

We think you should come as there have never been meetings of maori where the main mayoral contenders have spoken. It shows the increasing political awareness of maori to use their votes strategically.

WHY MAORI SHOULD VOTE

The Maori Party believes that it is important for Maori to vote in the local body elections and in Tamaki Makaurau (Auckland) we are encouraging our people and the public at large to attend the following events convened by Dr. Pita Sharples, the Co-Leader of the Maori Party.

Dr Sharples has invited the leading Mayoral candidates in Auckland City, Waitakere City and Manukau City to speak at the following events. The Hui will give our Maori Party membership, along with the public at large, an opportunity to hear from the candidates who will be elected into senior leadership roles in the Auckland Region.
