Press Release

30 September 2008

It’s always happening in Hauraki-Waikato!

“Hamilton shines” said Angeline Greensill, the Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato. “On Sunday, I took a walk through Hamilton and was amazed by the energy and activity happening on the streets”.

“The People's Procession arrived in Garden Place, with many whanau signing the petition to remove GST from all food” said Greensill.

“This effort shows how important Hamilton is to the nation’s heartbeat and I was encouraged to listen to young families support the People's Procession”.

“The Maori Party supports the effort to make food more affordable and will gratefully receive the People's Procession when it arrives in Wellington later this week (Friday)”.

“It was also World Deaf Day and I had the great pleasure of meeting a deaf group promoting trilingualism here in Hamilton” said Greensill.

“Sign language needs more support and trilingual sign language expertise should have more allocated resources”.

Mrs Greensill also signalled the significance of the annual hui of the Maori Women's Welfare League which this year marks its 56th annual conference.

“The Maori Women’s Welfare League Conference starts in Manukau City this week, highlighting the many positive initiatives developed and supported by Maori women, so I encourage young Maori women in particular to take an interest in this election and in your community”.
