Halt needed over plans to blow-up occupied kohatu
=================================================

**Halt needed over plans to blow-up occupied kohatu**

The Maori Party is urging a hydro company not to dynamite a two-storey high kohatu being occupied by tangata whenua.

“Cool heads is what is needed right now and I urge the company to hold-off on their plans to drill and dynamite Te Rongomai o Te Karaka until all parties have come to a consensus,” Maori Party MP for Te Tai Hauauru Tariana Turia said.

An abatement notice, which prevented Clearwater Hydro in Te Anga from destroying or removing the kohatu, was lifted at 5am this morning.

“My primary concern is the safety of the whänau who are occupying that area - whanau who view this site as a waahi tapu that must not be interfered with,” Mrs Turia said.

Mrs Turia said regardless of what process had taken place in the past, all parties – including Waitomo District Council, Environment Waikato Regional Council, Clearwater Hydro, the Heritage Trust and the people of Marokopa Marae – must sit down and talk through the issue as well as others issues tangata whenua have about other waahi tapu in the area.
