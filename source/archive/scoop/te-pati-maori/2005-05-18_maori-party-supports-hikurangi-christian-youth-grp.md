PRESS RELEASE

Hikurangi Ward, Whangarei

Maori Party supports Hikurangi Christian Youth Group

Hikurangi Christian Youth Group, the Tornadoes, will be closer to their fundraising goal when Maori Party candidate Hone Harawira arrives in town this Friday.

The Tornadoes will be selling sausages at the Hikurangi Memorial Hall while Maori Party members congregate to spend some time with Mr Harawira.

The Maori Party Tai Tokerau candidate has family roots in and around Whangarei, mainly in Whakapara and Ngararatunua. Mr Harawira was born in Whangarei.

The Maori Party membership in the Hikurangi ward have invited him to spend time with them this Friday before Mr Harawira gets started on his political campaign. He is currently on the Transient By Nature Speaking Tour within Te Taitokerau electorate, responding to invitations from West Auckland to Cape Reinga.

Tornadoes parent, Olive Waipouri, says the youth group is excited about fundraising to go to Ruapehu to visit the snow later this year (July).

\"The crew is excited," says Mrs Waipouri. "Fundraising for a goal, and getting to meet a Parliamentary candidate. He's great with tamariki, and inspires them to achieve. We're looking forward to meeting him, up close and casual."
