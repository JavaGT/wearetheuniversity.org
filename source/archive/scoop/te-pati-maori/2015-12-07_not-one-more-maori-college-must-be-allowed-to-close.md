MEDIA RELEASE

7 December 2015

Not one more Maori college must be allowed to close

The possible closure of Hato Petera College in Northcote will be a tragedy for all concerned if it is the result of a simple lack of communication. This today from the president of the Maori Party, Rangimarie Naida Glavish, who is also co-chair of Te Runanga o Ngati Whatua whose regions supply many Hato Petera students.

“Kaumatua associated with Hato Petera have asked me to intervene to the extent I can because they are concerned at what they feel has been disrespect for tikanga Maori by those who advise the Catholic Bishop of Auckland, Patrick Dunn. I know personally how deeply Bishop Dunn knows and respects our tikanga and our reo, and I can only surmise that he is being badly advised.

“There should be no need for political or iwi intervention into what is essentially, and should continue to be, korero between a church and its followers, but if it comes to a need for action to support those of our Maori people who wish for their children to attend Maori boarding schools, then we cannot and will not stand aside, said Ms Glavish.
