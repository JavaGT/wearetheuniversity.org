\"Maori Boys yesterday, Maori Girls today - the business of system failure"

Te Ururoa Flavell; Education Spokesperson for the Maori Party  
Wednesday 14 February 2007

“Day two of the parliamentary year and already it’s enough to get anyone down” said Te Ururoa Flavell, Maori Party Spokesperson for Education.

Mr Flavell was reacting to the Preliminary report for attendance, absence and truancy in New Zealand schools, 2006, which shows the Maori truancy rate has risen by two percent in two years.

The report demonstrates that ethnicity is a significant factor with regard to truancy. In 2006, Māori and Pasifika students had double the truancy rate when compared with New Zealand European and Asian students.

“What on earth is going on in New Zealand schools, to make our Maori and Pasifika students so disenchanted and disengaged?” demanded Mr Flavell.

“What on earth is going on in our society and when are we really going to do something about it? The mealy-mouthed excuses of bureaucrats and blame mentality of politicians has to stop” stated Mr Flavell.

“Students who truant, not only miss out on their right to learn, but they run the increased risk of being alienated and dropping out of the system altogether” said Mr Flavell.

“The preliminary report highlights that Māori females had the largest increase in truancy rates (from 5.6% in 2004 to 7.1% in 2006)” said Mr Flavell.

“So in one week, Maori girls (truancy) and Maori boys (achievement rates) have effectively been shown to be at significant risk of educational system failure, leading to greatly reduced opportunities for their futures”.

“It is an absolute outrage that year after year, the system is suffering a major melt-down, shutting the doors on our Maori kids” said Mr Flavell.

“Dr Pita Sharples, on behalf of the Maori Party, called for a major inquiry into system failure for Maori in compulsory education, at the Maori Affairs Select Committee this morning. We're heartened by his report back that committee members will be discussing this matter with their party caucuses before next week's meeting” said Mr Flavell.
