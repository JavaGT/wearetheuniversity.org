Founding Māori Party Co-leaders give their total support to the new line-up

  
In an historic week for New Zealand politics, departing Māori Party founding leaders give their unreserved support to the new generation of Māori Party candidates.

“Absolutely outstanding” is how Tariana Turia and Dr Pita Sharples describe the Māori Party candidates contesting the seven Māori seats this election.

“The party’s future is in great hands. We have a dynamic and committed group of candidates who are ready to serve our people”, says Mrs Turia.

“We have an incredibly dedicated group of candidates who understand, and embody the kaupapa of our party and the importance of maintaining an independent Māori voice in Government.”

“The Māori Party candidates broadly reflect who we are as a people”, says Dr Sharples.

“We have youth represented by Te Hira Paenga in Te Tai Tokerau and Marama Fox in Ikaroa Rāwhiti; we have experienced political thinkers such as our Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell in Waiariki and Chris McKenzie in Te Tai Hauāuru; astute entrepreneurs like Susan Cullen in Hauraki Waikato and Ngaire Button in Te Tai Tonga and people grounded in their communities like Rangi McLean in Tāmaki Makaurau.”

Mrs Turia says, “The last few weeks have been a watershed time for our party. Pita and I are committed to supporting our Party into the future, but it’s time that we stepped back and allowed the next generation of leaders to come through.

“Te Ururoa will steer our waka into the future. He is a great leader, a steady hand, and a much loved colleague to both of us. We know that our new team under his leadership has a huge amount to contribute to our people .”

ENDS.
