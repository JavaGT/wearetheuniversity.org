**Maori and Pasifika Strategies Launch, Massey University, Palmerston North**

E nga matawaka e tau mai nei i tenei ata ki Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa, tena koutou katoa.

Nga mihi o te Tau Hou Maori ki a tatou katoa.

I am pleased and proud to be here today to launch the Maori and Pasifika@Massey University strategies.

I would like to acknowledge the Massey University senior leadership team – my former parliamentary colleague, Vice Chancellor, the Honourable Dr Steve Maharey - Assistant Vice Chancellor Maori, Dr Selwyn Katene – Director Māori, Professor Te Kani Kingi and Director Pasifika, Professor Malakai Koloamatangi, tena koutou katoa.

I would also like to acknowledge and pay tribute to Professor Sir Mason Durie who has been instrumental in developing both the Maori@Massey and Pasifika@Massey strategies.

His foresight and commitment and collaboration with the staff and Maori and Pasifika communities over the past decades has seen an increase in Maori and Pasifika participation and graduation rates - a stronger Maori health workforce - and Maori and Pasifika communities who have more capacity and capability now through research and scholarship here at Massey University. It is heartening to see that despite Sir Mason’s retirement from university life, his work is still continuing today.

Thank-you to both Directors- Professor Kingi and Professor Koloamatangi for your presentations on these two visionary strategies. The Maori@Massey2020: KIA MĀRAMA and Pasifika@Massey2020: GROWING PEARLS OF WISDOM.

I was thinking about the notion of the pearl – so small, so exquisite and so precious. And in my head, I’ve been thinking about that 90s hit song by Moana Maniapoto – _Black pearl, precious little girl, let me put you up where you belong._

In many ways these two strategies reflect that power and that beauty – the strength, the knowledge and the cultural richness that we associate with Maori and Pasifika world views.

It is so uplifting to see that both these strategies have a focus of collaboration with both Maori and Pasifika communities to enhance the social, cultural and spiritual well-being of the people. It speaks to me of Whanau Ora which Sir Mason has been instrumental in developing – where whanau become self-determining, resilient and capable of deciding their own futures.

Maori and Pasifika identity is diverse and intergenerational and comes with multiple worldviews.

I am excited by the KIA MARAMA strategy – **K**ey **I**nitiatives to **A**ccelerate **M**assey’s **A**cademic and **R**esearch **A**genda for **M**aori **A**dvancement. What great opportunities this gives Maori communities. Not only by forging Maori academic pathways and building catalysts for Maori learning and scholarship but also the opportunity to generate new knowledge relevant to whanau, hapu and iwi development.

GROWING PEARLS OF WISDOM which expresses the essence of Pasifika values- reciprocity, service, respect, inclusion, and spirituality also reminds me of the beauty and uniqueness of the beautiful blue pearls found off the New Zealand Coastline – and it reminds me of the importance of wisdom.

Rather than just equip our students with qualifications – wisdom ensures that our students are also equipped with the ability to make wise decisions-for the benefit of the whole family, whanau and community.

And of course, as one who has spent many hours admiring the divine black pearls on display in the South Pacific, I know that perfection can come in many shades. The radiant hue of each pearl, each heart of glimmering darkness, reminds us that every student has hidden talents and diverse strengths, just waiting to be found. My hope for this programme, is that each student – and indeed each teacher, finds new gifts to develop during the duration of your study to keep you striving to learn more and take on new opportunities.

KIA MARAMA and GROWING PEARLS OF WISDOM build on the gains Massey University has made over the last decade to support the recruitment, retention and completion rates of Maori and Pasifika students. It is fitting that both Māori and Pasifika values have a place in academic thinking today. What a long way we have come from the days when Maori and Pasifika students were rarely seen at universities.

Pipiri or Hune as some still call it – is a time to celebrate the Maori New Year when the seven stars of Matariki appear in the sky heralding a time to remember and a time to celebrate new beginnings.

Congratulations to Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa for these two wonderful initiatives. Building on past efforts for a brighter future for Maori and Pasifika.

I now declare Kia Marama and Pearls of Wisdom officially launched!

Mauri ora ki a tatou katoa.

ENDS
