TVNZ must correct the lie – tonight!

The Māori Party is calling on the bosses of TVNZ's Seven Sharp programme to get their presenter Mike Hosking to correct the lie he told last night that non-Māori can't vote for the Māori Party.

"The fact is that non-Māori voters and voters on the general roll can give the Māori Party their party vote," said Māori Party president Tukoroirangi Morgan.

“So just to be clear, everyone on the general role can still vote Māori Party - Pasifika, Pakeha, Asian and all others.

"What Mike said wasn't tika or pono so we call on him and his bosses to correct that.

"Mike has abused his position of power and influence to lie to the nation. At his level, as a national broadcaster, being ill informed is no excuse.

"Freedom of speech is a good thing but not when it's used to tell lies.

"They've got a legal and ethical obligation, not to our party, but to hundreds of thousands of their viewers, to right the wrong. And they really should be doing that tonight when their programme goes to air again."
