Te Ururoa Flavell  
MP for Waiariki

25 July, 2012

**'Te Mita o Kaiwhao’ exhibition at Parliament**

Waiariki MP, Te Ururoa Flavell is hosting an exhibition of Maori art and carvings at Parliament at 10am, Thursday 26th July in the Parliamentary Exhibition Space on level one of Bowen House.

The exhibition, _'Te Mita o Kaiwhao’_ is the work of a group of five carvers from Waikato, Tauranga and Gisborne.

Artists Te Kuiti Stewart, Warren McGrath, Simon Madgwick, Thomas Hansen and Pita Broad have worked together on exhibitions in galleries around New Zealand several times and have undertaken commissioned work and large community projects. Their works demonstrate oratory as a theme, chosen by the group as the exhibition dates overlap Māori Language Week. Twenty eight works are featured and they include carved whalebone, moa bone, pounamu and whakairo.

The exhibition will be on show until 31 August and is open to the public three days a week – Wed/Thu/Fri from 10am to 3pm.
