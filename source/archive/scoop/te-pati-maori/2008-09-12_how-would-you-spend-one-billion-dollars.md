How would you spend One Billion Dollars?

**_How would you spend One Billion Dollars?_**

“It might be a bold statement but how would communities allocate spending if one billion dollars was made available in education, health and housing” declared Angeline Greensill, the Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato.

“The common message I hear when door-knocking and meeting social leaders is that communities want more say over how resources are allocated and financial support from the Government is too often prescriptive, rather than what is recommended by those working at the coal face” said Mrs Greensill.

“One way to encourage innovative discussion is to ask communities directly “_How would you allocate resources if the Maori Party advocated to direct one billion dollars to education, one billion dollars to health and one billion dollars to housing?”_

Mrs Greensill continued by saying “The Government has just spent billions of dollars based on its own political agenda, so we can all see that the money is in the system – why not finally ask the communities themselves how to allocate these much needed resources?”

“I would like to start a social discussion on how to best finance community initiatives and to work collaboratively on improving all communities across our beautiful country and within my intended electorate.”
