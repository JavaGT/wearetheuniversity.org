Day of shame for Nelson says Maori Party

The Maori Party is shocked to hear that 95 study places for people with intellectual disabilities look to be cut at Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology.

“I understand the institute is looking to save $34,000 by cutting these places and quite frankly if it does, it will lose more than it has bargained for especially as far as its credibility is concerned,” Maori Party MP for Tai Tonga Rahui Katene said.

“The education of 95 people outweighs saving $34,000 a year and if these places are slashed then that will be a great shame for the people of Nelson because what it says is that the city’s biggest tertiary education institute does not care about the education of its disabled community.

The institute’s supported training programme offers places to 120 students with various intellectual disabilities. And it is now under a review that could see the number of places slashed to 25.

“If the institute will not support the most vulnerable members of our community I am more than prepared to advocate on their behalf,” Mrs Katene said.
