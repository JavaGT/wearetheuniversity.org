**Turia congratulates Te Tu Toa Academy**

Maori Party MP for Te Tai Hauauru, Tariana Turia, is congratulating Te Tu Toa Academy on its relaunch next year as Tai Wananga.

From the beginning of next year, Tu Toa will become Tai Wananga and forge a close relationship with Te Wananga o Aotearoa.

"This relationship will give students an almost seamless transition from secondary to tertiary study or from school into work.

"Tu Toa have been an outstanding educational provider with its programme offering an alternative secondary education that has been very successful for our youth.

"I hope its collaboration with Te Wananga o Aotearoa will continue to build on the success achieved to date and create exciting pathways for our youth.

"I'm very excited about this development, and I look forward to watching future developments," says Mrs Turia.
