Maori Party succeeds in inserting Treaty clause
===============================================

**MEDIA STATEMENT**  
**Rahui Katene**  
**Maori Party Environment Spokesperson**

  
**Maori Party succeeds in inserting Treaty clause into Environment Protection law**

  
Environment spokesperson for the Maori Party, Rahui Katene, is delighted that her amendment to help to **“recognize and respect the Crown’s responsibility to take appropriate account of the Treaty of Waitangi”** in the Environment Protection Authority Bill was supported during the committee stages of the Bill today.

The amendment ensures that the Environment Protection Authority Bill, and any person acting on behalf of the Bill, must “comply with the requirements of an environmental act in relation to the Treaty”.

“Amidst all the noise of the political theatre played out over recent days, it is extremely important to me and the Maori Party, that we consolidate and strengthen the role of the Treaty as a living document”.

“I hope that my amendment will enable tangata whenua to exercise influence and authority in decision-making processes related to environment protection” said Mrs Katene.

“My SOP specifies the Treaty provisions in areas such as the use, development and protection of natural and physical resources; hazardous substances and new organisms, or our response to climate change”.

“Seven years to the day after thousands marched on Parliament in protest at the 2004 Foreshore and Seabed Act, it was a moment of great satisfaction for us, to succeed in introducing the Treaty clause into environment protection law”.

“It is also gratifying that through this SOP, we will be able to maintain and improve opportunities for tangata whenua to contribute to the decision-making process through the establishment of a Maori advisory committee” said Mrs Katene.  
.  
“What does all this mean?” asked Mrs Katene.

“It means we are one step closer to understanding – and acting – in a way which upholds article two of Te Tiriti o Waitangi - "te tino rangatiratanga o ratou whenua o ratou kainga me o ratou taonga katoa" (chiefly authority over lands, villages and all things precious).
