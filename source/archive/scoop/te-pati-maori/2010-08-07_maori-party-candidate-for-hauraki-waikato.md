**Saturday 7 August 2010**

Maori Party Vice-President, Heta Hingston, has today announced the successful Maori Party candidate for the 2011 General Election is Tauhuia Bruce Mataki

'Bruce brings into the role, a distinguished career in the Defence Force, in Maori Business Development and in the agricultural sector" said Mr Hingston.

"He is proudly of Tainui waka, and knows the issues for whanau throughout the rohe, having worked closely with communities throughout South Auckland and Franklin Districts".

"Bruce brings with him a successful background in business and enterprise, which will be of great value to the team, as we consider strategies to advance Maori economic development" said Mr Hingston.

"It was a hotly contested campaign, with three excellent candidates" said Mr Hingston. "We thank Pia Searancke, Hemi Rau and their support teams for their commitment over the last month of hui held in Papakura, Pukekohe, Paeroa, Huntly and ending in Hamilton.

"I am humbled by the opportunity to serve the Maori Party in Hauraki Waikato" said incumbent candidate Bruce Mataki.

"I am a passionate supporter of the party and have a lot of energy for this new role. Hauraki Waikato is calling for a change - a fresh approach with someone completely focused on their local issues. I greatly look forward to the challenge of contesting the seat".
