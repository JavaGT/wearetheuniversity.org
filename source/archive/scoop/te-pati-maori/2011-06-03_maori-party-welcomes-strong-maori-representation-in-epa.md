**Maori Party welcomes strong Maori representation in EPA**

Environment Spokesperson for the Maori Party, Rahui Katene, has spoken out in support of the Board of the new Environmental Protection Authority.

“The Maori Party welcomes the particular appointment of Anake Goodall and Taria Tahana who bring a rich experience in Maori community development to the Authority”.

“Tangata whenua take very seriously , our responsibility to care for our environment as an expression of kaitiakitanga—the spiritual and cultural guardianship of Te Ao Mārama” said Mrs Katene.

“Mr Goodall, brings some 25 years of tribal development to the table, from driving the Ngai Tahu settlement through to its enactment and then consolidating that work in his role as Chief Executive of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu” said Mrs Katene. "He also brings with him considerable experience of the RMA in practical effect" _\[see Te Whakatau Kaupapa: Ngai Tahu Resource Management Strategy for the Canterbury region\]_

“Anake is in the unique position of having overseen crucial issues in environmental management and sustainable development at the local level – and more recently at the iwi leaders’ table”.

“Taria Tahana has a reputation as an entrepreneur, having experience across a range of social and economic platforms which I believe will bring a particular strength to a community wide approach to environmental protection.

“The Maori Party was pleased to support these two nominations.

We think it augurs well for the work of this new Authority that there is strong Maori representation on the Environmental Protection Authority; there will be a Maori statutory board established to give particular strength to this advice, and of course all parties are charged with the mandate to recognise and respect the Crown’s responsibility to take appropriate account of the Treaty of Waitangi, on account of the Treaty clause negotiated into the law by the Maori Party.
