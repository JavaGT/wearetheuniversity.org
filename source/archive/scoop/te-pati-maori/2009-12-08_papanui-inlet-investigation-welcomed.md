Papanui Inlet Investigation Welcomed

Rahui Katene, MP for Te Tai Tonga

Tuesday 8 December 2009

Local MP for Te Tai Tonga, Rahui Katene, is delighted at the initiative taken by Otakou runanga to investigate the viability of the Papanui Inlet being designated as a site of national significance.

“The Papanui Inlet is one of our remote natural havens, set within the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin” said Mrs Katene.  “There has been a great deal of excitement about recent discoveries, including the recent finding of a rare outrigger float – one of only three believed to be remaining in New Zealand”.

“Inkeeping with their kaitiakitanga responsibilities, Otakou runanga has suggested the area should be considered a heritage site of national significance”.

“Koiwi were discovered two years ago, and I believe other items which were over two hundred years old.  It may well be that there are other archaeological treasures waiting to be revealed, if there was the appropriate support from the Department of Conservation, and the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, amongst others, to do so”.

“The Maori Party commends the leadership of Otakou Runanga in calling together relevant stakeholders to commence discussions around the type of resources available to protect an area which will clearly be of special interest to Ngai Tahu and Kati Mamoe, but could also have precious historical value across the land”
