### Raihania wants te reo put at the core on the coast

Na Raihania is taking a bold approach to try and save the Maori language in Ikaroa Rawhiti by calling for it to be made a core subject at all high schools in the electorate, starting with those in Tairawhiti.

“Our country’s native language defines us as a unique people and a country yet it is under threat so we really have to stop mucking around and get serious if we are to ensure it doesn’t die on our watch,” the Maori Party candidate for Ikaroa Rawhiti said.

“Voluntary measures haven't worked. We need to give the language more mana in schools or at least in the first year and I think we should start doing that right now, right here in Turanganui and on the coast.

Mr Raihania said Tairawhiti was an ideal place to pilot his idea given it has a successful track record of hosting two prestigious traditional Maori performing arts events including Te Matatini, the stunning progress that has been made on various Ma Te Reo initiatives, almost half the population being Maori not to mention a Maori speaking Chinese Mayor.

“We have Maori language teachers at 36 of the 40 high schools in the electorate and by investing in and supporting them more, we can pave the way for the rest of the country.

“I’m confident that if we start piloting it here, the number of fluent speakers in this area will increase dramatically within the next five years. There’ll also be other benefits including more Maori youth achieving academically, socially and economically.

“We need to adopt the three RAR approach – reading, arithmetics and reo.”

Mr Raihania said his idea was in line with the aspirations of Te Paepae Motuhake – a report on the language launched in April.

“We must give life to that report and not allow it to sit on the shelf to gather dust. The Tairawhiti has a very proud history of educational achievements with the recent investiture of Sir Tamati Reedy, Dame Iritana Tawhiwhirangi and now Dame Katerina Mataira who are all dedicated to the advancement of the language.”

Mr Raihania said he would talk with Maori Party co-leader, and Associate Minister of Education, Dr Pita Sharples about piloting his idea and ask iwi leaders to press for a stronger case to develop ownership of the language in schools.

\"This is not about bashing people but more about being genuine in our belief that all schools have a responsibility to deliver high quality results by providing resources and training for teachers to deliver a well rounded curriculum."

At a Maori language media conference in Rotorua over the weekend, attended by Mr Raihania, there was a call for the language to be made compulsory in secondary schools. And that is a call which he believes will only grow stronger.
