Turia: Opening of Te Tai Hauauru Campaign
=========================================

**Press Release: [The Maori Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party)**

Opening of Te Tai Hauauru Campaign Launch

Awapuni School Hall; Palmerston North; Friday 19 August; 5.30

Tariana Turia, Member of Parliament for Te Tai Hauauru

E nga mana, e nga reo, Ngati Rangitaane, tena koutou katoa.

E nga iwi e huihui nei ki te whakanui i te kaupapa o te ra, tena koutou katoa. E nga rangatira o tenei rohe, e nga whanau, tena hoki koutou.

Ten days ago the world celebrated the International Day of the World's Indigenous People, announcing with it the start of the Second International Decade of the World's Indigenous People.

The launching of a second decade is unprecedented.

It calls the world to attention to recognize and protect the rights that are crucial to the survival and well-being of indigenous peoples as distinct cultures.

This is our time.

We must not let go of this opportunity, for once and for all, to shape our own political destiny.

As we have travelled the motu over this last year it has been as if the hunga wairua has been with us. Our old people have watched over us, guiding us in the journey to realising our potential.

We have heard the calling to 'walk the talk'.

We must never do what mainstream politicians have done to our people, turning their backs on tangata whenua with the excuse that it is not in the interests of 'middle' New Zealanders.

The Maori Party is standing up to be counted for those in the middle, those at the bottom, those at the top, and those around the outside.

Marketing experts would tell us - it's from the edge that the best ideas come.

We believe in justice and in fairness for all.

That means that regardless of the ability to pay there will be opportunities for everyone to be successful to the highest levels of their potential.

Justice for all means there will be timely access to high quality and appropriate health care.

Being fair in Government means you don't discriminate against beneficiaries - or worse yet - the children of beneficiaries.

The Social Report revealed that 43% of children in sole parent households live with an income considered to be at the poverty level.

In real numbers, that is 300,000 children living below the poverty line in New Zealand.

300,000 children who are not currently enjoying the benefits of a buoyant economy:

\- Nutritious food;

\- Warm clothing;

\- Adequate housing which is not damp, overcrowded or cold;

\- Health care, including after hours care when necessary;

\- Education - with opportunity to participate in extra-curricula options.

It is time to get real about the 1.9 million people in this country who have a taxable income of $25,000 or less. Collectively, they pay $3.6 billion in taxation while the government will be running surpluses of between $4 billion and $7 billion for each of the next four years. People who earn $25,000 and less must get a significant reduction in their tax.

The Maori Party will not allow this ongoing deprivation to go unchallenged.

Do you want justice for all peoples, to be well-educated, healthy and participating?

Do you want to be part of building a strong society? Make your own decisions? Be independent of the state?

It's worth taking the risk for.

We must never ever give absolute power again to National or Labour.

We have risen up to say we will not be ignored, neglected or trivialised by either party ever again.

We can be your insurance for the future. We are your independent voice. We will speak up against injustice, and we will together create a better future for us all.

The Maori Party is looking forward to sharing our policy highlights over the next month.

We will be announcing policy solutions in the following areas:

Health - we know that Health is a right not a privilege. We will be introducing our approach to ensure that we focus on keeping well - ensuring that all people are entitled to goldstar access and referral to primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare.

Education : we believe that education is the greatest investment in the future of our nation. We will be announcing our approach to ensure that every child that leaves primary school will be able to read, to write, to count, to speak, to think with confidence; - and to be motivated to stay on to free tertiary education for all New Zealanders, with a liveable allowance for students.

Employment and Training: we will seek ongoing support to nurture the potential in all students and trainees, through improved access to trade training and apprenticeships, cadetships, and lifting the minimum wage.

Reducing Poverty: We will call on the tax system and the budget surplus to reduce poverty and invest in people.

Te Tiriti o Waitangi : The Maori Party will ensure that the Treaty of Waitangi remains as the founding constitutional document of our nation. Te Tiriti o Waitangi affirms our rangatiratanga, our mana over our resources and our people.

Environment : we must demonstrate our ability to take care of our whenua, our moana, our natural environment, and put a stop to the the raft of interventions sanctioned by the current Government - including the sand mining along the West Coast, and pollution of waterways. We will never forget the devastation of land confiscation through the foreshore and seabed bill.

Whanau: Whanau First is our key message for the nation.

We want our elders to be respected, supported and assisted to continue to play a vital role in all of our lives.

We want our parents to be valued for their essential parenting role.

We want all members of the family to play a significant role in shaping the world of their children.

We want our children to be healthy, well-educated and fulfilling their potential, growing up secure in who they are.

We want a future where all people can stand tall and proud, confident in their own cultural strength, and participating in all aspects of society.

The only party that is committed to tatou te iwi Maori is the Maori Party.

The Maori Party will secure the Maori seats ake tonu and build a more positive future for all of us.

A vote for the Maori Party is a vote for more Maori in Parliament representing you.

Your party vote is critical for a strong and independent voice in Parliament.

The people of Te Tai Hauauru are a constant source of inspiration to me - and indeed the Maori Party.

The seventeen iwi within this rohe are known for your courage, your strength when facing adversity, your determination and passion for standing up for whanau, hapu and iwi.

We have had enough of being controlled and constrained by the direction others have set for us.

We have had enough of being told what others can do for us, what putea can be suddenly available in the pre-election frenzy of campaigning.

The Maori Party is not here to take part in a lolly scramble.

We know the real sweetener is within our own power.

It's what we can do, together, for the future of this country

If you want to vote for independence, the freedom to be recognized as tangata whenua, the choice to be well-educated, healthy, valuing matauranga Maori; the right to be respected, then let's vote for the Party that will advance our people's aspirations in the most powerful way,

Ko tenei te wa. Enrol to vote!

Change politics for ever for the future of our rangatahi and tamariki.

Bring our rangatahi along with you - in this city only 54% of voters aged between 18 to 24 have enrolled to vote - our big challenge now for Palmerston North is to get that other 46% on the roll!

Don't waste your vote on a major party.

Because they will vote against you when the chips are down.

And finally, a vote for the Maori Party is a vote of trust in yourselves. Tena koutou, tena koutou, tena tatou katoa.

ENDS
