Rangatahi take on the World Hip-Hop Championships 2007

Te Ururoa Flavell, Member of Parliament for Waiariki

Tuesday 7 August 2007

"Our rangatahi are not only fearless - they are world show-stoppers as well" said Waiariki MP, Te Ururoa Flavell upon hearing the news that Rotorua hip-hop group, Fearless, was placed third at the World Hip-Hop championships in Los Angeles.

Hip Hop Crews from throughout the World competed at the World Hip Hop Championships which were held on 29th July on Redondo Beach in California.

"You can't get much better than this" enthused Flavell. "Crews from more than thirty nations across the globe came together for the world championship, and our kids come home with the bronze!"

"Over one thousand street performers did their thing, and it was our very own 'Fearless' that put Aotearoa on the map, again". In 2006 Aotearoa entered the World Championship for the first time with Auckland-based crew DZIAH coming second.

"This is the international premier event for hip hop" said Flavell. "As we think about the theme of the World's Indigenous Day which falls this Thursday (9 August) it couldn't be better timing to celebrate this outstanding group of rangatahi".

The theme for the 2007 International Day of the World's Indigenous People is 'honouring indigenous youth'.

"It does the heart good to think about just how awesome our kids are" said Flavell. "And a big mihi too, to all the whanau who have been fearless in their fund-raising and their tautoko to support their rangatahi on to the world stage".
