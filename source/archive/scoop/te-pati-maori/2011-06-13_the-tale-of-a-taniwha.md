**The tale of a Taniwha**

I have been intrigued by the debate currently going on about Horotiu the Taniwha in Auckland. Not because of the revelation itself, but rather, the reaction by New Zealanders to its existence.

The taniwha, may or may not reside under the streets of Auckland. That particular question, is not mine to answer. What I will say, however, is that my understanding – from a Maori world view - is that the presence of a taniwha denotes that care needs to be taken. As a kaitiaki (or guardian) the taniwha signals to all…..kia tupato!

To me, the tale of the taniwha is important because it encapsulates the cultural struggle faced by us as a bicultural nation. It cuts to the heart of debates around traditional knowledge, and more specifically matauranga Maori.

It is about the way in which Maori have shaped our understanding of the world. It’s about our epistemologies, our knowledge base, and the way in which we choose to articulate our understanding of the world around us, in a Maori way.

The taniwha and the Auckland railway line really represents a conflict that is centuries old. Kaitiakitanga versus kawanatanga; matauranga Maori versus matauranga Pakeha; Rangatiratanga versus Whakahaere(-tanga). These are just some of the tensions and challenges that we face as a bi-cultural nation; and some of the key areas of struggle in which Maori engage in search of equality as a culture, and as a people within Aotearoa.

Within these many intersecting issues, I really want to focus on one specific area of development which is close to my heart - that is raising the bar for awareness and understanding by New Zealanders of our Maori cultural values, processes and knowledge. In other words demystifying the ‘taniwha’.

This week past, I was pleased to be receiving the report produced by the Maori Youth Council, whose policy recommendations to Government provided a rangatahi perspective on how we can address rangatahi issues and aspirations.

The Maori Youth Council put forward some impressive ideas. They reminded me of why I and other Maori parents back in the 80’s invested so much hard work into Kaupapa Maori education. So that one day, our kids would stand in front of Governments and tell them (now us!) what they need to grow up happy and healthy as Maori citizens of the world.

There were many challenges laid down by the Council, one of which was that all teachers should learn Te Reo Maori. This particular point is closely aligned to another programme that I have been working on, Tataiako cultural competency standards for teachers, the details of which will be coming out in the future weeks.

Tataiako builds on the successful elements of Te Kotahitanga which has helped lift Maori student achievement in mainstream schools. It is about teaching teachers to better understand and engage with their students. It does not go as far as making Te Reo Maori compulsory, but does provide some pathways for understanding and working with Maori students, whanau and communities.

This is a wonderful initiative, and one which I think will go a long way to raising the rate of Maori student achievement. Cultural competency is one of the key success factors of Kaupapa Maori, not just as a system of education, but as a philosophy, a methodology, and a practice.

We must do something for the 54% of Maori kids leaving school before the age of 17. We must engage them, and for me, the solution is to build an environment that embraces their culture, their knowledge, and their sense of what is ‘normal’ and what is ‘right’.

I’m not picking on teachers at all – I am recognising the critical role they play in supporting the development and growth of our next generation, and I want to arm them with more tools to create more and more ‘Maori citizens of the world.’ Of course, this would happen with the support of the wider whanau, and community, who also need to be armed (arā Whanau Ora).

The point is that we all need to recognise and respect cultural difference. Discrimination can be subtle or innocent, but the point is, it can do some real damage, especially to our kids. So, whether its making fun of a taniwha, growling a kid for their spelling (especially kids who have come from Kohanga or Kura), or whatever, we need to make sure that our Maori kids are treated with respect within their own understandings of normal.

So to me, the taniwha in Auckland, and the reaction to it, highlights our need to raise our cultural awareness, respect and tolerance.  
Our Maori knowledge is not a joke, nor is it a problem. It is, however, different. And one day, I hope to live in a country that not only tolerates difference, but embraces it – that is the Aotearoa for the future.
