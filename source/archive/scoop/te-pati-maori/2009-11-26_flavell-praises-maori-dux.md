Flavell praises Maori dux

Maori Party education spokesperson Te Ururoa Flavell has commended Kataraina Faiers and Jamaika Anderson for being awarded the 2009 dux at St Joseph's Maori Girls College.

“It makes me so proud to see our rangatahi achieving in education and I take my hat off to Kataraina and Jamaika for persisting and achieving a high level of education excellence,” Mr Flavell said.

At 17-years-old, Kataraina (Te Arawa, Ngati Whatua, Tainui, Ngapuhi) plans to study a Bachelor of Applied Science and Bachelor of Business (conjoint) at Auckland University of Technology next year.

At the same age, Jamaika (Taranaki) intends to go to Victoria University to study a Bachelor of Laws.

Kataraina is a third generation student at St Joseph’s following in the footsteps of her grandmothers (one of whom was the dux in 1951) and her aunties.

“The whanau of these young ladies must also be congratulated because they have all had an influence on their development.

“I wish them both the best on her endeavors in a field where there is a need for more Maori.”
