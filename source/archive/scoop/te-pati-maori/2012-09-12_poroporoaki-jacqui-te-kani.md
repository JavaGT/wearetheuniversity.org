**Poroporoaki - Jacqui Te Kani**  
**Wednesday 12 September 2012**  
  
**Hon Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party**

E te kuia rangatira e Jacqui, takoto mai, takoto mai, moe mai ra. E kore o mahi e wareware, to kaha, to manawanui ki te atawhai i to iwi. Haere ra, haere ra, haere ra.

Huri noa i te motu, kua tangi nga reo o nga iwi, o nga marae, o nga kainga ki te mate rongonui o te wa!

Co-leader of the Māori Party, Tariana Turia, has extended her sympathies to the whānau, hapū and iwi of Jacqui Te Kani who passed away last night in Wellington Hospital (Tuesday 11 September).

“Jacqui has lived a life of absolute devotion to the people and she will be sadly missed throughout the motu” said Mrs Turia.

Jacqui Te Kani (CNZM) was Past National President of Te Roopu Wahine Māori Toko i te Ora (1999-2002) and held the position of General Manager of the Māori Women’s Welfare League.

“Her influence and her contribution across many sectors has been profound” said Mrs Turia.

“Jacqui had a particular focus on social and economic development for wahine Māori and was a trustee of the Māori Women’s Development Inc and a member of Te Korowai Wahine for the Ministry of Women’s Affairs”.

“Her interest also extended to language and broadcasting. Jacqui served as Chair of Te Māngai Paho, was a member of Te Putahi Paoho (Māori Television Electoral College) and also a member of Te Huarahi Tika Trust”.

“But she didn’t stop there. Jacqui was one of those people whom seemed to have an irrepressible enthusiasm for doing more. Other responsibilities she took up included as a member of the Māori Education Trust; on the Māori Committee to the Law Commission; on Te Roopu Manaaki for the Sport and Recreation Council and the Children’s Rights Sector Advisory Group – just to name a few”.

“Jacqui has served Aotearoa well – she has made every moment count; and leaves behind a legacy of service that will be recognised in every sphere of our community”.

“At this time, however, our greatest sadness is with her mother, her children, her mokopuna, her wider whānau who will feel so deeply the loss of a woman who has made a profound impression in all of their lives. My aroha is with them all, as they bid farewell to a beloved daughter and sister; a remarkable mother, aunty, grandmother, kuia and role-model”.

_Jacqui Te Kani will be taken to the Maori Women’s Welfare League (24 Burnell Avenue, Thorndon) on Wednesday, hoping to arrive mid-day. She will lie there for the night. First thing Thursday morning she will depart for Mangatu Marae, Whatatutu, where she will lie until her burial on Saturday mid-morning at Mangatu._
