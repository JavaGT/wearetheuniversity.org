**New funding sees Whanau Ora go nationwide**

A $30 million boost to the Whanau Ora programme will see it go nationwide, in every rohe throughout the country.

“The momentum over this innovative approach to social service delivery is growing and we’re really pleased that the new money will enable eight new provider groups to join the first wave of 25 providers which started last year,” Maori Party co-leader Tariana Turia said.

“The Whanau Ora approach is all about helping whanau to support themselves and we want to see it in every community throughout this country.”

"We are confident that the investment we are making now, will ensure there is nationwide coverage by Whanau Ora providers to address the higher than anticipated demand for whanau-centred services” said Mrs Turia.

The new providers are based in Kaipara, Hauraki, South Waikato, Taupo/Turangi, Palmerston North, Wairarapa, Levin/Kapiti Coast and Murihiku.
