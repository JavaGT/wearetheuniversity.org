MP welcomes dual naming of South Island landmarks

**MP welcomes dual naming of South Island landmarks**

It is very significant that Environnment Canterbury has formally endorsed dual Maori and English names for many key landmarks in Te Waipounamu, says local MP Rahui Katene.

“Place names link people to the landscape, and this decision recognises our dual cultural heritage in Te Waipounamu,” says Mrs Katene.

“The names keep alive iwi history, and the memory of ancestors, and the distinct place of tangata whenua in the world,” she says.

“In the case of Kai Tahu, our distinctive dialect is reflected in names like Aoraki, Waitaki, Moukatere and Ka Tiritiri o te Moana – where other iwi typically use ‘ng’ instead of a ‘k’. This decision lends valuable support and encouragement to the iwi’s efforts to bring our reo back into everyday use.

“The decision will make little practical difference, because dual names have already been widely used by the regional council. However it is very significant because formal endorsement means we are using the names as of right, and not on the whim of others.

“So I congratulate Environment Canterbury on taking this step, and I look forward to other councils in Te Waipounamu following suit,” says Mrs Katene.
