**Māori Party announces list**

The Māori Party is excited to announce its list for the 2017 General Election.

"We have a diverse list of 26 talented candidates with links across the Pacific who are all dedicated to mana motuhake and the benefits that can bring Aotearoa,” said Māori Party president Tukoroirangi Morgan.

“We’re excited with the new energy that our fresh talent are instilling in not just our party but the mana Māori, mana Pacifica movement.”

“The pool of talent and skill across the entire list of candidates made the task of finalising the party rankings an extremely difficult and challenging one.

“We have 17 brilliant women and 9 men in our line-up, from all walks of life and across all professions including a matāpule, several small business owners, a qualified lawyer, a librarian, a caregiver, a beekeeper and much much more.

“I am particularly proud of our young wahine Te Waka McLeod, Tasha Hohaia, Carrie Stoddart-Smith, Karen Williams and Mele Pepa as well as our sole Asian candidate Wetex Kang, for stepping up to the mark and believing they can win.”

The party’s co-leaders are at the top of the list with standing MP and Ikāroa Rāwhiti candidate Marama Fox at one and the incumbent MP for Waiariki, Te Ururoa Flavell, at two.

“Every day for the past three years Marama has led, walked, talked and breathed the strong independent Māori voice that is the Māori Party.

“She has made sure that the government and the nation doesn’t forget, and are constantly reminded, about the plight of our Māori people and why they need to take kaupapa Māori solutions more seriously to tackle some of the toughest issues facing our country such as poverty, homelessness and high incarceration rates.

“Te Ururoa is the backbone of our party. He has been doing the business for us behind the scenes and at the table, securing hundreds of millions of dollars for kaupapa Māori and putting up the arguments for us with the relevant ministers when we disagree with them. The public doesn't see that but we do," said Mr Morgan.

Mr Flavell said there was no more deserving of the top place than Marama.

“She truly is a mana wahine. I’ve seen her juggle 9 children, several select committees, nationwide roadshows and be a voice and beacon of hope for thousands of disadvantaged whanau. She’s amazing and that’s why we need everyone to party vote Māori Party.”
