Sending our support to the victims and their loved ones

**Sending our support to the victims and their loved ones in Orlando**

The Māori Party sends its aroha to the many people who will be shattered by the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

“While we are thousands of miles away, we want the whānau who have lost loved ones or have been injured by this despicable act that our hearts are with you,” says Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox.

At least 50 people were killed and more than 50 people were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.

Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell says the party wants to extend its sympathies to the gay, lesbian and transgender community who are calling for an end to gun violence and homophobia.

“We must all strive for a more tolerant society where the human rights of every individual are respected. We support the call for love and unity at a time where it would be easier to resort to hate,” he says.

E moe mai rā e ngā tini mate kua haere ki tua o te ārai. Haere, haere, haere atu rā.

ENDS
