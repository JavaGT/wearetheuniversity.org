Waiariki MP congratulates Tuhoe festival participants  
Te Ururoa Flavell - 8 April 2009

The MP for Waiariki - Te Ururoa Flavell - is congratulating Ngai Tuhoe for their remarkable record of holding festivals which have kept the iwi's traditions alive and relevant for the tribes young and old alike.

"The Ahurei or Tuhoe festival will be held at Ruatoki this weekend and if things run as normal about 15-thousand people will pass through the gates over the three days", says Mr Flavell.

"The first festival was organised 39 years ago by a group which included such Tuhoe luminaries as Boy Biddle and the late John Rangihau, and the aim was to bring urbanised Tuhoe back home to their roots. Well it's certainly done that."

"This weekend will see Tuhoe from around the motu competing in twenty different teams in kapa haka, debates and sports."

"The Ahurei used to be held annually but it simply got too big and came round very quickly so now it's held every two years. It is a remarkable example of an iwi getting its people together, renewing whakapapa links and just plain celebrating their Tuhoetanga. I intend being there and so will many, many other non-Tuhoe - it's such a great occasion" says Mr Flavell.
