he Hon Tariana Turia

Maori Party Co-Leader | MP for Te Tai Hauauru

4 November 2011

Co-leader of the Maori Party and MP for Te Tai Hauauru is delighted at the announcement that Hinerangi Raumati has been named interim chairperson of Parininihi ki Waitotara Inc, Fonterra’s largest Taranaki supplier.

“This is an inspired appointment which reflects the significant investment and financial management and governance experience that Hinerangi will bring to the position” said Mrs Turia.

Hinerangi was the Chief Financial Officer of Tainui Group Holdings Limited from 2002 to 2009 and was previously Deputy Chair and Chair of the Investment Committee of Trust Waikato.

  
”Hinerangi has done the ‘hard yards’ – she has proven herself in many challenging roles, and has established an impressive reputation as director of Te Ohu Kai Moana Portfolio management services; chair of the Nga Miro Health Trust; and of course, the first woman to be appointed to the board of the largest land owner and milk-solids producer in Taranaki.

“The Maori Party extends our warm congratulations to Hinerangi and wishes her well in such a significant appointment”.
