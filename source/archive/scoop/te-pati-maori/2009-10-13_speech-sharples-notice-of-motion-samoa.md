Notice of Motion: Samoa  
Tuesday 13 October 2009; 2.20pm  
Hon Dr pita sharples; Co-leader of the Maori Party

Tena tatou te whare nei

Matou te manatua pea aiga Pasefika o loo mafatia i nei taimi faigata.

Ua tiga faatasi o matou loto mo outou.

O loo maligi pea o matou loimata, ona o le faaleagaina o outou eleele ma e umi se taimi o matou lagona faatasi le tiga ma outou.

We think of our Pacific families at this traumatic time.

Our hearts have bled with yours.

Our tears flow at the loss of lives, the damage to your lands, the sadness that will last for months and years ahead.

When the news broke, just under a fortnight ago, that an 8.3 magnitude earthquake had struck Samoa, and a subsequent tsunami was observed, it took some time to sink in.

As the cabled photographs became relayed over wire, and we saw the ferocious six metre waves crashing down, the full extent of the disaster became known.

Today we join with others in the House to bow our heads in the profound grief we all feel as we pay our respects to the 184 people who lost their lives that day, in Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga.

In split seconds, twenty villages were completely destroyed; families were torn apart; loved ones ripped from each other.

Even now, there are several hundred people still nursing injuries; over 15, 000 people have been directly affected by this tragic twist of fate.

But it is the long term trauma that is starting to take hold now.

These are people who for centuries have lived on the coastline; suddenly homeless; and dealing with the devastating wreckage left behind.

Some have fled to the bush and have still not come out.

I remember with love, Tui Annandale, a dear friend, wife of Joe who was lost in the village of Poutasi.

Others are focused on the funerals that are still occurring but have no idea what next. One family in Lalomanu buried nine members from four different generations, from ages 2 to 97 years – the human cost of which will never be able to be measured.

For many it will be a long, painful journey to rebuild lives, to restore Samoa to the island paradise they know it to be.

The Maori Party extends our deepest sympathies to all of the families who will keep replaying in their minds, the fate they suffered that day.

This last Sunday – White Sunday – is the time when children are celebrated; when the possibilities of the next generation give reason for great joy.

But this year’s ceremonies were marred by the grief of the 9000 children affected by the tsunami; at least two thousand of which are thought to be displaced.

But perhaps the most incredible thing of all is that in the midst of such devastation, hope is still able to be found.

And we in the Maori Party want to place on record our utter admiration for all those courageous souls who have the strength of character to remake their world around them.

This last fortnight has shown some amazing examples of the human spirit at its best.

Who could forget the young boy searching for his relatives, motivated by his commitment to ensure each one was buried in dignity?

Or families who uprooted themselves to help those who need it most – those communities fighting through the chaos of rubble to be able to reconstruct sanitation facilities, access to clean water, shelter and protection from the elements.

We want to also acknowledge the fierce sense of pride all New Zealanders must have in the way in which this nation has responded.

There’s a gutsy Wellington ten year old, Abby Wutzler, who ran the length of the beach at Lalomanu, warning holidaymakers to head for the hills away from the tsunami.

There’s the Disaster Victims Identification specialists; the New Zealand Police; Royal New Zealand Airforce personnel, grief counsellors, infectious disease specialists; doctors, nurses; - a literal army of support which has dropped everything to help.

Theatre nurse Debbie Ratima summed it up – “these people need our help and so that’s something you prepare yourself for and get stuck in and help”.

A group of Samoan community leaders in Auckland has also got stuck in to help – including former all black, Laauli Michael Jones; Judge Ida Malosi; David Tua; Tuigamala Inga Tuigamala and others.

Indeed the reaction of Samoan and Tongan communities in Aotearoa has been legendary in their immediate expression of whakawhanaungatanga, to care for their loved ones back on the island.

It is times like this when we truly feel part of the Pacific village – and we must do all we can to care for our neighbours.

We must rebuild homes and infrastructure – and the six million dollars given to help recovery efforts is a vital part of that.

But equally important are the ten containers of donated goods from Samoan and Tongan communities in Auckland, the fifteen pallets of supplies for Tonga; and the supplies and equipment that all of our donations can help to provide.

Finally, as tangata whenua we express our deepest sadness for our Pasifika cousins, whom we are bound to by the Pacific Ocean; by common whakapapa; and by a powerful sense of connection.

Our prayers and our love go to the people of Samoa, and of Tonga.

O le a matou tatalo ma alolofa atu mo outou uma i Samoa ma Toga.

Faamalolosi pea ma loto toa, ma ia outou mautinoa o loo matou manatua pea outou.

ENDS
