Notice of Motion: Appointment of Assistant Speaker

Notice of Motion: Appointment of Assistant Speaker 'That Hon Marian Leslie Hobbs be appointed Assistant Speaker'

Te Ururoa Flavell, Member of Parliament for Waiariki

Tuesday 4 March 2008

Tena koe Madam Speaker, tena tatou katoa.

When this Notice of Motion appeared on the Order Paper, I noticed an increased interest in the proceedings of the House, from the honourable Member for Te Tai Tokerau, Mr Hone Harawira.

As someone who enthusiastically studies Standing Orders, Standing Order 30 really got him going.

It describes the criteria for the appointment of an Assistant Speaker as being limited only by the constraints that no member who is the leader of a party, or who holds the office as whip, are able to be appointed to this role.

In the case of the Maori Party, that meant we only had one potential nominee for the role - Mr Hone Harawira.

And so I come to this debate today, obviously disappointed that the expertise of Mr Harawira has been overlooked - but also, on behalf of the Maori Party to express our best wishes to the Honourable Marian Hobbs for the opportunity to hold office during the remaining term of Parliament.

In doing so, I do want to also convey our appreciation to Ann Hartley, for the contribution she brought to the Chamber as she negotiated, cajoled, conducted and directed the proceedings of this House.

We wish her every success in her role as a North Shore City Councillor. Her experience both as a former Mayor of Birkenhead, and the last eight years in national politics, will no doubt be of huge benefit to regional politics and we wish her and her whanau well.

Madam Speaker, regarding this Notice of Motion, the Maori Party is happy to support the proposal for Marian Hobbs to take on the role of Assistant Speaker.

It is always interesting for me, as a former school Principal, to see the influence of educationalists in this chamber.

As I understand it, Marian has been involved in playcentre management, has been a Principal of Girls Colleges in Christchurch and Wellington, has been a Co-Founder of the alternative education centre of Four Avenues; has been on the Canterbury University Council and countless community ventures.

I believe that presiding over the debate in this Chamber will pretty come as a breeze to anyone who has been charged with motivating secondary school students to stay awake during class.

Madam Speaker, we've watched Marian working alongside Mark Blumsky on Wellington issues - such as the Karori Sanctuary - and hope that the capacity to put aside party political positions will be a priority for her role as Assistant Speaker.

We hope too, that the varied life experiences she brings to the floor - including her association with the Chippenham commune and the Quaker Movement - will be influential in encouraging peaceful and respectful debate in this House.

Tena koe Marian. Nei ra nga mihi o te törangapü Maori ki a koe kua eke ki tënei o nga taumata o te Whare Paremata. Maku a Hone Harawira e korero, kia tau tana wairua, kia ngäwari ai te ngau o mamae na tana kore whiwhi i tera o nga turu. Kia kaha ra.

Congratulations Marian. We of the Maori Party wish you well having achieved this significant role in Parliament. I will speak to Hone, settle him down, ease his pain at having not achieved the position. Best of luck.

Finally, Madam Speaker, I want to use this opportunity to welcome the new List MP to this Chamber, Louisa Hareruia Wall

Ko Tongariro te maunga Ko Taupo te moana Ko Tutemohuta te hapu Ko Pakira te marae Ko Ngati Tuwharetoa te iwi Ko Te Heuheu te tangata.
