Palmerston North Showgrounds Act Repeal Bill  
Wednesday 22 September 2009; 4.40pm  
Rahui Katene, MP for Te Tai Tonga

  
There was a fifty percent chance that Ngati Kauwhata would be heard, would be heeded, would be respected in this Palmerston North Showgrounds Act repeal Bill.

After all there were only two submissions received in all – one that offered support and one that opposed; so the probability that the sun would shine on Ngati Kauwhata was high.

Such high stakes were inevitably helped by the compelling evidence provided in their submission.

And I want to take a rather unusual step of repeating a key statement from their submission for the benefit of the House. Ngati Kauwhata said that they, and I quote:

“must continue in our responsibilities as tangata whenua to protect the land and natural resources of our district.

To do this, we must object to and make others aware of the stealth that the Crown and their Agents, Local Government, will use to keep Ngati Kauwhata marginalised from their lands and in poor health to forever keep them dependent on the Crown as beneficiaries, and therefore to be slandered by those who seek power within the Crown’s structures”.

These are strong words; words which underline the passion and the responsibility that Ngati Kauwhata uphold in protecting their history and preserving their heritage.

They stand by the contention that Ngati Kauwhata did not sell interests in the Te Ahu-turanga block. Ngati Kauwhata believe instead that the land was taken by stealth and devious purchasing practices by the Crown and its Agents.

Ngati Kauwhata claim that the land is part of the Te Ahu-turanga block, taken from them by proclamation and is subject to two Waitangi Tribunal claims (WAI 784 and 972).  
There is also another new claim, WAI 1461 regarding the Rangitikei Manawatu Block. This is a conjoint claim between Ngati Kauwhata, Ngati Raukawa, and all of the te reureu iwi.

This is the history of Treaty injustices and contemporary breaches that the Select Committee heard.

But the Select Committee chose a different history.

The Local Government and Environment Select Committee opted to favour the history presented by the Palmerston North City Council which supports the bill on the grounds that the relevant land and most other assets are already owned by the council, and the council has effectively managed the showgrounds over the last two years.

This same committee was privy to the expert advice of Public Health Champion; Ngati Kauwhata member; and Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Māori) at Massey University - Professor Mason Durie.

Professor Durie’s analysis of course includes the conclusion that a lack of access to tribal land must be woven into explanations of the chronic poor health status of Maori.

Mr Speaker, Ngati Kauwhata were not asking for the world.

They wanted just to be a part of the overall governance, part of the process of managing the land that was taken from them.

They humbly requested that the Bill be delayed until they were able to determine the status of the land in respect of ownership, and the implications of the Treaty claims over it.

In considering the views of Ngati Kauwhata, the select committee has determined that any Waitangi Tribunal investigation can have no effect on the land in question given its status as private land.

With all due respect, I would suggest the select committee is not the appropriate body to make such pronouncements.

If Ngati Kauwhata believe they have the right to at least have the land in question considered as part of their claim, that is something for the Waitangi Tribunal to investigate, consider and determine – not the select committee.

Mr Speaker when the government purchased the Te Ahu-turanga block from Rangitane in 1864, it noted that there was some dispute between Rangitane and neighbouring iwi about ownership at the time.

145 years later –and this Bill could have been an excellent opportunity to face the dispute in the light of day, for once and for all.

Instead the select committee chose to ignore the dispute; to ignore the strongly held views of Ngati Kauwhata; and to effect the transfer of the management and control of the land of the showgrounds from the Board to the Palmerston North City Council.

The showgrounds will now be fully managed and controlled by the City Council as a recreation site.

The council’s submission to select committee does not discuss any consultation that they may have had or not had with local iwi, including Ngati Kauwhata.

While it appears this legislation is not a problematic change for Rangitane; it is utterly evident that there are longstanding and outstanding issues for Ngati Kauwhata.

The Maori Party believes we can not make any progress in this Palmerston North Showgrounds Act repeal Bill while this dispute is still manifest.

We will oppose this Bill.
