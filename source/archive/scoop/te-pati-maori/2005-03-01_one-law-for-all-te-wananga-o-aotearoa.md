One Law for All: Te Wananga o Aotearoa

Tariana Turia, Co-leader, Maori Party; 1 March 2005

The Government's proposal that Te Wananga o Aotearoa 'stick to its knitting' and in effect close its doors to Pakeha, Pasifika and other non-Maori students is extra-ordinary, on a day when the Prime Minister has declared at the Hui Taumata: "We know that working together we can build a society in which Maori, along with all New Zealanders, have a firm stake".

"Clearly that stake for Maori can only be planted in Maori contexts - and is not part of the vision for the nation that tangata whenua and non-Maori alike, have shared with us", said Tariana Turia, co-leader of the Maori Party.

"We truly believe in the message from another keynote speaker at that hui, Moana Maniapoto, that the power and strength of tangata whenua resonates around the nation, and indeed the world"

"We believe the wonder of Maori should not be ghettoised under restricted charters, but should instead be shared with all those who want to take up an opportunity to learn".

"It strikes me as somewhat bizarre that for years, Maori studies has been included as part of the core curriculum for all students in mainstream institutions - schools, polytechnics, universities. In these institutions, all students have been entitled to increase their knowledge and understanding of things Maori".

"Yet now that Te Wananga o Aotearoa is operating so successfully, the Government has suddenly decided it must restrict its focus to Maori needs and Maori education".
