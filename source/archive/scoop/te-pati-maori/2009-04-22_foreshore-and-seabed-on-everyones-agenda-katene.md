Foreshore and Seabed on Everyone’s Agenda - Katene
==================================================

Foreshore and Seabed on Everyone’s Agenda says Rahui Katene  
Maori Party Foreshore and Seabed spokesperson 21 April 2009

Maori Party Foreshore and Seabed spokesperson Rahui Katene reports that the review of the Foreshore and Seabed Act has been receiving strong audience interest, in the various hui she has attended.

“The Foreshore and Seabed Ministerial Review Panel this week began holding hui around the country to hear from people interested in keeping, repealing or amending the Act,” said Mrs Katene.

“In the meantime, Maori Party MPs have been making use of the Parliamentary recess to travel around the country talking to constituents, reporting back and seeking input for matters that are before the Parliament - including the Foreshore and Seabed review,” she said.

“The Review Panel started in Bluff on Monday, is in Christchurch today and Wellington tomorrow.

Mrs Katene clarified that there is a clear difference between the hui being held as part of the Ministerial Review Panel, and the hui that are part of the regular feedback loop valued by the Maori Party.

Mrs Katene said, "We want people to participate in the review, and we also want them to be quite clear about the difference between the two rounds of hui.

“The review panel is being chaired by retired Judge Taihakurei Durie and will be holding 21 hui round the country between now and the 19th of May. And while the review is taking place under the agreement between the Maori Party and the National Party, it is an independent appraisal of the Foreshore and Seabed Act with input from the public," she said.

"In the meantime as part of the Maori Party’s commitment to reporting back to our people, our MPs have been traveling round the country doing just that, and talking about issues of the day including the review, the question of which flag to fly next Waitangi Day, and giving us some input on how we should vote on the legislation before Parliament to get tougher on gangs and organised crime."

“It’s a busy time – but it’s fantastic to see the level of engagement that is out there, about such a critical issue.
