Maori Party praises Waikato Regional Council

Tau Bruce Mataki Maori Party Candidate for Hauraki-Waikato

Friday 28 October 2011

Maori Party candidate for Hauraki-Waikato, Tau Mataki, has praised the Waikato Regional Council for their decision to adopt two Maori seats for the upcoming 2013 local Government elections.

"This is a great decision by the Waikato Regional Council. Sometimes it takes real courage to do the right thing and Peter Buckley (Chairman of the Council) and his council deserve all the praise in the world" said Mataki.

"It is invigorating to think that in my own rohe, we will have dedicated Maori seats within two years. Whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori throughout Waikato whanui are better for it" said Mataki.

"I'm sure the decision made today was made a little easier by the successful establishment of the Statutory Board for the Auckland City Council, a statutory board the Maori Party fought long and hard to get" said Mataki.

"Maori ma, the council has offered the hand of manaakitanga to us and we have a real opportunity to repay the faith shown to us by really engaging with local Government. There are no excuses anymore" said Mataki.
