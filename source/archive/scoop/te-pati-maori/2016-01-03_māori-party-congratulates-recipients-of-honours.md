**31 December 2015**

The Māori Party commends all the 2016 New Year Honour’s recipients including tāngata whenua who have committed themselves to their work and serving their communities.

The Māori Party is thrilled Robin Hapi, former Chief Executive of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission has also been acknowledged for his services to Māori, the community and governance. He has been awarded a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit.

“Mr Hapi is a remarkable and influential man, who has had an extensive career in economic development. He most notably has been a driving force in developing systems to allocate fishing assets to iwi,” says Māori Party Co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell.

Te Aroha Paenga receives a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for her dedication to the preservation and teaching of te reo Māori.

“She has been an outstanding stalwart for the preservation of our language. Alongside Sir Pita Sharples they established one of the first Kōhanga Reo at Hoani Waititi Marae and has since dedicated herself to fostering te reo among our younger generation,” says Mr Flavell.

List MP based in Ikaroa-Rāwhiti Marama Fox is elated that Archbishop William Brown Tūrei has been awarded an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to the Anglican Church.

“He is an inspirational leader who at the age of 90 continues to serve the Anglican Church. I admire his fearless nature. He provokes topical discussions including whether New Zealand can fulfil a Treaty of Waitangi promise to live as one people. He also spoke out about the 2007 Police raid, calling on the Government and Police to apologies to Ngāi Tūhoe and Ruatoki,” she says.

Ex-Navy diver Te Uranga O Te Ra Tuwhakairiora Tuhaka has been awarded a Queen’s Service Medal.

“We will never forget the sacrifice our veterans have made for us. I congratulate Mr Tuhaka on receiving this accolade. Since he retired from the Navy in 1958, he has been an asset to the Gisborne community. Among his work in the community he is a Police Search and Rescue volunteer, has helped ex-servicemen with war pensions and allowance matters and is a respected kaumatua,” says Māori Party Co-leader Marama Fox.

MP for Waiariki Te Ururoa Flavell is pleased Heta Hingston has received a Companion of the Queen’s Service Order for his service to Māori and the Judiciary.

“The Māori Party is eternally grateful to retired Judge Heta Hingston for his involvement in the Foreshore and Seabed Act. He is recognised as the Judge who made the initial decision on Māori ownership, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2003,” says Mr Flavell.

The Māori Party also pays tribute to John Te Manihere Chadwick who has dedicated his lifetime to Māori and the Law.

In 1987 he was the founding president of the Māori Law Society, Te Hunga Rōia and in the same year founded Te Waiariki Purea Trust, and remains Chairman of the Trust after 28 years.

“In 2013 he was a founding trustee of Te Arawa Whānau Ora Trust and his leadership and support of Whānau Ora and many other whānau centred kaupapa has enabled thousands of whānau in Rotorua and the Waiariki Electorate to live better lives,” says Marama Fox.

Kataraina Hodge, who receives a Queen’s Service Medal, has been the Chairperson of Whakamārama Marae for over twenty years, and in that time she has been actively involved advancement and development of her iwi.

Te Ururoa Flavell says “Kataraina Hodge is a person who goes well beyond the call of duty. She is a steward, a leader and a caretaker of her people and is an outstanding leader of the Ngāti Raukawa iwi. We commend her dedication and commitment”.

Waimarama Taumaunu and Emeritus Professor Allan Bishop have both been named Officers of the New ZealandOrder of Merit. The former Silver Ferns coach receives her award for services to Netball, while Professor Bishop receives the title for his contribution to improving education outcomes for Māori and other indigenous peoples.

“We salute all this year’s recipients who have worked tirelessly to help our people. Thank you for your commitment, dedication, sacrifice and strength to do your best for our nation”, says Te Ururoa Flavell.
