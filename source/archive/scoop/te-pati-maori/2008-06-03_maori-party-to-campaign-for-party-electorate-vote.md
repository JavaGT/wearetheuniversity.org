Maori Party to campaign vigorously for party and electorate votes

  
Maori Party Press release from Hon Tariana Turia  
Co-leader of the Maori Party  
Tuesday 3 June 2008

  
“The Maori Party will campaign vigorously for the party vote in '08 as we did in '05, says Co-leader Tariana Turia.

"Our mandate to lead the nation on the basis of our foundation principles comes from all of Aotearoa, as well as the specific electorates we will stand in” she said.

She said that comments reported from the Green Party AGM in Auckland this last weekend have come as a surprise.

The comments attributed to Greens Party co-leader Jeanette Fitzsimons suggested that a deal had been struck with the Māori Party to encourage their supporters to give their party votes to the Greens.

“Just to put the record straight, there are no such arrangements in place” said Mrs Turia.

“We want to work constructively in Parliament using the mandate we get from both votes, the party vote and the electorate vote”.

"Many Pakeha, Pasifika and Asian people are telling us they plan to give their party vote to the Maori Party, even though they are in General electorates”.

“We are building for the long term future, not just a three year election term” said Mrs Turia. “That sort of thinking limits political strategy to three year opportunism”.

“Why would we not trust in ourselves?” asked Mrs Turia. “Our people are here for the long haul, for the future of Aotearoa”.

“We absolutely believe that the aspirations of tangata whenua are closely aligned to the aspirations of the nation”.

"The heartfelt message of our supporters is that Aotearoa is in need of a change, a change for the better - and they are going to 'Vote Maori Party for a change',” said Mrs Turia.

• Ngā Whare Waatea marae, 9-11am;
