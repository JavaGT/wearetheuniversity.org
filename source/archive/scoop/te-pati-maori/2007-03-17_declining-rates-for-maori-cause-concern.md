'Declining participation rates for Maori cause concern'

Dr Pita Sharples, Co-leader, Maori Party

Friday 16 March 2007

“The reverse fortunes of Maori and non-Maori participating in tertiary education should cause alarm for all New Zealanders” said Dr Pita Sharples, tertiary education spokesperson for the Maori Party today.

The Ministry of Education released facts this week which reported that Maori participation in tertiary education had declined from 22.7% of the adult Maori population in 2004 to 22.1% in 2005; while participation rate for students of all ethnicities increased from 13.7% to 14.2%.

“It’s not only the participation rates that’s our concern” said Dr Sharples. “It’s also at what level Maori students are participating - and the facts show they’re all concentrated in the lower levels (sub-degree qualifications) rather than at bachelor and post-graduate levels”.

“Until the government addresses the abysmal failure of secondary schools to adequately prepare decent numbers of Maori students who are 'tertiary-study' ready, in terms of both academic achievement and learning confidence, Maori participation in tertiary education will continue to be heavily skewed towards certificate level study” said Dr Sharples, a formerProfessor of Education at the Auckland University.

“The problem with the current participation picture is that gaining certificates and diplomas do not result in equitable incomes between Maori and non-Maori, where gaining a degree qualification does” explained Dr Sharples.

Ministry of Education data shows that for Maori, getting a tertiary qualification does not improve employment chances.

“Maori students are paid less when moving into the workforce, and this is both when completing and not completing qualifications” stated Dr Sharples.

“The only time we earn at the same level as non-Maori is when we’ve completed a degree. But for those completing certificates and diplomas, however, the pay gap is significant”.

“The data released this week, was inevitable, as a result of the Government’s brutal decision to cut Maori student support funding, particularly the Manaaki Tauira grants, and the SSG” said Dr Sharples.

“It just beggars belief that the Minister of Maori Affairs can issue a press release saying “Maori succeeding in tertiary education” when his own Ministry shows the number of Maori equivalent full students has decreased by 3.4% (1,860)” said Dr Sharples.

“One has to wonder – what IS success in the eyes of the Minister? Extending the queues to the local WINZ office? “ ended Dr Sharples.
