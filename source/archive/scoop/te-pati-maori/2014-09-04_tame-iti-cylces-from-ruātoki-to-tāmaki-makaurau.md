Tame Iti cylces from Ruātoki to Tāmaki Makaurau
===============================================

Tame Iti cylces from Ruātoki to Tāmaki Makaurau in support of the Māori Party  

  
In a show of solidarity for his fellow candidates, Māori Party List MP Tame Iti will be leading the cycle relay from Ruātoki in the Bay of Plenty to Tāmaki Makaurau.

The Tame Tū! Tame Ora! cycle tour will start at Tame’s home early on Thursday morning 4 September.

“Some parties do the talking while others do the walking. This is going to be three days to sweat it out, breathe in, breathe out and pump up the magic for the Māori Party,” says Mr Iti.

The Tūhoe health worker, artist and IronMāori contender says he has the upmost respect for the Māori Party candidates who are travelling the length and the breadth of the country to gather up support.

The 280 kilometre bike ride will take Tame and his team through three Māori electorates to meet up with Waiariki candidate Te Ururoa Flavell, Hauraki Waikato candidate Susan Cullen and his close Tūhoe relation Rangi McLean in Tāmaki Makaurau.

“I hope the cycle relay motivates people to think about policies, get on the roll and vote for the Māori Party.

“The Māori Party is a party on the move. They’ve shown an independent Māori Party can make a difference in Parliament by being true to the kaupapa.”

The Tame Tu! Tame Ora! cyclists will stop in Rotorua, Tirau, Cambridge, Hamilton, Ngāruawāhia, Pukekohe and Papakura before arriving at Manurewa Marae on Saturday afternoon.

People are welcome to join the cycle relay as long as they fit enough and capable of riding on the open road. All bikes will be safety checked before riding and there will be an escort going into Hamilton.
