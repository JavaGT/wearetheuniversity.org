Poroporoaki: Rereamoamo Monte Ohia

Aue, te ngau o te mate! te mamae! te mamae!  
Kua tau te kapua pöuri ki runga o Mauao, kua pukepuke nga moana o Tauranga, kua pakaru mai te tangi a nga iwi o Ngati Pukenga, o Ngai Te Rangi, o Ngati Ranginui, o Te Arawa.

E te rangatira, e te whakaruruhau, e te kaiärahi, takoto mai ra, takoto mai ra takoto mai ra.  
E te whänau pani, ka tangi hotuhotu mätou, ka pupu ake te aroha ki a kotuou e uhia nei e te kakahu taratara o te mate.

Monte Ohia’s Maori Party colleagues are utterly devastated at his sudden death this morning. The MPs have been touring Te Tai Tonga with Monte over the past few days, seeing the huge support he enjoyed as candidate, and sharing the excitement of the people.

Monte’s collapse at home in Christchurch, as he prepared to travel to Wairau for the final day of the tour, has shattered his family, his friends, and those who shared his dreams.

\"Monte was a man of great integrity, unstinting dedication and enormous strength" said Tariana Turia. "We are broken-hearted at this huge loss for us all"

"Over the last week as we have travelled with Monte, it has been a privilege to observe his leadership and devotion to the people" said Dr Pita Sharples. "Monte inspired us all with his passion, his impressive knowledge and his belief that nothing was impossible' said Dr Sharples

"But most of all we grieve for a very good man" said Tariana Turia. "A man we have all loved so dearly, a man of great courage and faith. Our tears flow for his beautiful wife, Linda, their children and whanau.
