Maori Party Congratulates Tangata Whenua Initiative in working to reduce child abuse from Waikato North

Tariana Turia, Co-leader of the Maori Party and Spokesperson for Maori Social Development

Monday 26 November 2007

Tariana Turia has said today that she is delighted to learn of the Maori summit taking place in Auckland, working to reduce child abuse in their region from Waikato North.

"This is a fantastic development, and I congratulate all of the Maori practitioners who are working together, to develop a strategic plan to reduce Maori child abuse" said Tariana Turia.

"Last October in Whanganui, we held a similar summit in which we called all of our leaders, workers, practitioners, advisors and importantly our whanau together, to look at ways we could achieve Mauriora in every whanau" said Mrs Turia.

"I have every confidence that as a result of the workshops and the korero, the strategic plan that the summit will produce will be absolutely about the power of the little ones - Nga Mana Ririki" said Mrs Turia.

"The Maori Party will be honoured to receive their strategic plan, and looks forward to learning from them, about the solutions that will work for whanau in their region" said Mrs Turia.
