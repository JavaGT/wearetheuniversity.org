Message to the people of Otautahi from the Maori Party
======================================================

**Tuesday, 22 February 2011, 9:25 pm**  
**Press Release: [The Maori Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/The_Maori_Party)**

Hon Dr Pita Sharples and Hon Tariana Turia, Co-leaders of the Maori Party

He aitua! He aitua!

Ki te hunga kua whakanguhia e te mate, takoto mai ra, takoto mai ra, takoto mai ra.

E nga whänau pani, kei te tangi hotuhotu mätou, kei te pupu ake te aroha ki a koutou e uhia nei e te kakahu taratara o te mate.

The Maori Party extends its deepest sympathies to the many families throughout the Canterbury region, and their loved ones throughout the land, as the whole country reels in the shock of today's massive earthquake in Christchurch

"Our love goes out to you all, at such a tragic time" said Tariana Turia.

"We share with every New Zealander the utmost sorrow and grief that has enveloped this city,  as they deal with the chaotic aftermath of this devastating event".

"We want you to know that you are in our every thought".

"Our MP for Te Tai Tonga, Rahui Katene, is based in Christchurch and will be helping us to know what we can do at this time of such crisis" said Dr Sharples.

 We pledge to you our commitment to do whatever we can, to provide you with the support you will need to rebuild and restore; to find the strength to get through the difficult days ahead".

"This is a disaster of unbelievable scale and severity.  We call on all peoples to extend the hand of manaakitanga to our friends and family in Christchurch as they confront the enormity of this situation" ended Dr Sharples.

Ma te Atua tatou e manaaki.
