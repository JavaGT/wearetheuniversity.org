**Poroporoaki: Eru Thompson**

Marama Fox and Te Ururoa Flavell  
Māori Party Co-Leaders

_E te rangatira, e te reo o ngā tupuna, e te kaiārahi o ngā uri whakatipu: Eru, takoto mai, takoto mai takoto mai!_

_Me pēnei te kōrero, tukuna rātou kia okioki i runga i te moenga roa. Āpiti hono, tātai hono, ko te akaaka o te rangi ki a rātou; āpiti hono, tātai hono, ko te akaaka o te whenua ki a tātou te hunga ora._

_E te taonga a te mate, takahia atu rā te ara whānui a tane, whakangaro atu rā ki te pō e, moe mai rā._

_The Māori Party flag flies at half-mast today, in the passing of a much loved friend, supporter, champion and kaumātua of the people, Eru Thompson._

_“We stand with Te Kawerau ā Maki, Ngāti Te Ata, Ngāti Māhanga, Ngāti Pūkenga and Tainui waka, gathered close in our grief for a man whose hearty laugh and respectful presence always made an impact at hui”._

_“Eru was a man that many held in the highest esteem” said co-leader Te Ururoa Flavell. “Whether it was in advising the kaumātua board of Te Atamira Taiwhenua (Department of Internal Affairs), or supporting visitors in prison, no task was ever too much for Eru._

_“Eru was particularly valued by former Tāmaki Makaurau MP Dr Pita Sharples, for his indepth knowledge of communities and councils right across the rohe. He was chair of the Auckland Regional Economic Development Māori component; Tikanga Pou Ārahi (Cultural Advisor) to Waitākere City Council and a relentless advocate for the community._

_“Eru had a special love for rangatahi” said Co-leader Marama Fox. “He attended countless rugby league games and other sporting activities, as a means of identifying talent and leadership that he could help to foster._

_“We had the privilege of seeing that mentoring role close-up in his involvement with our party membership. We know the Tāmaki Makaurau, Hauraki Waikato and Te Tai Tokerau membership in particular will sorely miss his leadership”._

_Moe mai rā e te Rangatira, moe mai ki runga i tō moenga roa, moea te moe roa. Haere, hoki, okioki atu rā.”_
