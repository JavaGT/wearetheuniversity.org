International Volunteers Day: Celebrating those who do a world of good

Hon Tariana Turia; Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector

Thursday 4 December 2008

Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, Tariana Turia, is encouraging New Zealanders to recognise the contributions of those who do a world of good in our communities.

Friday 5 December is International Volunteers Day.

“Right around the world, people will be stopping to take the time to say thanks” said Mrs Turia.  “Thanks for caring, for providing a second chance, for sewing the netball uniforms; for clearing the coastline of rubbish; for reorganising the library; for making dinner, for giving time to listen and help”.

“International Volunteer Day gives us all a nudge to recognise the volunteers and organisations who do so much in our communities” said Mrs Turia.

“I am looking forward to visiting a couple of these groups in Tamaki tomorrow” said Mrs Turia.

“My first visit is to meet with Migrant Action Trust, an organisation involved with supporting migrants and refugees into meaningful employment”.

“This group is extremely active – they are involved with mentoring, voluntary work experience, support groups, career counselling, workshops and work brokering.  They also provide (ethnic-specific) parenting courses, counselling, and interactive workshops on understanding Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Maori culture”.

“The other group is the Almanar Trust; an Islamic organisation catering for the large number of Muslim people living in Mount Roskill.  This group provides a whole range of services including driver’s licence courses, cultural activities, sport, weekend language and culture school for children, summer school, youth activities (camps) and the hosting of community gatherings”.

“Of course, we don’t need to wait till International Volunteer Day to say thanks to the thousands of individuals and organisations that hold our communities together” said Mrs Turia.  

“It doesn’t take much to say thanks – or for that matter to make a pledge to support those who do a world of good in our society”.

“This year, Volunteers Day is also National Jandal Day – if every worker in New Zealand gave a couple of dollars to Surf Life Saving, that might just help keep our beaches safe this summer”.

"On this special day to say thanks to others, thought also might be given to taking up voluntary and community work oneself.  It can be incredibly rewarding and enriching".
