The Lancet Says Palestinian Death Toll Most Likely To Be 186,000 Or More Killed By Israel’s War On Gaza
=======================================================================================================

**Press Release: [Palestine Solidarity Network Aotearoa](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Palestine_Solidarity_Network_Aotearoa)**

A report in the UK medical journal The Lancet, has estimated the Palestinian death toll in Israel’s war on Gaza is likely to be 186,000 or more.

The Gaza Ministry of Health count of bodies brought to hospitals or medical facilities stands at over 38,000 – mostly women and children. However the Lancet report is clear that this is a hopeless underestimate which does not, for example, take account of bodies buried in the rubble – estimated by some at 10,000 or more. The report goes on to say:

_Armed conflicts have indirect health implications beyond the direct harm from violence. Even if the conflict ends immediately, there will continue to be many indirect deaths in the coming months and years from causes such as reproductive, communicable, and non-communicable diseases. The total death toll is expected to be large given the intensity of this conflict; destroyed health-care infrastructure; severe shortages of food, water, and shelter; the population's inability to flee to safe places; and the loss of funding to UNRWA, one of the very few humanitarian organisations still active in the Gaza Strip._

_In recent conflicts, such indirect deaths range from three to 15 times the number of direct deaths. Applying a conservative estimate of four indirect deaths per one direct death_

_to the 37396 deaths reported, it is not implausible to estimate that up to 186000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza. Using the 2022 Gaza Strip population estimate of 2375259, this would translate to 7·9% of the total population in the Gaza Strip._

The New Zealand government continues its hypocrisy – fulsome condemnation of Russia and support for Ukraine alongside refusal to condemn Israel and miserly, grudging support for the Palestinian victims of Israeli genocide.

We will again be demanding our government hold Israel to account for its war crimes as we have done with Russia.
