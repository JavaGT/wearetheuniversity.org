40 Events In 29 Centres This Weekend Will Mark The 12-month Anniversary Of Israel’s Genocide Of Palestinians In Gaza
====================================================================================================================

**Friday, 4 October 2024, 7:07 pm**  
**Press Release: [Palestine Solidarity Network Aotearoa](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Palestine_Solidarity_Network_Aotearoa)**

Protests across the country this weekend will mark the 12-month anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza.

“We are incredibly proud of New Zealanders who have come out week after week for 12 months to stand with Palestine” says PSNA National Chair John Minto. “As far as we are aware this long-term pattern of solidarity has no precedent in New Zealand’s past”

“The protests have shown the absolute best of kiwi humanity”

“Meanwhile the Luxon government has been shameful and cowardly” says Minto. “It is blindly following the US lead and condemning every act of Palestinian resistance while refusing to utter a single word of condemnation of the rogue state of Israel which has been actively inciting a wider war in the Middle East.”

Israel is dangerous. It is out of control and armed to the teeth by western countries – almost certainly including New Zealand through Auckland’s Rakon Limited.

We are aware of threats by the pro-Israel fringe to disrupt Palestine solidarity action this weekend but we will not be deterred. We have written to the police in the expectation they will deal with anyone making threats against the movement which has a 12-month record of peaceful protest and relentless solidarity with Palestine.

We will be exercising out rights to protest under the Bill of Rights Act and expect the police to take appropriate action to protect those rights.

The demands from the marchers will be for accountability for Israel in line with international law and the rulings of the International Court of Justice which just this year has ruled Israel must

*   stop any acts of genocide
*   withdraw its troops from Gaza
*   end its unlawful occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories
