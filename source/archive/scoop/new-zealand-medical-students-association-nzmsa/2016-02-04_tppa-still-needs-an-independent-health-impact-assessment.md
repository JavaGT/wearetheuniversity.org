TPPA Still Needs an Independent Health Impact Assessment

**TPPA Still Needs an Independent Health Impact Assessment**

The New Zealand Medical Students’ Association (NZMSA) urges the Government to facilitate an independent Health Impact Assessment (HIA) on the recently agreed Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA).

“The TPPA could have significant impacts on our health system. Medical students are concerned these may detrimentally affect our future medical practice and the health of New Zealanders,” says NZMSA President Mike Fleete.

The NZMSA and other medical associations have repeatedly called on the Government to facilitate an independent HIA of the TPPA.

“It is unfortunate that the concerns of thousands of doctors, medical students and healthcare workers have not yet been responded to by the Government.”

“NZMSA is not opposed to the principles of free trade agreements and is aware of the potential economic benefits the TPPA may provide. However, we need to comprehensively understand the possible impacts the TPPA may have on healthcare. Without this understanding it is difficult for the country to come to an informed conclusion about the TPPA before it is ratified.”
