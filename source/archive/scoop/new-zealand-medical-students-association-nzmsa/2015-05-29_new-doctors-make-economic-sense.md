New Doctors make Economic Sense

**New Doctors make Economic Sense**

  
Minister Joyce has been touting that we must consider fairness to taxpayers on the student loan issues around medical students. However, New Zealanders must consider the economic impact of not letting new doctors graduate.

  
NZMSA President Elizabeth Berryman says that the Minister is undercutting the investment the public makes in training new doctors.

  
\"The government invests a lot in training doctors but when this policy prevents a large portion of the class at the final hurdle; he is completely undermining the investment the taxpayer makes"

  
"We would like nothing more than to have certainty about the future of our studies so we can graduate, work for the health of our communities, and repay our student loans"

  
Delaying graduation of New Zealand's new doctors will ultimately cost the taxpayer with delayed repayment of student loans and lost revenue from the income taxes the new doctors would pay.

  
"In the first few years after new doctors start work they will pay a third of their income back to the government in tax and student loan repayments."

  
"We are willing to talk to the Minister about a faster loan repayment scheme for those that need to borrow more than the 7 year limit."

  
In terms of fairness to the taxpayer the benefit of helping doctors graduate vastly outweighs the minimal cost to the government of letting them. The government’s short-sightedness is costing the taxpayer.
