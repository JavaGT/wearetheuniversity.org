No Troops For Trade - Labour must take a stand

No Troops For Trade - Labour must take a stand

"No troops for trade" is the message Peace Action Wellington will take to the streets this Saturday as part of a global week of action against the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and war.

The New Zealand Labour government is caving in to pressure from the United States to support military and trade policies which go against the interests and values of ordinary New Zealanders.

New Zealand troops are due to be deployed on Sunday, September 14 to Iraq.

"Whether it's sending troops to support us occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq, or supporting back-room deals at the WTO, the Labour government is showing its true stripes by siding with US interests" said Peace Action Wellington member Nick Henry.

New Zealanders marched in their thousands to oppose the invasion of Iraq, with the majority opposing the war. So why is Helen Clark now promising troops to support the US occupation?

Comments by US trade officials and New Zealand trade negotiations minister Jim Sutton have linked this military support to efforts to negotiate a US-NZ free trade agreement.

"A free trade agreement with the US would only hurt ordinary working people" said Nick Henry, "you only have to look at the experience of Canada and Mexico under NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) to see that."

"A free trade agreement just isn't worth fighting for. It certainly isn't worth fighting George Bush's dirty wars to get."

Peace Action Wellington is calling on the Labour government to withdraw its offer of troops to Iraq and to take a stand against us military and economic domination.

A demonstration has been called for Saturday morning in Manners Mall from 11am.
