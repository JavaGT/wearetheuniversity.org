No NZ support for war - Public meeting with Nicky Hager

  
A community meeting to discuss the involvement of New Zealand in the war in Iraq and Syria is being held on Thursday, November 6th at 6:30 at St. Joseph’s Church on the Basin Reserve. Investigative journalist Nicky Hager will be speaking about the politics of NZ going to Iraq, and Omar Kamoun will be talking about the rise of ISIS – the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The meeting is organised by Peace Action Wellington.

“The government has said that it will be making a decision about New Zealand’s involvement in the war before 8 November; this is one of the reasons we thought it was urgently necessary for a public meeting to discuss the issues,” said Valerie Morse, member of Peace Action Wellington.

“In 2003, thousands of Wellingtonians marched against the war in Iraq. People could see that the whole situation was based on lies and propaganda, and did not support any involvement by New Zealand. Now, we can see the incredible damage done by 10 years of a brutal US military occupation that has sown the seeds for the new war that the US is gearing up to fight for years to come.”

There will be a Q&A and discussion time following the speakers. All welcome.
