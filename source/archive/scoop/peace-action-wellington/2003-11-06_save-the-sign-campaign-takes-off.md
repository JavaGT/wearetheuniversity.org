Save the Sign campaign takes off

Save the Sign campaign takes off

Opposition is growing to Kerry Prendergast's plan to remove Wellington's historic nuclear-free sign. The Peace Action Wellington petition to save the sign is being well received by the people of Wellington, who are frequently outraged to learn of the Mayor's intentions. Many Wellingtonians are willing to queue up for a chance to register their support for the city's nuclear-free stand.

Contrary to Prendergast's claims, Wellington's nuclear-free status is still very relevant today. Nuclear waste is being used as a weapon by the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, with devastating long-term consequences for both civilians and the troops themselves. And if that isn't bad enough, the US also plans to build new nuclear bombs for use in combat, such as "bunker busters". This is a drastic and disturbing change in attitude towards weapons which have been universally considered too terrible to use for more than half a century.

"To remove the sign now would be to implicitly condone the aggressive policies of the current US government, which have already lead to thousands of civilian deaths. They've invaded other countries on the flimsiest of pretexts, and are encouraging renewed nuclear proliferation," said Peace Action Wellington member Kelly Buchanan.

But the sign issue is just one symptom of the current city council's desperation to please corporate interests at any cost. Parking buildings, community group premises, large areas of the waterfront, even our water services - Prendergast and her lackeys want to sell off as many public assets as they can get away with. All this might make the council accounts look good in the short term, but they are selling our city's future.

Peace Action Wellington is a broad group working cooperatively to promote peace, justice, and self-determination throughout the world. We're happy to hear from volunteers who'd like to help out with the Save the Sign campaign or other PAW activities.
