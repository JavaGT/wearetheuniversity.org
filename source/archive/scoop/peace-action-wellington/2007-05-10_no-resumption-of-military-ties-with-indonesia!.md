Media release: No resumption of military ties with Indonesia!  
From: Peace Action Wellington  
Date: 10 May 2007

Friday is a day of action against the resumption of military ties with Indonesia. The New Zealand Government will resume military ties with the Indonesian Government this month. An Indonesian officer will attend the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) Command and Staff College course in Trentham which begins on May 14, 2007. The NZDF website says that “the aim of the Staff Course is to provide an advanced Service education to selected officers so that they may prepare themselves for high grade command and staff appointments.” This means training the Indonesian military to better direct the killing of people.

“Helen Clark and Phil Goff are operating in a totally underhanded manner. Last year, they gave public assurances that New Zealand was not considering changing its military relationship with Indonesia, which has been suspended since 1999. It seems that was all a lie, a ruse, to hide a growing relationship with the murderous armed forces of Indonesia, the notorious TNI” said Peace Action Wellington member Valerie Morse

“Peace Action Wellington supports the work of the Indonesian Human Rights Committee in Auckland in their tireless work to highlight the grave abuses being committed by the Indonesian military against people in West Papua. We also offer our support to all the people in Auckland who are taking action outside of the Defence Headquarters on Friday.”

Peace Action Wellington launched the Troops Out Now Campaign on ANZAC day at the Wellington dawn ceremony. As part of this campaign, we are calling upon the New Zealand government to cease all military training and exercises with all foreign militaries.
