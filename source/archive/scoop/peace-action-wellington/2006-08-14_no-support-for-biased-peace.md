No support for biased peace

Peace Action Wellington

Monday 14 August 2006

"Any peace without justice is not a lasting peace. The UN decision to enforce a cease-fire between Hizbollah and Israel will only strengthen the position of Israel and lead to more violence" said Peace Action Wellington member Valerie Morse.

"The UN has lost all credibility as a neutral arbiter. US demands on security council resolutions means that the Israeli government is never criticised for its flagrant violations of international law. Meanwhile Lebanese and Palestinian people are portrayed as the instigators of the conflict by the mainstream media that refuses to depict the wider historical reality of the situation. This is yet another US invasion clothed in the UN flag."

Peace Action Wellington calls for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign governments from Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan as well as an immediate end to the targeting of civilians in Lebanon.

Peace Action Wellington will host a discussion meeting on Lebanon and Palestine on Monday, August 14 at 7pm at the Clubs Room, Victoria University Student Union. All welcome.
