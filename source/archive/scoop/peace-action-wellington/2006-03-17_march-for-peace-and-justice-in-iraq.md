March for peace and justice in Iraq

On Saturday, March 18 people from around the world will march to mark the third year of occupation in Iraq, the fourth year of occupation in Afghanistan and to express outrage at the threat of military action in Iran. In Wellington, people will converge on Midland Park at 12 noon and march to the US Embassy. Other actions are also planned in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin.

"Thousands more people are being tortured, raped, kidnapped and murdered as the illegal and immoral occupations in both Iraq and Afghanistan continue. The only solution is for the United States and all foreign troops to withdraw immediately and allow the people there to determine their own futures, free of interference and intimidation." said Peace Action Wellington member Valerie Morse

"The New Zealand Government must cease its involvement in the so-called War on Terrorism. The 'War' is simply a convenient name for pursing the US foreign policy goals of domination and strategic control of the Middle East and Central Asia. NZ is currently assisting by providing troops to serve in Afghanistan, intelligence information from the spy base at Waihopai and support for the referral of Iran to the UN Security Council."

"The blood of hundreds of thousands of people are on the hands of George W Bush, Tony Blair and John Howard. On the eve of Blair's visit to Auckland, Helen Clark should find the courage to condemn Blair's war crimes and hold him to account."

"We will never forget the crimes against humanity being committed in our names in these countries and we will struggle for an end to the occupations until justice is done. Join us in solidarity with the people of Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world this Saturday."
