Call To Protest US and NZ war crimes!
=====================================

**Wednesday, 3 November 2010, 11:21 am**  
**Press Release: [Peace Action Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Peace_Action_Wellington)**

Protest US and NZ war crimes! Protest Hillary Clinton, US war monger

  
When: Thursday 4 November 4:30  
Where: Parliament Grounds  
Bring: banners, placards, friends, comrades, etc

  
"When US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signs the 'Wellington  
Declaration' on Thursday at Parliament, she will be greeted with an  
anti-war picket just outside. We will not stand idly by as the one of the  
people responsible for the hundreds of thousands murders, tortures,  
kidnappings, rapes, and forced displacements in Iraq and Afghanistan sips  
wine inside the beehive" said Peace Action Wellington member Valerie Morse

"The New Zealand government has been right alongside the Americans in the  
global killing escapade that they call the 'war on terrorism' for nine  
years now. Why is New Zealand fighting and killing for America? Simply put,  
money and power: the government wants a free-trade deal with the US to  
appease NZ capitalists, and wants closer military relations with the US to  
ensure global Western domination.

"This is a war OF terrorism being waged by bullies and thugs in Washington  
and Wellington in order to secure the resources of the Middle East and  
ensure Western supremacy. Bush's war is now Obama and Clinton's war, but  
it is the same old US foreign policy of imperial war and occupation."

"Peace Action Wellington demands an immediate end to ALL New Zealand  
involvement in the phony 'war on terrorism': no more SAS, no more  
frigates, no more thinly veiled occupations disguised as ‘reconstruction,’  
no more spybases. We demand peace with justice and self-determination for  
Afghanistan, Iraq and all of the people of the world."
