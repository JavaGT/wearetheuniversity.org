US Embassy Protest Over War Crimes in Fallujah
==============================================

March to US Embassy to Protest War Crimes in Fallujah

Those angered by Bush, Howard, and Blair’s terrorising attack on Fallujah will be marching to the US Embassy in Wellington on Wednesday 15th December to voice opposition to the continued war of aggression in Iraq. The recent attack on Fallujah by US-led troops saw some of the highest civilian deaths and casualties since this war of terror began.

The march, organised by Peace Action Wellington (PAW), will begin outside Parliament at the Cenotaph at 5:00pm, and proceed to the US Embassy via the British High Commission and the Australian Embassy at 5:30pm. Green MP Keith Locke and Brass Razoo Solidarity Band will be participating.

“The civilian population in Fallujah have been systematically brutalised by the United States controlled forces. This assault has been an exercise in cruel collective punishment,” said Stephen Hay, spokesperson for Peace Action Wellington (PAW).

The people of Fallujah have had their power cut off, and the US denied the Red Cross access to deliver clean water. The first target of the United States forces was to destroy or occupy the hospitals and arrest doctors to deny both rebels and civilians access to medical aid.

“Since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, thousands upon thousands of Iraqi civilians have been slaughtered. Their stories have been too often ignored.”

“Although Hussein was a cruel dictator, the US response has resulted in a series of violent, destructive, and brutal blood baths with no end in sight. The US search for ‘weapons of mass destruction’ would have been much more productive had they looked in their own backyards, where the largest collections of the world’s implements of murder can be found.”

“Peace Action Wellington calls upon Helen Clark to voice New Zealand’s opposition to the War on Iraq, pull our troops out of Afghanistan, and end New Zealand’s commitment to the UKUSA spy-base agreement. Her refusal to speak out against the atrocities of Bush, Blair, and Howard means that New Zealand is endorsing these global wars of terror and imperialism,” concluded Hay.
