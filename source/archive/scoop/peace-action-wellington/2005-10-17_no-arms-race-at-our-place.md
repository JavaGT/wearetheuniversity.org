No arms race at 'Our Place'

From: Peace Action Wellington

The annual Defence Industry Conference is scheduled for October 18 and 19 at Te Papa. Peace Action Wellington has been actively campaigning to stop this conference and a range of actions are planned for the days of the conference. There will be a public protest starting from Civic Square at 12:30pm on October 18 that will include an invasion staged by the Revolutionary Clown Army.

"It is deeply offensive that a weapons conference is being hosted at the same institution as some of Aotearoa's most valuable taonga. 'Our place' is no place for an arms fair. The Museum of New Zealand Act of 1992 says that it has a responsibility to ensure that the Museum is a source of pride for all New Zealanders. But how can we be proud of a place that hosts a weapons conference?" said Peace Action Wellington member Valerie Morse.

The Defence Industry Association is comprised of New Zealand companies involved in the manufacture of a wide variety of military-related hardware. Some of the companies are subsidiaries of multinational corporations involved in the nuclear weapons industry overseas.

"The Government has been supporting defence related businesses with grants from Trade and Enterprise. In 2003, Flexisolutions was awarded $100,000 to develop the jungle-sweeper grenade. It is totally contradictory for the NZ Government to claim it is acting as a good international citizen in peacekeeping missions while it is simultaneously supporting the development of an arms trade."

The annual conference is not just a meeting of members. Delegates at the 2003 conference included representatives from General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin, two of the world’s largest manufacturers of arms including ballistic missiles. Other delegates of note included representatives from Halliburton, Sikorsky Helicopter and the US Army.

Peace Action is working to end the use of Te Papa as a conference venue for this annual meeting. Similarly, we are campaigning against the use of tax-payer money to fund weapons’ research and development. Ultimately, we want an end to any arms trade in NZ
