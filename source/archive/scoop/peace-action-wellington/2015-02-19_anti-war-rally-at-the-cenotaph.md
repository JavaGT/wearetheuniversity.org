Anti-War Rally at the Cenotaph
==============================

**Thursday, 19 February 2015, 10:35 am**  
**Press Release: [Peace Action Wellington](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Peace_Action_Wellington)**

Anti-War Rally at the Cenotaph

  
Peace Action Wellington is inviting all people who are opposed to New Zealand support for US wars in Iraq and Syria to meet at the Cenotaph at 5pm next Thursday, 26 February. Please bring banners or placards showing opposition to war.

The government has indicated that it will make a decision about troop deployments by the end of the month, but we all know that it is a foregone conclusion. For months, the prime minister has been priming the public for a deployment, testing public opinion to see how far he can go. The government euphemistically calls the deployment of training troops as being ‘behind the wire,’ but the reality is that these are combat soldiers who will be authorised to shoot to kill.

The situation in the Middle East is the direct result of the 2003 US invasion and subsequent occupation which left hundreds of thousands of people dead and Iraq massively destabilised politically, economically and socially. Sending the US military in to fix a situation that it created will make the situation considerably worse, not better.

Join us in opposing New Zealand’s involvement in a new US war in Iraq and Syria. Show the government that it does not have our consent to wage this war.
