### US War Criminal NOT welcomed in Aotearoa

US General John Abizaid arrived at the military terminal of Wellington Airport at 2pm this afternoon to peace activists demanding his immediate arrest for war crimes. Activists shouted 'scum' 'get out' and 'war monger' during the formal military welcome which included a haka.

The General's visit was leaked to the media accidentally on Tuesday by the Prime Minister. It is likely that he is here to encourage a further commitment of New Zealand troops including SAS soldiers to the war on the people of Afghanistan (the so-called 'War on Terrorism').

As commanding officer of US Central Command, Abizaid condoned the torture and abuses at Abu Ghraib and Bagram prisons. He further sanctioned the assault on thousands of civilians in Falluja.

The reception given to a man who has committed grave crimes against humanity is cause for serious alarm by all people concerned with issues of peace, justice and self-determination in Aotearoa New Zealand and around the globe. This man should be tried for his crimes, not welcomed as a hero.
