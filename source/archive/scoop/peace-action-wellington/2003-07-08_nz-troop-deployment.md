Provincial Reconstruction Teams are aiding a war on the people of Afghanistan

Another team of New Zealand troops is being deployed to Afghanistan today to participate in the so-called 'War on Terrorism' which is still being waged in Afghanistan.

'This military action is not a war at all as a war generally means a fight between two relatively equal sides. In Afghanistan, the high-tech United States led attacks are killing defenceless innocent people.' said Peace Action Wellington spokesperson Valerie Morse

In the days following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States was praised for ridding Afghanistan of the brutal Taliban regime. There is now evidence that the Taliban has been invited back to work with the US to help bring stability back to the country. Thus, the so-called 'War' has done little but bring about several thousand casualties.

'New Zealanders are being asked to risk their lives in a conflict without a foreseeable end - the enemy is not the people of Afghanistan but a nebulous 'threat'. The government must stop this military action offer real assistance such as direct medical aid to the people of Afghanistan.' Peace Action Wellington is calling on the government to stop all support for the 'War on Terrorism' by recalling our troops and the Navy frigate, Te Mana.
