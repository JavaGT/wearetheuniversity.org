The Return of Te Mana
=====================

The Return of Te Mana

'The return of the Navy frigate Te Mana from the Gulf of Oman today is a critical opportunity for the New Zealand Government to reconsider its support of the so-called 'War on Terrorism' said Peace Action Wellington member Valerie Morse.

Over the past year, New Zealand has been supporting 'Operation Enduring Freedom' with SAS troops, Orion aircraft and the Navy frigates. This military action has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan.

The 'War on Terrorism' has not made the world safer from terrorist attacks. A response to the attacks of 11 September 2001, this so-called 'War' has only caused destruction and chaos in Afghanistan.

'The United States is using the pretence of terrorism to launch pre-emptive military attacks on countries. The poorly defined terrorist threat means that the USA will intervene anywhere, anytime. The people of New Zealand do not want to be part of this aggressive war-mongering.' said Ms. Morse.

Peace Action Wellington demands that the New Zealand Government recall all military personnel and equipment in the service of the 'War on Terrorism' immediately.
