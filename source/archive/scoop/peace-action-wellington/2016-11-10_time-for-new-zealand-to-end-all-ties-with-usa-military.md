Time for New Zealand to end all ties with USA military

Press Release: Peace Action Wellington

It is now time for New Zealand to cut military ties with the USA. The USA military has a grotesque human rights record and has been involved in a huge number of unnecessary, brutal, destructive and poorly thought out conflicts, and that was before Donald Trump was appointed Commander in Chief.

Opposition to the arrival of a USA warship in Aotearoa is building with organisations around the country opposing the visit. Groups oppose this visit in November which is part of the upcoming Weapons Expo held by the Defence Industry Association. Last year this annual Weapons Expo was held in a venue owned by the Wellington City Council and faced staunched and passionate opposition.

Peace Action Wellington spokesperson James Barber says, \"this November companies are meeting to further their plans of making profit from war at the same time as our government welcomes warships and armed forces which have been responsible for a vast number of human rights abuses."

Peace Action Wellington is calling for New Zealand to not only end the annual Weapons Expo but also revoke its invitation to the US Navy, and end all ties with the US military, and finally to formally leave the ANZUS agreement and Washington agreement.

They continued, "we should not be strengthening military ties with an armed forces responsible for the grotesque human rights abuses of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. Nor should we have military ties with a country which has been killing thousands of innocent people through its ongoing and illegal drone war."

"The New Zealand government should stand up against monstrous international politics, protect our country from further involvement in unnecessary wars and end all ties with the USA armed forces."

Peace Action Wellington commends Auckland Peace Action which is planning protests and an on-water peace flotilla, and calls on all people to stand up against the war industry and for peace and justice by resisting military ties with the United States of America.

Peace Action Wellington will be marching from Thistle Hall, Cuba st, to the Wellington City Council at 12:30, Wednesday 16th November, in opposition to the war industry, opposition to military ties with war mongers such as the USA, and to deliver a letter calling on the city council to never host the Weapons Expo in their venues again.
