The nine recipients of a 2022 William Georgetti Scholarship are addressing everything from healthcare delivery inequities experienced by refugees to the best use of agricultural land to keep within the Earth’s environmental limits while contributing to global food security.

The William Georgetti Scholarship encourages postgraduate study and research important to the social, cultural or economic development of Aotearoa New Zealand. It was established from the Estate of William Georgetti, a Hawke’s Bay farmer who died in 1943.

With the support of their 2022 scholarship:
