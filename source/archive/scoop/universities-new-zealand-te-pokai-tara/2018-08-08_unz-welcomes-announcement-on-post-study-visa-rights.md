UNZ welcomes announcement on post-study visa rights
===================================================

Universities New Zealand (UNZ) welcomes today’s announcement on post-study visa rights by Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway.

“Providing good graduate outcomes is key to attracting the best students from overseas,” says UNZ Executive Director Chris Whelan. “Though most international students return to their home countries after they graduate, a proportion have the qualifications and skills that New Zealand employers need but can’t find enough of from the pool of domestic graduates. Having the option of staying in New Zealand for up to three years after graduating makes New Zealand a more attractive study destination for these international students while contributing to our businesses and economy.”

New Zealand was recently rated Number 1 for preparing students for the future by the Economist Intelligence Unit; and universities recognise the importance of gaining relevant work experience to complement and apply their qualifications.

“International students are an important part of New Zealand’s university sector, both financially and in creating a vibrant, attractive culture both on and off campus,” says Chris Whelan. “While New Zealand ultimately benefits from those international students who decide to stay here once they have completed their study, those who return to their country of origin also provide vital business and cultural links for this country.

“International education is a valuable export earner for New Zealand, but this is about more than export earnings and migration. The two-way flow of people between New Zealand the rest of the world is critical for both New Zealand and its people.”
