Universities welcome more flexible tertiary enrolments

**Universities welcome more flexible tertiary enrolments**

Universities are welcoming the move by the Minister of Tertiary Education, Steven Joyce, to give them greater flexibility to respond to changes in demand in tertiary enrolments.

Executive Director of Universities New Zealand Chris Whelan says the move gives universities the flexibility to grow student numbers in high demand courses without waiting for annual or bi-annual funding approval from the Tertiary Education Commission.

“At present universities have to turn students away or they have had to carry the unfunded cost."

“This much-needed change to regulatory settings gives universities better operational discretion and greater flexibility to manage their enrolments."

“It’s also great for students as they have a better chance to get into their preferred courses."

Previously providers had to apply for additional funding, which could take months or years if funding was not available from elsewhere.
