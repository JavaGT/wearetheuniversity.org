Universities New Zealand media release: New Zealand universities condemn terror attack, support students

A statement from Derek McCormack, Vice-Chancellor of AUT and Chair of Universities New Zealand, on behalf of New Zealand universities:

The universities of New Zealand make up a community that welcomes and celebrates diversity in staff and students. We condemn and are all deeply saddened by the terror attacks in Christchurch.

We want our international student community to know that all universities are doing everything possible to support their students and to ensure campuses remain the safe places they are supposed to be.

We stand by the Muslim community at this very difficult time.

The events of Friday will be affecting those of us who are part of the international student community in different ways. Help and support is available to those who want it. Please contact the support teams at your own campus.

These attacks are not us. The love and support that will surround our students is. Please remember that.
