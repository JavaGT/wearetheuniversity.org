**Universities NZ welcomes changes to UE**

Universities New Zealand – Te Pōkai Tara (Universities NZ) welcomes the changes to the university entrance requirement announced by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority today.

Set to take effect from 2014, the new university entrance requirement is more comprehensive than it was previously. “These changes will help to ensure that students achieving university entrance are better prepared for university study,” says Professor Pat Walsh, Chair of Universities NZ’s Committee on University Academic Programmes.

Currently, most universities are selecting students according to criteria that are more stringent than the university entrance standard.

“While achieving university entrance is mandatory, it does not guarantee entry into a university,” points out Professor Walsh. “The new university entrance requirement will help confirm the high expectations of students planning to attend university.”
