Universities New Zealand delighted at conference win  

28 March 2018

Universities New Zealand (UNZ), the peak body representing the interests of New Zealand’s eight universities, is delighted that New Zealand has been successful in its bid to host the 2021 Asia-Pacific Association of International Education (APAIE) Conference and Exhibition.

The University of Auckland will host the event—to be held at the to-be-built Auckland Convention Centre—with the seven other universities sharnig co-hosting duties.

“New Zealand universities have a long-term commitment to international education and the connections it fosters,” says UNZ Executive Director Chris Whelan. “We’re a small country a long way from anywhere, and the international links we build from high-profile events such as this are invaluable.

“Universities contribute hugely to New Zealand’s economy, with international education now our fourth largest export earner. At this conference, we will have the opportunity to showcase what we have to offer and to contribute to the theme of ‘innovation for sustainable futures’—a vitally important topic, particularly for the universities of the South Pacific region.

“We are proud of the quality of our education system and all eight of New Zealand’s universities are enthusiastic about the opportunity to support this conference and to showcase New Zealand and themselves.”
