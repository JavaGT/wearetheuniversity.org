Concerns over persistent UE disparity for Māori & Pasifika

Universities New Zealand – Media release

**Universities concerned over persistent UE disparity for Māori and Pasifika**

**Embargoed until 6am 13 April 2017**

University Vice-Chancellors welcome the increased numbers of secondary school students achieving NCEA Level 2 but remained concerned about the persistent achievement gap at University Entrance level for Māori and Pasifika students.

New data from the Education Minister shows that roll-based achievement of University Entrance now sits at 49.2%.

However Vice-Chancellors remain concerned about the significant disparity between Māori and Pasifika achievement rates, compared with those of Pakeha and Asian students.

The data shows that only 31.4% of Māori and 30.7% of Pasifika students are achieving University Entrance, compared with 57.8% of NZ European and 66.5% of Asian students.

Chris Whelan, Executive Director of Universities New Zealand says, “This means that a significant proportion of Māori and Pasifika do not have the opportunity to take on university education, with the significant benefits that it brings to them and their families, and to New Zealand as a whole.

“This continued disparity in achievement rates must be of concern to government, the education sector and to all New Zealanders.

“Universities remain committed to working with the Ministry of Education and schools to support work to help increase numbers of Māori and Pasifika who achieve University Entrance.”
