Universities welcome post-study work rights proposals

New Zealand’s universities welcome today’s announcement by Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway of proposed changes to post-study work visas for international students.

“The previous system permitted unscrupulous employers to exploit students and often saw students end up trying to get jobs with qualifications for which there was no real demand,” says Universities New Zealand Executive Director Chris Whelan.

“These changes simplify things for students, while encouraging them to get qualifications that will open doors to more meaningful jobs. That’s better for them; it’s better for the employers who are constantly dealing with skill shortages. And it’s therefore ultimately better for the country.

“International students are an important part of New Zealand’s university sector, both financially and in creating a vibrant, attractive culture both on and off campus.

“While international education is a valuable export earner for New Zealand, this is about more than export earnings and migration. The two-way flow of people between New Zealand the rest of the world is critical for both New Zealand and its people.”
