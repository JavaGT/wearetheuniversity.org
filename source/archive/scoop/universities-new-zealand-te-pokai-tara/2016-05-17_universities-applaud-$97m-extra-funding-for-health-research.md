Universities applaud $97m extra funding for health research

Universities New Zealand release

**Universities applaud $97m extra funding for health research**

  
Universities New Zealand has applauded the Government’s decision to increase funding for health research by 56% over four years.

The decision, announced today as part of Budget 2016, will see increased funding of $97million over four years.

Chris Whelan, Executive Director of Universities New Zealand says this is the biggest increase in health research funding in several years (since 2009/2010).

“Around 90% of health research ends up being carried out by universities. This is research that delivers new or better treatments, drugs and technologies that benefit New Zealanders.”

“The problem has been that funding levels were such that only a small proportion of the proposals for funding were ever able to be supported. This new funding will ensure that more good ideas can be supported.”

Universities will also look forward to contributing to the development of a new health research strategy which was announced today.
