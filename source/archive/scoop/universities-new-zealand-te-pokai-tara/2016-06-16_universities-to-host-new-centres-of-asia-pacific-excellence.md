**Universities to host new Centres of Asia-Pacific Excellence**

Universities New Zealand has welcomed the Tertiary Minister’s announcement that up to three Centres of Asia-Pacific Excellence (CAPEs) will be developed within New Zealand’s universities.

Minister Steve Joyce today announced funding of $34.5million over 4 years as part of Budget 2016.

Professor Harlene Hayne, Chair of Universities New Zealand and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago, congratulated Minister Steven Joyce on the initiative.

“Universities are delighted to contribute their research, knowledge and expertise to support New Zealand’s economic and cultural ambitions in the strategically significant Asian-Pacific and Latin American regions. This will also draw on our already strong relationships with other universities and research institutes in these regions.

“We have the expertise to teach and advise on the regions’ respective languages, cultures and economies to students, exporters, and government agencies, to support their important work.

“Universities have long recognised the critical importance of developing cultural capability to ensure faculty and students have the skills, experience and ability to work across other cultures and borders.

“My fellow Vice-Chancellors and I look forward to working with the Tertiary Education Commission on this important initiative.”
