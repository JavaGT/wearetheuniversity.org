**Prestigious Girdlers’ Scholarship awarded to multi-talented law student**

Eighteen year-old Harrison Fookes from Glendowie has been has been awarded a life changing Girdlers’ scholarship to Cambridge University.

The former Auckland Sacred Heart student is described as an exceptionally gifted, multi-talented, natural leader with a strong sense of social justice. He was Dux in both Years 12 and 13; a Prefect, Rowing Captain, coached football and debating, is a talented saxophonist and an active member of “Young Vinnies”. Last year he represented New Zealand at the World Schools Debating Championship in Thailand.

The prestigious Girdlers’ Scholarship, valued at approximately £25,000 (NZ$50,000) a year, will pay for Harrison’s university and college fees and contribute to his living costs while he studies for his degree.

Harrison is interested in studying international law or bioethics and medical law. “They will have a huge role to play in the world of medicine and genetics in the future.”

He says, “The scholarship is a fantastic opportunity to learn from and interact with some of the brightest minds in the world, to make connections within the university and also across the United Kingdom and Europe, and to bring all this back to New Zealand.”

This is the 51st Scholarship that the Worshipful Company of Girdlers has awarded to a New Zealand student.

In announcing the decision on behalf of the Company, Past Master Peter Trimingham says, “Harrison embodies the qualities we seek. He demonstrates both the academic excellence and maturity to perform well at Cambridge. He has a strong sense of social responsibility and is active in his community. We will watch his progress with interest and support him during his time at Cambridge.”
