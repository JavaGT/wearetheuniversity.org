NZ in top 4%

**NZ in top 4% of Times Higher Education World University Rankings**

The high quality of New Zealand’s universities has been confirmed in the annual Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings released today.

The results show that New Zealand universities rank within the top 4% of universities in the world.

Seven out of eight New Zealand universities are in the Times Higher Education top 800 worldwide. This compares well with Australia, where 31 of 44 universities are in the top 800. New Zealand also boasts one university in the top 200.

However, Chris Whelan, the Executive Director of Universities New Zealand, warns that while the big picture is good, the results show a continued slow decline.

Mr Whelan says, “We are concerned to see a slow decline for most of our universities over the past three years. The fact is that this decline won’t be arrested without further investment by government.”

“This year universities welcomed the Government’s first real increase in funding to the sector in nearly a decade. But more is needed if our universities are going to continue supporting this country’s economic and social objectives.

“The Government wants New Zealand universities to be producing capable and employable graduates, to be generating world-class research, and to be contributing to economic growth by attracting more international students. New Zealand universities recruit half their academic staff internationally and generate just over a billion dollars annually for the economy from international students,” says Mr Whelan.  
“This ability to attract excellent international teachers, researchers and students depends significantly on us having a high quality university system that produces international rankings that demonstrate our quality to academics and students.”
