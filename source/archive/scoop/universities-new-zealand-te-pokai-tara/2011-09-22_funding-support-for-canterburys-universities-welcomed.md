MEDIA RELEASE 21 September 2011

Funding support for Canterbury’s universities welcomed

Universities NZ welcomes today’s announcement that the government has agreed to fund Canterbury’s tertiary institutions at pre-earthquake-negotiated funding levels through 2012.

To secure government’s support for the affected universities, the other New Zealand universities agreed that Canterbury-based students who choose to transfer to another university will not attract government funding.

“Each of our eight universities makes its own important contribution to the country’s university system and the earthquakes will have a significant impact on our national capability,” says Universities NZ Chair Derek McCormack.

“The agreement with the government announced today will help mitigate this impact and provide much needed stability of funding to the affected universities while they work to recover.”
