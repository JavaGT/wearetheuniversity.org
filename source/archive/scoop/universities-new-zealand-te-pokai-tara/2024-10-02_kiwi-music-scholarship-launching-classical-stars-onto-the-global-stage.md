Aotearoa boasts an exceptional array of young, up-and-coming classical musicians, and thanks to the annual **Kiwi Music Scholarship**, provided by the Kiwi Music Trust, five have been awarded $15,000 to help them navigate the competitive world of professional music.

**Shiddharth Chand** graduated from the University of Auckland in 2022 with a Master of Music. A gifted opera singer, last year he was accepted into the Artist Diploma programme at the San Francisco Music Conservatory. Described by his mentors as talented, dedicated, and professional, Siddharth is thrilled to have received the Kiwi Music Scholarship. “The Artist Diploma programme and this scholarship are not just steps in my journey—they propel me toward a future filled with promise and opportunity on the global stage of opera.”

**Cecile McNeill** is a violist who has a Bachelor of Music from the University of Auckland and is currently working towards a Master of Music at the University of Southern California. With early recognition from her lecturers for her talent and potential, Cecile has already been involved in multiple musical engagements at USC. Cecile is particularly looking forward to more opportunities to work with other musicians in meaningful collaborations.

> **Cecily Shaw** graduated from the University of Waikato with a Master of Music in 2019, and in 2023, began postgraduate studies in Voice (mezzo-soprano) at Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Her first year included a number of successful performances and has laid the groundwork for Cecily to hone her skills to become fully industry ready. Her focus will be to prepare to audition for Young Artist programmes and opera companies in the UK and Europe.
