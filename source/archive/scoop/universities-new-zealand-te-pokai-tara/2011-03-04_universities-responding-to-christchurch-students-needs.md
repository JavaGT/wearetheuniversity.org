MEDIA RELEASE  
4 March 2011

**Universities responding to Christchurch students’ needs**

In the aftermath of the earthquake, the New Zealand universities have been working together to assist affected students from the Canterbury region.

Lincoln University’s physical facilities are all useable and compliant. The university is open for staff and will resume teaching on the 14th of March. The University of Canterbury is also expected to begin a progressive start to the semester on the 14th of March. Both universities have confirmed they expect to deliver a full-year academic programme in 2011. Massey University is working directly with its Christchurch-based extramural students to respond to their needs while the University of Otago is in daily communication with the students of its Christchurch campus.

Universities New Zealand would like to reiterate that students should contact their Christchurch-based universities in the first instance to discuss any concerns they may have and to find out more about the options that are being made available to them (see list below). For students that have internet access, there are frequent updates available on each university’s website.

“While we expect that most Christchurch students will choose to remain with their chosen institution, some have been completely displaced due to loss of accommodation, family moves and other impacts of the disaster,” said Universities NZ Chair Derek McCormack. “The universities are working together with the Christchurch institutions to help displaced students continue to undertake their studies in 2011 with minimal disadvantage.”
