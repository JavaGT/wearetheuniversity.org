MEDIA RELEASE 12 March 2012

**2012 Girdlers’ Scholarship winner announced**

Kate Poskitt is looking forward to engaging with some of the best minds in the world when she begins studying for a Politics, Psychology and Sociology (PPS) Tripos degree at Cambridge University later this year. The 18-year-old former Western Heights High School and current Victoria University of Wellington student, has won the 2012 Girdlers’ Scholarship to study at Cambridge’s Corpus Christi College.

Administered by Universities New Zealand-Te Pōkai Tara, the Scholarship is funded by the Girdlers’ Company, which traces its foundation back to medieval times as a craftsmen’s guild. The award, worth £25,000 per annum, is offered to one New Zealand “all-rounder” each year.

“We are delighted with Kate’s selection,” says Peter Trimingham of the Girdlers’ Company. “The Girdlers take great pride in supporting this award, which is symbolic of the Company’s warm and close relationship with New Zealand since 1933.” Kate will be New Zealand’s 48th Girdlers’ Scholar.

During her time at Rotorua’s Western Heights High School (WHHS), Kate excelled in her studies, gaining Excellence endorsements in all levels of NCEA, and gaining scholarship in History, Geography and Physical Education in year 13, and English and Geography as a year 12 student.

In addition to her academic excellence, Kate is described as a gifted performer, debater and public speaker, and a formidable athlete. Kate was a member of WHHS’ athletics, swimming and water polo teams, but it is soccer where she truly excelled as both a player and coach.

Kate is passionate about the environment and was a part of the winning regional EnviroChallenge team three years running. During her time at WHHS she was instrumental in making the school the first carbon neutral school in New Zealand, through a combination of offsetting and reduction of carbon emissions. These efforts led to Kate being named an EnviroChallenge Leader Ambassador in 2011.

At Cambridge, Kate is interested in studying how globalisation, politics and geography are interlinked and hopes her studies can help offer solutions to the pressing problems of expanding populations and environmental strife.

Girdlers’ Scholarship – One award is given each year for study at Cambridge University’s Corpus Christi College. The deadline for applications is 1 December. More information on the Girdlers’ Scholarship can be found on the Universities NZ website at www.universitiesnz.ac.nz.
