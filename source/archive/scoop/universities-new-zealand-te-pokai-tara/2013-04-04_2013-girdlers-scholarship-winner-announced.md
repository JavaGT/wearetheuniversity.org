Kerry Mackereth is looking forward to “experiencing the most revered place of higher learning in the world” when she begins studying for a degree at the Faculty of Human, Social and Political Science at Cambridge University later this year. The 18-year-old former Diocesan School for Girls and current University of Auckland student, has won the 2013 Girdlers’ Scholarship to study at Cambridge’s Corpus Christi College.

“To attend Cambridge at such a young age is the type of experience that students like myself would usually only dream of,” says Kerry.

Administered by Universities New Zealand-Te Pōkai Tara, the Scholarship is funded by the Girdlers’ Company, which traces its foundation back to medieval times as a craftsmen’s guild. The award, worth £25,000 per annum, is offered to one New Zealand “all-rounder” each year.

“We are delighted with Kerry’s well-deserved selection,” says Peter Trimingham of the Girdlers’ Company. “In addition to her outstanding academic abilities, she has a strong sense of social justice and personal integrity.”

“The Girdlers take great pride in supporting this award, which is symbolic of the Company’s warm and close relationship with New Zealand since 1933.”

Kerry will be New Zealand’s 49th Girdlers’ Scholar.

During her time at Diocesan School for Girls, Kerry excelled in her studies, and was named school Dux in 2012. She was awarded a University of Auckland Scholarship for 2013.

Kerry takes a keen interest in world affairs and was involved in the Human Rights Council and Model United Nations conferences.

In future, Kerry is looking to specialise in politics and international relations to pursue a career as a diplomat or to undertake a postgraduate degree in law specialising in international or human rights law. Kerry also has aspirations to work at the United Nations, the International Court of Justice or another non-governmental organisation. She is keen to return to New Zealand one day to work in politics or foreign affairs.

In addition to her academic excellence, Kerry has shown great dedication to charity work, such as Habitat for Humanity, and was recognised with a ZONTA National Young Woman Award in Public Affairs in 2012 for her community involvement.

Kerry is passionate about music and has sung and played piano for many years, and was a member of her school’s jazz band and chamber orchestra. She has also participated in sports including swimming, hockey and fencing.

Girdlers’ Scholarship – One award is given each year for study at Cambridge University’s Corpus Christi College. The deadline for applications is 1 December. More information on the Girdlers’ Scholarship can be found on the Universities New Zealand website at www.universitiesnz.ac.nz
