**Universities awarded 67% of science research funds**

The relevance and impact of university research has been recognised in this year’s Science Investment Round announced by Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today.

Chris Whelan, the Executive Director of Universities New Zealand, says, “It’s very pleasing to see that universities have won 67% of the successful proposals for new research programmes, collectively worth $53.8 million dollars.”

The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment received 157 proposals for funding in the 2015 Science Investment Round. The 48 successful proposals were selected by the Science Board following a robust review by independent experts.

Mr Whelan says, “We are delighted that the Minister values the importance of research-led science as a key driver of economic growth.

“The Minister has also demonstrated that he recognises the relevance and impact of the research being delivered by New Zealand’s universities, and acknowledges its contribution to New Zealand’s productivity and competitiveness.

“We are also pleased to see that all eight of New Zealand’s universities have been successful. This reinforces the high quality of New Zealand universities. All our universities are ranked within the top 3% in the world and each has at least one or more subjects ranked within the top 100 universities in the world,” says Mr Whelan.

“New Zealand’s universities, through their research and teaching, are proud to be contributing to New Zealand economic growth and social well-being.”
