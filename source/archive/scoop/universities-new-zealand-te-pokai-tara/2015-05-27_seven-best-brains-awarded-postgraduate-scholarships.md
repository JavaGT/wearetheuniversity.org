**Seven “best brains” awarded postgraduate scholarships**

Several young New Zealanders are heading offshore for their postgraduate study thanks to the William Georgetti Scholarships.

The scholarships were established by the late William Georgetti, a Hawkes Bay farmer, who wanted to create opportunities for the “best brains” to benefit from his bequest. The scholarships encourage postgraduate study and research in a field that is important to New Zealand’s social, cultural or economic development.

The 2015 scholarships were awarded to:

\- **Eloise Gibson** a journalist from Titirangi in Auckland, will study towards a Master of Arts in Journalism at Columbia University in New York. Eloise holds a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) with First Class Honours from the University of Waikato and a Postgraduate Diploma of Journalism from Auckland University of Technology. Eloise, who was a finalist in the 2010 Canon Media Awards for senior environment reporter of the year, is passionate about communicating science and environmental issues.

\- **Jade Leung** from Howick in Auckland will study a Masters of Philosophy (MPhil) in Environmental Policy at the University of Cambridge, UK. Jade has a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) from the University of Auckland which she completed in just three years, supported by an Edna Wadell Scholarship for Women in Engineering. Last year she was the Executive Officer of the P3 Foundation, a youth movement against extreme poverty. She remains the Learning and Change Manager for the not-for profit organisation, Engineers Without Borders New Zealand.
