New Universities New Zealand Chair keen to enhance universities’ contribution

1 July 2013

Professor Roy Crawford, Vice-Chancellor at the University of Waikato, has been appointed Chair of Universities New Zealand – Te Pōkai Tara.

Universities NZ represents and advocates on behalf of the country’s eight universities to promote the interests of students, staff and the higher education sector.

Professor Crawford says that as Vice-Chancellor at Waikato for the past eight years he has been tremendously impressed at how closely the universities work together.

As Chair he will be focussed on promoting a stronger working relationship with the government to enhance the contribution of universities to New Zealand’s economic and social development.

“The universities collectively are a very important national asset, but to a large extent they are under-utilised in New Zealand. Universities can make a major contribution to the national economy

by developing a well-educated workforce, undertaking research in a broad range of areas, providing informed, evidence-based input towards policies and strategies, and providing an independent

forum for discussing important national and international issues.”

He will also aim to promote stronger research collaboration between the universities, crown research institutes and other research organisations to address complex, multidisciplinary issues facing modern societies.

Professor Crawford is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering and previously held the senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor position at Queen’s University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he had special responsibility for research and development.

He has a BsC, PhD and DSc from Queen’s University and has published eight books and over 300 papers. He has also served on numerous government panels and research grant committees.

Professor Crawford takes over from Victoria University Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh, who will serve as Deputy Chair until the end of 2013.
