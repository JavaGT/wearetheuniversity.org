**Report confirms NZ university audit system of highest international standard**

6 December 2015

An international external panel has found that New Zealand’s university academic audit system meets the highest standards of independence and integrity.

The independent review of the Academic Quality Agency (AQA) was commissioned by Universities New Zealand as part of a regular review to assess how effectively it assists Universities New Zealand to discharge its responsibilities for quality assurance under the Education Act. It also considered how well AQA meets its own objectives as well as international standards of good practice.

Professor Harlene Hayne, who is Chair of Universities New Zealand and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago, says New Zealanders can be justifiably proud of the quality and integrity of New Zealand’s universities.

Professor Hayne says, “This review shows that the New Zealand university system is of a high quality. Both domestic and international students can be assured that they are studying at internationally competitive institutions. And it also demonstrates that our universities are continually striving to improve educational outcomes through ongoing self-assessment.”

“The integrity of our system is a key reason that we are the only country in the world to have all its universities ranked in the top 500 (3%) globally.”

The review was informed by AQA’s Self-Review Report and supporting documentation, as well as interviews with 40 stakeholders and 22 written submissions.

“We are proud of New Zealand’s robust academic quality assurance process”.

"AQA was established by Universities New Zealand to oversee the academic quality assurance for all New Zealand universities. AQA’s five yearly audits are based on peer review and supporting evidence. They are externally benchmarked and focused on quality enhancement rather than compliance.”

University Vice-Chancellors commended the work of the AQA team, especially its Director Dr Jan Cameron who retires in February after six years in the role.
