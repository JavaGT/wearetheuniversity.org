Universities welcome National Statement of Science Investment

Universities New Zealand has welcomed the National Statement of Science Investment released by the Government today.

The Executive Director of Universities New Zealand, Chris Whelan, says this is a critical document as it sets out the Government’s ten-year strategic direction that will guide future investment in New Zealand’s science system.

“We commend Minister Joyce for listening to the submissions made by the research community. This strategy aspires to create a system that is more simple and transparent, and is focused on making a difference to New Zealand society, businesses and individuals.

“New Zealand’s universities welcome the new dual focus on supporting high quality research that is also likely to have an economic, cultural or social impact on New Zealand.

“We are delighted to see that the strategy is not just about generating knowledge for business. The strategy also aims to support the development of new knowledge and ideas, and to develop them in ways that will benefit New Zealand. We are pleased the strategy recognises that most applied commercial research builds upon fundamental pure research.”

Mr Whelan says the move to one fund, and having more streamlined processes, will also be welcomed by all of this country's researchers.

“In addition, we welcome the proposal to create a plan for international science engagement. Our university system can best serve New Zealand if it is able to work with researchers from around the world. We need mechanisms to attract world-class researchers to New Zealand to live and contribute to research in this country.

“The review of the Marsden Fund, released last week, clearly showed that a lot of important research is simply not being done, as that there is not enough money available in the current system to fund proposals being put forward.”

Chris Whelan noted that Marsden fund has had a significant impact on the amount of internationally-cited research that is produced in this country. “This research enhances the international rankings of our universities helping us to succeed in an increasingly competitive international market.

“We therefore warmly welcome the Government's commitment to lifting expenditure on research and development from around 0.67% to 0.8% of GDP. This is in line with the expenditure of other comparable countries. It also reflects the urgent need to invest in solutions to the environmental, economic, geographic and social challenges that New Zealand faces.

“Universities currently account for 33% of research and development activity in New Zealand. We therefore look forward to working with the Government on implementing the changes to the science funding system,” says Chris Whelan.
