Baritone, Soprano and Double bassist win Patricia Pratt Scholarships

Baritone Benson Wilson, Soprano Isabella Moore and Double bassist Alexander Verster have been awarded the 2016 Patricia Pratt Scholarships in Musical Performance enabling them to continue their postgraduate development at renowned international music schools.

Benson Wilson has been awarded $5,000 towards the Guildhall Artist Masters in Opera Studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. A New Zealand-born Samoan, he has been described as potentially one of the finest baritones to emerge from New Zealand. Benson was the runner up in the 2014 Lexus Song Quest and won significant awards at the 2015 IFAC Australian Singing Competition. Last year he completed a Bachelor of Music (Honours) majoring in Classical Performance from the University of Auckland.

Isabella Moore has been awarded $10,000 towards a Postgraduate Diploma in voice performance at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. The Chair of their Voice Department has described the soprano as having extraordinary abilities. Isabella has a Bachelor of Music (Voice) and Postgraduate Diploma of Music, both from Victoria University as well as a Master of Arts in Advanced Vocal Studies from the University of Wales. Isabella won the Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge Bel Canto Award in Sydney last year and the Lexus Song Quest and New Zealand Aria in 2014.

Alex Verster has been awarded $25,000 to study for a Master of Fine Arts Creative Practice at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London. Alex has a Bachelor of Music in Jazz Performance from Victoria University. However, he recently made the move to Classical, taking up study at the Trinity Conservatoire and shocking Trinity’s Head of Strings with his rapid progress. Alex has just performed in London’s Festival Hall with the New London Orchestra. As well as helping fund his studies, the award will contribute towards the purchase of a double bass.

Violinist Olivia Francis, a Patricia Pratt scholar from 2015, has been awarded an additional $10,000 to pursue her postgraduate study in Europe.

The Convenor of the Selection Panel, David Bremner, congratulated the scholars and wished them well with their international music careers. He also acknowledged the Kia Ora Foundation for their support.

“Through the generosity of the Kia Ora Foundation, talented New Zealand classical performers can further their study at renowned institutions and achieve international recognition,” he said.

The Scholarship has been established by Annette Campbell-White, founder of the Kia Ora Foundation, in memory of her mother, Patricia Pratt. It assists outstanding young New Zealand musicians to continue their musical development at a renowned international music school or Conservatorium for up to two years. The scholarships are awarded for classical music performance, including vocal or instrumental performance or conducting.

Universities New Zealand, also known as New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, administers this scholarship in addition to over 40 undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships each year. Applications for the 2017 Patricia Pratt Scholarships close on 1 March next year.
