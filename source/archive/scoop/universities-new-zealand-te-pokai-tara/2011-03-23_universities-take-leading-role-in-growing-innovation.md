### Universities take leading role in growing innovation

A survey released by Statistics New Zealand, in association with the Ministry of Science and Innovation (MSI), shows that universities undertook $802 million worth of research and development (R&D) in 2010, a third of the nation’s total R&D spend.

The biennial Research and Development Survey measures the level of R&D activity by the private sector, government departments and agencies, and universities. Since the last survey in 2008, university R&D increased by 23% from $653 million to $802. New Zealand’s total R&D expenditure increased 13% during this period.

“These figures demonstrate the leadership that the university sector is taking to grow R&D in New Zealand,” says Professor Stuart McCutcheon, Chair of Universities New Zealand’s Research Committee. “The survey underscores the significant contribution that universities make to New Zealand’s economic, social and environmental development through their R&D activities, delivering practical, clever and profitable innovations for New Zealanders.”

While R&D activity has grown since 2008, both in terms of the total spend and as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), New Zealand’s total R&D expenditure continues to be relatively low compared with other countries in the OECD

“Increased collaboration between the private sector, government and universities is needed in order to boost the individual R&D efforts of each sector,” says McCutcheon. “In an effort to achieve this, last year the universities developed a series of events to showcase their R&D capabilities to business. This initiative has been well received and the events will continue during the remainder of 2011.”

Universities are the largest research organisations in New Zealand. They employ over half the country’s research staff, have the bulk of its fundamental research capability and train nearly all its postgraduate students - the researchers and professionals of the future that the country will rely upon to drive innovation and productivity.
