The 2023 winner of the award will be following in the footsteps of this year’s winner, Janet Hoek, a Professor of Public Health at the University of Otago, Wellington, and co-director of the university’s ASPIRE 2025 Research Centre, which conducts research to support the Government’s smokefree 2025 goal.

Other previous winners have been Professor Alexander Gillespie from The University of Waikato and Associate Professor Siouxsie Wiles from Waipapa Taumata Rau, University of Auckland (2021), Professor Michael Baker and Professor Anita Gibbs from the University of Otago (2020), Professor Andrew Geddis from the University of Otago (2019), Professor Ann Brower from the University of Canterbury (2018) and Dr Mike Joy from Te Herenga Waka – Victoria University of Wellington (2017).

The award, sponsored by philanthropic trust The Gama Foundation (whose Grant and Marilyn Nelson are pictured with Professor Hoek), aims to encourage academics to fulfil their role under the Education and Training Act 2020, which requires universities to act as the critic and conscience of society.

Each year, the award is given to an academic staff member who, in the opinion of a panel of three independent judges, has done more in the past two calendar years than any other applicant to provide the public with independent, expert commentary on an issue or issues affecting the New Zealand community or future generations.
