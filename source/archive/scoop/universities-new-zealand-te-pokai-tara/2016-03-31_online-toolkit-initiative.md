**Online toolkit initiative could see more Māori and Pasifika go to University**

31 March 2016

Universities New Zealand has welcomed an online toolkit developed by Starpath which could help increase numbers of Māori, Pasifika, and students from low decile schools, studying at university.

Chris Whelan, Executive Director of Universities New Zealand says, “Universities want to see more young Māori, Pasifika and first in family students taking their place at university.

“We therefore welcome this data-informed toolkit. It will help to shape students’ aspirations and planning, to put more students on a university pathway.

“From there, universities can work with these students to ensure they succeed at university.”

The free toolkit includes checklists for NCEA attainment and University Entrance; embeds data utilisation skills among staff; enables better academic planning; and will help improve engagement with students and their families and whanau.

Currently approximately 11% of university students are Māori and 8% are Pasifika students.

Chris Whelan says another gap preventing capable students from going to university, is the lack of quality career and course planning information for potential students and careers advisors.

“Universities New Zealand recommends the development of a national strategy and programme. This would see secondary students receiving quality advice and make informed course choices - even as early as year 8.”
