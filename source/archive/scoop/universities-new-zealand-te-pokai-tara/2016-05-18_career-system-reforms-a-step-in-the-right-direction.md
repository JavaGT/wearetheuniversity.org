Career system reforms a step in the right direction

Universities New Zealand has described government reforms to give secondary students better access to high quality and accurate careers advice as a step in the right direction.

Government has announced today that Careers New Zealand will become part of the Tertiary Education Commission and careers services in schools are to be reviewed.

Chris Whelan, Executive Director of Universities New Zealand, describes the current careers information system as a mishmash.

“The problem is that there are too many government agencies, schools and providers producing different and often poor quality or incomplete information. Within schools, the quality and amount of careers advice varies significantly, meaning many students aren’t getting the advice or information they need to make the best study and career choices.

He says school students need to be thinking about their broad career pathway as early as their first or second year at secondary school, so they are taking the right subjects as they move into NCEA.

“We therefore welcome reforms that will ensure a more joined-up system, delivering more consistent information.

“Universities New Zealand has long argued that the traditional guidance counselling and careers planning functions in schools should receive professional guidance from one national body. The sooner this critical function is given the recognition and support it deserves the better it will be for this country’s young people.”

Though Careers NZ will become part of the TEC, Chris Whelan hopes that the knowledge and experience of Careers NZ will be retained and built upon.

“Careers New Zealand has been the one part of the system that has been working particularly well in providing advice and support to young New Zealanders. They have good systems, good people and effective leadership. New Zealand universities hope that this merger will recognise and build upon these strengths.”
