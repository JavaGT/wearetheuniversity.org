**2012 Windle Scholarship Winner to Study Law at Cambridge**

Sam Bird is looking forward to beginning his studies for a law degree at Cambridge University later this year. The 18-year-old former Christ’s College and current Victoria University of Wellington student, has won the 2012 Peter Windle Scholarship to study at Cambridge’s Corpus Christi College.

Administered by Universities New Zealand-Te Pōkai Tara, the Peter Windle Scholarship was established in 2008 and is made available through the generosity of the late Mr Peter Windle. The scholarship provides an opportunity for top South Island students to undertake a first degree at one of the most prestigious universities in the world. It pays for tuition fees, a living allowance and a return economy airfare to England. The scholarship is offered every three years, making Sam the second Peter Windle Scholar.

During his time at Christ’s College, Sam excelled in his studies, winning prizes in History and English, gaining Excellence endorsements in all levels of NCEA, and achieving Scholarship in Economics and Outstanding Scholarship in English and History in year 13.

In addition to academic ability, the scholarship takes into account other factors such as character, qualities of leadership, contribution to cultural and sporting activities and the intention to bring back benefits from the scholarship to New Zealand.

Sam has been described as a young man of rare academic calibre, responsibility, and personal integrity. He is a keen singer and was a member of Christ’s College’s Chapel Choir and the smaller a cappella Schola Cantorum choir. It was on the Chapel Choir’s three-week tour to Europe in 2011 that Sam proved his leadership abilities as a role model and a dependable asset to staff. Sam is passionate about cricket, having played for both school and representative teams, and he enjoys a round of golf.

He credits his consciousness of injustice and his respect for the importance of law as driving his decision to study law at Cambridge. When he returns to New Zealand he hopes to be able to apply his degree advocating for the rights and privileges of all, regardless of their social standing. According to Sam, a career as a lawyer, in government, or as a public servant, are all relevant options.

  
Peter Windle Scholarship – One award is given every three years for study at Cambridge University’s Corpus Christi College. More information on the Scholarship can be found on the Universities NZ website at www.universitiesnz.ac.nz.
