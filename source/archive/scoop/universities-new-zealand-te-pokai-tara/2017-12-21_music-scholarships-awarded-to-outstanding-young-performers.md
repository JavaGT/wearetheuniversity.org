**Kiwi Music Scholarships Awarded to Outstanding Young Performers**

  
Five talented young performers have been awarded Kiwi Music Scholarships to continue their musical development.

He has been awarded $20,000 to continue his Artist Diploma studies at the Guildhall School of Music in London, where he is studying with Professor David Takeno. In November last year he won the Guildhall’s viola competition which led to a performance in St-Martin-in-the-Fields. He also won the University of London Symphony Orchestra’s Concerto Competition, which gave him the opportunity to play a concerto with the orchestra this year. He also won a scholarship to attend the International Musicians’ Seminar Prussia Cove in 2017, one of the world’s most renowned master class programmes. He has also played in very successful string quartets in both years of study at Guildhall and regularly plays Principal Viola with the Guildhall Symphony Orchestra, including under the baton of Sir Simon Rattle. His aim is to continue improving his playing, with a focus on chamber and orchestral performing, in order to prepare himself for forging a career as a musician.

Lexus Song Quest winner, **Benson Wilson,** aged 26, has been awarded $10,000 to continue his Artist Masters studies at London’s Guildhall. There the baritone is studying with vocal tutor Robert Dean and vocal coach Linnhe Robertson. He has been described by the head of vocal studies as one of the most talented singers and performers to have joined the Vocal Department in recent years. He graduated from the University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Music with Honours in 2014. During 2017, he played the role of Schabernack in Le Grand Macabre with the London Symphony Orchestra’s Conductor Sir Simon Rattle. Over the next year he proposes to capitalise on performance opportunities in the UK.

“These are some of the finest young musicians this country has produced in recent years. I know they will embrace the opportunities the Kiwi Music Scholarship offers. The panel members and I will follow their future careers with great interest and high expectations.”

The Kiwi Music Scholarship was established in 2009 by Mr Sven Stenbäck in memory of his wife Maida Stenbäck née Saunders, a New Zealander who loved classical music. Funding for the scholarship is made available through the Kiwi Music Scholarship Trust.

The scholarship is to assist New Zealand citizens who have demonstrated accomplishment in musical performance (including vocal performance) or conducting, to enable them to further their musical education.
