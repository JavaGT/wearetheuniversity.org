**Robertson Scholarship takes Kiwis to US universities**

Two former head girls of schools in Auckland and New Plymouth have won scholarships to esteemed universities in the United States.

Brenna Cukier from St Heliers, Auckland is off to pursue her passion for journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill while Paige Muggeridge from New Plymouth will study economics and finance at Chapel Hill and nearby Duke University.

Their scholarships, funded by New York philanthropist Julian Robertson, provide free tuition and board and a living allowance for up to four years.

**Brenna Cukier**, who will take a bachelors degree majoring in journalism, was Head Girl at Glendowie College last year, winning the school’s top special award for “outstanding character and sense of values”. She achieved all NCEA Levels 1-3 with Excellence and obtained an Outstanding Scholarship in English.

Last year Brenna was awarded the Public Speaking Cup, an award she won for four consecutive years, and was also the first recipient of the Senior Writing Cup.

One of her longest commitments was to the school debating team, where she won the title of Second Best Speaker of 74 entrants in the Eastern Region.

As well as serving as president of the Student Council, she was elected Student Representative on her school’s Board of Trustees. She was also elected as her school’s representative on the Auckland City Youth Council.

Brenna’s proudest achievement is that she founded her school’s student-run newspaper, leading a strong team of contributors as Editor-in-Chief. She has written for the College section of the New Zealand Herald, and gained work experience at Next, North & South and Metro magazines.

Magazine and television journalism both appeal to her. "The journalism school at the University of North Carolina has such an amazing curriculum, so I don't want to commit myself to one facet just yet. Regardless of whether I follow in the steps of Anna Wintour or Katie Couric, I want to combine my passion for journalism with my leadership skills to make a difference in the media industry.

"I visited eight of the top journalism schools in the US and found everything I was looking for at UNC. There are so many incredible opportunities to expand my horizons, contribute to the community and challenge myself. I am proud to be a Tar Heel (nickname for students at UNC)!" Most importantly, she knows that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is “the right school for me”, offering “the best of both worlds — a great education and an incomparable campus life”.

**Paige Muggeridge**, who will enrol in an economics and finance degree, was both Head Girl and Dux Literati of New Plymouth Girls’ High School last year. She was top in Year 13 accounting, economics, statistics, calculus, chemistry extension and physics extension.

In Year 12 she gained NCEA Level 3 with Excellence and New Zealand Scholarships in English and chemistry, undertaking an extension programme at Level 3. In Year 13 Paige gained a further four scholarships including an Outstanding Scholarship for accounting, which was also first in New Zealand.

At school she played netball, basketball and volleyball, and was the runner in a triathlon team. An outstanding public speaker she was a finalist last year in the National Lion’s Speech Competition and the National Bank Cyril Bassett VC Speech Competition.

Paige is the Youth Member of Parliament for New Plymouth and was in the New Zealand delegation that attended the International Model United Nations Conference at The Hague in 2010.

She says studying at Chapel Hill and Duke will “enhance the next stage of my tertiary studies beyond belief. The educational opportunities at both universities, especially in the Faculty of Business, are of a world class standard.”

Paige is aiming for a career in business management in New Zealand, whether in a national or multi-national company. “I want to make a difference to the New Zealand economy through effective business management and leadership.”

Up to three Robertson Scholarships, worth $NZ100,000 a year, are offered annually in New Zealand, two in Australia, one in Sweden and 24 in the United States. Selection is based on academic ability, commitment to community service, courage, collaborative spirit and a strongly ethical outlook.

Julian Robertson, who has long spent part of each year in New Zealand, and his late wife Jose established the Robertson Programme in 2000 with a $US24 million gift. Mr Robertson founded the Tiger Management hedge fund, and their generosity has benefited other causes in this country including the Auckland Art Gallery.

The Robertson Scholars Programme is administered by Universities New Zealand — Te Pokai Tara. The deadline for applications is 1 December. More information on the scholarship can be found at www.universitiesnz.ac.nz
