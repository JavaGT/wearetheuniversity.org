Claims On Maori Health Illogical

Press Releases -- Health

ACT New Zealand Leader Richard Prebble today said claims by health academics, that Rogernomics is to blame for poor Maori health statistics are as silly as claiming that Rogernomics makes pakeha live longer.

"If these academics are to be believed, then this would be the \`logical' conclusion. It is time we had some frank discussion - the real reason pakeha New Zealanders are living longer is that the message of personal responsibility on health is getting through," Mr Prebble said.

"What has this to do with economics? Nothing, other than the fact that quitting smoking, drinking less and watching your diet saves money - and going for a walk every day is free.

"Telling Maori that their health is a result of their race is just wrong. It is time for someone in Government to also say there is not enough money in the whole country - even if tax was 100 percent - to pay for a health system needed when people are overweight, smoke and refuse to exercise.

"The actual answer is Rogernomics and personal responsibility," Mr Prebble said.
