Pressure on WINZ was worth it - Newman

Media Release -- Social Welfare

ACT social welfare spokesman Muriel Newman is pleased that public pressure by ACT has finally led to a review of WINZ.

"Steve Maharey promised to investigate Christine Rankin's performance before the last election yet when he became Minister he developed amnesia and started endorsing her," Dr Newman said.

"Christine Rankin is the head of a government department that blatantly mistreats its customers. WINZ have repeatedly let down students throughout the country and last week's community services card fiasco caused great anxiety for many retired people.

"No matter what format WINZ eventually ends up in it will still have to meet the same standard.

"The litmus-test for WINZ will be and should always have been its success in getting the 25,000 at risk families throughout New Zealand into work," Dr Newman said.
