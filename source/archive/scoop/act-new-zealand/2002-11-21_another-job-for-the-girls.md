Another Job for the Girls

ACT Leader Richard Prebble said today that the only possible explanation for Miss Lee's appointment to this tiny island is that Helen Clark's former ally needs a job in the sun and they couldn't trust her to go anywhere else.

"There has been no census of the population of Niue for over 20 years. The Niue Government claims that the population is 3,000 but I was told that everyone - man, woman and child - attended Sir Robert Rex's funeral and I did my own count which was just over 900.

"So Miss Lee is a High Commissioner to a country of less than a thousand people. Even that is an appointment somewhat above her capabilities.

"Another job for the girls," said Mr Prebble.
