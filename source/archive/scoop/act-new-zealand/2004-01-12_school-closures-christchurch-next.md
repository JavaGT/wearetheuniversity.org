School Closures: Christchurch Next?

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today urged Christchurch principals, boards of trustees, teachers, parents and students to fight any attempts by the Labour Government to implement a round of network reviews in the area - a precursor to school closures.

"Education Ministry officials recently met with representatives from schools within the Christchurch area to discuss the schools' future structure. The Ministry has denied a review is imminent, but schools have reason to fear such an outcome," Miss Coddington said.

"Education Minister Trevor Mallard has shown an insatiable appetite for closing schools - he plans to close over 300 in the next seven years. Despite Education Ministry denials, a review of Christchurch schools appears inevitable.

"The Ministry is currently reviewing the future of 168 New Zealand schools. It begs the question: where are the remaining schools going to come from? A safe bet would be on Christchurch.

"Christchurch people should remain vigilant for Mr Mallard's creeping school closures. Communities must stand firm against this Labour Government's misguided culling of schools. If they don't, schools will simply vanish, never to return," Miss Coddington said.
