ACT: Tertiary report election-year window dressing

Tertiary report election-year window dressing - ACT

ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington today labelled Labour’s report-back on the tertiary education sector as election-year window dressing.

“Nothing can change the fact that Labour has made an absolute dog’s breakfast of tertiary education and Trevor Mallard is now blaming the bureaucrats,” Miss Coddington said.

“This report will not recover the millions of taxpayer dollars Labour has shovelled into tertiary institutions without demanding anything in return in the way of accountability or standards.

“Wasting taxpayers’ money on dodgy courses which masquerade as ‘education’ and hide true unemployment figures will be Labour’s tertiary education legacy.

“Meanwhile, many students who completed expensive courses, for example, diving instructors or helicopter pilots have got huge loans to repay. Others who ‘studied’ life skills, twilight golf or sing-along Maori have been victims of a cruel funding system.

“ACT will scrap taxpayer-funding of low quality, dead-end courses and stop the bums-on-seats funding culture that has spiralled out-of- control under Labour.

“Only a Party Vote for ACT this election will ensure excellence, standards and accountability are returned to the tertiary education sector,” Miss Coddington said.
