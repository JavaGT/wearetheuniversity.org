Serve DoC With Trespass Notices, Urges Eckhoff

Monday 20 Sep 2004

Gerry Eckhoff - Press Releases - Rural

ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman and Otago-based MP Gerry Eckhoff today accused the Conservation Department of adopting standover tactics in an effort to impose its values over the rights of private property owners.

"DoC appears to be determined to impose a marginal strip on a Wanaka farming family when it seems it can show no legal right to do so," Mr Eckhoff said.

"Any landowner faced with such tactics by this out of control Government department should immediately issue DoC and its agents with a trespass notice.

"It is very clear that the goodwill long extended by pastoral lessees to the public will come to an end if the department continues with its relentless campaign to undermine private property rights in this country.

"I would encourage every landowner who feels under any threat, real or imagined, to issue DoC with a trespass notice stopping its staff from being allowed on their property until Labour scraps its madcap proposal to force farmers to open their land to public access.

"If farmers don't defend their land today, their children will have nothing to thank them for tomorrow," Mr Eckhoff said.
