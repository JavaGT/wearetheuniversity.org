Govt admits defeat on charter schools
=====================================

**Tuesday, 24 July 2018, 3:44 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

The Government today has admitted defeat on charter schools by allowing six to remain open, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

"However, there is still uncertainty over one school thanks to ministerial incompetence.

"Chris Hipkins has finally come to the realisation that the schools are lifting engagement and achievement for about 1500 students.

"Charter schools are a popular ACT idea - 57 per cent of New Zealanders believe they should stay open.

"An independent MartinJenkins report showed the schools are strongly focused on disadvantaged kids with complex needs - largely Maori and Pasifika from low-decile schools.

"They are driven by a vision to provide an alternative for students who have been underserved by state schools.

"It is no exaggeration to say they are the most positive development in our education system for some time.

"There should no doubt whatsoever: if ACT forms part of the next Government it will fight to open more charter schools, providing choice for parents and students underserved by the state system.
