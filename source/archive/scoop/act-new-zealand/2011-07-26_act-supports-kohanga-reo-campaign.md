ACT Supports Kohanga Reo Campaign

**ACT Supports Kohanga Reo Campaign**

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman John Boscawen today offered ACT’s support to the Kohanga Reo Early Childhood Education campaign, stating that it is ridiculous to make cuts to their funding simply because Kohanga Reo teachers don’t have a particular piece of paper on their wall.

“ACT has long held the view that a teaching qualification isn’t necessary to make someone a great teacher. There are many people who don’t hold any formal teaching qualifications who do a far better job than those with the necessary certificate,” Mr Boscawen said.

“Kohanga Reo play an invaluable role in our education system - providing more diversity and giving parents more choice. It seems nonsensical that kaumatua, who have years of experience in their own culture, need a certificate to teach children about that culture and their own Maori language.

“Funding of quality education should be based on student outcomes and not teacher qualification one-upmanship. Early childhood education already has checks and balances in place to monitor each centre’s performance. Any early childhood centre not meeting expectations, Kohanga Reo or otherwise, risk having their funding cut and rightly so.

“But to penalise Kohanga Reo simply because some bureaucrat has decided that early childhood teachers need a qualification is nonsense. If they are performing and performing well just let them get on with the job,” Mr Boscawen said.
