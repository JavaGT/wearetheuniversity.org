ACT Set To Deliver ECA Facts To Employers
=========================================

**Thursday, 24 August 2000, 4:50 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT is beginning in Otago tomorrow, a nation-wide series of seminars on the Employment Relations Act, said ACT Leader Hon Richard Prebble.

The seminar will be held at Cargills Restaurant, George street, Dunedin at 12pm. This will be the first of more than 20 seminars on the Act.

The ACT party will be pointing out the numerous loopholes in the new union promoting law. ACT will be posting a copy of the seminar handout on the ACT website. [http://www.act.org.nz/action/employment/loopholes.htm](http://www.act.org.nz/action/employment/loopholes.htm)

“ACT believes it has identified at least 25 loopholes and will be sharing these with concerned employers and employees around New Zealand. The loopholes include:

 Through bad drafting it appears trade unions have no right to represent employees seeking an individual contract.

 Strike prone companies should consider employing all staff in a service company that then contracts to the firm.

 Employers can seek to have individual contracts set aside on the basis that they were not given independent advice.

 Employers and their employees can before October 2 form in-house unions.

 It is arguable that a union member can only be employed after a collective agreement has been agreed with the union.

“It is clear in the Act that wild cat strikes, threats and intimidation are illegal and that offenders can be subject to a compliance order and/or a large fine.

“ACT is advising employees not to hesitate to take unions, union officials and employees to the Authority when they do not act in good faith,” said Hon Richard Prebble.
