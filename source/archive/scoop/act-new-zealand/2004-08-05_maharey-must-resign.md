Maharey Must Resign

Thursday 5 Aug 2004

Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today demanded that Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey resign, after a report confirmed that Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology wrongly spent over $80,000 to attract students.

"The buck should stop with the Minister. CPIT broke the rules and misused taxpayers' money on book vouchers to entice students to enrol in its Cool-IT course.

"While I am pleased that this mis-spent money is to be re-paid, the matter should not be allowed to simply end there.

"This report, by the Tertiary Education Commission, highlights Mr Maharey's incompetence. He clearly does not have a good handle on his portfolio and is not up to the job of Minister. He should do the honourable thing and resign," Miss Coddington said.
