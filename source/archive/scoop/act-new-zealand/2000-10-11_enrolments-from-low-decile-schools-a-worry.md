Enrolments From Low Decile Schools a Worry
==========================================

“Abysmal” first-year university enrolments from low-decile schools is a good reason for the Government to again consider introducing a Targeted Individual Entitlement scheme, ACT Education spokeswoman Donna Awatere Huata said today.

A survey showed that 68 per cent of school leavers who enrolled at Canterbury University this year, were from high-decile schools and only one student came from a low-decile school.

Mrs Huata said the university was so worried about the situation, it had set up an equal opportunities committee to investigate the issue.

“Here is a classic case how a Targeted Entitlement Scheme could address the imbalance for low income families, keen to see their children get a university education,” she said.

The ACT promoted scheme was established to enable children from families with a taxable income of less than $25,000 and not “asset rich enough,” to attend a school or learning educational institution of their choice.

Three University of Otago research reports clearly demonstrated that low income students on a trial TIE, scheme closed the educational gaps.

“As long as the Government continues to be blinked to any ideas other than its own, the educational gap for low-income families will continue to widen, and the Canterbury experience will continue to be repeated throughout the whole country,” Mrs Huata said.
