1st Anniversary of the End of Life Choice Bill
==============================================

**Thursday, 13 December 2018, 7:12 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

“One year on from the first reading of the End of Life Choice Bill in Parliament, I have released a Sponsor’s Report outlining recommendations on how the Bill might be improved,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“One year ago today 76 Members of Parliament voted for the End of Life Choice Bill to pass through first reading, be considered by a select committee, and to allow the public to share their views on assisted dying,” says Mr Seymour.

“The Bill received the largest number of submissions in recent parliamentary history and will have been considered for a record 15 months when the Justice Committee reports back to Parliament on 27 March 2019.

“Over the past 12 months I have spoken with thousands of members of the public at 27 End of Life Choice public meetings from Kerikeri to Gore, consulted with representatives of disability, pharmacy, nursing and medical organisations, read submissions from all national organisations and listened to public submissions.

“I have taken the public’s views on board, analysed extensive overseas evidence from jurisdictions with assisted dying laws and set out my findings and recommendations for amendments to the Bill in a 73-page Sponsor’s Report."

In summary, the report suggests:

\- a binding referendum on the commencement of the Bill at the General Election

\- amending the eligibility criteria to limit eligibility to terminal illness

\- for avoidance of doubt, stating that access to assisted dying cannot be by reason of mental health conditions and disabilities only

\- incorporating the Access to Palliative Care Bill sponsored by Maggie Barry MP
