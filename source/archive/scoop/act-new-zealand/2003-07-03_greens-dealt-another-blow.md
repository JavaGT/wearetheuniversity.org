Greens Dealt Another Blow

Thursday 3 Jul 2003 Gerry Eckhoff Press Releases -- Rural

ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff today said that the lifting of the ban on GM food into the EU, and the lowering of the accidental \`contamination' of GM products to 0.9 percent, was a major step towards full acceptance that genetically-modified products can be beneficial to farmers and consumers.

"As well as that, the Green Party has been dealt another blow to its King Canute-like belief that it can stem the tide of science," Mr Eckhoff said.

"Even the Greens admit that thousands of products containing GM ingredients have been eaten for years without any ill effects on consumers and the environment. Now they want people to realize that what they have eaten for years - while containing minute amounts of GM material - has done them no harm, but that they should be upset anyway.

"Sue Kedgley can stick her finger in the GM dyke all she likes, it's not going to stop final acceptance by consumers," Mr Eckhoff said.
