ERB Has Already Lost Ten Thousand Jobs
======================================

**Thursday, 3 August 2000, 2:51 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Ten thousand jobs no longer exist because of business concern over the Employment Relations Bill, said ACT Leader, Hon Richard Prebble.

Today’s Household Labour Force Survey shows that the number of jobs in New Zealand, seasonally adjusted, has dropped from 1,770 to 1,760 (thousand) over the last two quarters. Job growth has been positive every quarter for the previous two years.

“Channel Nine spin can not cover up the reality of New Zealand’s business sector. New Zealand employers are terrified of the Employment Relations Bill.

“New Zealand’s positive growth should see the number of jobs expanding, instead the dramatic fall shows that the ERB is already having a profoundly negative impact on the employment market.

“The radical powers the Employment Relations Bill bestows on labour inspectors, the new ‘Industrial Gestapo’, has not gone unnoticed by employers.

“These labour inspectors can enter a workplace at any time without a search warrant. They can inspect an employers books and issue “demand notices” – in effect instant fines.

“I predicted the Authority would be stacked with retired trade union officials and failed Labour and Alliance candidates. From today’s results it would seem New Zealand employers agree.

“Why would a hard working New Zealander, take the risk of setting up a business to create wealth and employ a fellow Kiwi(s), when the ERB puts them at the mercy of a union.  
“Labour was only able to make this assault on the sanctity of contract, the rule of law and property rights, because National was a poor guardian. National intends to campaign on a return to the Employment Contract Act.  
“ACT intends to campaign on a policy of a fresh new approach and will return to the best of the Employment Contracts Act, but with a more flexible approach.  
“The Government must stop believing its own spin and look at the objective, hard facts of the New Zealand economy,” said Hon Richard Prebble
