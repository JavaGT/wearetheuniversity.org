What Is A Maharey Promise Worth?

Tuesday 3 Sep 2002

Social Services and Employment Minister Steve Maharey should explain how he could assure parliament that health contracts with Te Hauora o te Tai Tokerau Trust (THOTT) had been checked and were fine only days before the contracts worth almost $1 million were cancelled, ACT Associate Health Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.

"Last week Mr Maharey assured Parliament that only CYF contracts with THOTT were under serious question and that "having checked the health funding" worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, there were no problems, and the money would continue to be paid.

"Yet yesterday, the Northland District Health Board cancelled the contracts over growing concerns of serious financial mismanagement.

"It is difficult to believe that the health contracts were in great shape just five days before being cancelled, and it calls into question whether the minister's statement in the House was based on robust advice, or whether it was cheap political grandstanding," Dr Newman asked.
