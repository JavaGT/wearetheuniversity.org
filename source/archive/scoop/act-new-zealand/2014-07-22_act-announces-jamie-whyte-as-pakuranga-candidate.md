ACT announces Jamie Whyte as Pakuranga candidate

  
ACT is pleased to announce Dr Jamie Whyte as its candidate in Pakuranga.

Dr Whyte was elected ACT Leader in February. Since then he has been travelling around the country meeting New Zealanders and talking about ACT’s key messages of low, flat tax, cutting green tape, getting tough on crime, and “one country, one law.”

“ACT’s policy of three strikes for burglary, which would put serial burglars in prison for at least three years, will particularly appeal to Pakuranga residents,” says Dr Whyte.

“While I am campaigning strictly for the party vote, ACT’s policies will go a long way to making Pakuranga more prosperous, and its streets and homes safer.”

Dr Whyte has close ties with Pakuranga, having attended Mellons Bay Primary, Bucklands Beach Intermediate (BBI) and Pakuranga College.

Until returning to New Zealand from London last year, Dr Whyte was the Head of Research and Publishing at Oliver Wyman Financial Services. He is a fellow of the Institute of Economic Affairs and a senior fellow of the Adam Smith Institute. His opinion piece, arguing that the Greens’ emissions policy was about moral grandstanding rather than reducing emissions, was published last week in the Wall Street Journal.

Dr Whyte recently also won the Institute of Economic Affairs’ Seldon Award for his publication Quack Policy – Abusing Science in the Cause of Paternalism.

“No other candidate – or party leader in New Zealand, for that matter – can lay claim to being regularly published in the Wall Street Journal or winning awards for their writing,” says ACT President John Thompson.

“ACT is very proud of its leader and Pakuranga candidate.”
