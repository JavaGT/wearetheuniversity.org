No ‘success’ for students living on couches

No ‘success’ for students living on couches

  
“The Prime Minister is out of touch with students currently enduring a chronic housing shortage,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“If you're one of the countless students currently living on a couch, or in a garage, or with parents an hour away from uni, or in an over-full, tenancy-breaching flat, you'll know that the rental squeeze isn't a ‘success’.

“Housing shortages in Wellington and beyond are a government failure. It's been the making for decades. We've stopped supply from keeping up with demand, thanks to faulty, short-sighted red tape from both central and local government. We need reform - now.

“ACT will continue to campaign on fundamental reform of planning laws, giving councils financial incentives to approve development, and opening up building regulations to new materials and practices.”
