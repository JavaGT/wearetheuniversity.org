ACT calls for Government Assistance for Alexandra.

ACT Otago Candidate Gerry Eckhoff has written a letter to Otago MP Gavin Herlily in a bid to encourage the government to provide financial assistance to the residents of Alexandra.

“I have asked Mr Herlihy to insist that Cabinet meets urgently to discuss the plight of Alexandra residents whose lives and properties have been badly damaged by the flooding,”

“Who pays for what can be decided after the flooding has stopped, but right now people need assistance to help rebuild their homes and businesses,” said Mr Eckhoff.
