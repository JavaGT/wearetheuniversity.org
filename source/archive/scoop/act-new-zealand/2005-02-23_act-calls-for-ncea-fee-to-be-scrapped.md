ACT calls for NCEA fee to be scrapped

ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington today called on the Labour Party to do the decent thing and waive the NCEA scholarship reassessment fee.

Students unhappy with their NCEA scholarship results can pay $30 per paper to have them reassessed.

"Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope told Parliament on 10 February that he would consider scrapping the fee upon seeking further advice," Miss Coddington said.

"Today I received a phone call from an angry parent who phoned Education Minister Trevor Mallard's office, the Education Ministry and the NZQA, to find out whether the fee was still in place.

"The parent was told by Mallard's office that no decision had been made. She then called the Ministry who told her that she'd still need to pay $90 to get three papers remarked.

"What a disgrace. Twelve days on and the Government is still floundering. I call on the Labour Party and Benson-Pope to stop dithering and scrap the fee now," said Miss Coddington.
