Hypocritical Vice Chancellor Must Stop Meddling
===============================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

The Waikato University Vice Chancellor's warning that he would not 'undermine' the NCEA by accepting students with foreign qualifications is disgraceful and hypocritical, ACT MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"Vice Chancellor Bryan Gould - a former British Labour politician - is blatantly attempting to create hysteria with politically motivated, ill-judged comments.

"As of April, one in ten students at Waikato University were from overseas. It is embarrassingly hypocritical for Gould to claim he has qualms about accepting international qualifications.

"Dozens of schools in New Zealand are going to offer A-levels because NCEA will be a terrible measure of student performance.

"Mr Gould's left-wing political prejudices have no place in this debate. He must stop meddling and leave all schools to make their own decisions based on what is best for our youth," Donna Awatere Huata said.
