Long Arm of the Law in Community Hands

A grandmother who retrieved her property after finding the person who burgled her should be congratulated instead of scolded, says ACT Police Spokesman, Heather Roy.

"Citizens have a right to protect themselves, their families and their property. Local communities also have a role to play in ensuring their own safety and security," Mrs Roy said.

"The Police are doing their best, but are impeded by poor resourcing. The Government must act swiftly to rectify this, and provide safety and security for Kiwis.

"Sir Robert Peel, the founder of modern policing, recorded the principle that the police do not have special powers, but simply do full-time what any law-abiding citizen has the right and responsibility to do part- time.

"We should be defending - not discouraging - people who look after themselves and their neighbours.

"Many recent cases have highlighted the Police's inability to act, even when given the names and addresses of alleged offenders. Is it hardly surprising that communities are now organising themselves to fight off criminals.

"The new Ministers for Police and Justice should have three critical priorities - to speed up the thousand extra police officers, significantly increase police resources and endorse ACT's Supplementary Order Paper to the Arms Act (Amendment) Bill, which would protect people who defend themselves," Mrs Roy said.
