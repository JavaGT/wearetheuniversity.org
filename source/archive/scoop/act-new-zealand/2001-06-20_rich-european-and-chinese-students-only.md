Rich European and Chinese Students Only

Wednesday 20th Jun 2001 Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education

One of Auckland's best schools is set to become the domain of rich European and Chinese students, ACT Education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"The only state boys' school on the Auckland isthmus is forced to effectively lock out poor children as a result of perverse zoning policies," Donna Awatere Huata said.

"Maori and Pacific Islanders can't afford to live in Auckland Grammar's new wealthy, central-city home zone.

"With the implementation of zoning, the institution's rich multicultural environment will be decimated. Wealthy inner-city European and Chinese students will replace the dark-skinned kids from South Auckland.

"Pacific Island and Maori students perform exceptionally well at Grammar. In fact, the last ERO Review stated:

"The school as a whole benefits from the outstanding achievements of \[senior Maori students\]".

"These achievements include the success of the 1999 top Maori student, who travelled from South Auckland to Auckland Grammar every day. Under this new zone, he would be barred from entering the school.

"John Morris, the excellent principal of Auckland Grammar, has created a culture in which all students can - and do - achieve. We only have to look at Manu Körero national championship or NZEST results for the evidence.

"However, thanks to perverse Government policy, Mr Morris must now lock his doors to the poor students who most need his help."
