Awatere Huata Seeks Urgent Debate On NCEA

Tuesday 27 Aug 2002

ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata has sought an urgent parliamentary debate from the Speaker to address the Government's NCEA plans.

"Under standing orders, I have approached the Speaker to seek an urgent debate. This critical issue demands the attention of the entire House.

"The Minister of Education announced on Friday that while Level Two of the NCEA would be "available" next year, this did not necessarily mean that all schools have to offer it or that all students have to do it.

"The Education Minister is creating a two-tiered examination system - one which does not address the concerns of parents or teachers.

The Minister believes: "most employers and unversities would only care about Level Three results. Very few people will look at level two." Then why is he persisting with the introduction of level two of NCEA at all?

"The fairest option would be to scrap NCEA entirely. Mr Mallard's cowardly gesture demonstrates that even he has no faith in this qualification. He is too scared to dump it or introduce it completely. I hope that parliament will be able to urgently debate this bad decision - parents and children deserve it," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
