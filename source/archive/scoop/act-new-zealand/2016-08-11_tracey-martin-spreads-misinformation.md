Tracey Martin Spreads Misinformation

Tracey Martin is spreading misinformation about teacher qualification at Partnership Schools, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“Tracey Martin has said that Partnership Schools can ‘put untrained and unqualified individuals into classrooms’,” says Mr Seymour.

“That is simply untrue. Any Partnership School teachers that are not registered with the Teachers’ Council must have an exemption provided by the school showing their alternative qualifications, skills, and experience and demonstrating how these assets will lift achievement.

“For example, Vanguard Military School has employed an ex-Defence Force aircraft engineer to teach engineering. This fits with the military ethos of the school and has added considerable value to the students’ experience.

“Note that we are focused on getting the best results for students, whereas Tracey Martin is focused on sanctifying a certain pathway to education.”
