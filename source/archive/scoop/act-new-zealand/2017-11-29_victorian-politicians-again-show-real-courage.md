Victorian Politicians Again Show Real Courage in Final Stage of Legalising Assisted Dying

"Victorian politicians have again shown real courage in the final stage of legalising Assted Dying for the State," says ACT Leader David Seymour

Seymour's End of Life Choice Bill would legalise Assisted Dying here and is moving up the Order Paper to be debated early next year.

"These politicians resisted enormous pressure from the minority to give the choice to the silent majority. New Zealand MPs thinking about how they will vote on my bill should look to Victorian politicians' courage to cut through the usual misinformation from concentrated lobby groups and give Victorians choice when it is clearly safe to do so.

"Notably, the Victorians tightened one of the safeguards in their bill as they debated it, bringing it into line with New Zealand's End of Life Choice Bill. Their final Bill requires a prognosis of less than six months to live, whereas the original required a prognosis of up to 12 months. New Zealand's bill has always said six."

"As our End of Life Choice Bill moves up the Order Paper, I hope that my fellow Members of the New Zealand Parliament have noticed the courage of our Victorian counterparts."
