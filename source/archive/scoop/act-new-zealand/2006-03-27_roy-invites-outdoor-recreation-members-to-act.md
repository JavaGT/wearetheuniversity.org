ACT MP Heather Roy is inviting members of the Outdoor Recreation party to join ACT, now that their political marriage to United Future has ended.

"ACT is the only party in Parliament standing up for Kiwi hunters and shooters. ACT succesfully campaigned against registering firearms instead of firearms owners", Mrs Roy said.

"ACT supports responsible firearms ownership. We would improve hunters' access to Crown-owned land.

"ACT will not tolerate unlawful blocking of access to public land.

"Enjoying our natural environment is not a crime, and ACT would make sure that all Kiwis - including hunters and outdoor groups - are able to take an active role in conservation.

"ACT is a tolerant, liberal party. We welcome Kiwis from every walk of life.

"We hope that Outdoor Recreation's Board - including former United MP Marc Alexander - recognise that ACT is the only party in Parliament representing the thousands of Kiwis who enjoy the great outdoors", Mrs Roy said.
