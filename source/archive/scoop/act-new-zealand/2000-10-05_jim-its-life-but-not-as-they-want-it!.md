Jim, It’s Life But Not As They Want It!
=======================================

**Thursday, 5 October 2000, 12:46 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Today's Herald newspaper advertisement from disillusioned young New Zealanders is a sobering reminder of this government's policies and their effect on the brain drain, said ACT MP Penny Webster.

"We have reached a crisis situation when hundreds of ex-pat young New Zealanders put their names to a newspaper advertisement expressing concern about New Zealand's 'current economic direction.'

"This is the voice of New Zealand's young talented professionals, who have left the country in droves. This country's decision-makers can no longer ignore the fact that the 'Big OE' is no longer a choice, but a necessity for many young people.

"These are the very people Jim Anderton called on to come home. Instead, the numbers have been growing. Ask any parent of university students or young professionals and they will tell you.

"In New Zealand inflation is about to break 3%, 17,995 New Zealanders have been unemployed for a year or more, record numbers of New Zealanders are leaving for good, yet the Government still refuses to accept their share of responsibility.

"Young New Zealanders want their leaders 'to set an environment that inspires them to remain here, and attract back those who have left'

"While it's normal and healthy for the young to travel, what we are seeing is not normal experience-gaining travel, this is a complete abandonment of the sinking ship," said Penny Webster.
