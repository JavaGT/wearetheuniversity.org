'P' Research Highlights Labour Failure

Tuesday 5 Oct 2004

Dr Muriel Newman - Press Releases - Crime & Justice

ACT New Zealand Deputy Leader and Police Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman today claimed that the recent police-commissioned Massey University research on methamphetamine use had confirmed Labour's dismal failure to arrest the drug epidemic sweeping the country.

"Labour's failure is demonstrated in a lack of police funding to hunt down meth laboratories, a backlog of clan labs awaiting analysis by ESR, and a court system so clogged that offenders are left free to manufacture more \`P' while their cases move through the justice system at a snail's pace.

"The fact is that methamphetamines have become a massive problem for New Zealand society. Teachers, employers and police are left to confront the damage cause by this problem - which is raging out of control because of the sheer incompetence of this soft-on-crime Labour Government," Dr Newman said.
