Charter School Supporters Urged to Sign Petition
================================================

**Sunday, 11 February 2018, 2:40 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

“New Zealanders who support school choice for our kids are urged to sign a petition telling the Government not to close charter schools”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“Charter schools are working. Over 1500 students attend the fledgling schools, most of which have had to turn students away due to rapid growth. Struggling kids are having their lives turned around.

“This isn’t a left-right issue. Even three Labour Party Ministers – Kelvin Davis, Willie Jackson and Peeni Henare – know charter schools work and have publicly said so.

“We need to put party politics aside and support educational opportunities for our kids”, says Mr Seymour.

Note to editors: The petition can be found at [http://savecharters.kiwi](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17334&qid=5058244).
