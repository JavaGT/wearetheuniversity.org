WoF law will evict the poor and students from their houses
==========================================================

The Green warrant of fitness law will evict the poor and students from their houses, if they’re lucky enough to find a place to rent in the first place

“An army of inspectors will find fault with homes making them unprofitable to maintain so the total pool of rental properties must decrease. That is economics 101.” said Dr Whyte.

“94% of rental houses failed a 2014 warrant of fitness (WOF) pilot by councils, ACC, the New Zealand Green Building Council and the University of Otago using a 31 item checklist. Two-thirds of the fails required more than "just a few minor and inexpensive fixes". Be they minor or major, the majority of rental properties will go rent free while landlords scramble for tradesmen to fix faults. What investor would buy a rental property under the threat of the same severe penalty, no matter how minor the fault?” said Dr Whyte.

“The New Zealanders who will suffer the most from these laws are low income workers, beneficiaries and students who seek low-cost housing”, said Dr Whyte.

“The continued failure of the Greens to recognise there is no free lunch for any costs imposed by regulation also fails to acknowledge that tenants will bear the burden of unneeded regulations so homelessness will increase. Some people will not be able to find rental accommodation,” said Dr Whyte.

“There is no doubt that over time the wish-list of requirements to receive the WOF will expand, exacerbating the difficulties in finding affordable rental accommodation. Next will be double glazing, solar heating, low energy light bulbs, approved shower heads, allergy-free carpet, lead-free paint and asbestos removal”, said Dr Whyte.

“The Green’s proposals that any tenant will have the right of renewal will make every landlord wary of investing in rental properties. Rent controls and sitting tenants laws are the stock in trade of Seinfeld and other New York-based comedy programmes, not economic policy in New Zealand”, said Dr Whyte.

“It is incomprehensible that Dr. Norman claims to be more pro-free market than the National Party and the next day champions policies that will destroy the New Zealand rental market" said Dr Whyte.
