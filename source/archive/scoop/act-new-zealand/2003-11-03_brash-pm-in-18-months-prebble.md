Brash PM in 18 Months - Prebble

New National Party leader Don Brash could be Prime Minister in 18 months, ACT New Zealand Leader Richard Prebble said today.

Mr Prebble was addressing more than 80 people attending ACT's Waikato/Bay of Plenty Regional Conference in Hamilton.

"ÄCT welcomes Don Brash's election because National has been divided for far too long," Mr Prebble said.

" If National unites under Brash then they will be a far more effective opposition and viable alternative government.

"I applaud statements Brash has made.

"First, recognising that under MMP, National cannot win the next election alone. The alternative government to Labour will be a coalition.

"Second, Brash's recognition that the centre-right must win the economic argument. The economy is the issue of every election. Brash is correct when he points out to the voters that if this is as good as it gets, we will never catch up to Australia again.

"Third, the move to select Nick Smith was smart. Mr Smith is a rare National MP, one who holds a provincial seat, seats National must win to be government. It shows that National remains a centre party," Mr Prebble said.
