More Partnerships Schools on the way

“I welcome Minister of Education Hon Hekia Parata’s announcement of the second application round for Partnership Schools | Kura Hourua to open day one, term one, in 2015” ACT Leader John Banks said today.

“Partnership Schools are here to stay. They will be a permanent part of our education system.

“I don’t believe any future Government will abandon New Zealand’s world leading model, Mr Banks said.

“What Partnership Schools do is give educators greater flexibility in return of greater accountability for getting better results for some of New Zealand’s most vulnerable students.

“What is not to like in that?

“These learners deserve to be a productive part of New Zealand’s future. I want them to know that we value them and their potential.

“They deserve the opportunity of a world class education. Partnership Schools help make that opportunity real for more of our young.

“I want parents to know that Partnership Schools offer them a greater choice to find the school best suited to the needs of their child.

“I am also confident that just as the first five partnership schools are attracting interest from dedicated, committed educators, the next five will too.

“To the PPTA and NZEI unions I say get over it and get on board if you really value education and talented educators," Mr Banks said.
