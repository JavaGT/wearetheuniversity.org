Camera Policy Nothing But Revenue Seeking Ploy
==============================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Speed camera revenue will jump at least $12 million due to lower speed camera thresholds, said ACT Transport spokesman Penny Webster.

Transport Minster, Mark Gosche, in response to Parliamentary Questions, revealed an extra 150,000 motorists a year are expected to be snapped when speed-camera tolerances lower on July 1. Mr Gosche stated he was “not into a situation of being accused of revenue gathering and giving out more and more tickets. If we do that, we’ve actually failed.”

“If this is not a massive increase in revenue, then what is? If we take Mr Gosche at his word, the Government is actually planning for failure”

“This is a punitive, revenue gathering exercise. It deliberately entraps drivers who barely exceed the speed limit, rather than the highest 15% who were previously targeted.

“The Government’s own budget estimates show the revenue from speed cameras will increase by over 50%. This revenue will be squeezed from ordinary motorists via $80 tickets. The Government will photo an additional 150,000 motorists over the next 12 months to meet this goal.”

Hundreds of thousands of New Zealand motorists have already received speed camera tickets. The controversial hidden speed-camera trial in Waikato was recently abandoned after proving ineffective in raising road safety.

“The Government are forcing the Kiwi motorist to contribute to their consolidated slush fund. If the Government was serious about road safety it would address road need, not road speed,” said Penny Webster.
