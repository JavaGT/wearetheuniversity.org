Maharey's Long Road…To The Middle

Press Releases - Education

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Heather Roy today demanded that Education Minister Steve Maharey quit encouraging school students to reach the truly dizzying heights of mediocrity.

"Today's 'highly anticipated' announcement is little more than the Government tinkering with an education system that puts huge emphasis on burdensome assessment while leaving teachers with too little time to teach," Mrs Roy said.

"Education is not 'one size fits all'. The NCEA changes announced today show that mediocrity is all that Labour wants for our young people - but I'll warrant that the nation's parents want more for their children.

"It is for this reason that I am calling for real changes in education, and for internationally-recognised assessments - such as Cambridge, IB - to be made accessible to all students around New Zealand.

"New Zealand children don't need extra credits for Merit achievements; they don't need increased moderation; they don't need tinkering with a system that encourages them to be merely average - rather, New Zealand children need choice and diversity.

"If the NCEA really is the wonder system that Labour claims, then we should be able to see how it stands against other education regimes - regimes that encourage excellence and push students to perform to the best of their ability," Mrs Roy said.
