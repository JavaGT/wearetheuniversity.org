Public Money Down the Gurgler

Public Money Down the Gurgler

Massey University's decision to loan $180,000 to a "fraud-stricken" student union is indefensible, ACT New Zealand Tertiary Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

"The average student, who couldn't give a stuff about union politics, will gain nothing from this loan. In fact, the average student will lose out, because this is money that should be spent on their education.

"Massey University @ Wellington Students Association (M@WSA) has lost $100,000 to fraud. To most, that would suggest that loaning public money to the organisation isn't a particularly bright idea. The compulsory union is an incorporated society. It has nothing to do with providing teaching or research.

"How on earth can Massey University dish out this cash, then claim it is "underfunded"? It may as well flush $180,000 down the gurgler.

"Education Minister Steve Maharey made it possible for unions like M@WSA to become compulsory. Forcing students to cough up cash to join a "fraud-stricken" union is ridiculous. Now that Orientation Week is over, 90 percent of students aren't interested in the union's services - they'd far rather have their money back," Miss Coddington said.
