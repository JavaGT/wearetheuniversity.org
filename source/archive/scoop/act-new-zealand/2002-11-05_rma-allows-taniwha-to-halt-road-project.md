RMA Allows Taniwha to Halt Road Project

RMA Allows Taniwha to Halt Road Project

It is outrageous that work on the Waikato expressway can be stopped by the \`discovery' of a taniwha, ACT Transport Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

"This is political correctness and cultural sensitivity gone mad. Taxpayers are being forced to pay to support the spiritual beliefs of a small group of people whose ulterior motive is to delay construction of these badly needed roadworks.

"That people die on New Zealand roads has nothing to do with taniwha, ghosts or Billy Goat's Gruff. One reason why people are killed is because our roading infrastructure is woefully inadequate in some areas to cope with traffic levels.

"ACT would repeal the RMA legislation which allows mythical creatures to halt work on major roading projects," Miss Coddington said.
