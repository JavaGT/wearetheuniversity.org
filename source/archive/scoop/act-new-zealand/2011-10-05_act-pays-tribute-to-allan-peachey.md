**ACT Pays Tribute to Allan Peachey**

ACT Parliamentary Leader John Boscawen today paid tribute to Allan Peachey on news of Mr Peachey’s upcoming retirement.

“Allan Peachey was one of New Zealand’s leading educators before coming to Parliament, serving most recently as Principal of Rangitoto College. He worked hard for his students and he worked hard for the people of Tamaki,” Mr Boscawen said.

“I, and my colleagues, always enjoyed working with Allan. He ably helped shepherd Heather Roy’s, and for a time Sir Roger Douglas’, Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill through the Education and Science Select Committee.

“We in the ACT Party wish him well for his treatment and recovery. His contribution to the House will be missed” Mr Boscawen said.
