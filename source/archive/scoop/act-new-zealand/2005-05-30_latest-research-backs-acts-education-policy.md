Latest research backs ACT's education policy

Groundbreaking research released today backs ACT's education policies that trust parents and schools to make decisions, not education bureaucrats, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

“A Colmar Brunton survey of 1001 randomly selected parents in August 2004 shows exactly what ACT has been promoting – Let Parents Choose,” Miss Coddington said.

“The survey revealed:

“A staggering 79 percent believe schools should be free to offer alternative examinations such as the International Baccalaureate or Cambridge A Levels if they choose to do so.

“This backs up ACT's policy of allowing schools to dump the NCEA if they wish to.

“76 percent of parents think schools should be permitted to specialise in particular subject areas or sport if they choose to do so.

“This backs up ACT's policy that one size does not fit all in education.

“84 percent of parents believe that individual schools should be allowed to teach their individual community's positive ideas.

“This backs up ACT's policy that the education bureaucrats and politicians don't know what's best for every school, every student.

“Only 30 percent of parents believe the Ministry of Education should decide what their children learn in school.

“In other words, the bureaucrats should just, as the kids say, butt out.

“And further damning evidence for the Government in terms of the NCEA, which Trevor Mallard insists is 'a triumph', is shown in this survey.

“Only 31 percent of parents have confidence in the value of the NCEA.

“Only 27 percent thought the NCEA provides a clear measure of a pupil's abilities.

“ACT congratulates the Maxim Institute for undertaking this important research. It's now time for the Government to listen to parents and give them back the right to choose,” Miss Coddington said.
