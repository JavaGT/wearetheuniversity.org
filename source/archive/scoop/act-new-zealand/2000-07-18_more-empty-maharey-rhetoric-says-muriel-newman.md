More Empty Maharey Rhetoric Says Muriel Newman
==============================================

**Tuesday, 18 July 2000, 6:21 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Social Services and Employment Minister, Steve Maharey, has set a record for tough talk and no action, said ACT Welfare spokesman Dr Muriel Newman.

"Mr Maharey is compromised on student loan handling because WINZ sought extra resources to aid student loan processing from him at Christmas, but he refused support.

“Today we have seen another report that criticises WINZ, and accountability for that sits with the Chief Executive, Christine Rankin.

“And for the tenth time, and after seven months as her Minister, Mr Maharey expects us to believe him when he says he will hold her accountable.

“That is a joke.

“After repeatedly calling for Ms Rankin’s resignation in Opposition, Mr Maharey performed a classic flip flop when informed by legal advisors that his comments may have gifted Ms Rankin the opportunity for a huge employment settlement.

“Mr Maharey now reverts to empty public rhetoric whenever a problem arises, and weakly promises that ‘I will hold people accountable’.

"He has not, he will not, and he can not, hold Ms Rankin accountable.

"Mr Maharey should be up front with the public and confess his limitations rather than continuing to erode his credibility by pretending to be tough, when his record proves the opposite," said Muriel Newman.
