Five Years A Cruel Joke On Communities

Friday 3 Sep 2004

Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Crime & Justice

Sentencing paedophile Peter Liddell to preventive detention with a minimum of five years is a joke, ACT New Zealand Associate Justice Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

"Liddell has been labelled \`one of New Zealand's most dangerous child sex abusers', yet he could be out again, committing crimes, before his latest victim celebrates his 21^st birthday," Miss Coddington said.

"This highlights the myth of preventive detention. The public think this sentence is a lifetime jail term, but judges set the minimum period before parole can be considered.

"Liddell has yet again shown how white, middle class, former professionals get treated favourably in the justice system. He conned his way into families' trust as a counsellor at Middlemore Hospital, where at least one of his victims committed suicide as a result of Liddell's abuse.

"Then he worked at Auckland's Kings College. He is the master of making himself look \`respectable'.

"When he was released on parole in 1998, half-way through his last sentence, I was slammed for condemning his release. The usual do-gooders told me Liddell had \`paid his price to society', \`been rehabilitated' and I should leave him alone.

"I predicted he would reoffend and he has. I was phoned in 2002 by a concerned mother in the Waiuku district who'd spotted Liddell cruising around with young boys. I told her to go to the police.

"Liddell is a menace. I've heard stories about Liddell that make you weep. I hope the Crown will appeal this sentence and ensure Liddell is locked up for a long, long time," Miss Coddington said.
