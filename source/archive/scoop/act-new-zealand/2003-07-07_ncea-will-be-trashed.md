NCEA Will Be Trashed

ACT New Zealand Associate Education Spokesman Stephen Franks today welcomed John Minto's commonsense warning about the consequences of giving NCEA credits for picking up litter and doing chores.

"Mr Minto is right to warn that this sort of pseudo-qualification will mean students' life chances will depend on what school they went to, rather than what they learned at school.

"Only patently rigorous external exams will give employers the confidence that a good result from a poor school is not fake. Without them, school snobbery has no effective antidote. It is not often that I agree with Mr Minto, but he deserves credit for blowing the whistle on fake education," Mr Franks said.
