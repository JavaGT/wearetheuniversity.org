ACT Wants Select Committee Inquiry Into Floods
==============================================

**Thursday, 18 November 1999, 11:58 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT Leader Hon Richard Prebble today said ACT would insist that a special  
Select Committee of Parliament investigate who should be held liable for the  
latest flood in Alexandra.

"ACT's candidate for Otago, Gerry Eckhoff has been campaigning on this issue  
for some time. The facts are clear. Even in the horrendous 1878 flood the  
Clutha river stayed within its banks. But, in the three floods in the last six  
years with less rain the flood damage has been greater.

"The Roxburgh dam is silting up and forcing the Clutha to spill its banks.

"The common law is clear - those who cause a nuisance are strictly liable.

"The small businesses of Alexandra don't have the financial muscle to take on  
Contact Energy. Contact Energy is saying that it's a Government responsibility  
because it was the Government that built the dam. There is clearly a role for  
Parliament to determine the extent to which the Government should accept the  
liability.

"Shopkeepers, businesses and home owners can't wait three to four years for a  
Court case. They need immediate action which ACT MPs will insist Parliament  
takes," said Hon Richard Prebble.
