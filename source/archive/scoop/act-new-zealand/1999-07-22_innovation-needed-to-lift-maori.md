Innovation Needed To Lift Maori

Innovation Needed To Lift Maori

National education monitoring project test results showing poor writing, listening and viewing performances by Maori students, are further indication of the need for innovation in State Education, according to ACT Education Spokesperson Donna Awatere Huata.

The Charter School movement, which is revolutionising state education in the United States, would provide an answer, she said.

"New Zealand once had the opportunity to lead the world. The ability to develop state owned charter schools was enshrined in the Education Act 1989 but has never been used because in ten years the Ministry of Education did not develop guidelines for their establishment. One school has been waiting to apply to become a charter school for the past ten years.

The test results, released yesterday revealed the failure of Ministry of Education policy advice for Maori. Mrs Huata said that every year thick reports that contain not a single new idea are released by the Maori Unit.

"Schools are not making enough of a difference, in spite of the additional funding towards education in low socio-economic areas. The test results show that very little progress is being made for children in low social economic areas," said Donna Awatere Huata.
