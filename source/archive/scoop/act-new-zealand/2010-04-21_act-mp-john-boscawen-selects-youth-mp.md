ACT MP John Boscawen Selects Youth MP
=====================================

**ACT MP John Boscawen Selects Youth MP**  
  
ACT New Zealand MP John Boscawen is today delighted to announce that his representative for Youth Parliament 2010 will be Miss Hazzel Brown, a Year 13 student from Otahuhu College in South Auckland. She will be one of 122 youths to take part in the two-day Youth Parliament which starts on July 6.

“Youth Parliament 2010 will bring together young New Zealanders from across the country to Parliament for two days to experience a taste of life as a parliamentarian and to share their views with the country’s decision-makers," Mr Boscawen said.

“I wanted to select a Youth MP from Otahuhu College because I am an old boy of the school. Hazzel, a Samoan New Zealander, has a special interest in mental health issues. I was impressed by her passion and her dedication, shown though her voluntary work in the community.

"The Youth Parliament 2010 Bill will focus on an age of majority. Youth MPs will be able to debate the merits of different age thresholds. There will be ten select committees of inquiry ranging from entrepreneurship and education to copyright infringement.

"Young people who want to connect with the Youth MPs and let them know what they think can join the official Youth Parliament 2010 group on Facebook,” Mr Boscawen said.

ENDS
