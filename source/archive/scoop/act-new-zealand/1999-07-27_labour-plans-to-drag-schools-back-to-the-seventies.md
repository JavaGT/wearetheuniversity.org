Labour Plans To Drag Schools Back To The Seventies
==================================================

**Tuesday, 27 July 1999, 10:48 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT Education and Spokesperson Donna Awatere Huata has strongly attacked Labour's proposed Education policies saying \" a Labour Government will drag New Zealand Schools back into the Seventies."

The Act MP says "there is not a single new idea in their policies. Far from offering students more choice, there will be fewer opportunities for them to succeed."

"Labour is proposing more funding to close the gap between schools, but no measurement of the impact of the policies in schools. The quality of education children receive can't be improved without some form of national assessment."

"Labour proposes lifting the standard of education in the poorest 10% of schools, over half of which are Maori. But what failing schools require is more innovation and choice, the kind of choice provided under the TIE Scheme and Charter Schools."

"The state education system has already failed, and pouring more money into failing schools isn't the answer. Measuring the amount of money put in, doesn't necessarily guarantee an improvement in the quality of education."

"Labour also say there will be no major overhaul of the school system, despite a Ministry of Education Adult Literacy Report released last year showing that 50 % of the population are unable to read and write adequately."

"Do we have to wait for these figures to rise 70% before Labour will take action?" Mrs Awatere Huata said.
