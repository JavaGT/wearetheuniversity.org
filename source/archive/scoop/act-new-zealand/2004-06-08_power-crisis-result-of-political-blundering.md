Power Crisis Result Of Political Blundering

Tuesday 8 Jun 2004

Ken Shirley - Press Releases - Energy

The significant cuts to power generation along the Waikato River, predicted to occur within the next 10 years, will be a direct result of the Resource Management Act's expansion to cover metaphysical and spiritual beliefs, ACT New Zealand Deputy Leader and Energy Spokesman Ken Shirley said today.

"The Environment Court's recent decision - curtailing the water rights that underpin the Tongariro Power Scheme - was totally predictable, and is what comes of elevating myth and legend to matters of national importance within legislation," Mr Shirley said.

"Some of the Wanganui River's headwaters have been diverted, through tunnels and canals, to discharge into the Tongariro River since 1973. This flows into Lake Taupo and down the Waikato River.

"During the 1970s, New Zealand invested millions of dollars into the Tongariro scheme to contribute to our energy needs and prosperity. The river flows in the lower Wanganui have been negligibly affected, and regular flood events ensure a healthy and dynamic river system.

"The RMA was established to provide for the sustainable management of natural resources. But, with spiritual beliefs and superstition now a part of our law, it cannot adequately address the nebulous metaphysical wishes of those apply a selective morality to enhance their own political agendas.

"All New Zealanders have the right to adhere to the beliefs or superstitions of their culture - regardless of race. That said, however, these convictions should not be allowed to impact upon the public good. What we are seeing now are the rotten fruits of politically correct RMA blunders carried out by successive governments," Mr Shirley said.
