Media Advisory: 'Morning Drinks at the Backbencher'

Tuesday, October 9 2001 Penny Webster Press Releases -- Commerce

ACT Internal Affairs Spokesman MP Penny Webster is inviting media and others to the Backbencher Pub at 11.15am on Wednesday, 10 October 2001.

Mrs Webster will meet with Hospitality Association CEO Bruce Robertson to get the final signatures on her petition of over 10,000 New Zealanders opposed to legislation that would force pubs to segregate smokers from non-smokers.

"New Zealanders are sick to death of this Government interfering in our lives. Making the final signatures under the glaring puppet of Helen Clark will be most appropriate," Mrs Webster said.

"ACT has worked extensively with the Hospitality Association to find out what publicans actually think of Labour's proposed anti-business legislation. The Bill is being forced through by the Government, and has now been added to the Order Paper.

The Smokefree Environments (Enhanced Protection) Amendment Bill and its supplementary order paper would ruin many publicans, and force thousands of dollars of debt on every bar owner.

After getting the final signatures, Mrs Webster and Mr Robertson will walk across to parliament to lodge the petition.

ENDS

When: 11.15am Wednesday, 10 October, 2001

Where: Backbencher Pub, Molesworth Street, Wellington
