Labour Causes Critical Shortage of Summer Workers

Sunday 30 Dec 2001 Dr Muriel Newman Press Releases -- Employment

Labour's soft-on-welfare attitude has created a critical shortage of people wanting to take summer work, ACT Employment Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.

"Fruit is rotting at some orchards while thousands of young, able-bodied New Zealanders are partying all summer long thanks to the dole.

"Employers are desperate for short-term workers. But the Government has eliminated every incentive to get off the dole and back into work.

"Overindulgent political correctness doesn't get the fruit picked or the hay made. The Government is forcing taxpayers to cough up for the bad habits of a generation of dole-dependent young New Zealanders.

"ACT would eliminate Labour's weak, theory-based claptrap. We would create real incentives for the unemployed to return to work, and to take summer jobs when they are available. That's what New Zealanders expect, and that's what should be delivered," Dr Newman said.
