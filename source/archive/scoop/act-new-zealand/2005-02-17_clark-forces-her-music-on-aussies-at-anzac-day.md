Clark forces her music on Aussies at ANZAC day

Helen Clark has insisted that when she turns up to the 90th anniversary ANZAC commemorations at Gallipoli her music must be played, not anyone else's, said ACT Leader Rodney Hide today.

Mr Hide's comments follow a story in today's Australian Herald Sun.

"The Australians are appalled that a Kiwi has stepped in and rejected their much-loved John Farnham. What's more, they're flabbergasted that she has also wiped homegrown legends Neil and Tim Finn.

"The thousands of Aussies and Kiwis who will trek to Gallipoli on April 25 will have Helen Clark to thank when the politically correct didgeridoo and posh string quartet come out.

"No one ever suggested a rock concert, but Helen Clark's insistence that her high tastes are superior is unbelievably arrogant. Her latest edict is already winding people up who just want the 90th anniversary to reflect contemporary Australasian tastes.

"This special commemoration is not Helen Clark's to take over. I suspect John Howard will be keen to have his say when they discuss the final programme in Wellington this weekend," said Mr Hide.
