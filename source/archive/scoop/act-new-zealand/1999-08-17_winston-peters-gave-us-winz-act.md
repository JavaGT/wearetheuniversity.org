Winston Peters gave us WINZ - ACT
=================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Winston Peters latest attempt to rewrite history is outrageous even by his standards, says ACT Leader Richard Prebble.

"For the last 12 months he's been trying to convince us that he wasn't our Treasurer for two years and he didn't destroy thousands of jobs.

"Ms Rankin was appointed while Winston Peters was Treasurer. She was NZ First's personal choice.

"NZ First insisted on a new upmarket head of department and Winston Peters authorised the creation of the position, the huge pay - a quarter of a million dollars -and the glitzy budget.

"Now he has the nerve to claim that he was somewhere else when all these things happened.

"Cabinet papers show all these decision were approved by him and he took the lead in pushing them through Cabinet and on the country," Mr Prebble said.
