The Wairarapa branch of the ACT Party election campaign is officially under way with the announcement Safety Consultant and Greytown Community Board Member Shane Atkinson as its local candidate.

Mr Atkinson is a familiar face to local voters after standing in the Wairarapa electorate as an ACT candidate in 2008, and having lived in the region and played a prominent role in its community since 1992.

“I am standing again to promote ACT Party policies and values to our community. Wairarapa has always given ACT wonderful local support - the best in any electorate outside Auckland.”

“Wairarapa people deserve to be told the truth - neither the previous Labour government nor the current National government had or have the courage to take sensible but politically unpalatable decisions such as repealing poor policy.” he said.

Mr Atkinson singled out Working for Families and Interest-free Student Loans, describing them as vastly expensive election gimmicks which were ultimately poorly targeted, wasteful and ineffective.

“If National had the courage to repeal both of these policies, we would not have needed to increase GST to 15% – which has hurt families trying to feed their kids – and the top personal tax rate would only need to be 29%.”

Mr Atkinson also feels very strongly about helping young people into jobs and believes the best way to facilitate this would be by re-instating the Youth Minimum Wage to make hiring young people more attractive to businesses. He also advocates raising the retiring age to 67 to ease the burden young people will face in the future.

“People are working longer and living longer, retaining the pension entitlement age at 65 is no longer necessary or appropriate.

“As an ACT candidate I intend to promote rational debate about better social and economic policies,” said Mr Atkinson.

As a Greytown Community Board Member Mr Atkinson has been heavily involved in the purchase of the local Kourarau Hydro by Trust House. He has continued his work with the Wairarapa Irrigation Trust and supports the Greytown Trail Trust.

ACT Wairarapa’s recently appointed campaign manager and Masterton local Roger Greenslade advised people to go to the new ACT Wairarapa Facebook page to keep up to date with Shane and the local campaign.
