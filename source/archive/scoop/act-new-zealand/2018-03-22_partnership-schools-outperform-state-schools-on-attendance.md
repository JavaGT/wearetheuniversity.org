Partnership Schools outperforming state schools on attendance

  
"New data on school attendance shows Partnership Schools outperform state schools”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“In Term 2 of 2017, truancy made up 4 per cent of missed class time in state schools.

“The latest data on Partnership School shows that no school had a truancy rate of more than 1.7 per cent.

“Partnership Schools don’t just perform better on truancy – they’re specifically contracted to ensure this remains the case. They’re not allowed truancy rates above 2.8 per cent. If a Partnership School performed as badly as the average state school on attendance, it would be at risk of closure. Meanwhile, state schools can achieve high rates of truancy year-on-year with little or no consequences.

“Priority learners like those who attend Partnership Schools are statistically more likely than the average student to be truant. But at Partnership Schools they are showing up to learn. In other words, students underserved by the state system are effectively engaged by the alternative educational approaches offered by Partnership Schools.

“This is one reason why Kiwis back Partnership Schools. New polling shows that 57 per cent of decided voters agreed Partnership Schools should be allowed to continue operating in their current form, while 60 per cent of decided voters disapprove of the way the Government is dealing with Partnership Schools.

"New Zealanders are beginning to learn what 1500 students already know: Partnership Schools change lives for the better”, says Mr Seymour.
