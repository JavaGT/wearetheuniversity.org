Public land is for all New Zealanders
=====================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Public land is for all New Zealanders

"A [media report](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=18077&qid=5627929) this morning that surfers and boaties have been shot at on a remote Waikato beach is shocking and appalling", says ACT Leader David Seymour.

"Public land is for all New Zealanders. Kiwis wanting to enjoy the beach should not have to fear for their lives.

Albatross Point is only accessible via water or Māori land. Fishermen say shootings, abuse, and vandalism have been occurring for ten years and are driving the public away.

"Locals seem to believe they own the beach and the public should not be allowed there. That kind of attitude has no place in our country.

"The news that an iwi liaison officer is to meet with locals later this week is welcome. Police must take this matter extremely seriously and protect New Zealanders that are simply enjoying our public spaces

“This is taking place while the Government holds a 'Justice Summit' in Wellington. What exactly will the Government do about locals violently driving ordinary Kiwis away from a public beach?", asks Mr Seymour.
