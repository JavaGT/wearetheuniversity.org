250 more police is too little, too late

Rodney Hide Thursday, 11 August 2005 Press Releases - Crime & Justice

ACT Leader Rodney Hide today said Helen Clark's promise to increase police numbers is \"too little, too late."

"Helen Clark has been saying for six years that crime has been going down when every New Zealander knows it has been going up.

"New Zealand needs 2,500 more police just to match Australia's police levels," Mr Hide said. "250 is a drop in the bucket.

"At least Helen Clark has now admitted the problem, but it shows her priorities when she’s got $300 million to bribe students but only $25 million for the police.

"What the country needs is more police, Zero Tolerance for Crime and Truth in Sentencing.

"Helen Clark's pledge is for an increasingly violent New Zealand with a police force and justice system unable to cope," Mr Hide said.
