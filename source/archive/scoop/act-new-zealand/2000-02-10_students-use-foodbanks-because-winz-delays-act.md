Students use foodbanks because of WINZ delays

Thursday 10th Feb 2000 Muriel Newman Media Release -- Other

Some training providers are having to teach students how to access food banks, after more outrageous WINZ delays, says ACT Social Welfare Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman.

Dr Newman was responding to pleas from a tertiary education workers to prompt WINZ into doing their job.

"An employee who contacted me today explained how they and other teachers are doubling as food bank advisors because WINZ has again failed to pay student allowances on time," Dr Newman said.

"Some of the students completed their applications in December and started training in January. It is now almost mid February and they still haven't been paid. They make repeated calls to the student help line yet all they get is recorded messages.

"It makes a mockery of the promises of efficiency and reliability made by the Chief Executive of WINZ, Christine Rankin, to the Social Services Select Committee Inquiry last year.

"I call on the Minister responsible Steve Maharey to keep his word and restore taxpayer faith in the public sector by holding Christine Rankin publicly accountable for this habitual non-performance," Dr Newman said.
