ACT Party to Hold Public Rally on Law and Order
===============================================

**Wednesday, 20 March 2002, 5:09 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

The ACT Party will highlight one of its key election messages - "get tough on crime" - at a public rally in Christchurch tomorrow.

ACT leader Richard Prebble will address the lunchtime rally in Cathedral Square, to present ACT's policy of zero tolerance on crime and Truth in Sentencing - where a jail term means the full term.

ACT deputy leader Ken Shirley and MPs Muriel Newman and Stephen Franks will also speak at the rally.

"The ACT Party is determined to take on the government over its Sentencing and Parole Reform Bill," Mr Prebble said.

"The Bill is an arrogant response to the referendum at the last election in which 92 percent of voters said they wanted tougher penalties for violent crime.

"In fact, the Bill represents a softer approach to most violent crime. Violent offenders will no longer have to serve two-thirds of their court-imposed sentence - they will be able to apply for parole after doing just one-third of their time.

"The ACT Party is sending letters to several thousand households in Christchurch, outlining our concerns about the Bill.

"We have organised this public rally to make people aware that the Bill does exactly the opposite of what the government claims," Mr Prebble said.

Before the rally, Mr Prebble will unveil a billboard on the Zero Tolerance for Crime message beside the Main South road in Sockburn.

Mr Prebble will also address a public meeting in the evening at the Cotswold Hotel, Papanui Road, to outline ACT's approach to four key election issues - health, education, the economy and law and order.
