ACT Caucus Retreat In Dunedin
=============================

**Wednesday, 6 June 2001, 2:48 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT Party MPs today began a three-day caucus retreat in Dunedin.

The private retreat at the Southern Cross Hotel is an opportunity for ACT’s nine MPs to discuss strategy and develop policies in the lead-up to the next election.

Leader Richard Prebble said ACT MPs held regular caucus get-togethers and tried to base them in different locations around the country.

While Dunedin is a traditional Labour stronghold, ACT significantly increased its support in the city at the last election and also improved its vote substantially throughout Otago, Mr Prebble said.

While in Dunedin, the ACT MPs will meet business leaders and party supporters at a function on Thursday evening.
