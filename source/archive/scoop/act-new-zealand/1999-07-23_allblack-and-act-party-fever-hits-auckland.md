Allblack and ACT Party Fever hits Auckland
==========================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Friday 23rd Jul 1999 Donna Awatere Huata

  
Allblack fever and ACT party fever will hit the city of sails this weekend with the relaunch of Auckland Central Candidate Donna Awatere Huata's 1999 Election campaign.

Act MP Donna Awatere Huata will send a strong clear message to Aucklanders in downtown Victoria Park Saturday 24th July 1.00pm.

ACT's Education spokesperson says this election will take the country into the 21st century. It's time Auckland central voters made the right choice, to insure their needs are properly represented in the next government".

"Providing our youth with the right education will be the key to this country's success, every child must start school ready to learn, no kiwi teenager should drop out of school simply because they're bored and unmotivated".

"Graffiti and the vandalisation of Auckland's image by the city's growing number of street kids is an example of our education system not meeting the needs of our children.

Donna Awatere Huata says she'll do whatever it takes to insure these kids don't fall through the cracks onto the city's pavement where they only way they can express their creativity and emotional outbursts is through a few blasts of the spray can.

Act Leader Richard Prebble is also speaking alongside his Auckland central candidate as a mark of commitment to Auckland voters.

" Donna Awatere Huata is an example of outstanding talent that ACT is bringing to Parliament. She's without doubt the most outstanding Maori MP in my time in Parliament."

Richard Prebble says I believe she has an important contribution to make to the education sector-not just for Maori, but for the whole country.

The former Auckland Central MP Richard Prebble says Auckland Central has a tradition of sending outstanding MP's to Parliament- ït's time it was revived."

ACT Auckland Central Campaign relaunch Saturday 24th July 1.00pm Victoria Park.
