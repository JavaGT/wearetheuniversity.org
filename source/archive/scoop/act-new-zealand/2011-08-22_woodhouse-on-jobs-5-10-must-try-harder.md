Woodhouse On Jobs: 5/10. Must Try Harder

### Woodhouse On Jobs: 5/10. Must Try Harder

  
Dunedin based ACT MP Hilary Calvert today gave Michael Woodhouse 5/10 for his comments in today's Otago Daily Times on job creation, saying he and the National Party still rely too heavily on government schemes to try to create jobs.

“Michael Woodhouse is right to say that job creation is largely the role of business. It is business, not government, that responds to consumers’ needs, creates jobs, and generates wealth,” Ms Calvert says.

“However the best thing government can do for job creation is to develop good infrastructure, create an environment in which business will thrive and otherwise stay out of the way.

“What government should not do is spend millions of taxpayer dollars on pointless ‘make work’ schemes such as the Job Ops and Community Max schemes lauded by Mr Woodhouse, especially when options, such as reintroducing the youth minimum wage, would achieve better results at almost zero cost.

“For example Job Ops will cost the taxpayer $55 million and, at best, employ 12,000 young people. Yet, reinstating the youth wage would cost virtually nothing and put up to 13,000 young people into work.

“I challenge Mr Woodhouse to truly back business by renouncing expensive schemes such as Job Ops and Community Max. If he does that, those looking for jobs in New Zealand might actually have something to celebrate,” Ms Calvert said.
