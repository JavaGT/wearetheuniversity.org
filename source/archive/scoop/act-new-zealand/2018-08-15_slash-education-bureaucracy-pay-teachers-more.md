Slash education bureaucracy, pay teachers more
==============================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

"The Government could provide a decent pay rise for striking teachers by cutting the fat from our education bureaucracy", says ACT Leader David Seymour.

Today, primary and intermediate school teachers strike for the first time in 24 years.

"The Ministry of Education employs over 2600 bureaucrats - that’s more than the number of schools in New Zealand. There's been a more than 50 per cent increase in the number of Ministry staff since 2002.

"Education bureaucrats are paid $82,000 a year on average.

"Cutting the number of staff at the Education Ministry in half would save $108 million and deliver a $2000 - or over 3 per cent - pay rise for the average New Zealand teacher.

"A growing number of bureaucrats has not delivered better results for New Zealand kids.

"Student scores in the PISA test of maths, science, and reading are now at their lowest point since testing began in 2000.

"The Government should cut back office staff at the Education Ministry and use that money to pay hardworking teachers more", says Mr Seymour.
