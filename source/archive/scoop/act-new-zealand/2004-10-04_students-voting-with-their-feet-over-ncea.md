Students Voting With Their Feet Over NCEA

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today said she wasn't surprised that a growing number of students were deserting the NCEA and sitting Cambridge International Exams instead.

"It was revealed at the Association of Cambridge Schools in New Zealand's annual conference, held over the weekend, that the number of students dumping the NCEA in favour of sitting Cambridge Exams has increased nearly 300 percent since 2002," Miss Coddington said.

"It's little wonder the parents, teachers, schools and students are, in ever-increasing numbers, kicking the flawed NCEA to the curb. Unlike the NCEA - introduced by National, and implemented by Labour - the Cambridge Exam system is widely respected internationally, and by employers.

"ACT would allow schools to retain the NCEA, take up the Cambridge Exams, or return to the gold-plated bursary system that had been such a success before Education Minister Trevor Mallard threw it out.

"A return to national standards and external exams is crucial if our children are to reach their full potential, and if New Zealand's education system is to be the envy of the rest of the world," Miss Coddington said.
