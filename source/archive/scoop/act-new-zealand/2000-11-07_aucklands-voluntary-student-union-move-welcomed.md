Auckland's Voluntary Student Union Move Welcomed

Tuesday 7th Nov 2000 Stephen Franks Media Release -- Education

ACT’s Tertiary Education Spokesman Stephen Franks has welcomed the decision by Auckland University students to retain voluntary membership of the union.

“It was a remarkable achievement, given that the law change earlier this year was designed to allow gerrymandering and unfair influence by vested left wing student interests.

“ACT will be promoting a law to ensure voluntary student membership becomes the aspect of freedom of association it always should have been,” Mr Franks said.
