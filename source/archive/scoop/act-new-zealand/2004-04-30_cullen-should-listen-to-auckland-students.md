Cullen Should Listen To Auckland Students
=========================================

Cullen Should Listen To Auckland Students

ACT New Zealand Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide today said that Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen should listen to Auckland University students and cut the top rate of tax to allow graduates to pay their student loans back quicker.

"Dr Cullen was wrong to play the politics of envy and increase the top rate of tax from 33 to 39 cents. That tax hike was economically damaging and has made it tougher for graduates with loans," Mr Hide said.

"The Auckland University students who voted two to one yesterday for a lower top rate of tax to ease the student loan burden have it right. It's Dr Cullen and the Labour Government who have it wrong.

"It's great to see the new generation of students no longer clamouring for a handout but demanding instead the right to retain more of their hard-earned money. It bodes well for an end of the Labour Government and a prosperous future for New Zealand.

"Don Brash should also listen to the students: he has ruled out an immediate cut to the top rate of tax. The only party standing up for an immediate cut to the top rate of tax is ACT. It's clear that ACT is going to do well amongst students at the next election," Mr Hide said.
