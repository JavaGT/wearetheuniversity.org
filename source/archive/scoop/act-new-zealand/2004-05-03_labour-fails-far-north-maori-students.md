Labour Fails Far North Maori Students

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today slammed the Labour Government for failing to reduce the number of suspensions and stand-downs for Maori children in Northland.

"The numbers of Maori children being suspended or stood-down have skyrocketed. Maori made up 73 percent of suspensions and 70 percent of stand-downs in Northland schools last year," Miss Coddington said.

"Further, Northland Maori suspension rates rose from 226 cases in 2002 to 254 last year - that's an increase of 13 percent.

"Education Minister Trevor Mallard should be ashamed of these figures. It is an indictment on his stewardship of the education portfolio.

"Despite Labour's \`closing the gaps' nonsense, many schools still lack the resources, expertise and motivation to cope with at-risk Maori youth.

"ACT believes choice in education would provide an excellent solution. In overseas countries, school choice - such as Charter Schools - allows professionals to cater for at-risk students with outstanding results.

"This would provide an ideal option for students who are falling through the gaps. The schools would offer greater choice for parents and a second chance for children at risk," Miss Coddington said.
