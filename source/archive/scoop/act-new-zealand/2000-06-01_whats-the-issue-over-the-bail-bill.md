What’s The Issue Over The Bail Bill?
====================================

**Thursday, 1 June 2000, 11:44 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Justice Minister Phil Goff talked tough pre-election about protecting the innocent from crime, yet as a Minister his get tough Bail Bill is a sham, said ACT Corrections spokesman Stephen Franks.

“It shows Corrections Minister Matt Robson has not been politically sidelined for his “milk and cuddles” criminal policy. Instead he has the support of Cabinets academic majority and Phil Goff has not. Phil Goff amended his Bail Bill on Tuesday to hold only villains with 14 or more serious prior convictions. He accepted a further Green amendment at the last minute so that it covers only criminals caught committing an offence while on bail.

“This bizarre“14 strikes and you’re out” cut off point is calculated only to limit the number of extra prison beds needed, because cabinet won’t provide enough. Matt - Cuddles and Milk - Robson clearly has Cabinet support to neuter Phil Goff's limited attempt at giving some effect to election propaganda.

“This insulting amendment is only a bauble tossed to New Zealanders. ACT voted against using remand for trial as preventive detention. We are determined to see sentences that punish and protect, but using remand awaiting trial for that purpose is wrong in principle.

“The presumption of innocence is not a mere technicality to be brushed aside by political grandstanding for public distraction.

“I have moved amendments to be debated today treating offences on bail seriously, rather than the pathetic smack offenders currently get. ACT’s amendments are;  Sentences for offences committed on bail to be served cumulatively not concurrently.  Bail offences are not eligible for the automatic remission that makes every Judge a liar.  Offenders caught offending on bail will be made to serve any time previously remitted.

“Ordinary New Zealand has lost faith in the Government. If it honoured democracy and the 92% of New Zealanders wanting tougher penalties for criminals, the Labour Party would support ACT’s amendments. “National has indicated support for the Bill, so Mr Goff could be sure it will go through whatever Milk and Cuddles Robson thinks, ” said Stephen Franks.

(4) Nothing in section 90 of the Criminal Justice Act 1985 shall apply to any unexpired or subsequent sentence of a person convicted of committing any offence punishable by imprisonment, while on bail.
