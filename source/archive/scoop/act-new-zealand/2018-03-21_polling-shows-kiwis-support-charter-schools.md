Polling shows Kiwis support charter schools

“Polling conducted by Curia Market Research shows New Zealanders support charter schools remaining open and disapprove of the Government’s handling of the issue”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

57 per cent of decided voters agreed charter schools should be allowed to continue operating in their current form, while 60 per cent of decided voters disapprove of the way the Government is dealing with charter schools.

“The Government is on the wrong side of public opinion on this issue. It needs to stop taking advice from the teachers’ unions, start listening to Kiwis, and drop its ideological push to deprive kids of choice.

“I urge New Zealanders who value educational choice for our kids to go to savecharters.kiwi and sign the petition telling the Government to back off. More than 2600 people have already signed it.

“This website also tells people how to make a submission on Chris Hipkins’ legislation to scrap charter schools. It only takes a few minutes and can easily be done online.

“There’s plenty of anger about the Government’s decision to take school choice away from 1500 disadvantaged students. Kiwis nows need to translate that feeling into action”, says Mr Seymour.
