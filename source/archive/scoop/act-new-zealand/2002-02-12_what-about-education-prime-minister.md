What About Education, Prime Minister?
=====================================

**Tuesday, 12 February 2002, 2:49 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Not a word of the Prime Minister's ten page Statement to Parliament addressed New Zealand's failing education system, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"The Prime Minister sermonised about transforming the economy. Talk is cheap. If we really want to turn things around, we need to start with the kids.

"The education system is in trouble. Ms Clark chose to ignore the teacher shortage crisis her Minister's negligence caused. She didn't mention the effects of racist and elitist zoning restrictions, or the low standards her Government espouses for teachers and children.

"The five-thousand children in overcrowded classrooms don't have the luxury of ignoring this issue.

"The Prime Minister failed to address the real issues. Keeping her head in the sand isn't going to fix things for the kids," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
