NCEA Creates Two-Tiered Education System

NCEA Creates Two-Tiered Education System

If Labour needed any more evidence that NCEA is fatally flawed, news that the University of Auckland may not accept students into medicine, engineering, law and architecture courses if they sit unit standards surely provides it, ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

"This is another nail in the coffin of NCEA. The University points out what critics of NCEA have maintained since its inception: it is not possible to rank candidates for courses using NCEA unit standards, as they only tell the university whether a student passed or failed.

"South Auckland principals are right to complain that their schools - which focus on unit standards - will be emptied of academic students. But their anger should be directed at the Labour Government, not Auckland University.

"A two-tiered education system is exceptionally cruel to students whose parents have a low-income. Families on low incomes are robbed of the choice of where they can send their children.

"This is yet another reason why the state monopoly should withdraw from education," Miss Coddington said.
