SaveCharterSchools: Submissions Open, Over 2500 Sign Petition

  
The #SaveCharterSchools campaign is well underway with [submissions now open](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17437&qid=5127835) on the Bill to scrap charter schools and over 2500 New Zealanders [signing the petition](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17438&qid=5127835) to save them in just a couple of weeks.

“Chris Hipkins and the teachers’ unions have spread so many mistruths about charter schools we have set up a section on the savecharters.kiwi website to bust their myths.

“If New Zealanders value educational choice for students who haven’t been served well by our state system, I would urge them to go to the website and sign the petition telling the Government to back off.

“The website also tells people how to make a submission on Chris Hipkins' Bill to end charter schools. It only takes a few minutes and can be done easily online.

“There’s plenty of anger about the Government’s decision to take school choice away from 1500 disadvantaged students. Kiwis nows need to translate that feeling into action", says Mr Seymour.
