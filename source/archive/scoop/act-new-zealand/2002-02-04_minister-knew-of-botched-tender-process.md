Minister Knew of Botched Tender Process

Monday 4 Feb 2002 Penny Webster Press Releases -- Transport

The Transport Minister was told in at least October last year that the botched tender process for the Waikato expressway was Transit's fault, ACT Transport Spokesman MP Penny Webster revealed today.

"Transit New Zealand's admission of responsibility for the Waikato tender shambles is a welcome development in the fight to get the road built, but the Minister must share the blame. He's allowed this to continue without lifting a finger.

"Documents released to me under the Official Information Act show that Transit knew their processes were flawed, and told the Minister so in October last year. They were also experimenting with a new tender system, which is absurd on such an important project.

"Such a mickey mouse operation is simply unacceptable. The Waikato Expressway forms a vital part of the national roading network.

"The death toll on the current road, and the holiday congestion, make it a top priority. Local councils, emergency services and the police all want it finished.

"It is the Minister who is holding up development. He's known about Transit's botched tender process for some time, and done nothing. His failure to act is unacceptable," Mrs Webster said.
