Government Splashes The Cash On Splashes Of Paint
=================================================

**Thursday, 12 August 2021, 6:54 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

“While vulnerable New Zealanders are desperate for shelter, the agency tasked with housing them is spending tens of thousands of dollars on artwork,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“Kainga Ora is supposed to house people, not expensive carvings. We have people living in motels and cars and tenants whose houses aren’t up to standard. Instead of them, Kainga Ora is providing a home to expensive artwork.

“ACT can reveal that Kainga Ora has commissioned a carving for its Takanini office that cost $30,000. It has also commissioned artwork for its Hamilton office to the tune of $5,758.

“Labour used to say ‘you can’t live in a consent,’ well, Jacinda, I guess you can’t live in a carving either.

“Meanwhile the Ministry of Arts Culture and Heritage has decided the best way to support the arts is with its own taxpayer funded collection.

“Between 2019-2021 the Ministry spent over $45,000 on the design and installation of artwork throughout its building.

“The GCSB has spent $5760 on two pieces of artwork. ACT can neither confirm nor deny that it is a full-scale model of James Bond and his Aston Martin.

“Alarm bells are also ringing over the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management spending $5,612 on artwork.

“These might seem like small amounts to Megan Woods, Carmel Sepuloni, Andrew Little and Kris Faafoi who oversee the departments splashing the cash, but this money comes from hardworking Kiwis and it all adds up.

“New Zealanders have household budgets they need to manage; the Government should take the same care when managing its spending.

“The Government is running deficits while the economy is hot, what will it do when things cool down and we need stimulus? It’s time for this Government to take some responsibility and show taxpayers some respect.

“As a country, we deserve better.”
