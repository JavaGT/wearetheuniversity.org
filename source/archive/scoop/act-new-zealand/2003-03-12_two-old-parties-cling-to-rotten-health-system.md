Two Old Parties Cling to Rotten Health System

Two Old Parties Cling to Rotten Health System

Cutting patients from surgery waiting lists is simply what has to happen under New Zealand's outdated, Soviet-style public health model, ACT Health Spokesman Heather Roy said today.

"Only ACT is brave enough to discuss health with intellectual honesty. We believe that whoever is in power should be up front about what the State cannot provide," Mrs Roy said.

"Both Labour and National cling to the pretence that if we would just spend more money on public health, the system would work. Whoever is in Opposition expresses outrage that surgery lists have been cut, while the politician in Government says, "I've increased funding".

"The truth is that demand for quality, affordable healthcare far outstrips supply. We have an aging population. We can't possibly catch up with demand, and paper over all of the cracks in the flawed system.

"Annette King clings to the state-funded monopoly because she is philosophically opposed to private healthcare. Ms King ignores the unfairness the system creates, such as private health patients paying twice for their care. And she refuses to own up to the fact that this out-of-date system holds New Zealand back from implementing a decent and compassionate health care model. Until politicians like her accept the reality that the private sector must be used more in healthcare, thousands more New Zealanders will miss out," Mrs Roy said.
