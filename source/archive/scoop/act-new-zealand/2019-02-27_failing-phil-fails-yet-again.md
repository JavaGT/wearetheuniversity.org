Failing Phil fails yet again
============================

**Wednesday, 27 February 2019, 7:45 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

  
The Housing Minister has taken another hit with revelations KiwiBuild's Chief Executive didn’t even bother to tell his boss he was leaving the post.

"Phil Twyford’s relationship with Stephen Barclay was so bad that the Minister found out about his Chief Executive’s resignation through a press release, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

"How can New Zealanders have confidence that Twyford can build 100,000 houses if he can’t maintain relationships with the people tasked with delivering his programme?

"Almost weekly reports about changing personnel or recalibrating targets show what a shambles KiwiBuild has become.

“The fundamental problem with KiwiBuild, though, is it doesn’t solve the underlying cause of the housing crisis: scarce and overpriced sections.

"We have a shortage of sections, not buildings. The price of the median Auckland section has gone up 903 percent since 1993. KiwiBuild doesn’t do anything to generate more sections. It is just a project to buy houses built by the private sector on the scarce and overpriced sections we already have.

"The million dollar question is: What is Phil Twyford doing to free up more land for development? When will he abolish Auckland’s Metropolitan Urban Limit to help the city grow? We have seen nothing on this front yet.

"KiwiBuild raised the hopes of thousands of New Zealanders, but Failing Phil has stumbled at every hurdle."
