CT Launches Anti-NCEA Petition

ACT Leader Richard Prebble and ACT education spokesperson Donna Awatere Huata today launched a petition calling for the government to abandon the NCEA and reinstate a system of high quality, internationally comparable external exams.

"ACT New Zealand has been the only party that has consistently opposed the NCEA from day one," Mrs Awatere Huata said.

"Alone in Parliament, we have been the voice of parents and students who didn't want this new qualification, and are opposed to its shoddy and substandard implementation.

"We intend to continue to lead the fight against Trevor Mallard's failed experiment until the bitter end because our children deserve better."
