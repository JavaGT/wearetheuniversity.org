ACT Leader farewells rural MPs on Heartland Tour

Wednesday 6th Oct 1999  
Richard Prebble  
Speech -- Other

The ACT Party is launching a Heartland Tour. ACT in Parliament has been the voice of rural New Zealand. On ACT's list, we have more farmers than National, Labour and the Alliance put together.

On current polling ACT's candidate number eight, former Auckland Federated Farmers President Penny Webster will be an MP on 27 November.

Gerry Eckhoff, a well-known South Island High Country farmer at number 9 will also be an MP on current polling.

They will be joining former New Zealand President of Federal Farmers and the voice of rural New Zealand in Parliament, Owen Jennings, in a tour of the heartland.

ACT's other heartland candidates Cambridge farmer Andy Davies and Graham Hewett will join the tour that begins in the bay of Plenty on Monday and finishes in Mosgiel two weeks later.

ACT went within one thousand votes of winning the safest rural seat in New Zealand in the Taranaki/King Country by-election.

ACT has stood up for farmers who are being bankrupted by feel good laws, unnecessary red tape, bureaucracy and waste. ACT MPs have got rid of stamp duty, we have made changes to ACC.

ACT has an eight point plan to restore profitability to the farming sector. National and Labour regard farming as a sunset industry.

ACT says our farmers are the best in the world. The quickest way to correct the balance of payments, to restore rural towns, to get jobs is to restore the bottom line profitability of farming. Labour has declared on the West Coast that the heartland is surplus to requirements, that to quote Dr Cullen "Labour values have moved on".

National has neglected rural New Zealand. Mr Peters, as Treasury, nearly bankrupted it. The Alliance wants the heartland to be a national park.

Only ACT is proud to say the values of heartland New Zealand - hard work, honesty, thrift and personal responsibility are the values of ACT. ACT is pleased and proud to be the party of heartland New Zealand.
