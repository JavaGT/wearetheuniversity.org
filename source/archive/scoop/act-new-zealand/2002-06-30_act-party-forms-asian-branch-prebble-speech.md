ACT Party Forms Asian Branch - Prebble Speech
=============================================

**Sunday, 30 June 2002, 10:17 pm**  
**Speech: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Speech by Hon Richard Prebble, Leader ACT New Zealand  
at the launch of ACT’s Asian Chapter  
at the Dynasty Restaurant, 57-59 Wakefield Street, Auckland  
on Friday 28th June 2002, at 7pm

  
Welcome to tonight’s historic function – the formation of ACT New Zealand’s Asian Branch.

ACT believes that we are the party that truly represent the aspirations of New Zealand’s new Asian immigrants. The ACT Party’s values are values associated with Asia -respect for hard work, thrift and personal responsibility.

ACT is the party with the vision of how prosperous New Zealand could be. ACT says it is the private sector that invests, creates jobs and growth. So ACT is the party most supportive of business - and in New Zealand, business means small business.

ACT says that New Zealand cannot grow and prosper with the highest company tax rate in the Asia Pacific Region. ACT’s policy is to implement the McLeod Tax Review and immediately reduce company tax to 28 percent. We need to reduce personal tax rates to just two – 28 percent and 18 percent – lower than Australia. This will give every worker a tax cut.

Lower taxes will boost investment, jobs and growth. Lower taxes will help reduce the number of people on benefits. Lower taxes will assist new immigrants to start new businesses.

A country that is prosperous, but where you are not safe, has lost its values. ACT is the party toughest on crime. ACT will stop the early release of violent prisoners from jail. The Asian community has been targeted by these violent thugs. ACT’s policy is, I know, strongly supported by Asian voters.

ACT has been seeking to be the party of choice of Asian New Zealanders for some time. Last election, ACT had two Asian New Zealanders on our party list, with high list places – Alex Wong and Carol Wong. Alex was then elected to the Board of ACT by the members. This election we have Kenneth Wang, our candidate for Mount Roskill, and he will be high on our list.

I have been impressed by Kenneth Wang. He has been assisting us with our election billboards. ACT has become the first party to put up election billboards with Chinese script.

Can I thank the team that has put the Asian Chapter together. They have asked me not to thank them individually because this has been a team effort. But I know they have worked hard and been very generous with their time and money. Let me just mention Simon Kan. I have known Simon for over 20 years and I greatly appreciate his vision and energy that has made the Asian Chapter of ACT a reality.

Simon said to me that ACT is the Asian voters’ true party. ACT is the only party that believes that everyone in New Zealand has an equal opportunity. This is correct. ACT has opposed race-based laws, race quotas at university and separate representation for Maori. Those laws discriminate against the New Zealand Asian community.

ACT has a vision of Asian New Zealanders playing an equal role in New Zealand. It is possible that an Asian New Zealander could one day lead the ACT Party, one day lead our nation. ACT is the party of the future, it is a future that is as bright as we together want to make it.

When we create that future one day you will say – I was there at the Dynasty Restaurant on Friday 28th June when we started ACT’s Asian Chapter. When we founded the Asian Chapter of ACT and we opened the door of opportunity for all New Zealanders.

ENDS
