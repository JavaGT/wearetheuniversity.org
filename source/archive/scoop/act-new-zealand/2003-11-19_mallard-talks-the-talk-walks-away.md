Mallard Talks The Talk, Walks ... Away?

Wednesday 19 Nov 2003 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education -- Save Our Schools

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today expressed shock and dismay at Education Minister Trevor Mallard's behaviour during a public meeting to discuss the possible closure of six West Coast schools.

"Mr Mallard's behaviour was rude and erratic. He threatened to walk out on the crowd of 120 concerned parents, teachers and students, and described the presence of children at the meeting as \`irresponsible and unprofessional'," Miss Coddington said.

"Could this appalling reaction truly be from the same Minister who, only a couple of months ago, emailed me to say: \`I always front and boards know that'.

"Mr Mallard should resist from sending me emotive emails. Also, he should try paying closer attention to the needs and wishes of small communities who have been subjected to his misguided programme of school network reviews.

"The Minister should start acting like ... well, a Minister of the Crown. The origins of the Labour Party stem from the West Coast. Nearly a century later, this is the thanks that West Coasters get. Paddy Webb would be spinning in his grave - whatever happened to \`Solidarity For Ever'?", Miss Coddington said.
