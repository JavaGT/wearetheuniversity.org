Zoning Puts Squeeze On Popular Schools
======================================

Tuesday 15 Jan 2002

The Government has abandoned some of the country's most popular schools and is leaving them alone to battle the effects of the coalition's blatantly racist and elitist zoning system.

"It is unacceptable that some of our best schools cannot properly plan classes and timetables, are having to restrict subjects, and are teaching students in substandard facilities.

"The Government should have well known that its zoning system would cause a rush of parents moving into areas with good schools so they can do the best they can for their children in an unfair system.

"Now these popular schools are being forced to cope, without any help from the Government.

"If these schools experience a drop in education standards it will be the Government's fault. The ridiculous zoning system is actually acting as a disincentive for top schools to maintain their standards. Trevor Mallard must now abandon zoning to give every school and every child a chance," Donna Awatere Huata said.
