Young Kiwi Talent Should Be Encouraged - ACT
============================================

Muriel Newman  
Media Release -- Economy

ACT Broadcasting Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman today said National and Labour had fallen into the same old trap of promising to set up 'feel good quangos' to support kiwi musical talent.

"Labour and National have got into another bidding war on this without focusing on the real issues.

"ACT is the only Party that is saying let's stop just throwing money at problems. Let's actually tackle them and get on with real solutions. A fairer way to assist New Zealand businesses and artists is to reduce the barriers to jobs and growth in the economy as a whole.

"The only way to encourage young talent is to reward those in the music industry for their hard work and enterprise with lower taxes. Rather than throwing $200,000 a year at a Music Industry Forum, Government should be getting on with cutting the top tax rate to 20 cents. That would be the greatest boost they could give every industry.

"The other question we must ask is what effect the Government assisted Youth Radio Network will have on jobs in the commercial radio stations that have taken a risk to get into the market and have paid their own way. What about student radio stations like BFM and Radio Active that are self supporting and are doing an excellent job of promoting kiwi music and kiwi talent, how will they cope now that Government has tipped the playing field?

"While National and Labour are trying to out do each other, they may be doing hard working New Zealanders in commercial radio out of jobs," said Muriel Newman.
