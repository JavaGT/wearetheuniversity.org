NZQA's apology hollow, says Franks

The NZQA’s apology to students and parents over the NCEA Scholarship exams debacle is hollow, ACT Associate Education and Commerce spokesman Stephen Franks said today.

“If a business provided such a sloppy service to its customers like the NZQA has to students who sat Scholarship exams, then some sort of refund would be expected.

“NZQA board member Catherine Gibson’s apology will be a hollow apology unless students and their parents get their money back for exam and reassessment fees.

“Associate Education Minister David Benson-Pope tried to squelch questions several months ago in Parliament with the suggestion that refunds were being considered. He’s in charge. If his government thinks it’s fine to whack businesses for well-intended but abysmal performance, the least he can do is make the NZQA’s apology mean something,” Mr Franks said.
