Unions try to deprive parents of choice
=======================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

“Teachers’ unions should stop interfering with charter schools and trying to deprive parents and students of choice”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

[RNZ today reported](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17953&qid=5556497) that NZEI has made several submissions opposing applications for charter schools to re-join the state system as designated character schools.

“How is it the business of teachers’ unions which schools are allowed to remain open?

“Would we let bus drivers decide bus routes? Should we allow baristas decide what coffee we need?

“Parents and children should determine which schools are set up and where.

“Teachers’ unions should not have the right to veto the educational offerings parents and children have available to them.

“It shows the unions are deeply afraid different educational models might succeed where the state system has failed”, says Mr Seymour.
