ACT Announces List For 2023 General Election
============================================

**Sunday, 16 July 2023, 5:06 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT has today announced its list for the 2023 General Election.

“New Zealanders from all walks of life are demanding real change. Today, ACT has announced a talented and diverse team of Kiwis equipped to deliver it,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“In 2020, 10 ACT MPs were elected against all odds and every political commentator’s prediction. This term, they’ve defied expectations in the best way, being far and away the most disciplined and high-performing caucus in Parliament, and growing the party to the point where we will add more MPs in 2023.

“ACT’s list of candidates is a true representation of New Zealand society. There are farmers, legal experts, business executives, tradies, mothers and fathers, army lieutenants, policy experts, small business owners, teachers, engineers, licensed firearms owners and more. We have candidates from all walks of like. The one thing they all have in common is that they share a vision for real change.

“Kiwis reading the news today see a country in terminal decline. Almost every part of life is becoming more expensive, less productive, and less safe. This year’s election can’t be about just changing the Government, it needs to be about changing the direction of the country.

“ACT has put forward policies that address the cost-of-living crisis, restore law and order, get rid of divisive race-based policy, and make it easier to build affordable homes. ACT’s economic policies will restore the productivity and prosperity that New Zealand needs to move forward as a first world nation with the sort of health and education services that people expect and deserve.

“This is the team putting real change on the agenda. New Zealand can’t afford to go through another term of Labour running down every aspect of society followed by National slowing the decline but ultimately keeping things the same. History tells us the courage to reverse Labour’s policies and have real change won’t exist unless ACT is a big part of the next government.
