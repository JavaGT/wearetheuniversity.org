Fees-Free’s Fatal Flaw

Fees-Free’s Fatal Flaw

"Chris Hipkins has confirmed the Government will this year waste about $38 million of taxpayer money on its flagship fees-free policy”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“In response to a select committee question, Hipkins said the dropout rate for first year students studying a bachelor’s degree was 14 per cent.

“‘Fees-free’ will cost $275 million this year, so New Zealanders can except about $38 million of their taxes to deliver exactly nothing.

“This is a colossal waste, even by Labour’s standards.

“‘Fees-free’ is a subsidy for well-off kids who would have gone to university anyway and who will earn much more over their lives than non-graduates.

”Hipkins should admit failure and scrap it now", says Mr Seymour.
