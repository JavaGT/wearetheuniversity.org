We need 500,000 houses, Nick Smith’s reforms aren’t helping
===========================================================

**We need 500,000 houses and Nick Smith’s reforms aren’t helping**

RMA reforms set to pass today will do nothing to address New Zealand’s housing shortfall of 500,000, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“Shamubeel Eaqub has [pointed out the obvious](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15365&qid=3945873): until we start building at the rate we achieved in the ‘70s, housing will remain unaffordable.

“It’s this simple problem responsible for the rental squeeze affecting [students](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15366&qid=3945873), [teachers](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15367&qid=3945873), and anyone trying to save for a home.

“Meanwhile, long-awaited reforms to the Resource Management Act are set to pass today, but won’t actually help to get houses built.

“The reforms have been watered down by National’s lack of vision and adulterated by the Maori Party’s iwi provisions.

“At this point, Nick Smith seems more interested in being seen to be doing something than actually getting houses built.

“Only a stronger ACT will force National to follow the Productivity Commission's advice and replace the RMA with a coherent law, within 3 years. ACT will scrap the regulatory barriers that block housing development and restore housing affordability for all New Zealanders.”
