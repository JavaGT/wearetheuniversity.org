ACT supports Unitech's legal action

Thursday 20 Jan 2005

Deborah Coddington - Press Releases - Education

ACT New Zealand totally supports Auckland Unitec in its legal fight against the Labour Government to obtain university status, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today

"For five years, Unitec has obeyed all the rules and jumped through all the hoops in order to meet all the criteria to become a university," Miss Coddington said.

"It has full support from its student community, local government in West Auckland, local iwi, and the teaching staff.

"But former Tertiary Minister Steve Maharey has behaved irresponsibly by introducing a bill late last year to block Unitec's application.

"The bill is undemocratic and unconstitutional because it will be applied retrospectively.

"Therefore Unitec has been left with no option but to file legal proceedings in the Wellington High Court.

"More in sorrow than anger that ACT supports this move," Miss Coddington said.
