Full force of law needed for citizenship scam
=============================================

**Thursday, 14 October 1999, 11:10 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT Leader Richard Prebble supports the action of Immigration Minister Tuariki Delamere in referring a Maori citizenship scam to the police.

Mr Prebble said he hoped the police were prepared to prosecute. If not, doubts could be raised over whether New Zealand really had one law for everyone.

"If, as reported, over a thousand people have been signed up at $1,000 it should also be referred to the Commerce Commission and Serious Fraud Office," Mr Prebble said.

"If the charges are proved, the full force of the law should fall upon the fraudsters."
