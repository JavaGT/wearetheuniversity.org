Muriel Newman To Address International Welfare Conference

ACT New Zealand Social Welfare Spokesman, Dr Muriel Newman MP, has been invited to address the prestigious Australian Consilium Conference.

The annual three-day public policy conference organised by Sydney based Centre for Independent Studies, will be held in Australia in late July and will feature prominent leaders from business, politics, academia and the wider community.

Consilium has developed an international reputation as a straight-talking, free-thinking symposium, which does not shy away from exploring some of the more challenging economic, social, cultural and regional issues facing public policy makers.

One of those issues is welfare reform. Dr Newman will participate in an international panel discussion on welfare reform in the UK, Australia, the USA and New Zealand. Heading the panel will be Professor Peter Saunders, Director of Social Policy at CIS.

Other participants include Hon Tony Abbott MP, Australian Minister of Social Welfare, Hon Frank Field MP, former Minister of Welfare Reform in the British Labour Government, and Lawrence Mead, Professor of Politics at New York University, USA.

Following the Australian conference, Dr Newman will be hosting a Welfare Reform Symposium in New Zealand, with guest presentations from Professor Peter Saunders, Hon Frank Field MP, and Professor Lawrence Mead.

Other contributors include New Zealanders, Hon Michael Bassett, Hon Roger Douglas and Alan Duff.

Details, including an opportunity to register interest, can be found on Dr Newman's website at [http://www.newman.co.nz](http://www.newman.co.nz)
