ACT will sort out the shambles Govts have caused in housing

**ACT will sort out the shambles Governments have caused in housing**

"Government interference over the years have made a dog’s breakfast of housing in New Zealand,” said ACT Leader Jamie Whyte.

“It should be obvious that if government removed the needless regulations on land use that restricts supply, the number of houses built would dramatically increase. The housing needs would be met at a more affordable price."

"It is imperative that we throw out the Resource Management Act, which has been a disaster for the country. We should reduce the directives to Local Government to hire thousands of planners - they make the consents for planning and building as complex and expensive as they possibly can.”

“Get rid of the Municipal Urban Limit in Auckland, and similar boundaries around other New Zealand cities, and get on with putting a roof over people's heads. This was the New Zealand way before Government policies created bureaucratic empires of entanglement.”

“ACT is on the side of property owners, would be property owners, and against Government standing in the way of people getting housing.”

“National is too 'national lite' to do anything effective about the shortage of affordable houses in the country, but voters can Party vote ACT to get some action on housing,” said Jamie Whyte.
