Labour offers Jim Sutton and a chicken farmer

Jim Sutton and a chicken farmer are all that Labour offers

The Labour party is claiming to represent rural New Zealand but has only two farmer candidates - Jim Sutton and a chicken farmer, says ACT Leader Richard Prebble.

"Rural New Zealand will rightfully scorn two farmer candidates out of a Labour list more than half full of academics, teachers and unionists.

"By contrast, ACT's list contains 12 farmers and 8 who are at least part-time farmers. There are four farmers in the top ten of ACT's list.

"Labour will simply create more Ministries and commissions and spend even more taxpayers' money pretending to solve rural problems.

"But government is the problem, not the solution. ACT says the quickest way to correct the balance of payments, to restore rural towns and get jobs is to restore the bottom line profitability of farming by getting government off farmers' backs.

"ACT is currently on heartland tour of both the North and South Islands, standing up for farmers who are being bankrupted by 'feel good' laws, unnecessary red tape, and government bureaucracy and waste."
