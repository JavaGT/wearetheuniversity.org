Med School Future Depends On Newtown Hospital Site
==================================================

SPEECH TO WELLINGTON SCHOOL OF MEDICINE SURGICAL RESEARCH TRUST.

Takahe Room Plaza International Hotel, Wellington 5.30pm Thurs 12 August  
Hon Richard Prebble CBE  
Leader ACT New Zealand, MP Wellington Central

  
Future of Wellington Medical School depends on new hospital being at Newtown

As Member of Parliament for Wellington Central, I am honoured that the  
Wellington School of Medicine Surgical Research Trust has asked me to be your  
guest speaker at the Trust's annual dinner.

It gives me an opportunity to say three things. Firstly, why New Zealand  
medical research is important and secondly, why private sector involvement is  
vital and thirdly, why having a medical school in Wellington is important to my  
constituents.

New Zealand is a small country with less population than the city of Sydney.  
Medical research is very expensive. Many research projects turn out to be  
blind alleys. Why not decide that research is for large prosperous countries  
and just concentrate on say lowering waiting lists?

There are a number of reasons why abandoning our own research would be a very  
bad idea. Let me give just one. The medical problems that different nations  
face are very different. If we lived in the Solomon Islands where the malaria  
rate in Honiara is 108% each year - some unfortunates catch it twice in a  
year - then malaria would be our medical number one priority.

New Zealand has medical challenges that are unique to our country. No one else  
is going to study us and if we don't, then the problems will get worse. Let  
me illustrate by taking just one of the projects that the Trust is supporting -  
prostate cancer research. Let me quote from the summary of the research  
project.

"Prostate cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in New Zealand  
men. The death rate from prostate cancer has been steadily increasing over the  
last 30 years, so that the mortality among New Zealand men is now fifth  
highest in the world."

The research summary goes on to say:

"In New Zealand we are seriously hampered by lack of any accurate knowledge of  
how common the problem really is. We have a multicultural society and yet  
there is no data relating to Maori, Polynesian or men of other ethnic  
backgrounds. Of great interest is that globally it is believed that prostate  
cancer is commoner in blacks and in men with a diet high in animal fat and low  
in yellow/green vegetables. In New Zealand we do not know what the  
predisposing factors (if any) are.

The aims of this study are as follows:

ž To determine the incidence of prostate cancer in men with specific reference  
to men of Maori and Polynesian descent.  
ž To determine whether race (ethnic group) is a significant risk factor.  
ž To determine the importance of family history.  
ž To determine whether there are any other risk factors such as diet, previous  
infections of the prostate, environment and so on."

If we don't do that research no one else will. Why not say that this research  
is so good that the taxpayer should fund it all?

Because the demand on the public purse will always exceed the money available.  
This is my second point. Experience has taught us that the quality of  
outcomes from projects that have a significant private contribution are  
significantly higher than those purely funded by the taxpayer.

There is a very good reason for this. Public projects become political.  
Politicians cannot help themselves - they want to get re-elected.

Our example is a good one. Prostate cancer, I understand, kills more than  
breast cancer. Perhaps it's because women are more sensible than men -  
breast cancer is debated and there is wide public understanding.

I did not realise, until I was reading this backgrounder, that New Zealand is  
now fifth in the world for prostate deaths. I get many letters and lobbying  
for breast cancer funding - which I support. I can't recall ever getting  
lobbied for research into prostate cancer.

If the private sector does not support this research - the chances of purely  
taxpayer funded politicised research funding for such a project is remote. So  
you are meeting a real need.

Which brings me to my third point, why having a medical school in Wellington is  
such an asset to the region.

I spoke to Form 1 & 2 pupils from St Teresa's school in Karori this morning.  
The class is doing a project on the resources available to Wellington and  
Wellington's role in the economy.

Of course we discussed the economic effects of being the capital, the effects  
of being also the cultural capital, of becoming a tourism centre and my  
campaign to attract new corporates to Wellington.

I pointed out to the students that one advantage Wellington has over Auckland  
is this city is a centre of educational excellence. A good university,  
polytechnic and good schools attract corporates to locate here.

So too with medicine. To get a world class tertiary hospital for Wellington  
means we need to attract top professionals and the medical school is an  
important attraction.

The medical school being at Newtown is a vital part of the cluster of medical  
excellence in that suburb. It's one of the reasons why Newtown is the only  
site for a tertiary hospital.

You can't have a medical school in Newtown and the tertiary hospital in  
Porirua.

I have no doubt that should the tertiary hospital be built in Porirua,  
Wellington's medical school won't be able to get funding to move to Porirua and  
will not survive as a separate facility for very long.

Medical politics being what it is, there are some who are promoting Kenepuru  
because they know that such a development will lead to many tertiary services  
and our medical school being relocated to another city.

I have no doubt Wellington would be the loser, along with our reputation as a  
centre of educational excellence. So as MP for Wellington Central, this is a  
battle I am determined not to lose.
