ACT announces Dr Ron Smith as Hamilton East candidate

ACT Leader Dr Jamie Whyte is pleased to announce Dr Ron Smith as ACT's candidate for Hamilton East. Dr Smith was formerly the Director of Defence and Strategic Studies at the University of Waikato and has written extensively on international affairs, particularly security and nuclear issues.

"ACT is very pleased to have someone of Dr Ron Smith's calibre representing the party in Hamilton East," says Dr Whyte.

"Ron was a member of ACT in the party's early days. He has re-joined because he knows the way to a free and prosperous New Zealand is through ACT's policies - specifically a low flat tax, cutting green tape, getting tough on crime and 'one country, one law.'"

Says Dr Smith, "I am excited to join ACT's campaign and to campaign for the party vote in Hamilton East. There is a crucial political debate going on about the future of New Zealand, and I am proud to be on the side that is promoting freedom, choice and prosperity.

"The only way for Hamiltonians to support this future, and these policies, is to give their party vote to ACT on 20 September."
