ACT applauds Teach First expansion

ACT Leader David Seymour has applauded [the Government’s decision](http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=14463&qid=3541953) to push on with the Teach First policy.

“We need a wider range of pathways to ensure that talented individuals are put in front of Kiwi students. Teach First fulfils this need,” says Mr Seymour.

“We know that teacher quality is one of the most important determinants to ensure student success, so targeting top graduates is a no-brainer.

“If programs like Teach First are producing better results than traditional teacher training, then so be it. The purpose of teacher qualification should be to improve outcomes for students, not to protect the status quo.”
