ACT Finds Out Facts In Truck Ride
=================================

**Monday, 10 December 2001, 9:37 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Friday 7 Dec 2001

ACT Transport Spokesman MP Penny Webster is looking forward to riding through the Rodney district in a truck tomorrow.

"ACT is proud to support the transport industry. Trucking employs tens of thousands of New Zealanders. They form the backbone of our transport network.

"ACT believes that the roading system needs to be improved, and has consistently called on the Government to show some initiative in this area. Auckland and the Rodney district are two examples of areas where the politicians have talked the talk, but haven't done anything to make the roads safer.

"ACT believes in finding out what the true story is, talking to people who are in the business.

"I look forward to seeing how a truckie spends his day," Mrs Webster said.

ENDS
