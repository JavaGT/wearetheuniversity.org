**VUWSA Supports VSM**  
**_Press Release by Hon Sir Roger Douglas, ACT New Zealand  
Wednesday, October 14 2009_**

ACT New Zealand MP Sir Roger Douglas today welcomed the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association's support for his Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill.

"VUWSA held a Student Representative Council on the issue of voluntary student membership. A group of spirited supporters turned out to support the Bill, and ended passing a motion in support of the Bill by 45 votes to 35," Sir Roger said.

"This was despite the best efforts of the opponents of the Bill, who tried to shut down the meeting at every opportunity, calling for quorum motions over and over again despite the fact that quorum was clearly met.

"I am very pleased that students are having their voice heard on this issue. No group of students should be forced to join an association, and I am pleased to see that students on campus are aware that their freedom is being violated," Sir Roger Douglas said.
