Rural Otago Crime Stats Disgraceful: Eckhoff

ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman and Otago-based MP Gerry Eckhoff today demanded that Otago MP David Parker explain just how his Government intends to fix the problem of skyrocketing crime in rural Otago, as revealed in new crime statistics.

"Today's statistics show that Labour has abandoned rural Otago, where crime has jumped over 14 percent between 2001 and 2004," Mr Eckhoff said.

"Farmers will be shocked to learn that property damage has grown 25 percent between 2001 and 2004 and, I predict, it will only get worse as the Government forces farmers to open their land to unlimited public access.

"Violent crime has risen by a shocking 35 percent since 2001. This sharp increase is a stunning indictment on Labour's soft-on-crime approach to law and order.

"Mr Parker should get his act together and stand up for his constituents. We haven't heard a peep from him at a time when Labour is reducing the number of sworn police officers in his very own constituency.

"Rural Otago is sick of crime, and even sicker of politicians who refuse to fight for them. If Mr Parker isn't prepared to represent his community's concerns, then he should resign - or expect to be chucked out in 2005," Mr Eckhoff said.
