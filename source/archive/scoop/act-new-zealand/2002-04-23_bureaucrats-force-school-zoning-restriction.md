Bureaucrats Force School Zoning Restriction
===========================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

The Ministry of Education's rejection of Paraparaumu College's enrolment scheme shows school zones are created by bureaucrats rather than educators, ACT MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"The decile eight school is being forced by bureaucrats at the Ministry of Education to cut its proposed enrolment zone substantially.

"Schools and the community should be making these decisions, not the Ministry.

"School zoning is an unfair, elitist practice that forces children into dysfunctional schools and blocks parental choice," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
