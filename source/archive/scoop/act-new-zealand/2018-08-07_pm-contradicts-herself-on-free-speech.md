PM contradicts herself on free speech
=====================================

**Tuesday, 7 August 2018, 2:58 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

"The Prime Minister has completely contradicted herself on the Massey University free speech issue", says ACT Leader David Seymour.

"Ms Ardern has said she disapproves of Massey’s decision to ban Dr Brash but she will keep giving the University taxpayer money to do it.

In Parliament this afternoon, the Prime Minister said she believed Massey University’s decision was an ‘overreaction’ but went on to confirm that she would do nothing about it.

"What message does it send to publicly-funded institutions that they can shut down political views they don’t like without facing any consequences?

"What is the point of being Prime Minister if you can’t show leadership?

"The Prime Minister should be sending a strong message to universities that if they undermine freedom of expression they will be defunded.
