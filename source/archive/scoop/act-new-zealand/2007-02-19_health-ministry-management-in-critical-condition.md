Health Ministry Management In Critical Condition

A Treasury report highlighting management problems at the Ministry of Health coupled with a Ministry of Health internal review shows that management at the Ministry is in critical condition, said ACT Health Spokesman, Heather Roy.

"The Treasury report, dated 25 February 2005 but only released to the public last week, notes that the Ministry 'is a reluctant follower rather than a leader at times' and 'lacks coordination and a united approach'", Mrs Roy said.

"Nearly two years later, little has changed. An internal report from December 2006 says that the Ministry is still averse to risk, slow to make decisions, has no long term strategy and the various departments don't talk to each other.

"The Treasury report notes that hospital efficiency appears to have fallen by 7.7%, with new spending far outstripping measured treatments.

"Health Minister Pete Hodgson is in denial that, despite Labour spending an extra $3.5 billion a year on health, there are no extra health services as a result.

"To see the truth, the Minister only needs to listen to Treasury, his Director-General - who released the internal report - or any one of the tens of thousands of Kiwis waiting for health treatment.

"Treasury also notes that increased staff numbers have not led to higher outputs, and that mixed messages are sent to District Health Boards - who are then blamed for the Ministry's confusion.

"Under Labour, spending on the health bureaucracy has rocketed. Head office staffing has risen around 40%, and District Health Boards and Primary Health Organisation bureaucracies cost over $40 million a year.

"Proper management and medicine have been replaced by delays and spin doctoring. The losers are ordinary Kiwis, suffering and in pain, when beds are available in private hospitals.

"It's time for Pete Hodgson to wake up from his denials and take action. The health and wellbeing of our fellow New Zealanders depends on it", Mrs Roy said.
