Labour's No Show At ECO-N Launch A Disgrace

Thursday 12 Feb 2004 Gerry Eckhoff Press Releases -- Rural

ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff today welcomed the launch of ECO-N - a new product to reduce nitrate leaching into waterways - but was disappointed at Labour's failure to send a representative.

"Developed by Lincoln University, in partnership with farmer-owned Ravensdown Fertiliser, ECO-N could be one of the most significant pastoral farming advances since the 19^th Century development of super phosphate," Mr Eckhoff said.

"By reducing the amount of nitrate leaching into waterways, by up to 60 percent, ECO-N will have an enormous impact on the environment. This will contribute enormously to water quality - especially within dairy farming regions, where Fish & Game has been hugely critical of dairy farming practices.

"The failure of both Fish & Game, and Labour, to send representatives to this auspicious launch did not go unnoticed by the 500 farmers in attendance. I was sad to see that, although not the only Parliamentarian invited, I was the only one who understood the significance of the event and turned up.

"It's insulting that the Government did not send a representative to the launch of this revolutionary product - which will have positive implications world-wide. This no show is indicative of Labour's attitude towards the agriculture sector," Mr Eckhoff said.
