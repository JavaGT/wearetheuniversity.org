Defence Minister Faces Battle - Roy

Heather Roy Wednesday, 19 October 2005 Press Releases - Defence

"Incoming Defence Minister Phil Goff faces a battle to represent the armed forces in Cabinet", said Heather Roy, ACT's Defence spokesman, today.

"New Zealanders take our role as international citizens seriously. Unfortunately, successive Governments haven't.

"The outgoing Minister watched our forces decline. The findings of the Defence Capability and Resourcing Review, reported two days ago, showed a shortage of 2500 defence personnel.

In August, Mr Goff told Australian Defence College personnel that "we sustain military forces as combat ready", but in reality we have to scavenge from our allies before any significant deployment, Mrs Roy said.

"I hope that Mr Goff will ensure that our armed forces get the political and financial support they need.

"Our defence force needs the capability to deploy into the world's trouble spots as an independent force, as well as alongside other countries.

"ACT is committed to a strong, balanced defence force, comprising both regular and reserve forces. A coherant approach to national security across Minstries is required, alongside increases in effective funding and the development of both traditional and new alliances", Mrs Roy said.
