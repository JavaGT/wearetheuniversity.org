Gravy, Anyone?

Thursday 25 Mar 2004

Dr Muriel Newman Press Releases - Social Welfare

Recent revelations about the Government's highly questionable spending through the Community Employment Group's Social Entrepreneur Fund are simply a snapshot of Labour's blasé attitude toward taxpayers' money, ACT New Zealand Social Welfare Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.

"In my Column today, \`All Aboard The Government Gravy Train', I have outlined a number of questionable initiatives which were funded through these grants," Dr Newman said.

"And it is not just frivolous spending on hip-hop research, or gay and lesbian sports - it seems that Labour is now in the habit of funding tertiary study for select students.

"I am also looking into whether some of these grants have been awarded to political friends of the Labour Party. If it is true that more than $50,000 in taxpayers' money was awarded to the Government's political cronies and mates, then it is clear: Labour is nothing more than a gravy train government that looks after its own," Dr Newman said.
