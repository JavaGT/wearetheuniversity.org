ACT calls on Greens to abandon outdated GMO policy

Press release: ACT New Zealand

As over 100 Nobel Laureates call on Greenpeace to abandon its outdated position on genetic modification, ACT is calling on New Zealand Green MPs to do the same.

The fourteen Green MPs, none of whom have any scientific training, maintain the policy of ‘keeping the Aotearoa New Zealand environment free of GE organisms'.

This stands in stark contrast to 107 Nobel Laureates, who wrote:

“We call upon the governments of the world to reject Greenpeace's campaign against Golden Rice specifically, and crops and foods improved through biotechnology in general; and to do everything in their power to oppose Greenpeace's actions and accelerate the access of farmers to all the tools of modern biology, especially seeds improved through biotechnology, opposition based on emotion and dogma contradicted by data must be stopped.”

“The Green Party needs to catch up with science, and modify its position on genetic modification, especially when Golden Rice has the ability to give sight to thousands of babies struggling with a lack of Vitamin A,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.
