PM Must Listen To Ratepayers
============================

PM Must Listen To Ratepayers

ACT Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide said today that Prime Minister Helen Clark can't sit on the rate revolt sideline. "She is the Prime Minister. She has to listen to the hardship and heartache that spiralling rates are causing working families and pensioners. Her silence to date has been deafening.

"It's time that Prime Minister Helen Clark had a care. It's time that she dropped her "Let them eat cake" attitude.

"Rate rises have been double the rate of inflation over the last four years. Rates are proving a crushing burden on working families and pensioners.

"And it's not just Aucklanders who are suffering. I have had the Parliamentary Library prepare a report on rate rises for the year ahead. The list is not yet complete. It is based on annual plans, draft annual plans and news reports. The figures are not all final. But what Councils are planning is truly shocking.

"The Banks Peninsula District Council is planning an increase of 16.6 percent, the Franklin District Council 16.1 percent, the Marlborough District Council 11.6 percent, the Ashburton District Council 10.3 percent - and, of course, - the Auckland Regional Council leading the way with a whopping 34 percent increase.

"Ratepayers need protection from big spending city councils. Local governments are pillaging ratepayers. These big spending councils make the Sheriff of Nottingham look frugal and just.

"It's time Prime Minister Helen Clark and her MPs listened to what ratepayers have to say. She should support my Local Government (Rating Cap) Amendment Bill at least to Select Committee and give the public a chance to have their say.

"My Bill seeks to limit local government excesses and provide ratepayers some relief from the crippling demands of their local council. The Bill caps rate increases in any year to consumer price inflation for the preceding year, plus two percent. The maximum in any three-year period is set to the rate of consumer price inflation for the preceding three years plus four percent. It provides for the Minister of Local Government to grant dispensations, in special circumstances, with any such dispensations to be notified in the gazette along with accompanying reasons.

"The National Party have said they will support my Bill to Select Committee. It's time the Prime Minister had a heart and pledged the Labour Party's support of my Bill at least to Select Committee so that the public can have their say," Mr Hide said.
