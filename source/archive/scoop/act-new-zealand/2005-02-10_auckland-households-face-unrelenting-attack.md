Auckland households face unrelenting attack

ACT Leader Rodney Hide today said the steep rate hikes proposed by the Auckland City Council for the coming financial year would add insurmountable pressure to households already under severe attack from central government.

"How can a young couple, mortgaged to hilt, paying off their student loans, and paying too much tax, now cope with steep rate hikes?

"Auckland households are struggling to keep their heads above water and Dr Cullen has had to admit that the average household is no better off in real terms than when Labour came to power. Sadly, any wage increases over the past five years have been wiped out by rising costs and taxes."

Mr Hide said after three years of overall rate increases matching inflation, Aucklanders now face a winter of discontent.

"Labour is set to introduce its extra five-cent fuel tax from 1 April which will cost Auckland drivers dearly. Then hard on the heals will follow excessive rate demands which will frighten people as much as the Auckland Regional Council did last year."

"The cost structure in Auckland for families is getting out of control given their incomes remain severely suppressed. Both local and central government are asking far too much from Auckland households with any real improvements to services negligible.

"Once again, the workers of Auckland - those who work and produce - have been hit hard. The call for tax-cuts for every working New Zealander just keeps getting louder," said Mr Hide.
