Time To Show Mallard We've Had Enough

Time To Show Mallard We've Had Enough

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today urged New Zealanders to voice their anger over Labour's school closures by marching on Parliament on February 24.

"It is time to show Education Minister Trevor Mallard that we have had enough. His supreme arrogance has seen him ride roughshod over entire communities, and closed our schools," Miss Coddington said.

"I am calling on parents, teachers and students - indeed, anyone who is concerned about the quality of education in this country - to turn out en masse and shame the Labour Government into reversing the worst excesses of its network reviews.

"Labour has axed 71 schools, and plans to close over 300 in the next seven years. Mr Mallard has decided that penny-pinching is more important than parental choice and our right to give our children a quality education.

"Clearly, this Minister has lost the plot. ACT is urging communities to join us in the fight against school closures, and send a strong signal to Mr Mallard - and his Labour cronies - by turning up on February 24. Our schools and communities are worth it - it's time to take action, before it's too late," Miss Coddington said.
