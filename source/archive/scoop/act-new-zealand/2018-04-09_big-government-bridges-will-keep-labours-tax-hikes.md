Big government Bridges will keep Labour’s tax hikes
===================================================

Big government Bridges will keep Labour’s tax hikes

“Simon Bridges has confirmed his commitment to higher taxes by this morning refusing to roll back proposed fuel tax increases of between 9 and 12 cents a litre”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“This complements his record as a big spending Economic Development Minister.

“When Amy Adams slammed Labour’s ‘tax and spend’ policies the other day, she could have easily been talking about her own leader.

“The National Party under Simon Bridges believes it can return to Government by presenting itself as a more competent version of Labour.

“It has completely lost track of what it stands for.

"It makes you wonder what other socialist policies National will accept when it returns to Government. Will National repeal Labour's fees-free policy? Will it reinstate the tax cuts that were promised in 2017? Or will it put them in the too hard basket as it did with interest-free student loans and Working for Families, which John Key called 'communism by stealth'?

“Only a strong ACT Party will persuade National to cut taxes, wasteful spending, and red tape, and reform the Resource Management Act and Superannuation”, says Mr Seymour.
