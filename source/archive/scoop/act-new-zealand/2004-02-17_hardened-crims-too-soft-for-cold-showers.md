Hardened Crims Too Soft For Cold Showers?

Hardened Crims Too Soft For Cold Showers?

Tuesday 17 Feb 2004 Stephen Franks Press Releases -- Crime & Justice

If prison inmates have found three days without hot water so uncomfortable as to issue riot threats, then perhaps the hot water should be left off a lot longer, ACT New Zealand Corrections Spokesman Stephen Franks said today.

"The bleeding hearts tell us these criminals only offend because they're from deprived, disadvantaged backgrounds. It certainly hasn't hardened them up if they can't take what thousands of Kiwi families enjoy while camping every summer," Mr Franks said.

"The these criminals can even credibly threaten to riot - and for such a trivial reason - shows how soft and apologetic our prison policy is. Now they've shown how much they fear cold showers, Corrections Minister Paul Swain should introduce a permanent cold water policy.

"Would-be criminals might think twice before committing a crime if they found prison uncomfortable - and if they don't offend, they can stay in their hot showers at home as long as they like.

"Surely even the Labour Government couldn't argue that cold water is unhealthy. Do prisoners have a right to uninterrupted hot water? Thousands of people have been raised in the belief that cold showers are healthier than hot ones.

"What about a permanent cold water policy, Minister?" Mr Franks said.
