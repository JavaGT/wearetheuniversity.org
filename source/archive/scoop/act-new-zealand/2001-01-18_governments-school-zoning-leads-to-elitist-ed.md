Government's School Zoning Leads To Elitist Ed

Government's School Zoning Leads To Elitist Education

The rush of parents to buy and rent houses in certain areas to get around the school zoning regulations proves that this Government is developing an elitist and racially divisive education system, ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.

“ACT predicted that middle-class parents with the money to move house would do so to avoid sending their children to schools they see as inferior and poorly performing. And this is exactly what is happening.

“What we have seen this year is just the start. The wealthy will move in increasing numbers to wealthy areas for the good schools – driving up property prices in those areas – while the poor who can’t afford to move will be left to languish in poor areas with poor schools. Their children will suffer from a retarded education.

“This Government talks about closing the gaps – but this policy can only widen the gaps between the advantaged and the disadvantaged.

“Twice as many Maori and Pacific Island children used to travel out of zone to attend schools. Some 3000 students used to leave South Auckland every day to bus to better schools. New Zealand’s top Maori student was one of those pupils.

“Now under this Government’s rules these people are confined to a zone. They are kept in their place.

“ACT will continue to vigorously oppose this ridiculous zoning policy and strive to see it replaced with a sensible scheme which allows individuals a real choice about the type of education they receive,” Mrs Huata said.
