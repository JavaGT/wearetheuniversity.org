Labour anti-landlords

Speech to the Waikato Property Investors Association, Kingsgate Hotel, Te Rapa, 7.30pm

ACT Deputy Leader and Housing spokesman Dr Muriel Newman today urged the Waikato Property Investors Association to vote against Labour at the next election if they wanted to retain residential property as a great way to save for their retirement.

The Labour Government has demonstrated a very negative attitude to residential property investors.

Instead of treating them with respect for the partnership role they play in housing our nation, Labour appears intent on penalising them.

A bill already in front of Parliament introduces a range of punitive penalties on landlords.

A new tax grab on property acquisitions was introduced in the budget and a capital gains tax cannot be ruled out. Further the proposals signalled in the rewrite of the Residential Tenancy Act make for grim reading.

A register of all rental property, rent controls, the registration of all landlords, warrant of fitness checks for all tenancies, government advocates for tenants are just a few of the proposals.

Labour is driven by an ideological belief that landlords are out to exploit tenants, instead of realising that it is the market that sets rental levels and that landlords prefer longer tenancies with good tenants.

Labour intends to introduce harsh regulations that will make rental property less appealing as an investment option.

I say to property investors that you should not take this lying down. Stand up and fight.

Vote against Labour at the next election by giving ACT your party vote, so investment in residential property can still be regarded as a favoured option for people seeking financial independence from the state.

ENDS
