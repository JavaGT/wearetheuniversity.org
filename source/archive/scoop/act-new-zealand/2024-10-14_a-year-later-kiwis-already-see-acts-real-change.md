A Year Later, Kiwis Already See ACT's Real Change
=================================================

**Monday, 14 October 2024, 2:41 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

A year after the 2023 election, ACT is celebrating the long list of actions already taken to empower New Zealanders.

"In Opposition, we spent six years listening to New Zealanders," says ACT Leader David Seymour. "This resulted in a comprehensive election platform with a commitment not just to change the Government, but to deliver real change.

"Thanks to New Zealanders' support, on October 14 we were put in a position to deliver, and less than 11 months after signing the coalition agreement, we've made serious progress.

"The breadth and intensity of our action in Government speaks for itself. Even our critics complain at how we're punching above our weight for a small team. We call it value for your vote.

"Below is a list of actions ACT has taken that reflect ideas we campaigned on, and on which Kiwis elected us to deliver. Together, these actions break down barriers for Kiwis working to succeed on their own terms. We're addressing challenges in the economy, law and order, democracy, education, health and more."
