Tackling Waste Crucial To Christchurch Recovery

### Tackling Waste Crucial To Christchurch Recovery

Now that National has finally woken up to the sad state of affairs that our country’s economy is in, I recommend they read my discussion document ‘Budget 2010: Combating Government Waste’ which outlines practical solutions to get Government spending under control, ACT New Zealand Finance Spokesman Sir Roger Douglas said today.

“The discussion document identifies $3.1 billion of Government waste, including all of the costly and ineffective schemes – Families Commission, Ministry of Women’s Affairs and interest free student loans – that National is now willing to look at,” Sir Roger said.

“National had the opportunity to tackle this type of wasteful spending last year but chose not to – instead continuing to borrow and hope. With a multi-billion dollar earthquake repair bill doing nothing is a luxury National no longer has.

“Cutting waste benefits New Zealanders twice over. First, abolishing these schemes rules out the need for any type of ‘earthquake levy’ to be imposed on New Zealanders already struggling with the rising cost of fuel, food and other basic necessities. Second, the Government’s need to borrow to fund the Christchurch rebuild will be reduced resulting in lower taxes long-term.

“ACT urges the Government to cut wasteful spending across the board and will give its five votes to any initiative that does this,” Sir Roger said.
