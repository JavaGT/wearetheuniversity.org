Mallard's Claim Lacks Credibility

Monday 17 Jun 2002 Donna Awatere Huata Press Releases -- Education

The Education Minister's attempt to take credit for the suspension of teachers' industrial action is transparent nonsense, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"The Education Minister is clearly desperate. Mr Mallard is responsible for months of chaos in our classrooms. Teachers have no respect for him. Now he expects us to believe his ludicrous claim that teachers followed his lead in cancelling planned strike action.

"The secondary teachers' continued ban on extra-curricular activities and NCEA compliance damages the chances of thousands of school children.

"Mr Mallard is trying to score cheap political points any way he can. His actions are further inflaming irate teachers and students. He'd do better to drop the pathetic games and simply admit that if we want a quality education system, we must pay good teachers more," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
