ACT Rural Tour kicks-off today
==============================

**Monday, 17 April 2000, 9:59 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Three ACT MP’s begin a rural tour in Hamilton today, that will see them meet and greet the backbone of New Zealand industry.

The MP’s, Gerry Eckhoff, Penny Webster and Stephen Franks will spend the next three days touring the rural heartland from Waikato to New Plymouth. They will be talking to employers and employees about the new costs and pitfalls of the Government’s Employment Relations Bill.

The MP’s will also be highlighting, and supporting the struggle of, rural householders who have fallen foul of the Resource Management Act. They will also be voicing ACT’s position on the recently failed mega-merger.

The tour will include two public meetings focused on the Employment Relations Bill. The first is in Hamilton tonight with the second in New Plymouth on Wednesday night. Information on the meetings can be found in local media or on the ACT website.
