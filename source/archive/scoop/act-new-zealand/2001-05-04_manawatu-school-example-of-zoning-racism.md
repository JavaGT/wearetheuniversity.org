Manawatu School Example Of Zoning Racism
========================================

**Friday, 4 May 2001, 9:08 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Thursday 3rd May 2001 Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education

ACT MP Donna Awatere Huata said that Education Minister Trevor Mallard must listen to the principal of a Manawatu Intermediate School who is fighting for his students.

“The principal of Monrad Intermediate School, John Forsyth, has slated the zoning system as it is applied at Palmerston North Girls' High School, calling it racist and elitist.

“Mr Forsyth says his pupils have been cut off from gaining entrance to Girls' High – just down the road – by the lop-sided boundaries drawn up by the Girls' High Board of Trustees.

“Mr Forsyth has stated bluntly that the Girls’ High is trying to create a decile 10 school with mostly white faces in it.

“This is exactly the type of problem that zoning creates. This racist system leaves Maori and Pacific Island kids with no options. That is disgraceful.

“Mr Forsyth has written a letter to Mr Mallard – I call on the Minister to answer his appeal urgently, and repeal zoning.
