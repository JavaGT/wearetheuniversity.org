Parliament too soft on rural crime

Parliament too soft on rural crime

“New Zealand needs to take stock theft seriously, If Parliament had extended ACT's successful 3 strikes for violent crime to protect farm animals the cruelty of rustling the Cornwall Park theft of sheep would never have happened” said Dr Jamie Whyte.

"It takes rustling in a city park for the media to report what is a daily occurrence on our country's farms. Once National was the farmer's party and would have responded to the rapidly growing problem of stock theft. Today a National-lite government has adopted Labour's soft on crime approach and is more concerned about the welfare of the thieves.

Parliament needs to get a reality check. Rustling and burglary are increasing because they are crimes that pay. Organised stock thefts can earn rustlers hundreds of thousands of dollars.

It is time we sent professional burglars and rustlers, often they do both crimes, to jail.

3 strikes has dramatically reduced violent crime and will do the same for the often cruel crime of rustling." Said ACT Leader Dr Jamie Whyte.
