National backbench MP for Otago Gavan Herlihy has finally woken up from his slumber, said ACT Leader Richard Prebble today.

"He's managed to sleep through three 100-year floods in his electorate. He's managed to sleep through the calls of his constituents for action

"What's woken him up is ACT new MP Gerry Eckhoff calling for a Parliament enquiry on his first day in Parliament.

"Mr Herlihy, now embarrassed by this exposure of his lack of action, on the day before Christmas, writes to a Labour Prime Minister calling for a commission of enquiry.

"The flood happened when your government was in office, Mr Herlihy. Why didn't you ask Jenny Shipley for an enquiry? Apart from Gerry Eckhoff's actions, what else has happened to cause this out of character activity?"
