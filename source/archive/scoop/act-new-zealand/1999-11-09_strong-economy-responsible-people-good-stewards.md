Strong Economy, Responsible People, Good Stewards
=================================================

**Tuesday, 9 November 1999, 2:40 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

New Zealanders can feel justly proud of our natural environment. Some progress has been made in recent years but significant environmental problems remain. Environmental issues are causing unnecessary strife because of poorly-designed legislation and the government’s command and control approach is bureaucratic, costly, uncertain and anti-development. People’s right to property is not being respected. While many of the problems raise undeniable difficulties, government is all too often the problem rather than the solution.

ACT’s goal

\- To promote the sound and sustainable management of an environment of which all New Zealanders are justifiably proud.

ACT believes

\- Free and prosperous societies with light-handed environmental regulations give the best environmental protection.

\- Sound economic policies, clear private property rights and efficient pricing mechanisms allow the most efficient use of scarce natural resources.

\- It is unfair to make individual landowners bear the costs involved in protecting areas of environmental significance as at present. The costs of pursuing public good outcomes should be borne by all taxpayers.

\- The interpretation of the Resource Management Act often offers little environmental benefit at great cost to investment and job creation.

\- ACT recognises the environmental commitment made by thousands of New Zealanders through many voluntary organisations. Groups such as Fish and Game Councils have the strongest motives to make the right decisions on sustainable resource use, successfully managing the resource at minimum cost to the taxpayer.

ACT will

\- Implement sound economic policies - so we can afford to protect our environment.

\- Reform the Resource Management Act so it is focused on the sustainable management of the natural environment and is not a tool for bureaucratic meddling.

\- Ensure the costs of protecting the environment fall fairly on all New Zealanders, not just a few landowners.

\- Focus government's role in providing public goods such as pest control and the policing and enforcement of the law.
