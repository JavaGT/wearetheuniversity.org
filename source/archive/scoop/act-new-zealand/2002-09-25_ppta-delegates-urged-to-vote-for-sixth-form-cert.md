PPTA Delegates Urged to Vote for Continuation of Sixth Form Certificate Next Year

Wednesday 25 Sep 2002 Donna Awatere Huata Press Releases -- Education

ACT education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata is urging PPTA delegates to vote against the implementation of Level 2 of the NCEA at their annual meeting tomorrow.

"It's important that delegates recognise the widespread concerns of parents, teachers and children when they cast their votes.

"Anything but a vote in favour of the continuation of Sixth From Certificate will consign thousands of young people to the uncertainty of a valueless, meaningless qualification that rewards mediocrity.

"The best option would be to scrap the NCEA completely and reinstate a system of nationwide external examinations that are of a high standard and internationally comparable.

"Delegates at tomorrow's vote will have an opportunity to restore some certainty and confidence in the minds of parents and children - not to mention the teachers they represent - by voting against the continuation of the NCEA experiment next year.

"I hope they won't squander that opportunity", Mrs Awatere Huata said.
