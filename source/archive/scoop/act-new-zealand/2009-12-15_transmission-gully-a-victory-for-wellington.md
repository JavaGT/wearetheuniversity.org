Transmission Gully A Victory For Wellington

Transmission Gully A Victory For Wellington

Hon Heather Roy, ACT Deputy Leader  
Tuesday, December 15 2009

ACT New Zealand Deputy Leader and Wellington-based MP Heather Roy today congratulated Transport Minister Steven Joyce for doing what his predecessors would not: listening to the public and taking action on the long-awaited and controversial Transmission Gully.

"For years, I called for Transmission Gully to be built - those calls fell on the deaf ears of a Labour-led Government that was not focussed on the infrastructure needs of the country's capital," Mrs Roy said.

"It did not matter to the previous Government that, with only one fragile coast road in and out of the city, Wellington would be completely cut off from outside life-saving assistance in the event of a major emergency - a very real possibility given our location on a major faultline.

"All we've had is empty talk about Wellington's infrastructure deficit but this is now being addressed through the strategic upgrade of SH1 from Wellington Airport to Levin - which will see the construction of Transmission Gully, improvements around the Basin Reserve, Mt Victoria Tunnel duplication, and Terrace Tunnel duplication.

"Today's announcement is great news for Wellingtonians. We have fought long and hard for Wellington Airport-Levin route to be upgraded - including Transmission Gully - and the Government has heeded our call," Mrs Roy said.
