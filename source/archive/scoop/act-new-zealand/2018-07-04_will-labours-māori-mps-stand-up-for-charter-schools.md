Will Labour’s Māori MPs stand up for charter schools?
=====================================================

Labour’s Māori MPs have the opportunity to stand up and support Māori students in light of a new Treaty claim over the Government’s charter school policy, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

The Government has handled charter schools with such arrogance it is now facing a Waitangi Tribunal claim from educationalists Sir Toby Curtis and Dame Iritana Tāwhiwhirangi.

“Labour’s Māori MPs went off the party list and won every Māori seat.

“Māori will be asking themselves what the point of voting for them is if they won’t even uphold the Treaty.

“Labour considers itself to have a special relationship with Māori. But as a result of its arrogance, the Government now faces the prospect of an adverse Waitangi Tribunal claim.

“The Labour Party MPs who support charter schools – Kelvin Davis, Willie Jackson, and Peeni Henare – have thus far been missing in action.

“Their window of opportunity to do the right thing for Māori students is closing fast”, says Mr Seymour.
