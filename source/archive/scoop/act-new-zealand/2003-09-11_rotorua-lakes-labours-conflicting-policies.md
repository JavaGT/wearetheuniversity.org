Rotorua Lakes - Labour's Conflicting Policies

Rotorua Lakes - Labour's Conflicting Policies

While Environment Minister Marion Hobbs is correct that there is no cheap, quick and easy solution to the water quality problems of the Rotorua lakes, her moves to check this water quality deterioration are mere window dressing and political posturing, ACT New Zealand Environment Spokesman Ken Shirley said today.

"The real tragedy here is that the Lakes Water Quality Programme - managed by Waikato University's Professor David Hamilton and specifically researching the lakes' water quality - has failed to receive support from the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology research funding," Mr Shirley said.

"The Government's foundation has also cut funding for research by Geological and Nuclear Sciences into ground water flow and age assessment, which has a direct application upon the flow of nutrients into these lakes.

"Instead of concentrating on the real scientific problems confronting the country, Government research funding is being diverted into spurious social and cultural engineering projects that do not generate wealth or improve the environment," Mr Shirley said.
