Attacks on Teachers Rising - Awatere Huata

Calls from PPTA members at their annual conference for more targeted resources and staffing to counter violence against teachers come as no surprise, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"Serious attacks by students on teachers increased by 16 percent between 2000 and 2001". The school roll grew by 0.6 percent.

In 2001, 493 children faced disciplinary action for attacking teachers. There were 149 attacks serious enough for the students to be suspended.

"The classroom is becoming unsafe for teachers. The prevalence of attacks has increased along with suspensions for vandalism, sexual harassment and misconduct and alcohol offences. Overall suspensions for drug use did not decline.

"Sadly, these figures will highlight yet another reason why we're finding it impossible to keep good teachers in the classroom. ACT believes the bureaucrats and politicians have a responsibility to protect teachers in the classroom. We believe the abolishment of zoning and devolved funding to schools will allow each individual community to find the combination of policies that solves this problem," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
