ACT Leadership: Newman To Stand On Welfare Platform

Monday 3 May 2004 Dr Muriel Newman Press Releases – Other

  
ACT New Zealand MP Dr Muriel Newman today announced that she will be standing for the leadership of ACT.

"I have decided to throw my hat into the ring and campaign under the banner of welfare reform," Dr Newman said.

"New Zealand can be a country where everyone can achieve and succeed. To do that we must stop trapping hundreds of thousands of able-bodied Kiwis in the poverty of State dependency

"Under my leadership, ACT would campaign at the next election for a fundamental reform of New Zealand's welfare system.

"I want to ensure that ACT takes the lead in promoting a tax and welfare system that rewards family values, rather than the current State system that breaks families apart.

"As leader, I will bring to the table a great knowledge of our welfare system and practical solutions to solve the growing crisis in this area.

"Further, I can offer a real passion for welfare reform and the ability to communicate that passion to the New Zealand public.

"It's a compliment to ACT that it can boast four talented and high-profile candidates. I look forward to a fair and rigorous campaign," Dr Newman said.
