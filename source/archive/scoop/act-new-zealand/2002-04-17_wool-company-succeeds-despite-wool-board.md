Canterbury Wool Company Succeeds Despite Wool Board Opposition

The Canterbury based wool company Escorial has scored an internationally recognised victory of notable proportions with its winning bale of fine wool.

ACT Rural Affairs Spokesman MP Owen Jennings today congratulated Peter Radford, the Managing Director of Escorial, for the huge commitment has made to establish his company and its products as a world leader, "especially when in doing so he had to contend with a Wool Board that actively opposed him.

"The very Board that he has pays levies to has appeared to use his money to fight his progress.

"The Wool Board cannot disappear quickly enough. It has opposed progress in the marketing of fine wool with both Merion New Zealand and Escorial.

"ACT supports enterprise and congratulates Peter Radford and Escorial. ACT equally opposes statutory producer boards - especially those who so shamelessly lack accountability," Mr Hide said.
