Red Tape and Bureaucracy Hobbles Industry
=========================================

**Friday, 8 March 2002, 3:08 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

"The Primary Production select committee recommendations on the Aquaculture moratorium do not go far enough," said ACT Environment Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff

"The back down that allows existing applications to proceed illustrates how far behind the Government has become. They must recognise that they are leg roping the industry for eight to 10 years and forcing NZ technology off shore.

"The select committee must go further and demand the lifting of the moratorium altogether. The Auckland and Canterbury Regional Councils see the need in their local areas and they should be allowed to impose a moratorium but the vast majority must be allowed to opt out.

"Imposing blanket plans on aquaculture and other issues over the whole country is unworkable. Government must allow the regions to do what they need to do in their own areas. This is what the RMA was originally all about.

"Meanwhile NZ innovation and opportunity is lost while Government tries to catch up with industry. So much for the innovation strategy and the knowledge economy," Gerry Eckhoff said.
