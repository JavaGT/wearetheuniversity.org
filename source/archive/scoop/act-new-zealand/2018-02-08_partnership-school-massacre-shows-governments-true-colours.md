Partnership School Massacre Shows Government's True Colours

"It's ideology over evidence and payoffs to union backers as the Government seeks to massacre Partnership Schools despite their popularity and success. Today's announcement shows the juvenile and callous nature of a Government led by ex student politians.

"Partnership Schools are working, over 1500 students attend the fledgling schools, most of which have had to turn students away due to rapid growth. Struggling kids were having their lives turned around, but this Government will massacre the schools for a combination of ideology and union utu.

"The Government has not released the Phase Three of the Martin Jenkins report into the performance of the policy, but it hardly matters to Chris Hipkins, who probably doesn't know the study exists. Perhaps the study shows enormously positive results?

"The Government has no clear alternative to Partnership Schools, they know that Maori and Pacific achievement is abysmal, a stain on the promise of opportunity for all, but they are so focused on helping the 'sector,' read unions, that they have forgotten about the kids.

"The Maori Caucus are missing in action. They are intimately and personally involved in Kura Hourua. The stood indepently of the Labour list and yet are not accorded the mana they deserve in Labour if this decision is anything to go by.

"Today is a bleak day for the Government, who are more concerned with payback to their union backers than pursuing policies that work for the future of our children.
