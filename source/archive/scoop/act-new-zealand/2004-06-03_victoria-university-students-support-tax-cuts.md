Victoria University Students Support Tax Cuts

Thursday 3 Jun 2004

Rodney Hide - Press Releases - Taxation

ACT New Zealand Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide today applauded Victoria University students for passing the following motions into the Victoria University Student Association's (VUWSA) policy at the Student Representative Council on Monday June 2, 2004:

· That VUWSA support tax cuts as the most effective means to help students deal with their debt problems;

· That VUWSA denounce communism;

· That VUWSA support one standard of citizenship, as advocated by Don Brash and ACT;

· That VUWSA support capitalism as the most effective societal structure to help students;

· That VUWSA thank Richard Prebble for his contribution to ACT, Parliament and New Zealand.

President of ACT on Campus at Victoria University Michael Collins said: "The fact that students support tax cuts and free-market capitalism shows that young people today are acutely aware that New Zealand's future is dependent on a strong long-term economy that will only be delivered through these structures.

"This follows hot on the heels of a similar motion passed at Auckland University, calling for tax cuts, earlier this year.

"Support for \`one law for all' demonstrates that students are frustrated by the continual political correctness favoured by the current Labour regime. Students are affected by \`positive' discrimination more than most sectors of society," Mr Collins said.

"The motions passed reflect a growing view that enough is enough, and that students are not prepared to put up with discrimination of any sort any longer," Mr Hide said.
