Overstayer Policy Rapidly Unwinding - Webster
=============================================

**Wednesday, 27 September 2000, 4:25 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Today’s confirmation by the Minister of Immigration that she will consider refugee applications on a case by case basis is merely the first U-turn that signals the unravelling of transitional policy, said ACT Immigration spokesman Penny Webster.

“By not including refugees and students who may have been here just as long, and in similar circumstances, the Government has targeted overstayers for special treatment.

“This U-turn by the Minister highlights the growing number of anomalies that are in the policy. This policy is not a resolution, its inconsistencies are becoming apparent everyday since it’s launch. And the policy is unwinding.

“I call on the Minister to reveal the true number of people who may qualify. When partners, spouses and children of overstayers are included, along with students and refugees who are successfully pressing for inclusion, plus the large number of people who are legally here on long-term permits, and will qualify, the figures will increase.

“None of these people need to meet the normal points criteria that all of the legal immigrants have been required to meet.

“The policy is unravelling as the inconsistencies begin to emerge,” said Penny Webster.
