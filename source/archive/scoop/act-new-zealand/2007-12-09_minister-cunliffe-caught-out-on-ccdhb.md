Minister Cunliffe Caught Out On CCDHB

Minister Cunliffe Caught Out On CCDHB

The article in the latest edition of the 'Hawkes Bay Today' newspaper  
flies in the face of Health Minister David Cunliffe's claim that I was  
effectively lying when I stated in the House that people from other  
hospitals were dying as a result of Capital & Coast DHB's failures, ACT  
New Zealand Health Spokesman and Wellington-based MP Heather Roy said  
today.

"This article - titled 'HB Heart Patients Dying For Surgery' - has  
confirmed my statement while, at the same time, disproved the Minister's  
claim that I am a liar," Mrs Roy said.

"Mr Cunliffe should be embarrassed that he has been caught and - out of  
shame, if nothing else - now come clean on how other DHBs are affected  
when they too rely on CCDHB for tertiary healthcare services for their  
patients.

"Further, the Minister continues to refuse to answer the question I  
originally asked of him in Parliament last week: has he personally been  
advised of any of the deaths of patients on waiting lists for tertiary  
surgery at Wellington Hospital in the past year?

"This is a simple question that requires an equally simple 'yes' or 'no'  
answer. Instead of wasting his time making personal attacks on me, Mr  
Cunliffe should be trying to improve the serious situation at CCDHB by  
appointing an independent Commissioner - someone free of the political  
interference that he and his Ministry are notorious for," Mrs Roy said.
