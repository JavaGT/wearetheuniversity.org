Free Press 26/1/16: We're back
==============================

**Tuesday, 26 January 2016, 10:47 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

**Free Press**

_ACT’s regular bulletin_  

  

**We’re Back**  
After a bumper 2015, _Free Press_ is back for an even bigger 2016. This week we invite you to ACT’s 2016 Party Conference. Attendees will see an ACT Party that is rejuvenating and on a roll into the next election.

**Register Here**  
If you’re already sold, you need read no further. You can register online here: [http://www.act.org.nz/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=196](http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13928&qid=3128033)

**A Top Line Up**  
If you require more convincing, we have an outstanding program. Each speaker is expert in their field and passionate about ACT’s central idea: that a better New Zealand comes from better policies.

**Strong Communities and Free People**  
All of the speakers have one thing in common. They don’t just talk about making New Zealand a better place, they’ve all been active and successful at doing it. We’re proud to host them because they show it’s not always politicians and their grand government schemes that make New Zealand a better place, but that true compassion means directly helping.

**Ruth Money**  
The country’s leading victims’ advocate. As a volunteer she has assisted victims of some of the highest profile cases in recent times with navigating the justice system. ACT has always advocated putting victims’ rights first and Ruth is at the forefront of not only talking about how victims can be better supported (which she’ll do at the conference) but actively supporting them on her own time.

**Dame Lesley Max**  
Co-founder and CEO of the Great Potentials Foundation and creator of the HIPPY and MATES programs. Since its foundation, ACT has advocated strong community organisations solving social problems where the Government doesn’t always get it right. We are honoured to host one of New Zealand’s leading social entrepreneurs at our conference.

**Lindsay Mitchell**  
Lindsay’s blog is a recognised authority on welfare reform. As an assiduous researcher she is the best person in the country recount what National’s reforms have and haven’t achieved over the past eight years, and what the nest steps for reducing child poverty should be.

**Michael Littlewood**  
Recently retired from the University of Auckland’s Retirement Policy and Research Centre, Michael Littlewood has been at the forefront of the superannuation debate in New Zealand since the early 1990s. ACT believes that John Key and all other leaders have been too eager to kick the retirement can down the road, and we’re proud to host a definitive expert on the subject at our conference.

**Matthew Hooton**  
New Zealand’s best free market commentator, Matthew’s weekly _National Business Review_ column is compulsory reading for many on the right. Matthew reminds us that New Zealand once led the world at free market reform, and that National have done little to roll back Helen Clark’s legacy of government expansionism.

**David Seymour**  
Our leader’s keynote address will focus on the four P’s of free market environmentalism, Pricing, Property Rights, Prosperity, and Private Initiative. For too long environmentalism has been confused with government intervention when all the evidence worldwide shows it is free societies that make the best environmental custodians.

**Sonare on the Orakei Basin (and a Tesla Roadster)**  
If all of that is too much, you will be entertained by Auckland jazz band Sonare on the edge of the beautiful Orakei Basin. _Free Press_ also understands that, on the Smart Green theme, Tesla will be offering rides in their electric super car, the Tesla Roadster.

**Early Bird Registration and Accommodation Discounts**  
If we haven’t sold you yet, we should tell you that there are early bird registration fees and discounts for ACT members. We expect this conference to sell out early so please get in quick. You can register online here: [http://www.act.org.nz/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&id=196](http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13928&qid=3128033) or call the ACT office on 09 523 0470

**That’s All Folks**  
It’s going to be a stunning conference, we hope to see you there. _Free Press_ will return in its normal format next week.
