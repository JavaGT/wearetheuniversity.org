ACT Unveils Party List

ACT is pleased to unveil its Party List for the 2017 election today in Auckland.  
“ACT’s Party List displays the renewal of the party that has occurred over the last three years,” says Party President Ruwan Premathilaka.

“Our candidates showcase talent, youth, and diversity. They are committed to ACT’s values of freedom and personal responsibility.

“ACT’s candidates will campaign across the country for the Party Vote.

“As ACT MPs, they will fight to cut tax and red tape. They will expand choice in education and restore affordability to housing by reforming the Resource Management Act. They will welcome immigrants who embrace our values and positively contribute to New Zealand. They will provide both stability and spine to a centre-right government.
