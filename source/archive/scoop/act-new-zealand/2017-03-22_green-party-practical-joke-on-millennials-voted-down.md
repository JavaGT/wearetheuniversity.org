Green Party practical joke on millennials voted down

“ACT is glad to see a stunt bill by the Green Party rejected by parliament,” says ACT Leader David Seymour, “Perhaps now we can focus on the real issues that have put housing out of reach for young New Zealanders.”

“The Bill was economically illiterate. It targeted taxpayer funds at the most privileged people in New Zealand, but wouldn’t have helped them nearly as much as promised.

“Having your student loan repayments deferred would help people with larger loans more - it would help those who have already benefited from more expensive courses, people with greater earning potential. It is sad to see the Green Party standing for privilege.

“Worse, the benefit would be not nearly as great as promised by the Green Party. People fronting up to get a mortgage would be asked about their liabilities. Banks would demand larger deposits and or higher interest rates from those who still had a student loan.

“Finally, it is galling that the Green Party, who support the kinds of restrictive policies on urban growth that make housing so unaffordable, are using the housing crisis to perform political stunts."
