ACT selects Stephen Berry for Northcote
=======================================

ACT selects Stephen Berry for Northcote  

“ACT is proud to announce that Stephen Berry will contest the Northcote by-election,” says Party Leader David Seymour.

Mr Berry is a self-made man. He left school at 16 to work at a supermarket chain where he is now one of its top managers and trouble-shooters.

He stood for ACT in 2014, and as the fifth-ranked and East Coast Bays candidate during the 2017 General Election. Prior to that, he contested the Auckland mayoral election in 2013, finishing third.

Berry resides in Forrest Hill with his husband.

“I have known both Dan and Shanan since university”, says Mr Seymour.

“They are two nice guys, but they are offering more of the same, tired ideas.

"Northcote has suffered enough neglect from Labour and National. They now need a maverick to put their issues on the table.

“Stephen will bring positive, practical solutions to bear in fixing the traffic chaos on Onewa Road because he can do and say things the other candidates can’t.”

“I’m a life-long Aucklander who has lived on the North Shore for four years”, says Mr Berry.

“Having worked in nine different supermarkets in that time, on both sides of the Bridge, I’ve experienced the daily traffic jams.

“Labour is advocating for more public transport and National wants to take credit for whatever Labour decides. I’ll loudly advocate for what we know is successful.

Berry says that Northcote’s best chance for strong representation in Parliament is to elect the ACT candidate on 9 June.

“The Labour and National candidates, if elected, would become the lowest-ranked members in their respective caucuses, and therefore easily swallowed up by the party machinery.”

“Electing a second ACT MP in Northcote won’t just ensure Northcote’s issues are front and centre for the next 2 years, it will also provide a strong foundation for a centre-right government to return in 2020.”
