**Thugs threaten violence at Brash event**

  
Left-wing thugs at Massey University are threatening to banish former Reserve Bank Governor and Opposition Leader Don Brash by threats of violence, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“[In a Facebook post](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=18023&qid=5596979), one person menacingly wrote that the Vice-Chancellor should 'ensure the safety of those attending’ and that free speech 'does not come free of consequences’.

The Massey University Politics Society has invited Dr Brash to speak as part of its Past, Present and Future series. Tomorrow, the University’s Vice-Chancellor will decide whether to let him speak.

"If it is true that the Vice-Chancellor of a publicly-funded university is considering blocking a former Reserve Bank Governor from speaking, it is simply outrageous.

"I have long feared that the kind of anti-intellectual, violent intolerance that we see from students on American campuses would come here. Sadly, it has made landfall at Massey University this week.

"I have personally known Don for seven years. I don't believe there’s a racist bone in his body.

"Dr Brash has given decades of public service to this country.

“Left-wing thugs have decided that, simply because they don’t like Dr Brash’s views, they will deprive Massey students of hearing him speak.

"The idea that a former Reserve Bank Governor and Leader of the Opposition could be prevented from speaking at a publicly-funded university is otherworldly, but it is here today.

"Our Minister of Education should follow the British and defund universities that do not protect freedom of speech from violence”, says Mr Seymour.
