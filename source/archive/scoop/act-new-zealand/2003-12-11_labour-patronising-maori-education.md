Labour Patronising Maori Education

Thursday 11 Dec 2003 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Tertiary Education

ACT New Zealand Tertiary Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today accused Labour of blatant racism, in the wake of a Government announcement to establish a new Maori framework for tertiary education.

"The new framework - announced by Ministers Steve Maharey and Parekura Horomia - shows that, while claiming to be a friend to Maori, Labour actually believes that Maori can't cut it in mainstream tertiary education," Miss Coddington said.

"Many Maori may initially welcome Labour's new initiative but - upon closer inspection - will see it for the insult it truly is and treat it with the contempt it deserves. Despite what Labour may want us all to believe, Maori can - and do - stand on their own two feet.

"Once again, Labour has demonstrated its soft bigotry of low expectations for Maori, and risks taking New Zealand even further down a dangerous path of racial separatism - by throwing Maori a crust every now and then. Labour claims to care about Maori, while actually alienating them from wider New Zealand society.

"I do not believe that Maori wish to be treated any differently. Maori just want to get on with the job of improving education outcomes for Maoridom, without any special treatment. This framework will not achieve this, and Labour knows it," Miss Coddington said.
