Government Inconsistent on Bulk Funding Policies
================================================

Serious inconsistencies over bulk funding within Government ranks have appeared with the Health Minister announcing a move to bulk fund primary heath care providers.

ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata says the welcome move in health was announced the same week the Education Minister’s Bill to abolish bulk funding of schools is being introduced into Parliament.

“Trevor Mallard must explain why he’s intent on going backwards in education while the Minister of Health has realised bulk funding is the way of the future.

“The introduction of the Education Amendment Bill this week will be a dark day for education in this country. The Minister is blindly rushing ahead with the abolition of the very successful bulk funding programme that has allowed schools autonomy to make the best decisions for the education of their children.

“The Minister has produced no evidence to show that turning back the clock to centrally fund schools will improve the education outcomes of children. Rather, the Minister is up against proven research on bulk funding that all concludes it has been a fantastic success.

“Trevor Mallard is refusing to consult with the 836 bulk funded schools about his decision to break his contract with them. Instead, he has decided just to bully them from the comfort of his Wellington Office.

“If the Minister can’t justify to schools that breaking his contract with them is ‘in the school’s best interest’ then he shouldn’t be going ahead with abolishing bulk funding. It’s as simple as that.

“With a total disregard for students, principals, teachers and Boards of Trustees who have all benefited from bulk funding, the Minister is simply operating in the best interests of the teacher unions.

“Trevor Mallard’s inability to objectively study the results of bulk funding will ultimately cost our children their chance at excellence in our state run schools,” said Donna Awatere Huata.
