600 Submissions - Huge Response To ACT’s Website
================================================

600 Submissions - Huge Response To ACT’s Employment Bill Website

The Government must listen to the concerns of New Zealanders over the Employment Relations Bill, ACT leader Richard Prebble said today.

“I have received nearly 600 submissions against the Bill from people in all industries, representing all levels – from owners and managers and staff. They have come from a cross –section of New Zealand - Maori groups, retired people, educational bodies, multinational corporations, to name a few. They all invariably say the Bill is bad news for them and bad news for New Zealand.

“The Government should cut its losses, listen to the people, and drop this loony left-wing legislation,” Mr Prebble said.

Over 400 submissions against the Employment Relations Bill were received electronically by ACT’s parliamentary office after the people making them had seen the information about the Bill on ACT’s campaign website.

ACT’s campaign website has had hundreds of thousands of hits in the last month as people hurried to get information to make submissions before today’s closing date.

The website is believed to be the first in New Zealand history to give people the opportunity to make and send submissions on government legislation.

“We were forced to do this to counter the tight timetable the government put on this legislation, and give busy people the chance to make a submission quickly and easily.”

Mr Prebble and other ACT MPs have spoken to nearly 1,000 people at free seminars pointing out the deficiencies and unnecessary aspects of the ERB.

“What is interesting about the submissions is that they show how out of touch this legislation is from the reality of business. If the government doesn’t make amendments, this law will destroy jobs and businesses in New Zealand,” Mr Prebble said.
