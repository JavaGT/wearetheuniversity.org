ARC 'Study' Should Be Treated with Caution

ARC 'Study' Should Be Treated with Caution

The latest shock horror tactics by the Auckland Regional Council should not be taken too seriously, ACT New Zealand Transport Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

"The ARC brought to New Zealand at ratepayers' expense, one Mitch Williams from the University of Denver, to stand on the side of the road and test car exhaust emissions.

"Gasp! Our vehicles are worse than those driven around Los Angeles.

"So what?" Miss Coddington said. "If you stick the sensor up the exhaust of most cars the result will startle you. However, the sensor doesn't measure the air in and around Auckland, away from the exhaust outlet, the air we breathe each day.

"In Auckland, the wind clears the air. In Los Angeles - a city known for its air pollution - the valleys and lack of wind mean the polluted air hangs around much longer.

"This is the same sort of nonsense we're seeing from central Government - create a scare then regulate or ban. Wellington bureaucrats are going nuts over hamburgers. Auckland bureaucrats and councillors want to herd people on to public transport and make them live in railway corridors. The ARC has long conducted a campaign against the motor vehicle - one of the greatest symbols of individual freedom. It's assisted by the Labour Government which wants to get rid of Japanese imports - a boon for low income families - and this \`study' is just another example.

"The cruel irony is they spend our money to do it, then effortlessly increase our rates. If the ARC wants to \`clean up Auckland' it could start with some fiscal responsibility," Miss Coddington said.
