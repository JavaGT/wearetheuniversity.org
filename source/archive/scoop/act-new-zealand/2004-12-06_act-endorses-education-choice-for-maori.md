ACT endorses education choice for Maori

ACT endorses education choice for Maori

ACT Leader Rodney Hide today supported the Maori Party's call for more choice in education for Maori.

"Maori should be able to set up their own schools and universities. The Government's only concern should be with the quality of education - not who owns and runs the facilities.

"I agree with the Maori Party that the 'one-size-fits-all' education system disadvantages Maori in desperate need to lift educational achievement. The way we do that is with greater diversity and more choice."

Mr Hide said his party is looking forward to the Maori Party's education policy to be launched tomorrow. ACT is hoping that the Maori Party won't be blinkered by ideology or the view that government knows best.

"We should move past the colonial view that government knows what is best for Maori and other New Zealanders," said Mr Hide.
