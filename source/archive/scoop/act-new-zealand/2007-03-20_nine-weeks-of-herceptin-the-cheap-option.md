Nine Weeks Of Herceptin - The Cheap Option For Kiwi Women

Provisional approval from District Health Boards for a nine-week course of Herceptin is a cost-cutting measure that will fail thousands of Kiwi women with HER2-positive breast cancer, says ACT Health Spokesman Heather Roy.

"There will be a great deal of disappointment that approval for a full 12-month course of Herceptin has not been announced - as it has been in 23 other OECD countries including Australia", Mrs Roy said.

"Offering a nine-week course will be seen as cost cutting by those suffering from a very serious condition. Kiwi women with HER2-positive breast cancer deserve the highest standard of treatment - and that means a full 12-month course of Herceptin.

"The Government should explain why, when one tax dollar in five is being spent on health, we still can't offer women the same standard of treatment they'd receive across the Tasman.

"Svend Petersen, Managing Director of Roche Products (New Zealand) Ltd, pointed out last month that 'only a full year-long course is proven to save lives' and that 'New Zealand is the only country considering funding for nine weeks, and this is based purely on financial reasons'.

"PHARMAC and the Government must be honest with the public about whether or not the nine week short course of Herceptin for HER2-positive breast cancer sufferers is a trial. Trials are conducted under very different circumstances than treatments.

"We should be doing more for Kiwi women affected with breast cancer than crossing our fingers and offering them a cheap option", Mrs Roy said.
