Maori Education Idea Is Bureaucracy Gone Mad
============================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT Education spokesperson Donna Awatere Huata said today that the idea of a full-blown Government department to oversee Maori education is bureaucracy gone mad.

“I agree with Parekura Horomia that the real issue is the displacement of Maori children from the mainstream education system.

“There have been 22 reviews of Maori education in the past 20 years and still we have not got it right.

“What needs to be done is to make improvements across-the-board to our education system – this will benefit all our children – including Maori. Maori are asking for more choice and greater accountability. Every New Zealand child will benefit from choice and accountability – not just Maori. We also need a greater emphasis on literacy for all NZ children.

“This will only be achieved through better teaching, by setting clear and positive benchmarks for achievement and through clear assessment both of the performance of the students and of the system.

“Targeting one group within the education system is no answer,” Mrs Huata said.
