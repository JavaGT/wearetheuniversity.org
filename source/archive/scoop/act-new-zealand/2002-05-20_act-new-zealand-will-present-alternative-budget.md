ACT New Zealand Will Present Alternative Budget

Friday 17 May 2002 Rodney Hide Press Releases -- Governance & Constitution

ACT New Zealand will present an Alternative Budget, ACT Finance Spokesman MP Rodney Hide said today.

Mr Hide will present the ACT New Zealand Alternative Budget with ACT Leader Hon. Richard Prebble MP CBE and ACT Social Services Spokesman MP Muriel Newman at 9.45am in the Victoria Room, Level 6, Crowne Plaza Hotel (formerly the Centra), Auckland.

"The ACT New Zealand Party believes that a good Opposition should propose solutions," Mr Hide said.

"New Zealand can achieve 4 per cent growth per capita, over twice our present level. New Zealand can be back in the first world in just six years. But it needs a government with vision, positive practical policies and the leadership to achieve this.

"The ACT New Zealand Alternative Budget will deliver the solutions that New Zealand needs," Mr Hide said.
