Lifting Our Sights: ACT Party on the ETS

**Lifting Our Sights: ACT Party on the ETS**

The Emissions Trading Scheme imposes significant costs on all New Zealanders. We need our exporters to lead the way out of our economic crisis – instead we are shooting them in the foot.

Families are paying more for power, fuel and food due to the ETS. Last week’s ETS Advisory Committee’s report recommended the Government slow down the Scheme's implementation. This won’t help those already suffering.

Whatever you believe about climate change, it makes zero sense for New Zealand to try to lead the world with this ‘all sectors, all gasses’ shambles of a Scheme. Consider these facts:  
• We produce just **0.2% of the whole world’s** greenhouse gas emissions  
• **None of our major trading partners** have anything similar to our ETS  
• The ETS has caused electricity prices to **spike by 5%**  
• It has forced petrol prices up by **4 cents per litre**, which will double by 2013

On top of this, the average dairy farmer is paying an extra **$4,000 each year in diesel** **and electricity costs.** This will rise to over **$10,000 annually** if they start being taxed for animals’ natural bodily functions.

It is preposterous to think that our ETS will make **any** tangible difference to global warming - but it is making a major difference to our **bank accounts**.

ACT will fight to dump the Emissions Trading Scheme, or **have it suspended** until our major trading partners catch up.

**ACT NOW** to fight this madness. **Party vote ACT**.
