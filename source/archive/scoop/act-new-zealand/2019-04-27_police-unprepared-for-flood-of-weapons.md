Police unprepared for flood of weapons

Police unprepared for flood of weapons

The robbery of eleven guns from a Palmerston North police station raises questions about whether authorities are prepared for the flood of prohibited weapons they will soon receive, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“This deeply concerning incident comes at a critical time.

“If Police can’t keep eleven guns safe and secure, how are they going to manage the hundreds of thousands of weapons that will soon begin flooding in?

“It was clear that, as the the Government’s gun reforms were moving through the Parliament, the Police Minister didn’t have a clear idea of how these weapons were to be handled and stored by Police.

“You have to feel for policemen and women who have been working around the clock to keep New Zealanders safe. The Government has placed them in an incredibly difficult position.

“Stuart Nash must demand answers from the Police Commissioner on how this robbery happened and how a similar act will be prevented from happening again.

“The Minister must assure New Zealanders that every possible step is being taken to ensure that weapons handed in to Police will be safe and secure and unable to re-enter circulation.”
