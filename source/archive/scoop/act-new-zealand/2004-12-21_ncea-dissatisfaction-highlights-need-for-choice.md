NCEA dissatisfaction highlights need for choice

A drop in public confidence in the NCEA highlights the need for choice in New Zealand schools, ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

A new NZQA-commissioned ACNeilsen poll, released today, reveals an increasing number of employers and parents believe the NCEA is leading to lower standards.

"This survey confirms that the NCEA is not the \`triumph' Education Minister Trevor Mallard would have the public believe," Miss Coddington said.

"It's becoming more clear by the day that parents, children, students and employers want schools to offer a mix of New Zealand and international qualifications.

"ACT believes schools should be allowed to dump the NCEA. It's unfair for Mr Mallard to force his 'one-size-fits-all' standards-based assessment system on our children.

"Parents wanting the option of returning to external and national exams, which would raise education standards and better equip young Kiwis for the world stage, should give their party vote to ACT in 2005," Miss Coddington said.
