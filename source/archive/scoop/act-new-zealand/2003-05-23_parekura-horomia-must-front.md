Parekura Horomia Must Front

Parekura Horomia Must Front

ACT New Zealand Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide said today it was simply not credible for Minister of Maori Affairs Parekura Horomia to continue ducking accountability for the latest fiascos over Maori Broadcasting spending.

"Alecia Royal worked at MTS for an entire year despite having been convicted for her part in a million dollar student loan fraud against taxpayers. She was jailed for 15 months.

"She got the taxpayer-supplied job at Maori Television without the job being advertised. It was yet another example of jobs for mates.

"These revelations come just one year after the disgrace of fraudster John Davy, and hard on the heels of the resignation of Te Mangai Paho manager Mr Tame Te Rangi following the revelation of his conviction for theft and concerns over his trips at the expense of Maori SportsCasting, funded by Te Mangai Paho with taxpayer cash.

"Parekura Horomia is failing to front. These problems are all "operational issues," he says, or else he is waiting for his officials to finish a report "next week".

"Prime Minister Helen Clark promised New Zealanders in 1999, "a new era of moderation, frugality and integrity in the public sector".

"It's well past time that she delivered. She should sack the Minister of Maori Affairs. And she should put a halt to the "cash for cronies" schemes that her handouts to Maori have fast become," Mr Hide said.
