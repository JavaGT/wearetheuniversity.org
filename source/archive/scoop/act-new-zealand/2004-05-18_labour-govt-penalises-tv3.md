Labour Govt Penalises TV3

Tuesday 18 May 2004

Deborah Coddington - Broadcasting

The Labour Government, using millions of taxpayers' dollars, is helping TVNZ to eliminate competition from its TV3 rival, ACT New Zealand Broadcasting Spokesman Deborah Coddington revealed today.

"The Government is giving $12 million to TVNZ to implement the Charter.

"This edict - forced on the State broadcaster by a nanny knows best Government - commands TVNZ to promote \`New Zealand culture and identity'.

"At the same time, TVNZ is splurging hundreds of thousands of dollars on American TV networks to buy programmes TV3 already runs.

"Last night, TVNZ did a deal with ABC for international news. Now it's offering $1.3 million for 20/20 - twice as much as TV3 currently pays. TVNZ is also trying to buy Dateline from NBC," Miss Coddington said.

"How does this fit with the objectives of the Charter, Minister?

"Labour has destroyed shareholder value in TVNZ to the extent that less than a year ago, TVNZ tried to save $4 million by sacking current affairs staff and dumping the Assignment programme.

"These latest revelations are yet another example of the Government being unable to prevent a culture of extravagance - from TVNZ\`s disgraced chairman Ross Armstrong's gross overspending on expenses, to now paying double the market rate for overseas programmes just to eliminate competition from the private sector," Miss Coddington said.
