Choice For Parents; Success For Students
========================================

**Thursday, 28 October 1999, 12:23 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Education is the key to advancement at all levels in society. The state education system, however, is seriously under-performing. Government monopoly has caused too many young New Zealanders to leave school ill-equipped to develop their full potential. The personal and social consequences are immense. ACT will put the focus on students where it belongs. School choice can change incentives, empower parents, enable talented teachers to be rewarded and give students a greater opportunity to succeed.

ACT’s goals

Every child to arrive at school ready to learn  
Every child to have access to competent schooling  
Every child to learn to read, write and do maths  
New Zealand to be in the top five countries in the world in reading, mathematics and science  
Students and parents empowered through real choice

ACT believes

Parents can make better decisions about their children’s future than the Government  
The education system is failing because parents have been disempowered by government ownership, regulation and funding  
The problem is largely with the system, not with the teachers  
Government should ensure access to quality schools. Effective choice, not blanket government ownership, is essential  
Schools must be freer to reward merit and excellence in teaching  
Successful boards or schools must be able to take over poorly-performing boards or schools, subject to proper processes

ACT will

Ensure regular monitoring of each child's performance through standards and Assessment  
Move to bulk fund all schools  
Enable parents to take their child’s share of government funding and use it on a school of their choice, whether it be state or privately-owned  
Give schools greater ability to run their own affairs  
Review the school curriculum to ensure it emphasises excellence in the core Subjects  
Take an integrated approach to education and welfare
