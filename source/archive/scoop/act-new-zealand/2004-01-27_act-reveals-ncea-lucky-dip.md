ACT Reveals NCEA Lucky Dip

Tuesday 27 Jan 2004 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today exposed the flaws in the New Zealand Qualifications Authority's delivery of NCEA results by revealing that one student inadvertently received the exam papers of two other students.

"Commonsense tell us that this would not be an isolated case. Recent reports have highlighted a myriad of problems associated with the release of NCEA results," Miss Coddington said.

"There have been reports of students spending hours trying to access the NZQA website to see their results; teachers and students unable to finalise classes and timetables due to late results; and parents and employers scratching their heads over the new grading system.

"Education Minister Trevor Mallard is responsible for this mess. He rushed through the NCEA with nowhere near enough planning and now it's students, parents, and teachers who are forced to pick up the pieces.

"Mr Mallard cannot guarantee students will receive the marks they have earned - yet that's the most basic, fundamental requirement you'd expect after spending the year trying to achieve the best possible results.

"ACT is the only party that has consistently opposed the NCEA from day one. ACT is the voice of parents and students who didn't want this new qualification, and we opposed its shoddy and substandard implementation.

"It's time to give our schools the choice of dumping the NCEA, and adopting internationally-recognised external exams. It's also time Mr Mallard sorted himself out, and start acting like a competent Education Minister for once," Miss Coddington said.
