Waikato farming restrictions
============================

Environment Minister could intervene over Waikato farming restrictions

ACT Leader David Seymour today questioned the Environment Minister over the effect of the Healthy Rivers plan on Waikato farmers.

**David Seymour**: Will the Minister rule in or out invoking section 142 of the Resource Management Act and appointing a board of inquiry for the Healthy Rivers: Plan for Change/Wai Ora: He Rautaki Whakapaipai, in light of complaints from farmers in the area that it will put them out of business?

**Hon Dr Nick Smith**: The process under the Resource Management Act, where I as Minister can call in a planned change, is only time limited to a period prior to the notification. The notification of the planned changes on the Waikato River that are publicly available for submissions right now has passed that point where I could intervene, but **it would be unusual for the Government to step in and, effectively, take over a regional council's most important function of water quality. We did choose to do so in Canterbury; I am reluctant to do so in the Waikato**.

“Having been contacted by landowners gravely concerned about the effects of the plan on their profitability and even viability, it is good that the Minister hasn’t ruled out intervention.” says Mr Seymour.

“We hope the hearing committee will properly listen to submitters bearing in mind that the Minister is closely watching.”
