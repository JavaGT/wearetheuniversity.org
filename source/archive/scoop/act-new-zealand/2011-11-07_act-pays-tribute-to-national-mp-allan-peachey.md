**ACT Pays Tribute To National MP Allan Peachey**

ACT Leader Don Brash and Deputy Leader John Boscawen today paid tribute to National’s MP for Tamaki Allan Peachey, who died yesterday at home in Auckland.

“As a former Principal, and MP for Tamaki, Alan worked hard for his students and then the people in his electorate. His passing is a great loss,” Dr Brash and Mr Boscawen said.

“Before coming to Parliament, Allan was one of New Zealand’s leading educators. His vision for the education system in New Zealand was very much in line with ACT’s vision and, although he was disappointed that in his time in Parliament he did not achieve more, ACT will continue fighting to see that vision come true.

"My colleagues and I always enjoyed working with Allan. He helped shepherd Heather Roy’s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill through the Education and Science Select Committee,” Mr Boscawen said.

ACT Leader Don Brash said that the thoughts of the entire ACT caucus, both past and present, are with Allan's family and friends during this difficult time.

“Allan was a consummate Member of Parliament both in the House and for the people of Tamaki. His hardworking and tireless presence was an inspiration that will be felt for years to come,” Dr Brash said.
