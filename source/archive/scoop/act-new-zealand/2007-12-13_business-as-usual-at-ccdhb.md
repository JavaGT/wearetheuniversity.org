Business As Usual At CCDHB

**Business As Usual At CCDHB**

It appears to be a case of business at usual for Capital & Coast District Health Board - the newly-appointed Crown Monitor will report directly to Health Minister David Cunliffe, when the focus should be one of independent decision-making for the health and safety of patients and staff alike, ACT New Zealand Health Spokesman and Wellington-based MP Heather Roy said today.

"ACT believes an independent commissioner should have been appointed - someone with a proven record of turning troubled organisations around, the ability to think outside the square and the authority to form their own team. They would remain free of the political meddling from Labour and the Health Ministry that is endemic in the health system," Mrs Roy said.

"The newly-appointed Crown Monitor will report directly to the Minister, raising concerns around the possibilities of political meddling. This is the last thing that is needed at CCDHB.

"The new Board contains many of the members of the previous Board - who have already had three years to deal with the serious financial issues that have plagued the DHB for many years, and the serious disconnect between clinical staff and management.

"This is an entrenched cultural issue that will take much longer to fix than the 'four-month trial' the Minister has given the new Board. Further, every DHB is instructed that its first duty is to implement Government health policy. CCDHB needs bold new initiatives to sort out its problems - not ongoing instructions from Labour.

"Over the past week the Minister has deliberately misinterpreted criticisms of himself and Labour's health policies as an attack on clinical staff - it is the doctors, nurses and other health professionals who have held things together at Wellington Hospital for much too long. They deserve decisive action from this Government - actions, not words - in return for their expertise, professionalism and dedication to the patients of Wellington and the central region when providing tertiary services," Mrs Roy said.
