Talking Or Taking Action On The Health Workforce

Health Minister Pete Hodgson today admitted in Parliament that the distribution of General Practitioners around the country was creating problems, says ACT Health Spokesman, Heather Roy.

"Surveys by the College of GPs show that almost a third of General Practitioners are looking to change jobs within five years", Mrs Roy said.

"Shortages of GPs are a real problem, despite government pouring thousands of millions of dollars into primary healthcare, Primary Health Organisations, and a committee to look into workforce issues.

"The Health Workforce Advisory Committee (HWAC) cost over $3.5 million to specifically look at this issue, but after six years, has failed to produce any practical recommendations for the government.

"HWAC cost $934,207 last year, when - according to its website - just four publications and one media release were produced.

"An 'action committee on health workforce' was announced by the Minister on 26 May. Almost two months later, this group has no members, no name and no budget.

"Finally, the Minister plans to announce progress in 'a few weeks'. I hope the progress is more real than his 'action committee', which remains a figment of his imagination.

"The Minister needs to take action - not just talk about it.

  
Funding for HWAC  
2000/01 $400,000  
2001/02 $400,000  
2002/03 $454, 265  
2003/04 $710,000  
2004/05 $980,188  
2005/06 $934,207
