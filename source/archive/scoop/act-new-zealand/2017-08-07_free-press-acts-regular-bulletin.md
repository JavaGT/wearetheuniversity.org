Free Press: ACT’s regular bulletin
==================================

**Monday, 7 August 2017, 12:42 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

**Free Press**

_ACT’s regular bulletin_  

**Own Your Future**  
David Seymour’s second book, ‘Own Your Future’ is out. [You can order it here](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=16204&qid=4368719). From the back cover:

_We politicians are the second least trusted profession, just barely ahead of the journalists who report on us. Even the used car salesmen and lawyers are being rehabilitated compared with us. No wonder John Key achieved political superstardom by effectively saying ‘I’ll keep those other muppets out and then I won’t change anything.’_

_But what if politicians could solve real problems, and were prepared to set out their solutions in a book? This is an ACT Party tradition, ever since Sir Roger Douglas wrote_ Unfinished Business _and Richard Prebble published_ I’ve been thinking.

_This book is filled with fresh new ideas. Inside you’ll find out how we could, with the political will, teach prisoners to read while saving taxpayer money, make councils want to process resource consents quickly, stop the disaster that is one-in-five children born onto a benefit, genuinely rebuild the self-esteem of school drop outs, and bring back the birdsong that Captain Cook heard to every suburb of New Zealand._

_None of this requires higher taxes or more rules and regulations, in fact, the opposite. It shows how those of us who believe in Freedom, Choice, and Personal Responsibility have the answers for creating a richer and more inclusive society._

**Foreword by Stephen Jennings**  
Kiwi entrepreneur and billionaire Stephen Jennings has written a strong endorsement of the book in his Foreword: _In this era it is absolutely critical for New Zealand to be on top of our policy game. As David Seymour persuasively shows, this is far from being the case today, but with strong political and policy leadership could readily be so._

**$5,000+ in Presales**  
Over $5,000 in presales were made before the book’s launch, many people are buying two. Perhaps it is because it’s the first ACT book in 11 years, or perhaps it’s because it’s the first book by a Party Leader in 11 years, we don’t know, but demand is strong!

**Actually, Jacinda Ardern is Dangerous**  
For nine years under Helen Clark, New Zealand marked time. Government spending increased to the point that mortgage rates hit 11 per cent and we led the world into recession. Employment Law changes drove business mad and sapped productivity. New election bribe entitlements such as Working for Families and interest free student loans would prove too hard for John Key to reverse.

**Five Days of Ardern**  
Ardern’s promise of relentless positivity lasted five days until Kelvin Davis’s cringe-worthy, over-rehearsed attacks on Government Ministers. He called Jonathan Coleman, who is admittedly a bit of a dork, Dr Death. Meanwhile Ardern has promised to raise taxes on Auckland motorists. As if the problem with congestion is that we don’t pay enough tax!

**What ACT would Do**  
Central government introduced GST in 1986 at 10 per cent. Then it was 12.5 per cent, then National raised it to 15%. When someone builds a house, 15% of the cost is GST, but the Council gets nothing for infrastructure. When central government does hand over money, it is preceded by political wrangling between central and local government. This is why ACT would give half the GST on construction to the council that issued the consent.

**Totally Crooked**  
Metiria Turei has shown she has no regard for the law. We know she claimed the DPB for several years while, according to the electoral roll, living with her mother and partner over several years. When confronted, she claimed she’d committed electoral fraud by claiming the wrong address. Who believes these are the only things she’s done? _Free Press_ predicts that Turei has left loose ends untied all through her life and there will be more to come.

**How We Win**  
ACT’s internal poll is encouraging. The support is the same as all other polls show, but the number who’ll shift their vote to ACT when prompted with ACT policies is large. We are looking forward to seven weeks of delivering those messages. There is no reason why ACT will not elect five MPs and hold the balance of power.
