Cowardly Vice-Chancellor should resign
======================================

**Tuesday, 7 August 2018, 10:02 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

"Massey University Vice-Chancellor Jan Thomas should resign after cowardly barring Don Brash from speaking at the University", says ACT Leader David Seymour.

"After veiled threats from a left-wing thug in a letter to the Vice-Chancellor, she capitulated this morning and prevented Dr Brash from speaking on ‘security’ grounds.

"A student wrote to the Vice-Chancellor: “I look forward to hearing what your thoughts are on this matter and steps you will take to ensure the safety of those attending. Remember in light of their type of "Free Speech" does not come Free of Consequences.’”

Brash, a former Reserve Bank Governor and Opposition Leader, was due to speak to the Politics Society tomorrow.

"I have long feared that American-style anti-intellectual, violent intolerance would come here.

"It has appeared at Massey this week and the university has completely failed to the test.

"Education Minister Chris Hipkins should follow the British and defund universities that do not protect freedom of speech in their campuses.

"Universities exist to promote robust debate, educate, and search for the truth.

"They do not exist to coddle students and protect them from views they might disagree with.

"Hipkins must take action against publicly-funded universities that fail to protect free speech. Professor Thomas should resign immediately.
