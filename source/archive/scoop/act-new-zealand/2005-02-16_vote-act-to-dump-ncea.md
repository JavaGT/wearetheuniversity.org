Vote ACT to dump NCEA

Wednesday 16 Feb 2005

Rodney Hide - Press Releases - Education

ACT Leader Rodney Hide today said it was a bit rich for the National Party to call for an overhaul of the discredited NCEA.

"The previous National-led Government came up with this hare-brained qualifications system, which was then implemented by Labour when it came to office," Mr Hide said.

"Unlike National, ACT has opposed the NCEA from day one. National, in fact, joined Labour in refusing to support an ACT bill in 2003 that sought a moratorium on the NCEA until its flaws could be ironed out.

"ACT believes schools should be given the choice of dumping the NCEA and replacing it with an internationally recognised, exam-based qualifications system.

"Parents and teachers who want to give their children and students the world-class education they deserve, should vote ACT this election," Mr Hide said.
