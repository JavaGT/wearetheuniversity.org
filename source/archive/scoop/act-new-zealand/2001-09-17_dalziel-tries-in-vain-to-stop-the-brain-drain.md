Dalziel Tries In Vain To Stop The Brain Drain

Lianne Dalziel Tries In Vain To Stop The Brain Drain

The Government's announcements on immigration fail to address the key issue of talented New Zealanders leaving the country, ACT Immigration Spokesman MP Penny Webster said today.

"This Government is not producing growth in living standards. Alliance and Labour have done nothing to encourage New Zealanders to be innovative or entrepreneurial at home. So thousands and thousands of our youngest and our brightest now see their future overseas.

"Replacing them with foreigners is a short-term solution that can only fail. After living here for a few years, newcomers will simply leave for the next country that is relaxing its borders. Kiwis who have left don't see any reason to return - all Lianne Dalziel is doing is painting over the cracks. This is just another one of her methods to try to stop the brain drain.

"What we need to do is concentrate on keeping talented New Zealanders in New Zealand," Penny Webster said.
