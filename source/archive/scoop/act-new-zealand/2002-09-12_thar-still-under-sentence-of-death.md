Thar Still Under Sentence of Death

The Thar on Bendigo Station in Central Otago are still under sentence of death, ACT Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff said today.

"My meeting with Conservation Minister Chris Carter failed to produce an assurance that these animals could remain in their secure surrounds until a review of the regulations next year".

"Relocation is the only option available according to Mr Carter, otherwise the animals must be disposed of.

"Thar are regarded as a threatened species by international conservation groups. I fail to see why New Zealand cannot be regarded as a safe haven for these magnificent animals, especially if kept behind secure fences and "farmed".

"New Zealand has an international obligation to view endangered animals with a greater degree of oversight and not focus on the advocacy of those who promote ethnic cleansing of New Zealand biodiversity," Mr Eckhoff said.
