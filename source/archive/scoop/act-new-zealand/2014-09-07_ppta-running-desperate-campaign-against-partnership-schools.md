PPTA Running Desperate Campaign Against Partnership Schools
===========================================================

**PPTA Running a Desperate Campaign Against Partnership Schools**

"The PPTA is misguided. Epsom is blessed with wonderful schools" said ACT Epsom candidate David Seymour.  
"We believe that Epsom voters want good schools for their children, and for all children in New Zealand."

"Partnership Schools allow for passionate and talented educators to engage with kids who would otherwise fail."  
"One such Partnership School is the South Auckland Middle School. It is the brainchild of Alwyn and Karen Poole, who run independent Mt Hobson Middle School in this electorate" said Mr Seymour.  
"Under the Partnership School model, they have taken their model of education from Remuera to Manurewa so that more children can attend a good school. It is sad that the PPTA feels threatened by such initiatives."

"We know that the children going to the five partnership schools are thrilled with the advantages they get from these schools. I believe every child should be able to access a good school, but currently New Zealand is failing its most vulnerable students." said Mr Seymour.

"I am very proud of our achievements through Partnership Schools Kura Hourua said Mr Seymour, ACT Candidate for Epsom.  
“I look forward to going to Wellington to expand the partnership program and give the opportunity to attend better schools to more New Zealanders” said Mr Seymour.
