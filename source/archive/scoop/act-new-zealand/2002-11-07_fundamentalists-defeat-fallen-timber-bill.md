Fundamentalists Defeat Fallen Timber Bill

Fundamentalist elements within Labour and the Greens combined to defeat ACT Forestry Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff's Private Member's Bill to allow for the use of Fallen Native Timbers on the DOC estate.

"A mere four votes now means valuable nature trees will continue to rot rather than allow furniture manufacturers the chance to practice their skills on naturally fallen indigenous timber, with the funds raised going toward predator control.

"It is rather galling that blind ideology and adherence to the belief that nature doesn't need any help from human beings is still being perpetuated despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. I would have thought that even a few thousand dollars would make a difference to the survival of bird life and indigenous trees, by destroying predators that DOC has so much trouble in adequately controlling with limited funding," Mr Eckhoff said.
