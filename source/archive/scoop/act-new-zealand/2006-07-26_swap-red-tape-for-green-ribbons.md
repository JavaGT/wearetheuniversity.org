Wellington-based ACT MP Heather Roy has today added her support to the Green Ribbon campaign launched by fellow MP Mark Blumsky to assist the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary.

"I was pleased to join Mark, Marian Hobbs and Green Co-Leader Russel Norman, tying green ribbons signed by Wellingtonians to trees along Lambton Quay this morning", Mrs Roy said.

"The Karori Wildlife Sanctuary was described by Helen Clark as exactly the sort of enterprise the government wanted to support from the Significant Community Based Projects Fund.

"Yet despite the Prime Minister's spin, and after raising expectations, their visitor and education centre was declined funding.

"As the thousands of Wellingtonians who signed green ribbons have shown, the public want this development to go ahead.

"This is more than a government handout - it's an investment in environmental education, making the Sanctuary financially sustainable.

"The Prime Minister should admit that she made a mistake, and stop hiding behind technical advice.

"As a Sanctuary Member, I know it's an important part of the capital's urban environment, and I urge Helen Clark to reconsider this decision", Mrs Roy said.
