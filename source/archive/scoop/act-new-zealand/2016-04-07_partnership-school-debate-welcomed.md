**Partnership School debate welcomed**

ACT Leader David Seymour welcomes a debate on abolishing partnership schools, but has some questions for bill sponsor Chris Hipkins.

“Has Chris Hipkins ever visited a partnership school?” asks Mr Seymour.

“Does he have the support of Labour MPs with partnership schools in their electorates?

“Will he close down existing partnership schools? If not, why not?

“Did he draft his bill in consultation with the teacher unions? Has he received congratulations from the unions or their offices since his bill was drawn?

“What makes him qualified to overrule the judgment of the hundreds of families who have already made the choice to embrace partnership schools?

“And finally, how does abolishing school choice fit with Labour Prime Minister Peter Fraser’s proclamation _‘that every person, whatever his level of academic ability, whether he be rich or poor, whether he live in town or country, has a right as a citizen, to a free education of the kind for which he is best fitted, and to the fullest extent of his powers’_?”
