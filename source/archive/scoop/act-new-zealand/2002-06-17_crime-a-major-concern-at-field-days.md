Crime a Major Concern at Field Days

Sunday 16 Jun 2002 Owen Jennings Press Releases -- Crime & Justice -- Zero Tolerance for Crime

  
Violent crime was the number one concern of rural people at last week's Field Days at Mystery Creek, said Owen Jennings, ACT's rural issues spokesman.

"Rural New Zealanders are heartily sick of the high crime rate and the way the Labour coalition government has ignored the Norm Withers referendum calling for tougher sentences for violent crime.

"Labour's spin doctors can't disguise the fact that New Zealand is now an unsafe place to live, and rural people know it more than most.

"Rural women are particularly vulnerable, often home alone, away from sight and sound of neighbours and a long distance from a police station.

"They are calling for firmer action on criminals. Farmers are continually frustrated by stock thefts, break-ins and the loss of tools, machinery and farm equipment.

"ACT's policies of Truth-in-Sentencing and Zero Tolerance for Crime were well accepted," said Mr Jennings who spent every day at ACT's tent at the Field Days.

"We gave away thousands of \`You Deserve to Be Safe' pamphlets outlining ACT's positive, fresh ideas for dealing with crime.

"ACT is seen by rural people as the only party listening to their concerns," Mr Jennings said.
