Split PPTA Vote Spells Trouble

Press Releases -- Education -- School Choice Campaign

The even-split vote by secondary teachers on a short-term deal with the Government will create even more trouble for students, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"With no majority consensus, we're likely to experience more wildcat action. Children from schools with militant unionists will bear the brunt of teachers' anger with the Labour Government.

"This entire fourteen-month debacle exposes the Labour Government's true contempt for the people entrusted with educating our children. If we want a quality education system, we must pay good teachers more.

"More than anything, this mess exposes the complete failure of the centralised pay negotiation system. Individual schools and communities should be given the freedom to pay good teachers what they are worth, instead of being dictated to by Government bureaucrats and unionists," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
