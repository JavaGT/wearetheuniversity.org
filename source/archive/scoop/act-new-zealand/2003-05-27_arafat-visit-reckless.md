Arafat Visit Reckless

Arafat Visit Reckless

ACT Leader Richard Prebble strongly criticised Foreign Affairs Minister Phil Goff's visit to Yasser Arafat as another foreign policy mistake.

"Yasser Arafat is being excluded by the US President Bush's road map for peace. This latest peace initiative has been endorsed by the EC and Russia.

"Phil Goff knows that the US Security of State, Colin Powell, refused to visit Yasser Arafat this month. Our Foreign Affairs Minister also knew that the Israeli Prime minister will not see Foreign Ministers that call on Yasser Arafat.

"The question has to be, how is it in New Zealand's interest to get involved in the Israel/Palestine situation. What national interest was Mr Goff pursuing? Here is Prime Minister Clark saying New Zealand is trying to patch up relations with the USA and New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister is out to sabotage the US road map for peace.

"It is yet another example of the Clark government's incompetent, student-like, anti-American foreign policy.

"Silly gesture politics that will cost New Zealand dearly.

"It is worth noting that the Israeli and US opposition to Yasser Arafat is soundly based. Arafat must take most responsibility for the failure of the Oslo Peace Accord. The demand that every Palestinian be able to return to pre-Israeli property is totally unrealistic. Arafat has done nothing to stop the suicide bombing.

"The Palestinians have selected a new Prime Minster who the US and Israeli are willing to negotiate with. So Phil Goff was visiting a discredited yesterday's man. A futile gesture," said Mr Prebble.
