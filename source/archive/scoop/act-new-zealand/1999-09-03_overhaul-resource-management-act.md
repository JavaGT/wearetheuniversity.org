More Reasons to Overhaul Resource Management Act - Ambler

Act New Zealands Otaki Candidate Brett Ambler says Justice has finally been done with a new Environment Court Decision which has awarded costs against well known Alliance activist Lowell Manning.

Mr Ambler says the new Environment Court Decision has awarded costs to the Kapiti Coast District Council and the Pharazyn Trust after a three year argument over a five million dollar rural subdivision at north Waikanae Beach.

"Every one is a loser when people who are not directly affected by development plans tie up the Courts with very expensive personal crusades under the Resource Management Act"said Mr Ambler.

"A Trustee of the Pharazyn Trust has lamented to me over direct costs exceeding two hundred thousand dollars which would have otherwise gone to Wellington and Kapiti Coast charities.Even more scandalous is a $11,000.00 bill to the account of Kapiti ratepayers who have had to defend Council decisions that have been found to be correct in law" he said.

"The local Public Issues Group of the Alliance and its activists are now on notice that there are serious costs which will have to be met when the Resource Managemnent Act is used against the best interests of the people of Kapiti".

"It is an Act New Zealand policy position that the costly and lengthy excesses being created by the Resource Management Act need overhaul" he said.
