Traffic 'Improvements' Are Just Window Dressing
===============================================

**Thursday, 7 February 2002, 11:11 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT Transport Spokesman MP Penny Webster described today's announcement of spending on State Highway One as a two hundred thousand dollar sticking plaster.

"This is just window dressing from Transit New Zealand.

"Every driver is familiar with delays coming into Wellington. Some holiday weekends it takes hours to crawl along - it just reinforces the need for the Transmission Gully project.

"State Highway One is a vital and major part of New Zealand's roading network. These delays cost money.

"If Transit had any sense, they would get on with building Transmission Gully. Unfortunately, that seems to be the last priority," Mrs Webster said.
