Record Numbers Of Early Education Teachers Leave
================================================

**Wednesday, 28 March 2001, 3:00 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

ACT education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata today said today that a record 2210 primary and early childhood school teachers had left New Zealand in the past twelve months to February this year.

“I’m very concerned. While the Minister claims there are low teacher vacancy rates currently it does not mean we can be complacent, especially with figures like this.

“Undoubtedly, should such a rate continue upwards the impact on teacher vacancies and the quality of education delivered to our children will be negatively affected.

“It is no surprise there is an increase in the number of teachers leaving the country - considering teachers no longer have the incentive to achieve with the removal of bulk funding and school zoning plus an academic framework where success is not rewarded.

“The Minister may well be right in the short term that vacancies are low simply as a reaction to not only skilled people leaving the country but also their young children leaving with them,” said Mrs Huata.
