Pay freeze must target senior bureaucrats
=========================================

"While the decision to freeze MPs’ pay is welcome news, the Government should also freeze the salaries of the highly-paid civil servants that politicians’ pay is linked to", says ACT Leader David Seymour.

"It’s convenient for the Prime Minister to target MPs, but what about the pay packets of all those well-paid bureaucrats that MPs' pay is tied to?

This year, bureaucrats will get, on average, a 3 per cent pay increase.

"There are about 16,000 public servants receiving salaries of more than $100,000.

“These bureaucrats will be in line for pay increases of several thousand dollars, costing the taxpayer tens of millions this year.

"The Prime Minister doesn’t want high-earning MPs to get a pay rise at a time when poorly-paid teachers and nurses are bargaining with the Government. That’s fair enough.

"If she is to be consistent, though, she must also target the public sector.

"Senior bureaucrats should be more than willing to show solidarity with nurses and teachers.

"The Government must apply the freeze on MPs' pay to our well-paid public servants”, says Mr Seymour.
