Disabled NZers deserve a fair go

Friday 3 Dec 2004

Dr Muriel Newman - Press Releases - Other

Disability Minister Ruth Dyson's claim that Labour is assisting disabled New Zealanders into paid work couldn't be further from the truth, ACT Deputy Leader Dr Muriel Newman said today.

Today in a press release marking the International Day of Disabled People, Ms Dyson said the Government's Disabled Persons Employment Promotion (Repeal and Related Matters) Bill will help disabled Kiwis into paid work.

"The fact is, in reality the Bill will put many disabled people out of work. Many sheltered workshops will be forced to close their doors should this draconian piece of legislation, supported by the trade unions, become law.

"This Bill proposes that anyone involved in an activity considered \`work related' should receive the minimum wage. The problem is that many people who work in sheltered workshops have productivity challenges. This makes paying the minimum wage unaffordable. As a result, many of these workshops will be forced to close down.

"The Bill is a triumph for ideology over commonsense. Many thousands of New Zealanders will have their lives turned upside down if it is passed. I strongly urge people to visit www.disabledpersons.co.nz and sign my petition calling for more open and honest consultation on this Bill," Dr Newman said.
