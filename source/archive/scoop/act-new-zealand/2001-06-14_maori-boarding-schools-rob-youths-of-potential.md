Maori Boarding Schools Rob Youths of Potential
==============================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Maori boarding schools are robbing our brightest youths of their potential, ACT Maori Affairs and Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"Maoridom's finest and brightest kids enter these schools, but they come out the other end with appalling academic results and bleak futures," Donna Awatere Huata said.

"Maori boarding schools must improve academic performance or be shut down.

"The 'Memorandum' signed yesterday between Trevor Mallard, Parekura Horomia and boarding schools is a pointless waste of energy. It is meaningless, and will achieve nothing.

"Maoridom deserves better," Donna Awatere Huata said.
