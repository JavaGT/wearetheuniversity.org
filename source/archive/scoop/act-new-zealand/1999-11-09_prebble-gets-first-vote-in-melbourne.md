Prebble gets first vote in Melbourne
====================================

**Tuesday, 9 November 1999, 3:45 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

The first vote in the Wellington Central electorate has been cast - for Richard Prebble - in Melbourne.

Former Wellingtonian Samantha Krafft has been the first person to cast a vote at the Victorian Electoral Commission in Melbourne.

Ms Krafft's vote went to sitting member Richard Prebble.

Mr Prebble says he expects a large vote in his electorate from Wellingtonians living overseas.

\"The current high tax policy is driving successful people away from New Zealand," Mr Prebble said. "They are Kiwis who want to stay in New Zealand but who find the tax environment stifling growth in their chosen professions."

Mr Prebble said lowering tax rates would bring many successful Kiwis home again.
