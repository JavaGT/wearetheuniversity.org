Nats Supremely Hypocritical on NZ First Re-Election Fund

  
“National doesn’t have a leg to stand on in its criticism of the Government’s Provincial Growth Fund because the fund is simply a continuation of the Nats’ corporate welfare policies”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“National’s criticism that the Government’s "only criteria for success... is spending money" is supremely hypocritical.

“By some estimates, National spent about $13 billion on corporate welfare during its time in office, costing the average household several thousand dollars.

“Film industry subsidies, KiwiRail bailouts, Callaghan Innovation, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters, irrigation, cycleways, export subsidies, handouts for tourism operators, regional development plans, Team New Zealand, Solid Energy, sporting events, venture capital funds, food innovation and biotechnology. Very few industries didn’t benefit from the previous government’s largesse. Taxpayers were the sole loser.

“The goal of this new Provincial Growth Fund is clear: to ensure NZ First’s survival in 2020.

“The only way its purpose could be more transparent is if it was renamed the NZ First Re-Election Fund”, says Mr Seymour.
