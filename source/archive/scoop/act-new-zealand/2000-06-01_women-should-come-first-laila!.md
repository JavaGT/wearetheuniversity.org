Women Should Come First Laila!

Women’s Affairs Minister Laila Harre must concentrate on improving business confidence and not pushing her own agenda, said ACT Women’s Affairs spokesman Penny Webster.

Laila Harre wants to introduce twelve weeks paid parental leave funded by an employer levy. Labour said today that paid parental leave was not a priority on the legislative agenda.

“As Minister of Women’s Affairs, Laila Harre must know it is women who bear the brunt of economic downturns. New Zealand business confidence is at its lowest in twelve years.

“History shows a drop in business confidence affects part time and low skilled workers most; roles generally filled by women.

“By alienating business with blitzkrieg legislative attacks on ACC and the Employment Contracts Act, the Government has put female employment security at great risk.

“Job security for women is secure in a strong economy with positive business confidence. Ms Harre’s crusade for paid parental leave contributes to neither.

“Laila Harre should abandon her ideological bias and fulfil her Ministerial duties; the protection and advancement of women’s interests.

“I demand Laila Harre subordinate her own political ambitions, to the needs of thousands of New Zealand women, and support the closing of gaps between New Zealand business and Government”, said Penny Webster
