**Labour and National: Brothers from Different Mothers**

“Bill English and Steven Joyce are crying crocodile tears over tax cuts that never existed”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“If National wanted to complain about the new Government raising taxes, it should have cut them instead of just talking a big game when it was in power.

“The new Government’s mini-Budget extends National’s tax and spend approach.

“It is determined to roll out universal welfare programmes like fees-free university and winter energy payments regardless of a person’s need for them.

“This means that all New Zealanders - including those on low incomes - are paying for significant benefits for wealthy families who don’t need them.

“Labour’s former student politicians should drop their socialist ideals. Young socialists might be endearing, but socialist governments are utterly dangerous”, says Mr Seymour.
