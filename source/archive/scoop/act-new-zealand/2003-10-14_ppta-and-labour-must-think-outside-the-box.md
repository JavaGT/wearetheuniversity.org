PPTA And Labour Must Think Outside The Box

Tuesday 14 Oct 2003 Deborah Coddington Press Releases -- Education

ACT New Zealand Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington today congratulated Rangitoto College Principal Allan Peachey for rewarding parents and teachers who went above and beyond the call of duty to coach sports teams and help with school activities.

"Mr Peachey's initiative to provide a corporate box to thank parents and teachers for spending up to eight hours a week taking activities in their spare time should be applauded," Miss Coddington said.

"Education Minister Trevor Mallard's centralised pay system does not allow schools to reward good teachers. Devolved funding would give schools and communities the flexibility to retain and recruit high-quality teachers, instead of being dictated to by Government bureaucrats and unionists.

"Rather than bagging Mr Peachey for his inspirational choice of a corporate box, PPTA President Phil Smith should be citing this case as an example of why schools need performance-based pay. It's extraordinary that Mr Smith seems to hold the view that good teachers shouldn't be rewarded for their efforts. His comments about corporates reveal much about the medieval mindset of the PPTA leadership.

"In the meantime, Mr Peachey should continue looking after his staff - it's clear that he can't rely on Labour or the teacher unions to do so," Miss Coddington said.
