Arrogant PPTA is Out of Touch With Reality

Friday 16th Mar 2001 Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education

ACT Education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata today slammed the PPTA’s bid to freeze interest rates on student loans for teachers working in state schools.

“The PPTA’s arrogant claim demonstrates they are out of touch with reality.

“Why does the PPTA believe that teachers should be singled out for special treatment?

“Should the Government accept such a claim, there would be a groundswell of disgruntled state employees with student loans asking, ‘what about me?’

“Under a National/ACT government, outstanding teachers would be rewarded for their performance.

“It doesn’t take genius to realise that if you work harder and get results, you get paid more. If you get paid more, your student loan will go down quicker.”
