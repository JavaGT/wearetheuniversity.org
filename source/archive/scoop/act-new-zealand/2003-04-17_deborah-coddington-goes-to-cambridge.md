Deborah Coddington Goes to Cambridge

Thursday 17 Apr 2003 Richard Prebble Press Releases -- Education

ACT Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington leaves New Zealand tomorrow to begin ten weeks of study at Cambridge University.

At the 2002 Qantas Media Awards - now in their thirtieth year - Miss Coddington was named Senior Feature Writer of the Year and was awarded the 2003 Qantas Fellowship to Wolfson College, Cambridge University.

Miss Coddington will study models of child-centred education provision being used by Sweden, Britain, Ireland and Belgium.

"These countries have all moved to get rid of the state monopoly in education - as our nation needs to do if we want world-class education standards," Miss Coddington said.

"I am very proud to take my place at Cambridge University. The experience I will gain will be invaluable. I am looking forward to my studies, and to continuing my work as an ACT MP from Britain," Miss Coddington said.

Deborah's scholarship will be excellent for parliament and New Zealand, ACT Leader Richard Prebble said today.

"Parliament and the country will benefit from Deborah Coddington's unique opportunity to not only attend one of the world's leading universities, but her chance to study how European countries are tackling the worldwide problem of providing access to education. The latest education surveys show that New Zealand is falling behind European countries.

"And it is a boon to the taxpayer that the costs of Deborah's study are being borne by her scholarship.

"We wish her well," Mr Prebble said.
