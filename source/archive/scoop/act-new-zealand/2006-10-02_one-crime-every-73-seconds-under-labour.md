One Crime Every 73 Seconds Under Labour

Police statistics reveal that a crime was reported every 73 seconds last year, an indictment on Labour's soft-on-crime policies according to ACT National Security Spokesman, Heather Roy.

"More Kiwis than ever are falling victim to criminals, with more than 426,000 crimes reported in the 2005/06 year. Leaked statistics were released to the Sunday Star-Times on July 30, suggesting that Annette King has been sitting on these figures for at least five weeks", Mrs Roy said.

"On the average day last year:

\* A sexual crime was reported in Wellington;  
\* 100 Aucklanders fell victim to dishonesty offences;  
\* Another 138 Kiwis were victims of a violent crime.

"Since Labour came to office, violent offences alone have risen by ten thousand. In the last year, homicides have risen by almost a third.

"The economic cost of criminal offending is horrific, and there is an even higher human toll.

"Kiwis deserve honest answers to their questions - not evasion, spin or more of the same soft justice policies.

"Our Police do a good job, but they are often overwhelmed and frustrated by a weak, revolving door justice system.

"We should be taking a zero tolerance approach, which means treating every offence seriously and punishing every crime appropriately", Mrs Roy said.
