Minister Quashes Choice In Education
====================================

Monday 7th Feb 2000 Donna Awatere Huata Media Release -- Education

Education Minister Trevor Mallard has denied educational choice by turning down the establishment of a new girls on the Kapiti coast, says ACT education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata.

"The proposal would have increased schooling choices for students and parents but this is obviously anathema to the new Government," Mrs Awatere Huata said.

"Mr Mallard's reasons for turning down the school are contradictory. On the one hand he worries that it would draw too many girls away from co-educational schools in the region, but on the other hand, he says the fees would be too high to gain enough students to be viable.

"Mr Mallard should make up his mind about the real reason for declining this application. To parents and students it appears nothing more than a heavy-handed quashing of educational choice."
