Evidence Shows Schools Will Lose When Bulk Funding Abolished

ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata MP today said she was gobsmacked by the evidence presented to the Education and Science Committee, which overwhelmingly shows the majority of bulk funded schools will each lose thousands of dollars under a return to centralised funding. The report was prepared by the Ministry of Education.

“I was absolutely shocked to see that almost without exception the Ministry predicts schools will lose desperately needed funds just so Labour pursue its union driven agenda. It’s clear this Government would rather put teacher union wishes ahead of children’s needs.

“A quick count of the 836 bulk funded schools in the report shows almost every school will be much worse off despite Mr Mallard’s hollow claims to the contrary. He is burying his head in the sand if he thinks he can ignore the empirical evidence prepared by his own Ministry.

“However, the facts speak for themselves, just like with ACC before it. Bulk funding not only delivers much needed financial resources to schools, that a centrally funded system will not match. It also offers flexibility and choice which this Government is set to rip out of parents and community’s hands.

Mrs Huata further said she was extremely concerned Trevor Mallard had consistently argued the reverse. He has repeatedly gone on record saying he has seen no evidence that schools will be worse off when bulk funding is abolished.

“No doubt the Government will attempt to shift the blame or shoot the messenger, but the evidence from the Ministry of Education speaks for itself. Bulk Funded are set to lose millions of dollars, but at the end of the day what really concerns me is that our children are the ones that stand to lose the most”, Mrs Huata said.
