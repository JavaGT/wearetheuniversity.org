Govt. must hear Wellington's urgent need for new hospital - Prebble

Wellington Central MP Richard Prebble today welcomed the release of the Government's discussion document on the new Wellington public hospital.

"Wellington urgently needs a new public hospital. I regret that this sense of urgency is missing from this report. It merely notes that "On 16 February 1999 the Prime Minister announced the decision in principle to build a new hospital in Wellington".

"The report should have included the reason why a new hospital is urgently needed - the third world conditions in parts of the hospital and the critical need for a main tertiary hospital.

"The report does deal with the site question, pointing out correctly that Newtown has a "distinct advantage as a site for a new Wellington hospital". I hope the Labour MPs in Wellington and Graham Kelly in particular drop their campaign for the Kenepuru site. All Labour has achieved by raising the red herring of an alternative site is significant delay in vitally needed funding. As the principal public advocate of Newtown, I believe the report vindicates the stand I have made.

"But I am disappointed in the lack of detail in the report. It's just not acceptable that planning work on bed numbers and best configuration and even on what services will be provided has not been done.

"The failure to have undertaken necessary research indicates a lack of urgency in the Ministry of Health.

"It is important that we the people of Wellington give a clear answer to this document. We want a new public hospital as a matter of urgent priority."

ENDS
