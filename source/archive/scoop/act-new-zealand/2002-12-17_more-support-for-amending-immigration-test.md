More Support for Amending Immigration Test

More Support for Amending Immigration Test

ACT Leader Richard Prebble has presented yet another petition asking that the House of Representatives reconsider the policy requiring that immigrants from non-English speaking countries pass the University level English tests with an unreasonably high score

. "On behalf of Wan Ji (Mount) Kang, the President of the Korean Society, I have presented a petition of 640 names," said Mr Prebble. "To my knowledge there are now three separate petitions - two Chinese and one Korean - asking the government to look at the discrepancies in treatment of immigrants to this country.

"I am also aware that the petitions have been signed by many of Indian nationality and many others of New Zealand birth.

"The reason for the large numbers of people who have fronted up to sign these petitions over a very short period of time is that the sudden imposition of University level English tests is so savage in its impact. Peoples' lives are going to be totally destroyed by the government's panic reaction to Winston Peters' popularism.

"Few will dispute that the English language is useful for immigrants. But what is particularly incongruous - and unfair - is the move from an immigration English test requiring a pass level of 4 points (under National) to a 6.5 point level pass under Labour. This is particularly indefensible as Helen Clark campaigned in opposition to raising the points level in the last election," Mr Prebble said.
