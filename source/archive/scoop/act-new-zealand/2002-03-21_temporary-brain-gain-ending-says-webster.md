Temporary Brain Gain Ending Says Webster
========================================

Latest migration figures indicate the brain drain reversal has ended, and is poised to start again after a blip caused by September 11, ACT Immigration Spokesman MP Penny Webster said today.

"The brain drain has bled New Zealand of skilled young graduates since Labour came to power. After September 11, the drain stopped for a short time - the skilled people arriving in New Zealand outnumbered the skilled emigrants by around 970 for several months. That was because of the frightening events overseas, not due to any new policies from the Government.

"Today's statistics show that anomaly has ended. We lost 1,512 skilled young graduates in February, and only 1,543 skilled people arrived to our country. The \`gain' in skills has dropped from being 970 to just 31. New Zealand appears to be on the verge of resuming its \`net loss' of skilled people.

"Labour is failing the biggest test of all - convincing bright young graduates that our country is worth living in. The gap left by thousands of New Zealanders who don't buy her policies will be felt by every employer and taxpayer," Mrs Webster said.
