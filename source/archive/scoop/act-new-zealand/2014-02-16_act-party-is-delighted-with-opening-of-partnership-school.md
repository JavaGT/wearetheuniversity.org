ACT Party is delighted with opening of partnership school
=========================================================

The ACT Party is delighted with Saturday's opening of the partnership school Te Kura Hourua o Whangarei Terenga Paraoa.

Whangarei-based ACT Board member Robin Grieve, and Jamie Whyte, ACT Party leader-elect were pleased to attend the dawn ceremony and opening of Whangarei’s first partnership school, Te Kura Hourua o Whangarei Terenga Paraoa. They were very impressed with what they saw and excited for the future of the school, and for the students who will benefit from this new dawn in State funded New Zealand education. Partnership schools, an ACT Party initiative, were introduced as a result of the party's coalition agreement with National.

“This is an historic day, students in Whangarei now have another choice when it comes to choosing the best educational option for them,” said Grieve, who was accompanied by the ACT Party leader-elect Jamie Whyte.  
“The feedback we have received from people involved in the school is that they love the flexibility of the partnership school model.

Jamie Whyte was thrilled to see first hand the result of the ACT Party’s policy. Dr Whyte said “ACT's education policy is focused on lifting life outcomes for all by liberalising the supply of education - allowing for more innovation and variation of what is offered to parents and students , and making it easier for new schools to open and good schools to expand.”

There are two partnership schools operating in Northland and Mr Grieve hopes that with the expansion of the scheme recently announced by the Government, we will receive many more.

“The ACT Party supports the empowerment of the individual through education and believes offering students alternative educational sources is the best way to provide this for more students.

"A good education is the key to better life outcomes and is the answer to addressing issues of poverty, inequality, welfare dependency and crime. ACT wants all children to benefit from an education that provides them the opportunity to live out their aspirations. Te Kura Hourua o Whangarei Terenga Paraoa is now open and is doing just that”. Mr Grieve said
