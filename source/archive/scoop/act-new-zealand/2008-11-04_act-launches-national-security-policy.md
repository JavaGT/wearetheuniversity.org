Press Release

ACT Launches National Security Policy

Heather Roy MP

Tuesday, November 4 2008

ACT Deputy Leader and National Security Spokesman Heather Roy today launched ACT New Zealand's National Security policy at the Australian Defence College Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies.

"Over the past three years, ACT has taken - rather than simply talked about - a 'whole-of-government' approach to ensuring both the internal and external safety of New Zealand and its citizens," Mrs Roy said.

"ACT's policy ( www.roy.org.nz/royters/act-launches-national-security-policy) will form the basis of ACT's White Paper on International Relations and National Security, a statement of ACT's direction and purpose.

"It is a substantial and comprehensive piece of work and the culmination of the efforts of dozens of people over three years: groups I have visited, and discussions I have had with a variety of people in security-based organisations, the Defence Force, academics and my own National Security advisor.

My own experiences as a territorial soldier in the NZ Army have also been invaluable when contemplating the effect of policy at the grass-roots level.

"Keeping Kiwis safe both abroad and at home is the most important role of Government. ACT's policy is a road map toward turning New Zealand back into a safe and prosperous nation in which we can raise our children and grandchildren," Mrs Roy said.
