ACT announces Auckland Central candidate

ACT Leader Jamie Whyte is pleased to announce that Auckland Central based Property and Commercial Solicitor Dasha Kovalenko will be standing as ACT Party Candidate for the area.

“Our Auckland Central candidate will be Dasha Kovalenko. Dasha is a vibrant young professional who will be a good addition to the political scene in Auckland Central. Her biggest concerns are issues affecting younger generations, like housing affordability, and I’m glad she has agreed to do her best to grow ACT’s party vote in the area,” says Mr Whyte.

Although Dasha grew up on the North Shore, she has spent her adult life in Auckland Central. Dasha lives in the CBD with her partner of two years.

Dasha's CV is an interesting read, as she has been a competitive ballroom and Latin dancer, plays the piano, paints and speaks several languages. She graduated from the University of Auckland in Laws and Arts and wrote research papers through the European Union and the United Nations. She has previously worked at the Ministry of Justice and currently practises law at a boutique firm downtown.

“I believe people reach prosperity and fulfillment fastest when they have freedom to make their own decisions, and I believe there are many people out there who feel the same. We just need to remind them this is what ACT stands for,” says Kovalenko.

“I'm looking forward to starting door knocking and introducing Auckland Central to ACT's policies, such as the three strikes policy for burglary, and lower, flatter taxes.

“I think my having a legal background, together with worldwide travel and experience working for international organisations has developed certain skills important in politics. These include determination, precision and being able to look at the bigger picture.

“National needs a reliable coalition partner to have a stable centre right government valuing freedom, choice and personal responsibility. The best way to achieve this is by giving your party vote to ACT!”
