ACT Conferences Focus On Rural New Zealand

ACT is gearing up for a strong campaign in Rural New Zealand over the next two weekends at Rural Conferences in Taupo and Timaru being run by the Party's Rural Spokesman Owen Jennings.

Owen Jennings said the Party would be showcasing its strong line up of rural candidates at the North and South Island conferences that kick off in Taupo on Friday night.

"ACT has really worked hard in rural New Zealand since the last election and our impressive candidates reflect the Party's standing on the farms and in the rural towns and communities.

"The many thousands of miles ACT's 8 MPs have travelled on the ACT Bus through heartland New Zealand on our 'listening tours' have really put us in touch with the issues Rural New Zealanders need addressed.

"The conferences are totally focused on those issues and ACT's practical plans to tackle them.

"We have achieved real gains for farmers like the abolition of stamp duty. But, there is still a long way to go to cut the red tape and bureaucracy that is biting deep into the profitability and viability of farming families. We have listened carefully to the problems farmers are facing and are recognised as the Party committed to getting the Government off their backs.

"The conferences are an important working weekend for ACT's rural candidates and myself to finalise our rural policy and work through our election strategy in the rural electorates.

"Farmers from the Taupo and Timaru regions will join the Conference open forums to hear keynote speakers from the agriculture industry and discuss their concerns as part of the afternoon programme.

"ACT is committed to a strong campaign in Rural New Zealand. We have laid the ground work well over the last two years and will continue that work with our experienced and talented candidates this election," said Owen Jennings.
