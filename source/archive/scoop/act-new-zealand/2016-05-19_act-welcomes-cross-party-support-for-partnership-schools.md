ACT welcomes cross-party support for Partnership Schools

Press release: ACT New Zealand  
May 19, 2016. 1:40pm

ACT, National and the Maori Party have pledged to vote down Chris Hipkins’ Charter Schools Abolition Bill.

“Labour’s mean-spirited bill sought to close down all eight partnership schools and force 900 students to go elsewhere,” says ACT leader David Seymour.

“This is despite the very promising initial results from these schools. It’s crazy that Labour wants to close schools that deliver outstanding NCEA results for kids who have struggled in the state system.

“I would like to thank both National and the Maori Party for standing up for the life-changing work Partnership Schools are doing. Their support provides certainty to the innovative educators at these schools and the hard working students that choose to attend them."
