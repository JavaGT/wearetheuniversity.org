More PC claptrap from Labour

The Education Ministry decision to introduce values to the school curriculum is just more politically correct claptrap from Labour, says ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said.

"I can't believe taxpayers' money is being spent to come up with politically correct weasel words that don't mean anything," Miss Coddington said.

"This is clearly a pathetic attempt by Labour during an election campaign to try and show it's doing something about children behaving badly in the classroom.

"While ACT has enormous sympathy for teachers struggling to cope with unruly students, adding this to an already crowded curriculum will only make the situation worse.

"ACT's policy of giving parents choice, paying good teachers more and bringing discipline back to the classroom, is a far more effective way of freeing schools to do their job.

"That is to teach our children to read, write and add up," Miss Coddington said.
