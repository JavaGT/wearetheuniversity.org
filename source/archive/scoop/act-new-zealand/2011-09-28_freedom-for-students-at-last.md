Freedom For Students At Last

**Freedom For Students At Last**

Students will finally be given the same rights as every other member of society with the passing of the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill making membership of Students’ Associations voluntary for all students, ACT New Zealand Tertiary Education Spokesman Hon Heather Roy said today.

“I am absolutely delighted that tonight Parliament has voted to give students freedom of association, it has been a long time coming. The debate over compulsory student membership has been raging for almost two decades and ACT’s Bill has been in the House for over two years,” Mrs Roy said.

“Students are the only people who can be forced to join an organisation against their will. Well no more. My Bill, which passed its third reading tonight, will ensure that from 1 January 2012 all students are free to choose whether or not they join a Students’ Association.

“Compulsory student membership has been a disaster. Many Students’ Associations have a track record of fraud, financial mismanagement and of student politicians misrepresenting students to push their own political barrow. Sadly this comes as no surprise; students who don’t like what their association is doing have had no choice but to remain a member and continue paying their levy.

“However, I purposely devoted part of my speech in the House this afternoon to focussing on the future and suggesting how Students’ Associations can thrive under voluntary membership. I am confident that the Students’ Associations that provide good quality services and actually listen to their members will enjoy every success over the coming years,” Mrs Roy said.
