Huge opportunities in tertiary Partnership School sponsorship

**Huge opportunities in tertiary Partnership School sponsorship**

ACT Leader David Seymour has welcomed the introduction of the Education Legislation Bill, which will allow tertiary institutions to apply to sponsor Partnership Schools.

“This is paving the way for unprecedented innovation, allowing New Zealand’s highest learning institutions to apply their resources and expertise to secondary and primary age students," said Mr Seymour.

“Many tertiary institutions already have strong links with the school system through their provision of teacher training and development, and are likely to have familiarity with the latest educational research and theory.

“This Bill comes off the back of a successful Partnership School application round which saw 26 applications from across the country. This is clearly a policy that is in high demand and has real momentum.”
