GlobalCo Weaknesses Become Apparent
===================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Weaknesses within GlobalCo are becoming increasingly evident as delays continue, ACT Rural Affairs Spokesman MP Owen Jennings said today.

"GlobalCo's inferior strategy is proving difficult to hide," Owen Jennings said.

"The organisation's failure to settle on a CEO is regrettably symptomatic of the huge problems with the proposal.

"This failure points to leadership of a poor quality. It also highlights the flaws in a proposal that does not include quality research, ignores views and data that points toward weaknesses, and fails to outline sensible alternatives. "It is now evident that delays are being caused by a lack of support for the proposal among Waikato and Bay of Plenty farmers. There is considerable disquiet - and even antagonism - over key issues. Farmers are worried about the lack of leadership and the loss of top commercial directors. They are also concerned that the valuation of their company shows it to be virtually the same as Kiwi’s, when just twelve months ago the Directors produced studies purporting to show Kiwi to be worth considerably less.

"The longer GlobalCo leaders play juvenile games, the more the disquiet will increase.

"The GlobalCo proposal will be doomed if current leaders do not urgently demonstrate an ability to manage something as relatively straight-forward as the appointment of a CEO," Owen Jennings said.
