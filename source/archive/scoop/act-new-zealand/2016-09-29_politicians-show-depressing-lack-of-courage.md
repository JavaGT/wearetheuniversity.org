Politicians show depressing lack of courage

"All politicians should take the Productivity Commission's call to reintroduce interest on student loans seriously instead of running for the hills at the first hint of a policy debate, it's called leadership," says ACT Leader David Seymour.

"The interest-free loan scheme takes students for fools who can't work out it is they who will pay for interest write offs through higher taxes for the rest of their careers. Worse, students who make good decisions and study hard are forced to subsidise those who made bad decisions and mess around."

"The outrage from Labour and the Greens is entirely predictable, as are the protests from vested interests in the tertiary field who benefit from the status quo. What's concerning is this government's timid, complacent approach to politically sensitive issues. It's hard to consider this a centre-right government when they try to bribe voters like Labour did."
