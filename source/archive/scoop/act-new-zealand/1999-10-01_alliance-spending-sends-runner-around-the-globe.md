Alliance Spending Sends Runner Around The Globe
===============================================

**Friday, 1 October 1999, 3:49 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Long distance runner, Seigfried Bauer must be hugely relieved that the Alliance  
cancelled its plan to have him running to highlight their spending promises.

ACT Finance Spokesman Rodney Hide said the Alliance's six billion-dollar  
spending plan would have seen the long distance runner face the greatest  
challenge of his career, circumnavigating the globe.

"If you laid the 300 million $20 notes end to end that Jim Anderton wants to  
spend, they would go right around the globe

"The issue of job creation and business growth is extremely serious for New  
Zealand. Taxing hard working New Zealanders and their businesses into the  
ground costs jobs and thousands of them.

"Jim Anderton's $20 vision for New Zealanders who are out of work and need jobs  
is a disgrace. They deserve real jobs. ACT wants to help people off welfare  
and into real jobs.

"ACT's economic policies are about strong businesses and creating jobs. That  
is why ACT's policies are recognised as being the best policies for the  
economy, for jobs and for growth," said Rodney Hide.
