Vice Chancellor Must Apologise To Parents

University Vice Chancellor Must Apologise To Parents

The Waikato University vice-chancellor must immediately withdraw his promise to bar New Zealand students with foreign high school qualifications, ACT MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"I seek a full apology from Mr Gould to parents throughout New Zealand," Mrs Awatere Huata said.

Mr Gould's politically-motivated comments are being used by Education Minister Trevor Mallard as an argument for the implementation of the NCEA high school qualification. Mr Gould says he does not want to 'undermine' the new qualification by accepting New Zealand students with foreign qualifications.

Some of New Zealand's best schools are choosing to offer British A-Levels and baccalaureate exams because the NCEA is fundamentally flawed.

"If Mr Gould chooses to reject students from these schools in order to impress his Labour friends, then his institution will suffer.

"One in ten students at Waikato University are international students, who pay higher fees than New Zealand students. Mr Gould's objection to foreign qualifications is obviously overcome by a few dollars.

"A ban would be racist and hypocritical.

"His politically-motivated meddling is unwelcome here," Donna Awatere Huata said.
