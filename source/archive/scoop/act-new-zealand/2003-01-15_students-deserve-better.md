Students Deserve Better

Students Deserve Better

Education Minister Trevor Mallard should apologise to students for the serious delay in releasing NCEA results, ACT New Zealand Associate Education spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

"School Certificate results would have been out by now. NCEA results, however, will not be known before January 24 - about three days before students return to school," Miss Coddington said.

"How on earth are students expected to finalise their courses and subjects in this time frame?

"The Qualifications Authority, which Mr Mallard is responsible for, blandly dismisses concerns about delays, and blames them on the high number of standards sat by students. Well they've actually known for about six months, since enrolment, how many standards were being examined. The NCEA is self-funding so they can't blame a lack of resources.

"Also, since no actual marks are given, the results should be easier to determine and release. If anything, NCEA marks should have been out earlier than School Certificate used to be.

"This is totally unfair on students, their parents, and educators.

"I have written today to the Minister of Education to ask why there is a delay, and if he's satisfied with the way these results are being handled. NCEA already lacks any credibility. Mr Mallard should be ashamed," Miss Coddington said.
