No Guarantee Of Funding Levels For Schools
==========================================

ACT Education spokesperson Donna Awatere Huata MP today told Hamilton Principals she’s concerned the Minister of Education won’t give schools an assurance he will continue their present funding levels when he abolishes bulk funding.

Mrs Huata, who is holding meetings around the country opposing the abolition of bulk funding, has asked Trevor Mallard to give an assurance to schools that present levels of funding will continue. “The Minister will not give his commitment that the overall financial resources directed to schools will be the same as at present, or increased, if bulk funding is abolished,” she said.

The agreement between the Minister and bulk funded schools clearly states there must be a benefit from the removal of bulk funding. “The isn’t any benefit if schools are financially worse off,” said Donna Awatere Huata.

“If Mr Mallard gets his way, the Government will force all schools back to a one-size-fits-all approach. It is clear that Hamilton schools, and other schools I have visited around the country this week, do not want any part of a return to central funding,” she said.

“I agree with Principal Martin Elliot of Hamilton Fraser High School that the removal of bulk funding is another step toward ‘dumbing-down education’. The Minister of Education would do well to visit Hamilton’s Fraser High School and see how students have benefited from bulk funding through smaller class sizes, more support staff, and innovative classroom programmes. The school is proof that the choice and flexibility of bulk funding markedly improves the quality of education for children in our schools,” said Donna Awatere Huata.
