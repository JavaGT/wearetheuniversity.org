A Year Into Government, ACT Celebrates Change In Direction
==========================================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Celebrating one year of ACT in Government this week, ACT Leader David Seymour says:

“Last year, ACT campaigned to rein in the cost of living, deliver real consequences for crime, and end divisive policies. Kiwis who voted ACT didn’t just vote for a change of government, they voted for a change of direction.

“After just one year in Government, we can report that Kiwis who trusted ACT with their vote have had an outsized impact in changing the direction of our country. We’ve put values of freedom, personal responsibility, and equal rights into action.

"We've seen price inflation brought under control and mortgage rates cut. We've seen more police on the streets and fewer ram raids. And New Zealanders can now have their say in an overdue debate on whether equal rights are protected by the Treaty of Waitangi.

“Every day we’re working to empower New Zealanders to peacefully make a difference in their own lives and the lives of those they care about, no matter their background.”
