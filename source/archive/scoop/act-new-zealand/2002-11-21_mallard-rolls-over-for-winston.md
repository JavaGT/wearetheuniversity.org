Mallard Rolls Over For Winston

Mallard Rolls Over For Winston

Education Minister Trevor Mallard has committed his most cowardly and unprincipled act yet in endorsing the call by New Zealand First for a cap on foreign student numbers, ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"Mr Mallard has ignored the facts and sold his own values to win back votes from a bunch of populist, unprincipled politicians.

"Our country is not flooded with foreign students.

"This move is not just blatantly anti-Asian, it is anti-New Zealand. Export education brings over one billion dollars to New Zealand every year. This income funds opportunities for every child that we'd otherwise lack. Foreign fee-paying students bring diversity and life to our classrooms. They are welcome.

"After his time in office, I have very low expectations of Mr Mallard, but even those were let down today. I will wait to see what sort of "cap" or "halt" he proposes, but I promise the Minister that ACT New Zealand will fight tooth-and-nail any measure to bring race-based quotas to our classrooms," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
