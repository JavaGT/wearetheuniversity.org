Labour chooses votes over education quality

**Labour chooses votes over education quality**

**Press release: ACT New Zealand

Since Labour introduced interest free student loans, New Zealand’s Universities have tumbled down the world rankings, and ACT Leader David Seymour says that the two are connected.

“Labour’s approach to education is funding for votes, and quality be damned,” says Mr Seymour.

Since 2006 the University of Auckland has fallen from 46th to 82nd, and Otago to 173rd from 79th.

“Historical Labour policies such as the Fees Freeze, Fee Maxima, and interest free student loans were all politically popular but emphasised quantity over quality.

“Moreover, students will have no skin in the game. Right now the deal is: you back yourself, borrow a quarter of your course cost and the taxpayer picks up the remaining three quarters. Labour are now saying the taxpayer pays the lot.

“With Labour everybody will have a certificate, it just might not be a very good one."
