ACT Stands By Crime Figures

Friday 22 Feb 2002 Richard Prebble Press Releases -- Justice, Law & Order

ACT leader Richard Prebble is standing by his claim that violent crime in Hamilton is now worse than in New York.

"I can understand why Superintendent Kelvin Powell is surprised to learn that New York is now safer than Hamilton, because New York used to be much more dangerous," Mr Prebble said.

"But due to Mayor Giuliani's zero tolerance approach to crime, the city has seen a dramatic drop in offending.

"Figures from the Parliamentary Library show New York had 872.3 violent crimes per 100,000 population in the year 2000, while Waikato had 1021 violent crimes per 100,000 population for the year ended June 2001.

"Waikato's district police commander is correct that Hamilton is safer than other parts of New Zealand. Counties-Manukau has the highest rate of violent crime in New Zealand, with 1561 offences per 100,000 population. Auckland City's rate is 1247 per 100,000 people.

"People in Hamilton should not accept the present crime levels. We can lower than but it will require action from politicians.

"The ACT Party says if we had a zero tolerance approach to crime, and truth in sentencing, instead of an 8.5 percent rise in crime during the past two years we would have seen a reduction.

"I feel sympathetic towards the police who arrest criminals, see them convicted by the courts and sent to jail, only to be released early so they can re-offend," Mr Prebble said.
