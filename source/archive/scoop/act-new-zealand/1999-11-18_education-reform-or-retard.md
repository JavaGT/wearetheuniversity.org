Education: Reform or Retard
===========================

**Thursday, 18 November 1999, 12:12 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

New Zealand's current education system is not working and change is the only solution say ACT NZ Education spokesman Donna Awatere-Huata and Rongotai candidate Stephen Franks.

The duo will be discussing ACT's education policy at a public meeting in Newtown tonight.

"We must set a standard of excellence in education for every child," said Mrs Awatere Huata, "Our failure to do so has resulted in one in four children leaving school unable to read and write properly".

Mrs Awatere Huata will explain how many of the problem areas exposed in the latest New Zealand Council for Educational Research report, would disappear under ACT's education policy. She will also outline her own private members' bill on the direct resourcing of secondary schools as well as ACT's key education issues of greater parental choice and the regular assessment of student performance.

Rongotai candidate Stephen Franks, a seven year Board of Trustees veteran, will talk about the implications of school zoning laws, Labour's proposed abolition of the Education Review Office and the restructuring of the British education system under Tony Blair's Labour government.

"As Tony Blair has such a high focus on education it should be no surprise that many of the reforms undertaken by his (Labour) government have been standard ACT policy for years," said Mr Franks.

The public meeting will start at 7.30pm and will be held at South West Intermediate School staffroom, 30 Waripori St tonight.
