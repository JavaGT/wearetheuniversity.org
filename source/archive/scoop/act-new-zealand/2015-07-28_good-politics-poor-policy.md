Good politics, poor policy

  
July 28, 2015. 2:45pm

“Funnelling immigrants into the regions through adjustments of our points system may be good politics, but it’s poor policy,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“The policy is clearly intended to release pressure on Auckland housing, but it only adds to a long list of piecemeal policy tinkering that avoids the comprehensive RMA reforms needed to free up Auckland’s inflexible housing supply.

“The problem is that it changes none of the long-term incentives for locating in Auckland or the regions. Auckland attracts immigrants because its economy is booming compared to the rest of the country. This simple fact won’t change until the regions are allowed to spark their own booms by utilising their natural resources, including mineral wealth.

“Trying to force immigrants to settle in particular parts of the country is more trouble than it’s worth. In the Epsom electorate, schools devote full time employees to ensuring students live in the right suburb – enforcing these living arrangements is time consuming and invasive.”
