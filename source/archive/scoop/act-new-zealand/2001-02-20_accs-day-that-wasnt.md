ACC’s Day That Wasn’t

ACC’s Day That Wasn’t

Tuesday 20th Feb 2001 Ken Shirley Media Release -- Other

ACT New Zealand Deputy Leader Ken Shirley is calling on Michael Cullen to explain why thousands of self-employed New Zealanders are again being overcharged by ACC.

“It is clear from ACC invoices that premiums for the period 1st July 2000 to the 31st March 2001 have been calculated by ACC on the basis of 275 days of cover whereas any examination of the calendar shows there to be 274 days in this period.

“The ACC self-employed workers account has a projected premium revenue exceeding $90 million and on this calculation the over-charging amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

“This is money being gauged from small businesses throughout the country and is another example of ACC’s abuse of monopoly powers.

“I call on the Minister to explain to all self-employed people the basis of the miscalculation and assure them that they will be refunded.

“I am also calling for a Select Committee inquiry into the over-charging by ACC with a view to ensuring that there are statutory mechanisms to ensure that aggrieved parties are properly refunded,” concluded Ken Shirley.
