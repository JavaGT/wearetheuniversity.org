Maori & Pacific Islanders Dominate Poorest Schools
==================================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

One out of five Maori and four out of ten Pacific Islanders attend the poorest schools, according to figures obtained by ACT Education Spokesman Donna Awatere Huata today.

“Our poor schools have become ghettos filled with brown faces,” Donna Awatere Huata said.

“In comparison, only 1.4 per cent of all European students attend the most destitute schools. The other 98.6 per cent of Europeans enjoy life in better-off schools.

“Under racist zoning, this can only become worse.

“Pacific Island and Maori students are stuck in a downward spiral of education failure, thanks to a zoning system which means they cannot escape the clutch of poverty.

“A Government which promised to close the gaps has done no such thing.

“We must get rid of zoning now. Otherwise, Maori and Pacific Island kids will continue to be stuck in ghettos with no escape,” Donna Awatere Huata said.

The percentages of each ethnically identifiable group attending schools with a decile one rating are as follows:

European 1.4%  
Maori 21.1%  
Samoan 38.2%  
Cook Island Maori 44.8%  
Tongan 42.8%  
Niuean 37.6%  
Fijian 15.7%  
Tokelauan 40.0%  
Other Pacific 8.0%  
South East Asian 7.5%  
Indian 5.3%  
Chinese 1.5%  
Other Asian 2.0%  
Other Groups 3.9%
