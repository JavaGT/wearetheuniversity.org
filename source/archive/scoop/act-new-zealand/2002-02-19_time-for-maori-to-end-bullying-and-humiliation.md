Time for Maori to End Bullying and Humiliation of Women

Tuesday 19 Feb 2002 Donna Awatere Huata Press Releases -- Treaty of Waitangi & Maori Affairs

It is time for many Maori to end the promotion of macho thinking and humiliation of women, ACT Maori Affairs Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"The championship of macho bullying by kaumätua is a core problem for our nation.

"Both men and women not only allow humiliating practices, but actively recreate a so called "Maori culture" based on them. An increasing number of marae push women to submit to practices that undermine their self esteem. The old ideas that fists and weapons are the way to win an argument are part of a time warp that needs to be broken.

"The active promotion of such ideals underpins the existence of gangs. Ultimately these ideas killed Wallace Whatuira. We can't just blame gangs. Male Maori leaders must take responsibility.

"Wallace's murder was pathetic, avoidable and tragic. But the events since his death have been sickening. Patched gang members have humiliated Ministers - they have humiliated the Crown. And we have allowed that to happen.

"We must stop using "culture" as an excuse for not moving into the twenty-first century. Gangs, spousal abuse and ritual humiliation of women should not be part of Maori "culture".

"New Zealand must use this tragedy as an opportunity to get our thinking into the twenty-first thinking, and end the humiliation of our women and children," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
