Ministers losing it - Hodgson heavies student

Stephen Franks Tuesday, 6 September 2005 Press Releases - Crime & Justice

Labour Minister Pete Hodgson is facing police inquiries after assaulting a mother who was peacefully protesting at Otago University today, ACT Justice spokesman Stephen Franks said.

"She has confirmed to me that he pinioned her so that she could not raise her arms to show her protest sign to the television cameras.

"The sign said "Speed kills".

"On the basis of her statement to the police he's a goner. The law is simple. Any uninvited unwelcome and intentional touch can be an assault.

"Before the last election Labour wallowed in outrage when Gerry Brownlee shoved a man downstairs. My recollection is that the man had been abusive to Mr Brownlee. Mr Brownlee nevertheless apologised.

"The Hodgson incident is more sinister because it was done in cold blood to censor the protest and Hodgson refused to release her when asked.

"It seems that Mr Hodgson targeted the women after he was upset by the release of tennis balls alluding to his colleague Mr Benson-Pope.

"The Labour cabinet needs legal education. Ms Clark for example plainly does not understand the law of assault.

"She appears to support the Green Party lie that ordinary parents would not be liable for assault after removal of the defence in section 59 of the Crimes Act for smacking or restraining children.

"I am sure an apology would help Mr Hodgson but otherwise I would be glad to help the woman in any court case to teach Labour ministers the lesson that the law applies equally to all," Mr Franks said.
