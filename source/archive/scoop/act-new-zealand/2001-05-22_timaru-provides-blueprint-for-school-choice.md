Timaru Provides Blueprint For School Choice
===========================================

ACT Education spokesman Donna Awatere Huata today said that the South Island township of Timaru was an excellent blueprint for school choice.

"South Canterbury schools are free from the racist and elitist restrictions of zoning. The result is a healthy competition between schools.

"In Timaru especially, we see parents and students empowered to determine their own education requirements.

"There are five high schools in Timaru, and principals report that most parents attend Open Days at all five before making a decision.

"Competition clearly leads to improved service to students - each school must position itself to offer clearly distinct opportunities. In a sense, these are state-funded character schools.

"Timaru demonstrates everything that is good about zone-free schooling," Donna Awatere Huata said.
