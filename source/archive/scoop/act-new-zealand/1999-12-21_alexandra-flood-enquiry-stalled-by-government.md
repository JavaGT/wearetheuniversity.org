Alexandra flood enquiry stalled by Government
=============================================

Central Otago based MP Gerry Eckhoff said today he was surprised that Government members who have been parading through the flood-stricken town of Alexandra making promises could not find time to send the issue to a select committee for action.

"It seems to me they are only interested in helping the town if they can gain political advantage from their tragedy," Mr Eckhoff said.

Mr Eckhoff was denied leave to make a Notice of Motion which would have instructed the Commerce select committee to hold an enquiry into the "causes, severity and frequency of flooding in Alexandra".

"Trevor Mallard told the ACT Leader that the new Government was opposed to an enquiry because it would show a liability of Contact Energy of at least $20 million. Mr Prebble replied that Labour had not opposed the INCIS enquiry even though it had exposed a liability, so why not allow an enquiry to find out whether Contact Energy had a liability to the people of Alexandra?

"Roxburgh dam has brought benefits to the nation over a long period of time," he said. "It will be a tragedy if this has been bought at the expense of Alexandra's future."

Mr Eckhoff said he was determined to have a select committee enquiry and that he would try again.
