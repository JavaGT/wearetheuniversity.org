Hora Hora School  

"Pat Newman of Tai Tokerau Principals' Federation claimed today on Radio New Zealand that he wanted the same funding model and freedoms as apply to Partnership Schools. I totally support him although I am surprised a former Labour Candidate would say this”, said ACT Leader Dr Jamie Whyte

“I back Principal Pat Newman’s call to given the same freedoms and funding model for his Hora Hora School as those for the Partnership School in Whangaruru”, said Jamie Whyte.

“I have taken a look at his ERO report. I think Hora Hora would do even better as a Partnership School than it does as a State school.

“I am prepared to back Pat Newman’s leadership of his school and the potential of every one of his students if he is prepared to back himself.

“I have written to the Chair of his Board of Trustees Kellie Martin inviting the Board to back Principal Newman’s desire to convert to a Partnership School. I have invited the Board to write to the Ministry expressing their interest.

“Partnership Schools are about giving talented educators the funding freedom and flexibility to meet the needs of our most vulnerable students. We will welcome Hora Hora School into the partnership school fold,” said Dr Whyte.
