ACT MP Drives Down Memory Lane
==============================

**Monday, 10 December 2001, 9:28 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Friday 7 Dec 2001

Stephen Franks will be driving down memory lane in a delivery truck tomorrow.

Mr Franks, Justice and Commerce Spokesman for ACT New Zealand, has accepted an opportunity to ride in a truck to promote the message that better roads are safer roads.

"As a student I worked as a driver for Gowan and McGee, general carriers. I am glad we will end up at Centreport - I usually did wharf and bond store collections, and shop and warehouse deliveries.

"In those days before the Shell Gully Motorway, driving through the cramped streets of Wellington and reversing into warehouse loading bays and collecting exotic goods from the wharves, was far more exciting than lectures in land law.

"I don't think I ever caused any significant accident with my country boy inexperience in the city. Of course in Truck Safety Awareness Week I wouldn't want to talk about it if I had!

"I know I probably scraped a bit off the corners of some historic buildings. Generations of truck trays had left their mark on most buildings with daily deliveries.

"As a short-term former driver I have every sympathy with the professionals. They get unfairly blamed for road accident risks, generally caused by the idiocy and impatience of the non-professionals," Mr Franks said.
