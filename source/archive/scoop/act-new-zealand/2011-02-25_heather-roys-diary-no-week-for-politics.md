Heather Roy's Diary - No Week for Politics
==========================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

### Heather Roy's Diary - No Week for Politics

There is no Heather Roy’s Diary this week. In New Zealand’s worst natural disaster in living memory our focus is entirely on the people of Christchurch and Canterbury. Parliament rose early this week to allow MPs to concentrate on assisting those affected as best they can. Like all kiwis we are finding it impossible to work on anything else.

The death toll is rising and the lives of too many have been cut short – may they all rest in peace. My sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.

To the rescue workers, volunteers and all those who are participating in helping those affected, our grateful thanks from all those who feel the frustration of not being able to assist personally.

Kia kaha
