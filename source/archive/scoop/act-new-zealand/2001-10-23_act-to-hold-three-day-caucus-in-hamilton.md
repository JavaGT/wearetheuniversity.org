ACT to Hold Three-Day Caucus in Hamilton

Tuesday 23 Oct 2001 Richard Prebble Press Releases -- Governance & Constitution

ACT New Zealand Members of Parliament are holding a three-day Caucus at the Anglesea Motel (36 Liverpool Street) in Hamilton starting at midday Wednesday, October 24 and running to Friday, ACT leader Richard Prebble said today.

The MPs will be joined by Party President Catherine Judd.

"We will be looking to review our strategy following the election of Bill English as Leader of the Opposition," Mr Prebble said.

"ACT views the National leadership change positively. National needs to target the crucial middle ground and North Island provincial seats.

"ACT's role will be to go for the list vote and to continue to be the party that advocates a more free enterprise approach.

"There will be important differences in our approach. In the economy, ACT is the low tax party - and I believe the Government should respond to the economic shock of September 11 with a cut to the 39 percent tax rate.

"ACT also believes the events of September 11 justify ACT's policy of New Zealand rejoining active membership of ANZUS.

"The caucus will be review both our economic and defence policies with a view to their early release.

"While in Hamilton ACT MPs will be visiting a wide range of businesses and taking the opportunity to be briefed on important local issues.

"The Waikato is an important region for ACT. In the last election ACT increased its list vote in every Waikato electorate," Richard Prebble said.
