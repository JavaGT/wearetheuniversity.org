Increasing housing supply a matter of life or death

**Increasing housing supply a matter of life or death**

Improving housing supply is a matter of life and death, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“By the end of this winter, [over a thousand people will be dead](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15795&qid=4201283) due to low quality housing.

“This comes as [Stats NZ confirms](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15796&qid=4201283) home-building rates are far below the levels needed to keep up with population growth.

“These facts are directly linked. When you have a large number of renters bidding on a small number of rentals, landlords have no incentive to improve their property. They know they’ll get a fat rent cheque regardless of quality.

“That’s why the only long-term solution to shoddy rentals is to turn a landlord’s market into a renter’s market by allowing people to build more homes in line with population growth.

“ACT’s [housing policy](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=15797&qid=4201283) will do exactly this. It won’t just save renters money – it will save renters’ lives.”
