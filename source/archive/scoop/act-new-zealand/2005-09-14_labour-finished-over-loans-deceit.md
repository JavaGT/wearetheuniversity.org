ACT Leader Rodney Hide said today that Treasury costings of Labour's interest-free student loans had sunk any chance of Labour being re-elected to office on Saturday.

"The documents show that Labour cannot be trusted. Labour has consistently and knowingly misled New Zealanders about the true cost of the policy.

"Labour has ruthlessly attacked anyone who has dared to question Labour's claim that free loans would cost only $300 million a year.

"Labour has attempted to cover up the true cost of the policy by refusing to release Treasury advice.

"We now know that Labour attempted to mislead New Zealanders and they can't be trusted.

"Helen Clark has striven to make her integrity the election issue. She is now sunk. We now know that she and the Labour Government that she leads has none," Mr Hide said.
