Maharey Doesn't Understand His Own Jargon

Maharey Doesn't Understand His Own Jargon

The Minister of Tertiary Education clearly doesn't have a clue about links between tertiary education providers and industry, ACT New Zealand's Education Spokesman Deborah Coddington said today.

"In a speech delivered December 2001 Hon Steve Maharey said \`stronger linkages and networks' between tertiary providers and business were needed," Miss Coddington said.

"Indeed, his own Tertiary Education Advisory Committee in its November 2001 report advised that \`improved linkages between tertiary providers, industry and the wider community' are needed.

"Then just nine months later in September 2002 the Minister is admitting ignorance," says Miss Coddington.

"In reply to a written question, Mr Maharey said \`The exact nature and extent of links between tertiary education providers and their partners in industry and the wider community are not currently known'.

"So are the linkages strong, medium, weak or non-existent?" Miss Coddington asked. "I think we should be told.

"The Government is seeking to establish, through the Tertiary Education Reform Bill, a central planning command centre for all tertiary education providers.

"This Tertiary Education Commission will dictate what courses providers will be allowed to offer, depending on their \`profiles' which they must submit for approval.

"Why should we accept the Minister's word that these \`profiles' will \`ensure links are robust and genuine' when he doesn't even know how strong or weak the links are now?

"The ACT Party says the best way for tertiary education providers to strengthen their connections with industry is for the Government to get out of the way."
