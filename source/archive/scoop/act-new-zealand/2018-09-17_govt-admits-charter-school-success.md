Govt Admits Charter School Success
==================================

Govt Admits Charter School Success

The Government today admitted defeat on Charter Schools by giving the stamp of approval to the final two of 12 Charter Schools that applied to become designated character or state integrated schools.

Waatea School in Auckland and Tūranga Tangata Rite in Gisborne will now continue to open in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

“Last year Education Minister Chris Hipkins, with the backing of the Teachers Union, made it his mission to abolish Charter Schools,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.

“His u-turn to now keep all 12 schools open as State Schools shows Charter Schools have succeeded and serve an important role in lifting engagement and educational achievement for students in disadvantaged communities.”

“Chris Hipkins may not like the ACT Party’s solution but the flexibility and freedom of the Partnership School model is what allowed these schools to flourish.”

“Forcing these two schools, and other Charter Schools, to adopt the same governance, dictated funding, and union contracts as state schools will not deliver the same results that we saw under the Partnership School model.”

“If ACT forms part of the next Government, we will give all schools, including Waatea School and Tūranga Tangata Rite, the ability to convert to Charter Schools and the flexibility and freedom to succeed.”
