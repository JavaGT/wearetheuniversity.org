**Ellie Bishop Chosen as the Epsom Youth MP**

ACT Leader and MP for Epsom, John Banks, today announced Ellie Bishop as his Epsom Youth MP for the 2013 Youth Parliament.

Ellie, 17, is a student at Epsom Girls Grammar. Mr Banks says he chose Ellie for her get-up-and-go attitude and her drive to succeed.

“Ellie is active in her school community. She is a member of the school advanced debating team, is heavily involved with the UN Youth organisation and is a member of several school committees, including committees on humanitarian assistance, child cancer and sustainability.

“While juggling her own studies and commitments, Ellie still finds the time to help other students in her role as deputy tutor captain. She tutors English, classics, social studies and business studies. Ellie also holds two part-time jobs.

“I was very impressed with Ellie’s ability to manage so many commitments. I look forward to seeing Ellie represent Epsom in the 2013 Youth Parliament. I know she will make her school and community proud,” Mr Banks said.

Ellie says she applied to become a youth MP because it is a wonderful opportunity to become actively involved and to understand more about the workings of Parliament.

“I have a passion for politics and after I finish studying politics and law at university, my dream career would be to work at the United Nations.

“It is an honour to represent Epsom in the 2013 Youth Parliament and I look forward to improving my skills, learning new things and meeting new people.”
