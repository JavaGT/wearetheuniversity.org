Voluntary National Service A Logical Choice

Invited to take part in a panel discussion for the Australian Defence College Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies visit to the Australian High Commission today, ACT New Zealand National Security Spokesman Heather Roy reiterated her enthusiasm for the creation of a Voluntary National Service scheme in New Zealand.

"Since 2002, ACT has been working on the concept of a VNS scheme - through which Kiwis could choose to serve their country on a full or part-time basis in security services roles," Mrs Roy said.

"A Voluntary National Service scheme would involve a closer integration of all areas of national security - including defence, police, civil defence and emergency services. The scheme could also be extended at a later date to include other areas of skill shortage and could include closer ties between national security and social policy areas.

"As well as bridging the gap between qualification and experience through core and specialised training programmes, participants would gain other benefits - like retiring their student loan, or commencing retirement savings through serving their country; debt-ridden students would have a choice in contributing to the cost of their education, rather than just heading overseas.

"The VNS concept - being developed under the working title of 'Your Country - Your Choice' - offers significant citizenship-building potential and would be the first scheme for decades that enables new arrivals to New Zealand to identify with their country, flag and anthem, and share a bond with those Kiwis who gave so much to build this nation.

"Voluntary National Service has the potential to be a win-win situation: the country benefits by utilising graduates' skills - instead of losing them overseas - while young Kiwis have the opportunity to decrease their burden of debt," Mrs Roy said.
