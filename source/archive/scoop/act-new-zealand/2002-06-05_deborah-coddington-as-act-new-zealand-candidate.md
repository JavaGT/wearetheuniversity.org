Deborah Coddington as ACT New Zealand candidate

Immediate Release:

Deborah Coddington to stand as ACT New Zealand candidate

Journalist and author Deborah Coddington today announced that she is putting her name forward as a list candidate for ACT New Zealand, seeking nomination in the North Shore electorate. She said wants to be in a position to help make a difference because as a mother she is concerned about issues surrounding the future for New Zealand children.

“A Member of Parliament is in a position to try and make this country a place where our future generations are safe, well-educated and prosperous. Right now there are far too many children being abused or neglected, many by their own families.

“There’s also the wider issue of children born to parents who are not emotionally, intellectually or financially equipped to raise them with love, discipline and responsibility. Having a child is the single most important thing two people will ever do in their lives.

“The State has taken the place of the father, or mother, in too many families – not just financially but also spiritually - and that’s just wrong.”

Coddington said she was also concerned about the fact that many women don’t feel safe in this country, “But current government policies are more focussed on the rights of criminals than victims of crime.”

Coddington acknowledged there was no silver bullet for solving the problems contributing to New Zealand’s social malaise, but improving our education system by giving parents more choice would be a good start.

“Giving power to parents, instead of teacher unions and the Ministry of Education, will deliver support and resources to the teachers and schools that educate students to their greatest potential. Today too many children are leaving schools without the basic literacy and numeracy skills to cope with everyday tasks.”

Coddington also criticised New Zealand’s social welfare system which, she says, locks people into poverty – both in spirit and resources - by only rewarding further dependency. “We’re a small country. We can move people into work by following the examples of Canada, the United States and Britain.”

Health is another major issue for Coddington, who said there’s no need to have so many people languishing on waiting lists. “Again it’s a matter of choice and our public hospitals can be just as efficient as our private.”

But central to all these improvements, she said, is for the New Zealand economy to grow again. “At the moment it’s stagnant, in danger or going backwards. Quality of life for all New Zealanders - especially those on low incomes - will only improve when we get back to growth rates of 4%-plus. Currently that’s just not happening.”
