6 months, 6 destructive policies

  
Today marks 6 months in office for the Ardern-Peters Government. It has relentlessly pursued ideas that sounded good on the hustings but which will end up hurting New Zealanders. Here are six of their worst policies.

**Closing charter schools**

"[The evidence](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17641&qid=5311128) now shows charter schools are improving engagement, innovation, and achievement for 1500 mainly Maori and Pasifika students. The Government plans to strip away educational opportunities so they can keep a promise to their union mates.

**Ending oil and gas exploration**

"[As revealed by ACT](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17642&qid=5311128), the Government has ended offshore oil and gas exploration without a cost-benefit analysis, consultation, or estimates of whether emissions will fall as a result. This policy will gut an industry that pays $500 million in royalties and taxes and employs 11,000 workers at peak times.

**Raising the minimum wage**

"[Officials have told the Government](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17644&qid=5311128) that raising the minimum wage would destroy 3,000 jobs. They will be lost to exactly the people whose best hope of upskilling was a foot on the employment ladder. The Government would rather young, unskilled workers sat at home on a benefit. The job losses will be even greater as the minimum wage is raised to $20 by 2021.

**90-day trials**

"ACT’s policy of a 90-day trial has given thousands a start in the labour market when employers mightn’t have otherwise taken a chance on them. As if hiking the minimum wage didn’t destroy enough opportunity, this policy will make hiring staff more risky, leading to fewer jobs overall.

**Fees-free**

“A $275 million subsidy for generally well-off kids who would have gone to university anyway and who will earn much more over their lives than non-graduates. ACT revealed last month that the first-year drop-out rate of 14 per cent will mean New Zealanders can except [$38 million of their taxes to deliver exactly nothing](http://act.org.nz/wp-content/plugins/civicrm/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=17643&qid=5311128).

**Foreign buyer ban**

“An unworkable disaster of a bill. There’s no evidence house prices will fall as a result of this ban. The bill will restrict new construction by making foreign-owned construction companies jump through regulatory hoops. As Eric Crampton has pointed out, the bill doesn't just target overseas speculators - a British doctor moving to Greymouth on a work visa would not be able to buy a house. The bill further harms our reputation as a place to do business."
