Labour's Anti-Business Stance Creates $20,000 Bill
==================================================

Around 12,000 bars, cafes and restaurants will each face minimum compliance costs of $20,000 if they are forced to implement the Government's anti-smoking plans, ACT Internal Affairs spokesman Penny Webster said today.

"The Government has not even consulted HANZ, yet sells itself as pro-business," Penny Webster said.

"If this is truly a health issue, then the Government should create an air-quality standard which would apply not just to bars, cafes and restaurants, but also to nightclubs and clubs. These businesses could then meet this standard in their own way.

"Enforcing a $20,000 cost on every small bar- and café- owner is unfair. For many, it will be physically and financially impossible to create such a space.

"In provincial New Zealand, where the public will bypass their local pub and go down the road to clubs, their will be closures and job losses.

"Thousands of small business-owners will suffer because of an arrogant move by righteous Labour politicians," Penny Webster said.
