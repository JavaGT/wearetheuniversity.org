ACT Appoints Experienced Political Operator As Party Manager

President of ACT New Zealand, Catherine Judd, today announced the appointment of Graham Watson as ACT Party Manager. This is a new position based in Auckland but reporting to me, with key responsibilities being to run the Party's day-to-day membership and campaigning activities, she said.

Graham Watson is best known publicly for his record three terms as President of the Auckland University Students Association and for his broadcasting as a talkback host on Radio Pacific over the past two years.

Educated at Dilworth College and the University of Auckland, Mr Watson holds a Bachelors degree in History and a Masters degree in Philosophy.

He has extensive campaign experience both as an individual and as a member of organisations. Some of these campaigns include the homosexual law reform campaign, the campaign to review cannabis laws, general election campaigns, campaigns for the preservation of historic buildings and a raft of university based campaigns.

Mr Watson was one of New Zealand's foremost and most controversial student activists from the mid eighties through into the nineties. He was instrumental in rationalising the national student body (NZUSA) from a left-wing fringe organisation into an education-focused lobby group. Mr Watson co-ordinated the successful campaign for voluntary student unionism.

Mr Watson also has a background in market research. Over the past decade he has been involved in various roles in quantitative and qualitative research projects in both the political and consumer behaviour spheres. He will apply these skills to help ACT in its analysis of the political landscape leading in to the 2002 general election.

Catherine Judd said the ACT Party is delighted to have been able to secure Graham Watson for the job.

\"Graham has the ideal background as well as the energy and enthusiasm to help ACT gear up for the general election. He has excellent liberal credentials and a strong background in practical political campaigning. His appointment is one of a series of moves the Party is working on to rekindle our liberal vision and extend our influence throughout the electorate."
