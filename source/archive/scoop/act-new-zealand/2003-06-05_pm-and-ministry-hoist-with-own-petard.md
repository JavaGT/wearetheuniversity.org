PM And Ministry Hoist With Own Petard

Thursday 5 Jun 2003 Ken Shirley Press Releases -- Governance & Constitution

Plans to unveil a tomb of the unknown warrior, at the National War Memorial on Armistice Day, have now hit the RMA's wall of frustration, ACT New Zealand Deputy Leader Ken Shirley said today.

"Each year, thousands of New Zealanders have their plans dashed by cultural and heritage impositions, many of dubious worth.

"We now have Prime Minister Helen Clark and the Ministry of Arts, Culture and Heritage championing this project, only to run foul of their own constraints.

"Justice Young's decision that the forecourt and steps are an integral part of the historic site poses an interesting challenge. This challenge and frustration, however, is no greater than that faced by thousands of New Zealanders seeking resource consents each year," Mr Shirley said.
