Return to Militant Union Control Would Cost Jobs

Tuesday 23rd Jan 2001 Ken Shirley Media Release -- Other

“The viability and success of New Zealand's forestry sector is dependent upon an efficient waterfront industry and any return to the militant union controls of the past would cost thousands of forestry jobs and many more servicing jobs” says Ken Shirley, ACT Deputy Leader and Forestry spokesman.

“The wharfage costs for both log and processed wood products reduced by two thirds following the waterfront reforms of 10 years ago. Any return to the former slack practices would prove devastating for those communities dependent upon forestry exports.

“Waterfront reform delivered productivity gains of several 100 percent and these gains mean New Zealand can compete on world markets in what is a highly price-sensitive and competitive industry.

“The Australian waterfront is a disgrace and the last thing we need is their militants over here telling us how to organise.

“I have no doubt New Zealand would very quickly degenerate to the same level of inefficiency if union monopolies are permitted to prevail and once more seize control of our wharves,” concluded Ken Shirley.
