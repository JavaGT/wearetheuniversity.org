So Where Is The Government Accountability Now?

ACT Social Services Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman says today's postponement of a major conference looking at poverty and social disparities bears all the hallmarks of Government intervention and cover-up tactics.

"The reason given for the postponement is that the issues raised at the conference could be overshadowed during an election campaign.

"On the contrary, surely anything that puts this Government's handling of poverty and social disparities under the spotlight at the moment would be sure to get a great deal of attention.

"You can only conclude that the real reason for the postponement is that this Government and its Social Services Minister don't want their dismal record in this area held up for public scrutiny.

"As well as the lost opportunity for discussion of these important issues, I also understand that thousands of dollars of taxpayers money will apparently be lost due to the late cancellation of the conference.

"In Opposition Labour promised accountability and an end to a so-called culture of extravagance with taxpayers money. What a difference two-and-a-half years makes," Dr Newman said.
