ACT Clarifies Position On Student Union Membership
==================================================

**Friday, 13 October 2000, 9:07 am**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

Last night NZUSA claimed that ACT Tertiary Education spokesman Stephen Franks had admitted flaws in ACT’s stance on voluntary membership of student unions. “The NZUSA release is deceptive,” responded Mr Franks.

“I have no reservations about ACT’s longstanding support for voluntary student membership. Indeed, six years ago I helped Nicholas Kerr, one of the early campaigners for student freedom of association, with legal advice on his draft legislation.

“Having an unequivocal position does not mean that I refuse to debate. I acknowledged arguments on the other side, but found them outweighed. I said that unambiguously during the Waikato discussion.

“I have not changed my view that compulsory membership of student unions is unjustifiable.”
