Labour drives Kiwis offshore

Dr Muriel Newman - Press Releases - Immigration

The latest migration figures confirm that Helen Clark is driving thousands of Kiwis offshore, ACT Deputy Leader and Immigration spokesman Dr Muriel Newman said today.

Last year, according to Statistics New Zealand, the net number of New Zealanders emigrating jumped 71 percent from 11,300 to 19,300. All up, 44,100 Kiwis left the country in 2004.

"The Labour Party's over-taxation, over-regulation, soft-on-welfare and soft-on-crime approach to running the country has driven thousands of New Zealanders offshore. Australia with its higher living standards continues to be a favoured destination," Dr Newman said.

Dr Newman said the dramatic drop in new migrants - now 12,800 and falling compared to an average 36,000 for the previous two years - was a real concern.

"If the present trend continues, New Zealand could be facing depopulation as better pay and conditions attract our best and brightest overseas.

"To make matters worse, Labour's failure in the critical area of immigration, typified by their knee-jerk changes to entry criteria, has damaged our international reputation and attractiveness as a destination," Dr Newman said.
