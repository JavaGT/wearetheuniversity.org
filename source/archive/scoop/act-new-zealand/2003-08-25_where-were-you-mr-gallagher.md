Where Were You Mr Gallagher?

Friday 22 Aug 2003 Gerry Eckhoff Press Releases -- Rural

ACT New Zealand Rural Affairs Spokesman Gerry Eckhoff described this afternoon's anti-Flatulence Tax protest in Hamilton as a real wake-up call for Prime Minister Helen Clark and the Labour Government.

"Today I witnessed an enormous outpouring of anger. Over 100 vehicles, and an estimated 450 people - including urban Hamiltonians - turned up in protest of the imposition of this methane emissions tax," Mr Eckhoff said.

"Both rural and urban New Zealand recognise that this ridiculous tax is part of an increasing Labour trend of taxing the wealth creators of this country.

"I was delighted that Hamilton Mayor David Braithwaite and his mayoral colleagues, who make up the Waikato Mayoral Forum, expressed their strong support for the farmers' campaign against this discrimmatory tax.

"My question is: where was Labour's Martin Gallagher? The Hamilton West MP was conspicuous by his absence. In fact, no Labour MP dared show their face at today's protest. Their absence makes a mockery of the Government's promise to consult with farmers.

"I am pleased to report this campaign by the rural community is gaining momentum, despite the Government preferring to look the other way.

"I am flying to the Deep South this afternoon, to support hundreds of farmers attending a protest rally in Invercargill tomorrow, and will be rejoining the ACT bus tour on Sunday.

"Helen Clark has succeeded in shaking the complacency out of rural New Zealand - it is abundantly clear to everyone that she is on borrowed time," Mr Eckhoff said.
