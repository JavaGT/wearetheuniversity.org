Council Abuses People And Their Property Rights

Media Release -- Environment

Environment Waikato’s announcement of new plans to harass farmers spells bad news for rural businesses and their owners, said ACT Rural Affairs spokesman Owen Jennings

Environment Waikato announced the plans after the revelation that Cambridge pig farmer, Roger Johnson, has been forced into an out of court settlement to save his sanity and remaining equity.

“The handling of the Johnson’s piggery case demonstrates the worst face of Local Government bureaucracy. Rules were invoked that ignored the fundamental rights of land owners.

“Neighbours whom moved into the discounted, sub-divided land around the Johnson piggery have only themselves to blame for living with the natural smell of pigs. Environment Waikato have deteriorated to a complaint driven mentality, whose actions trampled over the Johnson’s existing use rights and totally their ignored private property rights.

“There is no more deserving case for compensation then the Johnson’s. They have incurred massive costs in disestablishing a successful business employing local people. Where is the New Zealand love of fairness for the underdog ,when a family, through no fault of their own, are evicted off their property by one organisation’s interpretation of the Resource Management Act?

“I am shocked that yet another New Zealand family can be so callously and unfairly treated by those who are supposed to represent them,” said Owen Jennings.
