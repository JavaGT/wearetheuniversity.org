Tinkering will not fix NCEA mess

The NCEA is fundamentally flawed and should be scrapped, says ACT Education spokesman Deborah Coddington.

The MP was responding to the release of the second part of the State Services Commission's NCEA review today.

"The NCEA has been a disaster from the day it was introduced by National through to its implementation under Labour," Miss Coddington said.

"Parents, teachers, employers and students have lost faith in the NCEA, and no amount of tinkering around the edges will fix it.

"ACT will allow schools to dump the NCEA and replace it with an internationally recognised, exam-based qualifications system.

"We will stop this dangerous experiment on our children and restore standards and excellence to the school curriculum," Miss Coddington said.
