Speech: Seymour - Epsom Campaign Launch
=======================================

**Sunday, 27 August 2017, 3:59 pm**  
**Speech: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

  
**David Seymour Official 2017 Epsom Campaign Launch (speech notes)**  
Thank you Malcolm and thank you everybody who’s turned up today.

I campaigned as a fresh faced 31 year old to represent the greatest electorate in the country. A lot of people thought I couldn’t be serious. The commentators wrote me off, the journalists came out to see this kid from the crazy hi, hi, hi video. I particularly want to thank those of you who are here today, who’ve believed in me all the way through. Thank you.

Then my neighbours sent me to Wellington to represent them on two basic promises. The first was stable centre right Government, the second was to be a high quality local MP.

On the second promise, I hope I have served my neighbours well.

Some of a local MP’s work gets reported but most is done in private. Over 2,000 people have approached my office in the past three years, but there’s still a good chance you won’t have seen this side of my work.

I campaigned on being an approachable and effective local representative. There is an old Maori saying that the Kumara doesn’t tell you how sweet it is, so I thought I’d share some testimonials from those I have worked with since you elected me in 2014.

**Christine Fletcher, Auckland Councillor, Albert-Eden-Roskill Ward**  
_David has been an extremely hardworking local MP for residents of the Epsom electorate. I have been impressed by his genuine concern for community issues and his advocacy on behalf of constituents._  
**_Peter Bircham and Elane DE Moraes Lobo_**  
_David is a very trustworthy and compassionate MP who has been providing guidance and support to our family during some very difficult times in our life...thank you so much for being a fantastic representative for us and for championing our case relentlessly and with a great attitude._  
**Deborah Manning, Barrister**  
_Your active involvement, much needed MP support and principled advocacy has been of great value, and a cut above of what I normally see being provided to those who need assistance._  
**David Yang, Epsom Resident**  
_David Seymour is interested in different cultures, especially Chinese culture and he can speak some Chinese. David emphasises keeping NZ’s safe environment and totally supports Asian communities._  
**Neil Roberts, Joint CEO, Harmoney**  
_David works tirelessly for his electorate and party and has his eye on building a better New Zealand for this generation and the next._  
**Tim Cantlon, Greenlane resident**  
_I believe David Seymour embodies what your local MP should be. David will be getting my vote in the upcoming 2017 election._  
**bob Narev, Chairman, Auckland Holocaust Memorial Trust**  
_David is a very approachable MP who listens and does his best to assist. We found him interested in our project and genuinely supportive of diversity in Auckland._  
**Parnell Community Committee & Friends of Gladstone Park**  
_David is an approachable MP and our community appreciates his willingness to be engaged in local issues._  
**Ivan Nash, Epsom resident**  
_David helped our campaign to secure a bus shelter and seating for local residents in Epsom. His contribution was significant._  
**Cheryl Adamson, General Manager, Parnell Business Association**  
_David is a very approachable MP and is actively engaged in local issues._  
There is one more person who’s endorsed me, who’s not from around here, actually he hails from the other end of our country, and that’s Bill English, the Prime Minister, who said:  
_We are encouraging National supporters to give their electorate vote to ACT candidate David Seymour in Epsom (Wednesday, 26 July, 2017)._  
Bill’s endorsing me because there’s a strategic reality about the Epsom electorate. Through strategic voting, we often choose the Government.  
Every critical vote in this parliament has come down to a majority of one. All the critical votes have been 61-60, or 60-59 since last elections large party leaders, John Key and David Cunliffe, retired. The votes run so close because the Maori Party are fair weather friends.  
ACT has been there as an integral part of this Government. In this time New Zealand has become the envy of the developed world. Restrained government spending and stable policy settings have meant that we’ve enjoyed job growth, low unemployment, low interest rates, and rising incomes.  
You only have to look at the rest of the Anglosphere. Our neighbours are in constant political turmoil and running large deficits. The U.K. is deeply unstable, the U.S. is in political crisis not seen since the late 1960s. The Canadians are happy but only because they’re mesmerised by Justin Trudeau. That will wear off.  
That’s why most of New Zealand’s biggest problems today are a result of people wanting to come here. Of all the problems you can have, being popular is not the worst, but it is still a problem.  
Auckland will gain another million people by 2040, according to Auckland Council. In other words, the pressure on our schools and infrastructure that we already see is going to intensify.  
That’s especially the case in the Epsom electorate. We’ve currently got 62,000 residents, but the Unitary Plan allows for a population increase of over 50,000 in these suburbs by 2040.  
This should spark alarm bells considering how our schools and transport systems are already reaching breaking point.  
For all of local government’s proclivity to waste money on events, self-promotion, and committees, there’s been a serious underinvestment in basic infrastructure.  
The best time to address this was ten years ago, the second best time is now. As ACT leader, I’ve been campaigning on a clear infrastructure proposal. We should give local councils half the GST from any building projects they consent, with the proviso that they use it on basic infrastructure.  
That means high growth areas like Auckland would receive a tremendous infrastructure boost. With $7.5 billion of building in the last year, Auckland would have received over half a billion dollars for use on improved roads, public transport, electrical infrastructure, and so on.  
This would create systemic change, ensuring infrastructure is funded automatically with growth, instead of by political whim.  
But we’re still left with the challenge of our overstretched local schools.  
I’ve commissioned a report from Property Economics that produces some astounding figures. It shows that the Epsom electorate is set for an influx of up to 8000 school-age students, exceeding Ministry of Education projections. For comparison, the role of our largest school, Auckland Grammar, is around 2500.  
Barfoot and Thompson estimate 14 housing developments will mean over 1700 apartments in the AGS zone alone, within the next 18 months.  
It shouldn’t be any surprise that people want to send their kids to our local schools – they’re some of the best in the country. As a student I boarded in the grammar zone to take advantage of these opportunities.  
It’s fantastic that these schools are creating opportunity for more kids, and we should support any initiative to extend proven successes in education.  
But we must ensure that pressure on school rolls doesn’t damage the quality of this education. As MP, I’ve been meeting with principals and staff at Auckland Grammar, Epsom Girls, Newmarket Primary, Kohia Terrace, Remuera Intermediate, and there’s a clear problem. These schools are at or above capacity, and are concerned that Ministry of Education projections underestimate likely roll growth.  
And despite this roll growth, and the proportional increase in funding, they are struggling to attract teachers. Part of this is the disproportionate cost of housing in Auckland, especially here in Epsom. ACT has comprehensive policies to cut red tape, lift housing supply and reduce costs across the city, but I’ll save that speech for another day.  
The other side of the issue is that state schools are quite literally not allowed to pay enough to attract talented teachers to teach in Auckland. I’ll be working to ensure these schools aren’t just funded properly, but have flexibility in law and in their contracts to offer salaries that reflect the quality of the education they offer, and the rising costs of living in this part of Auckland.  
I’ll be addressing this and other issues of interest to the Epsom electorate for the rest of the campaign and, if re-elected, for the next three years.
