Wool Growers Have No Confidence In Wool Board

Media Statement Gerry Eckhoff

ACT New Zealand Candidate for Otago  
For immediate release 22 July 1999

ACT's Otago Candidate Gerry Eckhoff today said the New Zealand Wool Board must accept it has lost the confidence of wool-growers.

The Central Otago farmer says that the farmers of Otago/Southland have put $1 billion into the Wool Board over the years and have seen little or no financial returns on the auction floor.

"We now see marino and mid-micron growers wanting control of their own destiny with out filtering funds through the Wool Board structure.

"The more than $100 million of grower reserves does not need a monolithic structure to administer it.

"Genuine consultation with growers is not Wool Board representatives flying around the country speaking to meetings where only ten farmers turn up.

"Clearly generic promotion of wool hasn't worked. Farmers are now asking why, for example, don't hop growers spend their money advertising beer?

"We need wipe the slate clean and have our highly focused growers driving the industry," said Gerry Eckhoff.
