Labour Picks And Chooses

Labour Picks And Chooses

ACT New Zealand Social Welfare Spokesman Dr Muriel Newman today questioned why the Labour Government is not extending its young persons education, training and work scheme, announced today, to all unemployed New Zealanders.

"ACT has long advocated that anyone, who is able-bodied and can work, should work, and should be engaged in a 40-hour a week programme of work, education or training," Dr Newman said.

"While it is laudable that Labour has picked up on this idea, and is now promoting it for young people, there is a huge question mark as to why it doesn't provide that same opportunity to all unemployed New Zealanders.

"Labour's present system for the unemployed consigns hundreds of thousands of them to the scrapheap. This is simply not good enough. ACT believes that the unemployed deserve better. I am disappointed to find that Labour is picking out one segment of this group, instead of offering them all opportunity to move into employment and out of dependency," Dr Newman said.
