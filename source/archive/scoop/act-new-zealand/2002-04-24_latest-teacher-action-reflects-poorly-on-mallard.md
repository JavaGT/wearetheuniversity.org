Latest Teacher Action Reflects Poorly On Mallard
================================================

The latest industrial action by school teachers should be a wake-up call for Trevor Mallard, ACT Education Spokesman MP Donna Awatere Huata said today.

"It is deeply distressing for Auckland families that their children will no longer be able to take part in extracurricular activities including sport, drama and music. The teacher boycott of these activities is squarely the fault of Mr Mallard.

"Mr Mallard's quick photo opportunity at a school yesterday was no compensation for frustrated and angry teachers who have watched him swanning around wasting time on the Rugby World Cup.

"No Education Minister since Merv Wellington has squandered as many opportunities as Mr Mallard.

"It has been reported that as a school teacher Mr Mallard took an unscheduled break from taking classes at Taumarunui College because he had coached a basketball team during the lunch hour. It will be very rich for the formerly staunch unionist Minister to attack Auckland teachers for copying his own actions.

"Mr Mallard has shown us all where his priorities lie in the past week. Surely it's time for him to get back to task," Mrs Awatere Huata said.
