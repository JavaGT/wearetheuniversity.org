Charter school board accused Govt of \"mistruths"
================================================

**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

  
Before resigning in protest at the Government’s decision to close charter schools, the Board set up to oversee them wrote a scathing letter to Education Minister Chris Hipkins.

The Partnership Schools/Kura Hourua Authorisation Board resigned en masse on 1 March, saying it would play no part in implementing the Government’s decision.

"The Board wrote that it was concerned about the 'many half-truths’ and ‘mistruths' that the Government had used to attack charter schools”, says ACT Leader David Seymour.

"It criticised Government Ministers for lacking the courage to visit charter schools.

  
"The Board said that 'the interests of the students and their whanau have not been taken into consideration in the Government’s decision to close charter schools’.

“Ms Isaac said that the Government’s regulatory impact statement was ‘misleading’ and that the its decision to close the schools did not take account of the evidence.

“She was also scathing of the Government’s desire to terminate the contracts saying it would send a ‘chilling message to parties considering contracting with the Government…that they cannot have confidence that contracts entered into in good faith will be honoured.

“This letter, signed by education professionals with decades of experience, exposes just how awful the Government’s charter schools policy is”, says Mr Seymour.
