**Free Press**

_ACT’s new regular bulletin_  

**It’s Catching**  
Vernon Small of the _Dom Post_ says ACT’s call to index tax brackets to inflation is [a ‘canny policy.’](http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13255&qid=2563550) The only real downside? “Let's face it, when it comes to vote-harvesting, drip fed tax cuts will never beat a multi-billion dollar election year tax package.” That people will keep their own money without having to wait for an election lottery is actually another reason to support the policy.

**Defending John Campbell**  
Tribal politics has erupted from the inkling that Campbell Live might be cancelled. Rookie National MP Todd Barclay offended more people with one anti-Campbell Facebook post than some will manage in their entire career. Not to be outdone, Labour have issued a press release defending Campbell.

**John’s Our Boy**  
Campbell thinks like and even says he’s a leftie, but look at what he does: He fundraises for people in tough spots, most recently Vanuatu. He goes after shonky business practices, last year shaming the nation’s malls into getting rid of a particularly predatory and irritating sales company. He advocates for people getting a rough deal from government departments, such as the Immigration department. He does all of this without government help, while entertaining thousands and making an eye-watering salary.

**Adam Smith’s Boy, Too**  
The father of capitalism was a moral philosopher in a time of great poverty. He invented economics to explain ‘the nature and causes of wealth,’ but he died perfecting his favourite work, ‘The Theory of Moral Sentiments’ where he said, _The great pleasure of conversation and society, besides, arises from a certain correspondence of sentiments and opinions… But this most delightful harmony cannot be obtained unless there is a free communication of sentiments and opinions_. The Campbells of the world are essential to a free society.

**Spiritual Son of Sir Roger**  
At 51, Campbell came of age under Rogernomics. Older lefties would spend their time calling on the government to ‘do something’ where Campbell uses argument, persuasion, and private fundraising. What’s more, he does it on New Zealand’s first privately owned TV channel, whose history is one of deregulation and foreign investment. The creative destruction that made his show may now end it, but not its spirit.

**“This House Believes Internet Access is a Human Right”**  
David Seymour’s team convincingly negated the above moot in front of 200 high school students, who were assembled for a UN Youth camp last Friday. Free Press readers might have certain presumptions about such an audience, but they’d be wrong. Opponent Laila Harre completely misread them. Losing the debate, she started attacking David but the audience took to Twitter and told her to get some arguments instead of ad hominem. The times they are a-changing.

**Bring Back Nandor**  
Wellington-based Green Party leadership contender Gareth Hughes was late to the debate due to flight delays. Were none of the 14 Green MPs available in Auckland? To his credit, Nandor would have taken the train (and flown at the same time). The Greens they have a-changed.

**Railtax**  
ACT is the last party to call for a new tax, but some of them should be better labelled. Bill English has admitted another billion dollars may need to be dropped into the ailing Kiwirail. ACT says let’s be up front about this: one billion dollars is the same as businesses paying an extra cent of company tax (currently 28 cents on the dollar) for the next four years. It would be more honest to say the company tax is now 27 cents, plus a one cent levy for Kiwirail. Let’s make it crystal clear that but for the rail bail, company tax could be reduced by a point. Transparency.

**It’s Already a Crime**  
_[One News reports](http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13258&qid=2563550)_ on an Indian student at Canterbury who likes to wear a Turban. Probably a good idea in Christchurch at this time of year, but he has had death threats after false accusations were made against him on Facebook. As David Seymour has pointed out, inciting violence is already a crime (Crimes Act 1961), and the police can easily find people on Facebook, but they didn’t bother until they were shamed by journalist Rachel Parkin. It is important to enforce the laws we have already before making new ones such as the proposed Harmful Digital Communications Bill.

**Winnie and the Wailer**  
It’s said that in politics you should accuse your opponents of your own worst trespasses. New Zealand First MP Tracey Martin bizarrely attacked Hekia Parata for barracking in Parliament. David Seymour sits one along from Parata and reports she is one of the most dignified parliamentarians. MPs who sit near Martin, however, will need hearing aids before they retire.

**More Private Greening**  
A fertiliser company has been sponsoring a series of regional awards through the New Zealand Farm Environment Trust. It’s for farmers who, among other things, manage run-off. According to the farmer versus environment mindset this shouldn’t happen, but ACT has long said that property owners make the best environmentalists. An example is the Bay of Plenty Supreme winners: _“The mud soils are high in phosphate and to reduce phosphate loss John has constructed up to 200 detention dams throughout the farm, which slow the runoff and collect sediments.”_ The whole story of these farmers working with the land is a good read for those of us who think meat is made at Countdown: [http://www.nzfeatrust.org.nz/vdb/document/315](http://www.act.org.nz/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/url.php?u=13259&qid=2563550)
