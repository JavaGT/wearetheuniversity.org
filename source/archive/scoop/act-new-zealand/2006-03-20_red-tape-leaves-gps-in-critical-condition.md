Red Tape Leaves GPs In Critical Condition

A new report from the College of GPs warning that nearly a third of family doctors are looking to change jobs within five years is not the first warning about the critical condition of general practice, says ACT Health spokesman, Heather Roy.

"Professional medical groups have warned of a worsening situation for many years", Mrs Roy said.

"The Ministry of Health has given up trying to solve workforce issues - the Health Workforce Advisory Committee needs to stop sitting on its hands, actively identify the problems that exist, and find more effective ways of recruiting new staff.

"After four years of meetings, and no recommendations, the Minister of Health should be seriously considering the validity of this group.

"The red tape that holds back all small businesses also punishes general practitioners, and now they have to grapple with the added bureaucracy of Labour's Primary Health Organisations.

"No wonder many doctors are reporting that they want out and medical students are shying away from General Practice.

"GP shortages are prevalent in rural areas, but the situation is getting worse in urban practices, which have traditionally had fewer problems attracting medical staff.

"Labour needs to offer more than bluff and bluster on workforce planning. We simply cannot afford to have our health workforce in terminal decline", Mrs Roy said.
