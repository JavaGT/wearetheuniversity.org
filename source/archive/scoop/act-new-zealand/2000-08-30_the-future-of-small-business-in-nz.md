The Future Of Small Business In NZ

“THE FUTURE OF SMALL BUSINESS IN NEW ZEALAND”

I think the next two years for small business are not going to be easy. But I am very optimistic about the future of small business for three reasons, said ACT Leader, Hon Richard Prebble.

“First - I have great faith in the resilience, ingenuity and ability of small business to survive, whatever this coalition throws at small business.

“Second – I would see more small business people than any other Member of Parliament. Contrary to media myth – ACT is the party of small business. We have in our 14,000 members and supporters, thousands of small business operators. Hundreds have come to our seminars on the Employment Relations Act. You cannot be but impressed by the character of the kiwis who are in business on their own account. They are special.

“Anderton is not going to beat these people!

“My third reason is because the 21st century is the century of small business. Last century, with the techniques of mass manufacturing, it was the century of big capital, big plants, mass employment and big business.

“The PC computer, e-mail and the internet have transformed the basis of business. Small is beautiful. For a fraction of the capital cost, it is possible to enter a wide range of businesses. The knowledge economy empowers the individual entrepreneur.

“So despite the falling dollar, the coalition, the growing compliance costs, the anti-business legislation, I am very optimistic about the future for small business. We will beat every problem.

“This is a one term government. The next government will not be a return to the drift of the Bill Birch years. The next government will include the ACT party that is firmly pro small business and determined to put in place an environment that is supportive, for small business to grow and prosper.

“This is going to be our century,” said Hon Richard Prebble.
