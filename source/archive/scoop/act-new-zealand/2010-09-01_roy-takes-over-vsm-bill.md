Roy Takes Over VSM Bill
=======================

**Roy Takes Over VSM Bill**

ACT New Zealand MP Heather Roy is today pleased to announce that she will be taking over responsibility for the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill which is currently in the name of her colleague Sir Roger Douglas.

Mrs Roy had the Education (Freedom of Association) Bill – also referred to as the ‘VSM Bill’ - in the Ballot from 2005 until 2008 but it was never drawn. It was transferred to her colleague Sir Roger Douglas’ at the end of 2008.

"ACT was founded on the principle of freedom – both economic and personal - and a belief that individuals should have the right to determine for themselves whether they want to belong to a particular group. This is why voluntary student membership is so important," Mrs Roy said.

"Students are the only group who are forced into joining a union. Many of these associations do not represent students’ views and in many cases undertake partisan political activities, waste student resources and some have indulged in resource mismanagement for personal gain – such as the alleged misuse of funds at Whitireia Polytechnic.

"Making students' association membership voluntary will ensure that the associations become more accountable to students and have a greater incentive to provide services that students actually want.

"The idea that people should be forced to join an association has lost support over the years as people recognised that it violates individual freedom of association. The Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill will allow students to finally enjoy that freedom too," Mrs Roy said.
