Massey Finding Raises Race Relations Hope

The Massey University study's finding, reported today, that most Kiwis are in favour of one law for all is extremely heartening, ACT New Zealand Maori Affairs Spokesman Stephen Franks said today.

"This finding, that most of us see our New Zealander identity first and our ethnicity second, is great," Mr Franks said.

"New Zealand will not become a Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka - or the now extinct Yugoslavia - if we refuse to see our neighbours, schoolmates, fellow sports fans and church-goers through a racial lens.

"The study shows that the racists in the government, in education, in churches - who have been teaching people to see themselves separately - have, thankfully, failed so far.

"This study raises optimism that - despite the current race relations and foreshore controversy - New Zealand has a bright future," Mr Franks said.
