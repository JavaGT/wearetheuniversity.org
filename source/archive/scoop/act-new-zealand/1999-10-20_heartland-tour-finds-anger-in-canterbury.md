Heartland Tour finds anger in Canterbury
========================================

**Wednesday, 20 October 1999, 4:15 pm**  
**Press Release: [ACT New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/ACT_New_Zealand)**

The ACT Heartland Tour learned today of Darfield residents' anger at the high-handed way they are being treated over the proposal to build a regional rubbish dump at Darfield.

The Heartland Tour around New Zealand's rural areas by ACT farmer candidates led by ACT rural spokesman Owen Jennings is now in Canterbury. The ACT rural team were welcomed warmly at a meeting of Darfield residents today.

Owen Jennings says the Darfield situation is one more instance that the ACT rural team have encountered of the abuse of the Resource Management Act and local government high handedness.

"Darfield residents were relieved to learn that ACT intends to restore power to the people by reducing the influence of government and cutting red tape and bureaucracy including the Resource Management Act," Mr Jennings said.

Owen Jennings outlined ACT's proposals to reform local government and the Resource Management Act including removing a tier of local government and restricting the draconian and frustrating powers given to local authorities.

Tonight the ACT rural team will hold a public meeting in Ashburton. Tomorrow they will hold farm meetings and public meetings in Mayfield, Geraldine, Hanging Rock, Waimate and Timaru.
