Australian Senators to legalise Assisted Dying

**Australian Senators to legalise Assisted Dying**

  
“Australia once again shows New Zealand the way on assisted dying legislation,” says ACT Leader David Seymour.

Following the passing of last year’s assisted dying law in the State of Victoria, Australian Senators are poised to vote in favour of allowing a ban to be lift on assisted dying laws in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory (NT) next week.

“I’m encouraged to see courageous steps being taken on assisted dying by Senators in Australia while our Justice Committee is considering the End of Life Choice Bill.”

“More than half of Australian Senators will side with the vast majority of the public, around 73 per cent, who want and support voluntary assisted dying.”

“Over 120 million people currently live in a jurisdiction with assisted dying laws and it’s set to grow.”

“It’s time New Zealand politicians took a clear stance in favour of change and represented the 75 per cent of New Zealanders who are in favour of assisted dying.”
