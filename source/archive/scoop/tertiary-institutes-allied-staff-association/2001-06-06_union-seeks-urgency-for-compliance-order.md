Union Seeks Urgency For Compliance Order

Union Seeks Urgency For Compliance Order Against Massey

  
The Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Association (TIASA), the union representing allied staff in the Tertiary Sector, has filed with the Employment Relations Authority, seeking an order for Massey University to comply with the terms of settlement of their Collective Agreement.

TIASA and Massey University settled negotiations for the renewal of the Collective Agreement, covering allied staff at Massey’s Wellington campus, in February of this year. The settlement provided for a 1.7% salary increase and a one-off $400 lump sum payment.

“The $400 lump sum payment was to be made immediately the settlement proposal was ratified”, said TIASA’s Chief Executive, Peter Joseph. “We advised Massey of the ratification and on the day it occurred, both verbally and in writing, and have afforded them every opportunity to comply with the settlement agreement” he said. They have failed to do so.

Peter Joseph said that TIASA members were angry and frustrated at Massey’s lack of action and their apparent disregard for their legal obligations to their staff.

“In absolute frustration, we wrote to Massey University on 22 May, advising that unless we heard from them by 4pm the following day, confirming that the $400 lump sum payment would be made immediately, we would seek urgency with the Employment Relations Authority”, said Mr Joseph, “however we never even received the courtesy of an acknowledgement of receipt”, he said.
