55 Jobs Axed as Unitec contracts out Allied Staff work

**55 Jobs Axed as Unitec contracts out Allied Staff work**

Unitec’s Chief Executive Dr Rick Ede this afternoon released the outcome document on phase one of their Sector Alignment and Student Services Blueprint Reviews, which result in 55 allied staff roles being contracted out to a multinational company.

Meetings were held with the various groups of impacted staff and their union, TIASA, this morning followed by the all staff meeting and presentation by Dr Ede early this afternoon.

“We are extremely disappointed that Unitec has decided to proceed down this path, despite the risks involved, impact on staff, their families, and the community and considerable opposition to the proposals” said TIASA’s Chief Executive Peter Joseph. “We will continue to support and represent our members through this process over the coming weeks and months and will be holding meetings with impacted members early next week. Staff and students of Unitec are stunned by today’s announcement” he said.

The majority of the redundancies are expected to take effect in April next year but Unitec management are calling for expressions of interest in voluntary redundancy at the end of next week.

“Allied staff are holding their collective breath as they now look forward to phases two and three of Unitec’s proposal” said Joseph.
