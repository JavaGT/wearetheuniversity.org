Labour’s Student Loan Policy A Winner

“Today’s announcement by Labour that it will scrap interest on student loans for students resident in New Zealand, is a far sighted policy to be applauded” said Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Association (TIASA) National President, Shelley Weir.

The current loan scheme, introduced in the early 1990’s has been a financial leg-iron for graduates and has seen many of this country’s brightest leave New Zealand to work overseas.

“This policy will ease the debt burden of thousands of students and graduates, and will provide greater access to tertiary education for all” said Shelley Weir.
