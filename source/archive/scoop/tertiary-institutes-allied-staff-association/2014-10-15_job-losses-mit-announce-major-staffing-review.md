**Job losses: MIT announce major staffing review**

15th October 2014

Staff members at MIT’s two largest faculties, the Faculty of Education and Social Sciences (FoESS) and the Faculty of Engineering and Trades (FoET) were called to meetings yesterday to be advised of a major review of the faculties which will result in significant job losses.

Both faculties are forecasting deficits of over $3 million.

Staff listened in silence as the overview was presented by MIT Management but there were audible gasps when the extent of the impact on current staffing was revealed.

The consultation period for the reviews commenced yesterday and it is proposed that it will conclude on 4th November.

“TIASA has questioned both the adequacy and reasonableness of the consultation period as it effectively only provides 14 working days for impacted staff to consider the restructuring proposal, take advice, consider available options and, provide feedback/submissions on the proposal” said TIASA Chief Executive, Peter Joseph.

“We are not seeking to unnecessarily prolong the review process as we certainly understand how distressing this is for our members but, we do want to ensure that all impacted have the opportunity to properly consider and respond to the proposal” he said.

TIASA will be holding meetings early next week with members in the two faculties impacted by the review, to discuss the proposals and, to provide support and advice.
