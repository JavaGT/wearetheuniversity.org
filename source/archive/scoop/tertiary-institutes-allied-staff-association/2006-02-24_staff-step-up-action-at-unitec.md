Staff Step Up Action at UNITEC

  
Unitec staff members have voted to step up their action in support of a fair pay increase.

Members of the Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Association (TIASA), today decided to target Monday morning’s Unitec council meeting with a protest stoppage and picket and will continue to picket the Institute all of next week.

“Our members have picketed Unitec for the last two days in an endeavour to move them from what we consider to be an unrealistic and insulting offer of settlement of our Collective Agreement”, said TIASA Chief Executive , Peter Joseph.

“Further discussions have failed to resolve the impasse and staff feel that Unitec management are not taking their claims for a fair pay increase seriously”, he said.

“TIASA members feel that if management are not prepared to be reasonable then the Council, Unitec’s Governing body, need to be aware of the possible repercussions”, said Peter Joseph.
