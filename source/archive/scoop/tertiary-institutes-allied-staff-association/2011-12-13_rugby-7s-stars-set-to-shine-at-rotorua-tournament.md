**Rugby 7’s Stars Set To Shine at Rotorua Tournament**

New Zealand’s top women’s Rugby 7’s Players will be on display at the annual Aotearoa Maori Women’s Invitation 7’s Tournament in Rotorua this Sunday (18th December).

“With just over four years to Rugby 7’s debut as an Olympic sport in Rio de Janeiro, tournaments of this calibre take on even greater importance for preparing our athletes”, said Tournament Director, Peter Joseph.

“The Aotearoa Maori Women’s 7’s team which is selected from this tournament, has set the standard internationally for women’s 7’s for a number of years and has been the only vehicle, apart from the 2009 Inaugural 7’s World Cup, for New Zealand’s aspiring players to showcase their talent on the world stage” said Joseph. “It is great to know that there are to be other quality tournaments in New Zealand to assist in preparing our players”.

Last year’s Tournament finalists, Counties Manukau Maori and Waikato Warriors, are returning as the top two seeds however, they will have plenty of competition from Wellington Pride; Outkast Hawkes Bay; Manawatu; Auckland Marist; Ekatahuna; and Waikato SSG.

The tournament, sponsored by Te Wananga o Aotearoa, will kick off at 10.20am on Sunday 18th December at Rotorua Girls High School. Teams will be competing for the Donna Morgan Memorial Trophy.
