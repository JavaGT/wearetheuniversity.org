Further Protest Action Likely At NMIT

MEDIA RELEASE

  
FURTHER PROTEST ACTION LIKELY AT NMIT

  
The protest action taken by allied staff at Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology (NMIT) last month, is likely to escalate as a result of the failure of the parties to reach a settlement in mediation.

The staff who are members of the Tertiary Institutes Allied Staff Association (TIASA) have voted overwhelming to reject an offer by NMIT, that would have union members receiving 0.2% less than non-union staff.

“Our members view NMIT’s approach to these negotiations as provocative, and an attack on their union membership” said TIASA Chief Executive, Peter Joseph.

“Their apparent determination to have non-union members in receipt of higher salaries, than TIASA members, for the same work, along with more than 80 claims at the commencement of negotiations, can only result in strife” he said.

“It is extremely disappointing that NMIT do not appear to want to reach a reasonable and fair settlement for their staff,” said Joseph. “We have been genuine in our attempts to bring about a settlement and had arranged urgent mediated discussions in an attempt to resolve matters before the Chief Executive, Tony Grey, departed on a month’s leave,” he said.

It is unclear at this time as to whether any further discussions can be held during the NMIT Chief Executive’s absence overseas.

‘We have indicated our preparedness to meet, but have not received any response from NMIT Management,” said Joseph.
