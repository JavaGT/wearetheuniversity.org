MEDIA RELEASE

WITT Allied Staff vote unanimously to ratify collective agreement settlement

4 December 2018

Bargaining for the renewal of the Allied Staff Collective Agreement was extremely positive and took just over four hours to conclude.

TIASA members at WITT Taranaki have voted unanimously to ratify the settlement which delivers them a 2% increase to salary rates (paid and printed) and, provides the Living Wage ($20.55) as the minimum hourly rate.

“In a sector that is currently facing many challenges it is great to have the senior management of WITT Taranaki recognise and value their greatest resource – staff. WITT have not just talked about valuing staff, they have put their money where their values are,” said TIASA Chief Executive, Peter Joseph.

The collective agreement takes effect from 1st October 2018 and while WITT “may” pass-on the settlement to non-union allied staff members, the pass-on provision in the TIASA/WITT collective agreement means that a period of four months must have elapsed from the commencement of the collective agreement before it can be offered to those allied staff on individual agreements.
