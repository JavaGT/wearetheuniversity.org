### Aotearoa Women Play for Christchurch - in Rome

The organisers of the Roma Sevens are promoting the Christchurch Earthquake Relief prior to, and during, their high profile International Rugby 7’s Tournament to be held in Rome on 3 & 4 June and, the current champions and tournament number seeds, the Aotearoa (NZ) Maori Women’s 7’s team, are at the forefront of that promotion.

“We are absolutely rapt to have the plight of Christchurch people acknowledged throughout this hugely popular international event and, to be part of raising money to help people re-build their lives and their beautiful city” said Aotearoa Coach, Peter Joseph.

“There will be tremendous media attention on this event throughout Europe and, while these talented young women don’t normally require any incentive to perform on the world stage, playing for Christchurch, on the other side of the world, will make us even more determined to succeed” said Joseph.

The Aotearoa (NZ) Maori Women’s 7’s team depart for Rome on Monday 30th May, 2011.
