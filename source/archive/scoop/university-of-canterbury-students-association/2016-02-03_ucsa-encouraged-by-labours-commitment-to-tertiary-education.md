**UC Students’ Association President Encouraged by Labour’s Commitment to Tertiary Education**

On Sunday 31st January, Labour pledged to offer three years of free post-school education over a person’s lifetime.  

The University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) President James Addington has applauded Labour for kickstarting the discussion around tertiary funding.

“It’s great to see a major party tackling tertiary education head on and I hope we see other parties doing the same. It’s no secret that university study is becoming increasingly unaffordable for average New Zealanders, and we need it to be at the forefront of debate and discussion in the upcoming elections.”

Addington said he looks forward to discussing the policy with his fellow students when Canterbury’s 2016 academic year commences on February 22nd.
