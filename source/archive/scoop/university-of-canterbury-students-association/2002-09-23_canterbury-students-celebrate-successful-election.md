Canterbury students celebrate successful election
=================================================

University of Canterbury students are celebrating another successful election.

The University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) last week held its annual elections to elect the 2003 President, Vice President and Executive. Turnout for the election was over 50% higher than last year.

UCSA President Richard Neal was re-elected with a majority of over 600, one of the highest polling results for years.

“I’m extremely pleased to be re-elected,” Neal said. “I thank all those students who voted for me. It allows me to carry on the important work for students—which is what all Executive members are here to do.”

An interesting facet of the election was the gender split of the 2003 Executive. “For the first time in as long as anyone can recall, the Executive is split evenly between men and women. This is important, because it shows the UCSA is a truly diverse institution. And it shows that a wide variety of people want to be involved in running the UCSA.”

UCSA elections were an important event, he said, “because it gives students a chance to have their say. Students often query the use of the Executive—well, this is a chance for them to comment directly on the running of the UCSA.”

Mr Neal said he was excited by the election results. “The Executive they’ve selected for 2003 is a good group of people. I’m looking forward to working with them.”
