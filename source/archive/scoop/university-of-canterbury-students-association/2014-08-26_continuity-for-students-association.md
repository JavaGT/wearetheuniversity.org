**Continuity for the University of Canterbury Students’ Association**

**August 26, 2014**

For the first time in the University of Canterbury Students’ Association’s 120-year history the top three executive positions have been re-elected.

The University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) has announced its executive team for 2015. Five of the current UCSA executive members were re-elected for a second term. They are president Sarah Platt, vice-president Luke Gillespie, finance officer Cameron Bignell and general executives Michael McRae and Daniel Chan.

In returning for a second term Platt says she is excited to be elected for a second term as it provides an opportunity to build on the initiatives started this year.

\`\`Having such a strong team elected beside me is fantastic and we’re excited about what we can bring to 2015,’’ Platt says.

The UCSA represents and advocates for more than 12,000 students at the university. It employs about 100 staff and has a turnover of $9 million. It owns and operates the majority of food and beverage outlets on campus plus two Early Learning Centres and organises activities and events for the student population. It has an advisory board with external board members who provide advice to the student executive.

Platt says looking to 2015 and beyond she expects the UCSA to continue to create belonging, ownership and foster student success.
