University Of Canterbury Orientation 2011

UCSA, in association with Fabel Events, is proud to announce the official line up for 2011!

What a party it’s going to be for Orientation week 2011, so get your dancing shoes on, your laughing gear ready and your earplugs in, for what promises to be the best start to the university year, EVER!

With everything from comedy to dubstep and new noise to hypnotism, O week has something for everyone and starts off with the hugely popular, annual Toga party (Touch my Toga) on Thursday the 17th of February. This year, look forward to dancing your sandals off and tearing it up in the all new ‘Toga Garden’ to the exclusive NZ performance of Australia’s Yolanda Be Cool (writer of international hit track “We No Speak Americano”), our own Coco Solid, Dick Johnson, Croatian DJ sisters Maya and Vanya, Toby Nice, Supermodel and Ed Musik.

Next up Saturday night brings the New Noise to Cloud 9 for its glorious re-opening as an entertainment venue at UCSA. Up and coming, uber cool artists The Ruby Suns, Street Chant, The Guest and Tommy ILL will all strut their awesome indie styles for an evening of distorted bliss, hip hop and the well crafted songs. The future of New Zealand independent music is right here, get on board!

The best medicine, laughter, will be on show on Tuesday the 22nd of February, with this year’s evening of comedy boasting not one, not two, but four of New Zealand’s top comics. Paul Ego, Jeremy Elwood, Steve Wrigley and Justine Smith will have you in stitches as each performs their own unique brand of comedy genius and satirical banter. Always a firm favourite, the universal language of laughter will make this a night not to miss. Go on Laugh it Up!

Wednesday the 23rd of February spells a major night for punters as Christchurch, the capital of all things drum and bass and dubstep welcomes a wicked, bass heavy line up of international and national DJs, producers and MC’s to the University Ballroom, The MIX and amphitheatre. Featuring UK heavyweights TC and Mensah and our own top of their game, Truth, Concord Dawn with MC Twincam, DJ Presha, and ILL Figz, prepare yourself to be blown away by the rib shaking basslines, death-defying breaks, killer drops and heavy beats of what will without a doubt be a sell out night. Bass, how low can YOU go? Booyah!

Returning to Orientation this year on Friday the 25th of February and as popular as ever, Hypnotist Guy Cater will be showing off his considerable talents, as he enters the realm of your mind. All in the name of fun and entertainment hilarity ensues as he showcases the variety of shenanigans and hi jinks that people can get up to while under his spell. Get in quick if you want a taste of the sometimes bizarre, the always funny and the occasionally spooky Hypnotist.

Saving the best till last, Orientation 2011 winds up this year with the mighty Amp it Up daytime party on Saturday the 26th of February. Amp it Up sees the UCSA Amphitheatre and mega stage come alive in a way only seen at the legendary Tea Party. Tickets are limited! Whakatane dub rockers and masters of the live show KORA, headline this day in the sun and will be joined by Kidz in Space, the phenomenal State of Mind, Australia’s Bad Ezzy and Kween G, Dj Killamanraro and our own DJ Insomniac. This excellent and line up of both organic and electronic musical geniuses are a primo choice to put everyone in the perfect mood to start the year and hit the books. Sunshine, Free Food, Awesome Sounds, You and your mates, Yeah Bo!
