### UCSA strongly supports CCC proposed light rail link

University of Canterbury Students Association (UCSA) strongly supports the Christchurch City Councils proposed light rail link between the new CBD and the University of Canterbury.

"The concept of a light rail system in the draft City Central Plan would have significant benefits for both University of Canterbury students' and the rebuild of the centre city itself. With the success of the University and the city inextricably linked, providing an effective and convenient transport between the two is a fantastic opportunity to speed progress with Christchurch's recovery ", says student president Kohan McNab.

"The proposed light rail link is a key step in the process of connecting an energetic and educated student body with our city. Students will only utilise the link if there is an exciting vibrant city at the other end of the track."

The UCSA is working with the Student Volunteer Army to channel student opinions on the draft plan to the Christchurch City Council.
