Canterbury Students to Burn Budget
==================================

**Thursday, 19 May 2005, 9:18 am**  
**Press Release: [University of Canterbury Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury_Students_Association)**

Canterbury Students to Burn Budget

  
Students from University of Canterbury Students’ Associations’ will publicly express their anger on Thursday, 19th May over the 2005 Budget. They will be protesting the Government’s Budget which is set to offer little for students. At approximately 6:30pm tomorrow night Canterbury Students will burn a larger than life replica of the 2005 Budget.

“Canterbury students believe the Government has again let all students down. By burning the Budget we send a clear sign that this treatment is not good enough” said University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) President George Hampton.

Hampton believes students’ are angry for many reasons: “The axing of the independent circumstances allowance, increasing fees and now a turn towards private savings schemes for tertiary education has frustrated many students,” said Hampton, “If the Government wants the hundreds of thousands of students in New Zealand to support them at the polls they have to make greater commitments to tertiary education – it is no wonder many students look overseas after graduation.”

  
The protest will begin at 6:30pm Thursday 19th May University of Canterbury Students’ Association Amphitheatre. To show the nation that tertiary student issues do matter.
