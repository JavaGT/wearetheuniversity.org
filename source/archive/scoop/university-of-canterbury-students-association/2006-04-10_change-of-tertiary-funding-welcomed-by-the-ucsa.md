Change of Tertiary Funding welcomed by the UCSA

Change of Tertiary Funding welcomed by the UCSA

The University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) has welcomed moves by the Minister of Tertiary Education to move away from the “bums on seats” funding policy of the past. The proposed move to a funding model that will recognise that the quality of education for University students is a step forward in ensuring University produce high quality graduates.

UCSA President Warren Poh said, “The UCSA had already planned to highlight the importance of the quality of education received at the University of Canterbury to students during 2006. The support of Dr Cullen in promoting this cause shows how important this issue is.”

“Staff redundancies in the College of Arts at the University of Canterbury have been driven by the decline in EFTS (Equivalent Full Time Student) numbers of various departments in the College of Arts. A change in the funding policy of University’s by the Government will mean that such funding driven staff cuts are less likely to happen in the future.”

“This can only mean that the Government is making the quality of education received by University students across the country a high priority, thus ensuring that the quality of a degree of a New Zealand University is second to none.

The additional mention of a quality and monitoring system by Dr Cullen is a great sign for students that Universities are considering monitoring the quality of lecturers and the quality of research performed. It is important that these systems are made available to students for them to evaluate and compare lecturers and Universities,” said Poh.
