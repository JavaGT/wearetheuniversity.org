Students Concerned Over Strike Action
=====================================

**Press Release: [University of Canterbury Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury_Students_Association)**

University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA) expressed concern over staff strike action today. On March 4 some staff at the University of Canterbury will proceed with industrial action for the day. As a result some classes will be cancelled and students will be without a day of teaching only two weeks into the academic year.

“Students are likely to be the most significant party affected by the industrial action,” said University of Canterbury Students Association President Richard Neal. “The result is disappointing, as students have and will continue to be the worst affected group in an under-funded tertiary environment.”

“Students generally understand that staff salaries are not competitive internationally, however the principal problem lies with government funding,” said Neal. “The university has cut expenditure to the bone and there is was little room for significant movement without increased government funding.”

“Students understand where staff are coming from but calls for increased salaries, without an increase of Government funding, would always mean fee rises for students,” said Neal. “This would always concern students, as while staff are concerned about pay conditions, they are not headed toward $5 billion of debt.”

“I think the problems are symptomatic of a tertiary system in need of better funding and I look forward to a combined effort by staff, students and institutions in election year,” said Neal.
