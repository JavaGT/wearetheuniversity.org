Canterbury students ready for Guinness shot slam
================================================

University of Canterbury students will attempt to take back their Guinness world record shot slam this Friday, October 4.

Last year, 500 Canterbury students took part in the slam, doing shots of tequila, a mammoth effort that saw Canterbury entering the Guinness World Records. However, students at Bath University, UK set a new record of 749 students in March this year.

Canterbury students were determined to retake their record, said University of Canterbury Students Association (UCSA) president Richard Neal.

“Canterbury students are always keen for a challenge,” he said. “We pride ourselves on being the best in the country—well, now we can show that we are the best worldwide.”

It was hoped that 1,100 students would take part on Friday, Mr Neal said. “We need some huge numbers to make sure that everyone knows when Canterbury does something, we do it well, and no one can challenge us.”

The Tequila Slam was a good example of the exciting student culture at Canterbury. “It shows that Canterbury students can work together to create an excellent, vibrant place. We’re determined to take back our record.”

Tequila Slam, Friday, October 4. Entry: $2. Entry through UCSA Ballroom foyer.
