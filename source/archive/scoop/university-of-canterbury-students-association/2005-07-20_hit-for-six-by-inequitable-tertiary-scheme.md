“Hit for Six” by Inequitable Tertiary Scheme

“Hit for Six” by Inequitable Tertiary Scheme

Mixed Reaction From Students Over Strike

The majority of staff, both academic and general, are striking at the University of Canterbury today.

“A staff strike of this magnitude is difficult for students,” said George Hampton, President of the University of Canterbury Students’ Association (UCSA). “Regardless of the staff’s intent in holding this strike, students will be adversely affected. Not only do they lose valuable lecture time, but they also have lost access to resources vital to their study, such as the Central Library. Any classes and tests that do go ahead will be conducted in unheated classrooms. Many students have contacted the UCSA expressing their frustration”.

The UCSA is doing all it can to help students through this time. The UCSA building remains open, with the common rooms providing a warm place to study. Hot tea and coffee is also available free to students outside the Central Library. In addition to this, the UCSA will endeavour to heat the rooms being used for tests at the university this evening.

“The UCSA supports the sentiment behind the strike,” said Hampton. “Academic staff at New Zealand universities are underpaid, and this directly impacts upon the quality of education that the universities are able to offer their students. However, we are disappointed that AUS has recently refused to meet with us over their plans for the industrial action and that the University has not sufficiently communicated with students. We represent the 12,000 students that are directly affected by this strike, and although we are trying to keep the student body well informed of the effects of the industrial action, AUS’s lack of consultation means this is very difficult. We are extremely disappointed by this turn of events and urge members of AUS to cover all material missed by cancellation of lectures today before the end of the semester. But if the Government wants to stop events like this it should adequately fund Universities”.

The UCSA is holding an AGM next Wednesday at 1pm that will consider what position students wish to adopt towards any further strike actions.
