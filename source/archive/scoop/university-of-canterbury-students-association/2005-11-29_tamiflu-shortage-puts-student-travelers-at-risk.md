TamiFlu Shortage Puts Student Travelers at RIsk

TamiFlu Shortage Puts Student Travelers at Severe Risk

The University of Canterbury Students' Association today expressed its' concerns for student travelers. This time of year is traditionally when many students take-off overseas to celebrate the end of their exams or to begin well-deserved OEs - many of these young people are now unable to access the TamiFlu drug, because of the already severe domestic demand for the medicine.

"New Zealanders heading overseas are far more at risk than those staying at home. Many students and young New Zealanders are being unnecessarily put in danger due to the shortage of the drug. We call on local DHBs and the Government to give New Zealanders heading overseas to at-risks areas precedence for access to any remaining, pharmacy stocked, TamiFlu" George Hampton, UCSA President, said.

"The Government should weigh up where the most value lies for protecting New Zealanders: those sitting at home in a country currently unaffected or those in a country where there is a high risk of a human to human outbreak" Hampton said.
