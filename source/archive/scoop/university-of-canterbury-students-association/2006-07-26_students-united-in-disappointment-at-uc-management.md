Students united in disappointment at UC Management

University of Canterbury students are unhappy with Vice-Chancellor Professor  
Roy Sharp plans to bring forward fee-setting for next years domestic tuition  
fees. The lack of consultation and notification has forced the University  
of Canterbury Student's Association (UCSA) to step up its attempts at  
gauging student reaction and concern. These will be voiced at a Rally being  
held today (Wednesday) at 2pm on the University Central Library steps.

The last two days have seen UCSA representatives attend a number of lectures  
in an attempt to let all UC students know what has happened. With over  
15,000 students to inform, UCSA representatives have been working day and  
night to not only inform students of the domestic tuition fees increase; but  
to let students know how the Vice-Chancellor has avoided consultation with  
students until forced to by a recent media article.

The Vice-Chancellor seems to have reacted to the recent newspaper article  
by sending an all student email out, which is unprecedented. In response  
students have been vocal and supportive of each other. This is of note in a  
time when the University seems to have turned its back on its own students.  
It is an example of how the University of Canterbury student body can unite  
and stand up for a common cause, said UCSA President Warren Poh.

Mr Poh said, Tomorrows rally is an opportunity for students to show their  
dissatisfaction in the process. By voicing their concerns and turning up to  
the Rally in numbers, we will make the Vice-Chancellor hear and see that  
students are disappointed at the actions of the University.

Tomorrow University of Canterbury students will show the University  
management that we are interested in the fee-setting process. Despite the  
University locking us out of the process this year, we will show that we  
care, and that the University cannot push the setting of tuition fees,  
behind our backs, Mr Poh concluded.
