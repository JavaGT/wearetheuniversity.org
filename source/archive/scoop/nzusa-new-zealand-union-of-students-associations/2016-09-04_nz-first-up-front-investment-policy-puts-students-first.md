NZ First Up Front Investment Policy Puts Students First

Sept 3

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) warmly welcomes the Up Front Investment policy announcement by Tracey Martin and New Zealand First at their conference today. This policy transforms a student’s financial debt into a skills debt which would be paid off by working in New Zealand for the same number of years that one studied.

NZUSA is pleased to see another political party taking the issue of student debt seriously.

“We know Tracey and NZ First are committed to addressing the barriers that student loans create while balancing the obligation that graduates have to the country that has educated them” says NZUSA President Linsey Higgins.

“We know Tracey and the NZ First team have spent months working on a robust and fiscally sound policy that addresses the impacts of student debt and builds on previous policies from the party’s manifesto.”

“Student debt is currently impacting on people’s ability to start families, buy houses and prepare for retirement.”

“Significant variances in course costs and graduate wages can see some of our most important members of society such as nurses and teachers left with the burden of debt for longer. This policy treats all graduates as equal. One year’s study equals one year of skills commitment.”

“If implemented, this policy would be a game changer for students”.

“While we celebrate this policy announcement, NZUSA is committed to working with all political parties to ensure the best outcomes for tertiary students”.
