Students remember Dame Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan

Joint VUWSA-NZUSA press release

Student leaders are remembering the passing of a wahine toa of the student movement.

Dame Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan ONZ was elected as Women’s Vice-President to the 1960-1961 Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) Executive becoming its first Maori woman member.

While on the VUWSA Executive she campaigned to have te reo Maori offered at Victoria, pushed for better student health facilities and was a keen advocate for the proposed new Student Union Building. She was also an active member of the University Fencing Club.

VUWSA President Seamus Brady said Dame Whetu was part of a tradition of student representatives and students’ associations who have pushed for greater students’ rights, stronger pastoral care, a better and more inclusive education system, and adherence to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.

“It is fitting that the same proposed Student Union Building she advocated for over fifty years ago has just completed a student-funded $4 million upgrade and now boasts a purpose built student health and counselling facility – Mauri Ora and dedicated space for our Maori roopuu Ngai Tauira.”

“People like Dame Whetu and the students’ association they were a part of many decades ago are the reason the students of today enjoy such a wide ranging education and student experience”.

New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) Co-President David Do said Dame Whetu also made a significant contribution to the advancement of Maori education at a national level.

“Students today continue to benefit from her legacy of work in education and society. She helped establish the New Zealand Maori Students' Federation and served as its first President. NZUSA has a Treaty relationship with its successor, the current national Maori students’ association Te Mana Akonga.”

VUWSA and NZUSA extend our sympathies to Dame Whetu’s whanau and friends.
