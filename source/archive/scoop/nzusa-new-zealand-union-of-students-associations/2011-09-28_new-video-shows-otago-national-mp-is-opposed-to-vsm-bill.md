New Video Shows Otago National MP is Opposed to VSM Bill

**New Video Shows Otago National MP is Opposed to VSM Bill**

NZUSA is calling on National MP Michael Woodhouse to cross the floor this afternoon on ACT’s Education(Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill as a new video has revealed that he told students at Otago University that: “I don’t personally support the Bill as it is introduced at the moment.”

The video was from a political candidate’s debate held at Otago University last month.

Woodhouse also wrongly told students that it was “almost certain the Bill would not go through in its current form, this term of Parliament”.

The National MP showed support for the compromise solution that was put to National and Act by NZUSA and others during the Select Committee stage.

“Woodhouse misled students who he was seeking votes from” said NZUSA Co-President Max Hardy.

“If he now votes for the Bill, we think that is very embarrassing for him.”

“National MPs had consistently reassured us in private that they did not think the Bill would go through this term and that they were interested in the compromise solution put on the table”

“It is deeply disappointing to see them push it through now, at the latest possible time, giving us the shortest possible transition.” concluded Hardy.

The video can be found on Youtube:
