Public service job cut threats uncalled for

Public service job cut threats uncalled for

Student leaders are very concerned at news of potential job cuts in the public service, particularly in government agencies and departments that deal with tertiary education and student support, and label any ‘slash and burn’ approach to staffing as reckless and irresponsible.

“All New Zealand workers, including public servants, deserve reassurance and certainty during these troubled economic times, not stress and threats over their livelihood”, said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA). “Government should be setting an example and treating its’ workers well, particularly when we are days out from the “Jobs Summit”, and especially if it expects other employers to do the same”.

National has previously criticised the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) for excessive staff numbers and there has been further indication over the last week that the government may halve its workforce, and in recent days it has been revealed that the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) will likely cull hundreds of positions.

“Since its relatively recent establishment in 2003, the TEC has had a significant and positive impact and has the potential to do much more if resourced well and given the chance”, said King. “Considering the size of the tertiary sector, the fact it is still in the early stages of reforms, and the approximately $3 billion the TEC is responsible for investing in tertiary education each year, a few hundred staff is by all accounts a small workforce,” said King.

“Of course there is always room for improvement in any organisation, but it is inappropriate and unnecessary to punish individual workers for issues that are beyond their control or responsibility,” added King.

“Also of concern are impending MSD cuts that could threaten Studylink, which administers student loans and allowances. Any reduction in staff could have a significant negative impact on students seeking financial assistance to get them through their study,” said King. “This is particularly worrying considering this is the busiest time of year for applications for support and that this year there are likely to be even more students enrolling in education. It’s likely more frontline staff are needed, not fewer,” added King.

“Tertiary education is going to be a key contributor to both New Zealand’s short term future and its’ long term economic sustainability. An educated workforce will promote productivity and innovation and assist in filling workforce shortages,” said King. “NZUSA hopes that no rash and unnecessary cuts are made, but rather that government recognises that investment in its own staff and agencies can have a direct positive flow-on effect to the rest of the economy and therefore retain good workers and protect much needed jobs,” concluded King.
