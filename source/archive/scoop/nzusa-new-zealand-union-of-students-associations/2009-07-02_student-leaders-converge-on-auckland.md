Student leaders converge on Auckland

Student leaders from Universities and Polytechnics around the country are converging in Auckland this weekend for the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) July Conference to be held on the 3 – 5 July at the University of Auckland Business School.

“This is the first NZUSA conference since the release of the National Government’s Budget and student leaders will have plenty to discuss,” said Sophia Blair, Co-President of NZUSA. “One of the things that students are really concerned about is the overall lack of funding that the Government has invested in the tertiary sector. This lack of funding will have a huge impact on students in terms of academic quality, student support and access to education. These concerns will be a major topic of discussion and action at this conference," said Blair

Notable speakers include the Minister of Tertiary Education, Hon Anne Tolley who will be speaking about the Government’s priorities for tertiary education in 2009, Professor Jane Kelsey, who will be discussing the increased commercialisation of education and the impact that this has on students and Peter Coolbear, Director of Ako Aotearoa, who will be discussing the challenges for teaching and learning quality in the 21st Century.

Workshops topics include, but are not limited too, student retention and completion rates, the importance of student representation on University and Polytechnic councils, international student issues and why investment in tertiary education is smart economics.

“We’re looking forward to a productive and engaging conference in which students leaders will be developing their answers to the key issues and concerns that will be affecting their students in 2009” concluded Blair

NZUSA is a federation of sixteen students’ associations representing the common and collective interests of tertiary students nationwide. Formed in 1929, NZUSA celebrates its’ 80th anniversary this year as the national representative voice for tertiary students.
