Still Time For Students to Vote In Council Elections
====================================================

**Still Time For Students to Enrol and Vote In Council Elections**

The NZ Union of Students’ Associations is urging tertiary students around the country to exercise their right to vote in the 2013 Local Government elections.

To back this call to action NZUSA is promoting a brief video with the message ‘Make Your Vote Count’ on their website at http://students.org.nz/local-elections

In launching the mini-campaign today, NZUSA President Pete Hodkinson said one of the aims is to ensure all eligible voters get the message that it’s not too late to enrol to vote and to obtain voting papers from local councils.

NZUSA has also published a set of resource links to better direct first-time voters on where to go for information about candidates and about issues-based initiatives such as the Generation Zero campaign at generationzero.org.nz/localelections

“As we say in our video the local council elections are not just a reason to find out if you’re enrolled to vote. It’s time to decide to vote, and a time to decide who deserves your vote,” said Hodkinson.
