Students to rally in run-up to VSM Bill
=======================================

[![NZUSA - New Zealand Union of Students' Associations](https://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1511/new_nzusa_logo_green.small.png)](http://www.students.org.nz) **Sunday, 25 September 2011, 4:18 pm**  
**Press Release: [NZUSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZUSA)**

  
**Students to rally in run-up to VSM Bill**  
  
Students around the country will be rallying on Monday against education cuts and threats to their independent voice in the lead up to the Third Reading of ACT’s Bill to end universal membership of students’ associations on Wednesday September 28.

“Students are growing increasingly frustrated and appalled that the Government is ignoring their voices on these issues. National is supporting ACT’s extreme Bill which will undermine independent representation on campus and put important student services at risk, and the Government’s new draft directions on Student Services Levies could shut down many aspects of student life – creating a double whammy for students next year,” says NZUSA Co-President David Do.

Tomorrow’s actions are as follows:  
• Auckland University rally in the Quad, Student Union Complex, 1pm  
• Otago University rally, Union Lawn, 12pm  
• Waikato University silent protest, Village Green, 11-1pm  
These events continue many activities by students at Auckland, Wellington, Lincoln, and Dunedin campuses over the past few months regarding ACT’s Bill.

“Voluntary student membership is one of the biggest threats to a strong independent student voice for many years. It will splinter and undermine the collective voice and contribution of students to the tertiary community. National still has an opportunity to drop its support for this extreme and inflexible Bill and instead work with students on fairer alternatives for improving student services and representation, rather than gutting them,” says NZUSA Co-President Max Hardy.

“Continued underfunding to the tertiary sector has got worse, putting more pressure on institutions to raise their tuition fees when New Zealand already has the 7th highest fees in the OECD. Student debt continues to rise and will hit a whopping $12 billion this year – this affects graduates, families and the professions, with workforce shortages experienced in sectors with high student debt,” says Hardy.

“NZUSA supports students getting involved, having their say, and standing up for their education. These events will help ensure students are aware of the key issues in the run up to the general election campaign – the quality of their education and the institution they are in, and the ability to have an independent voice on campus,” says Do.

“With the general election coming up soon, students will be looking for leadership on the issues that affect them and New Zealand. We need bold policies to invest in education, tackle student debt, ensure access for all, and value students’ voices,” concludes Do.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
