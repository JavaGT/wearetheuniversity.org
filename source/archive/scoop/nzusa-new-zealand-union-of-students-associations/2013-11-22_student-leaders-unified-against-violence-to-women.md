**Student Leaders Unified Against Violence to Women**

Male student presidents at campuses around New Zealand have joined in taking the White Ribbon Day Pledge to never commit, condone or remain silent about violence towards women.

Pete Hodkinson, President of the NZ Union of Students’ Associations and also a White Ribbon Day Ambassador, has joined with fellow presidents Francisco Hernandez (Otago – OUSA), Dan Haines (Auckland – AUSA), Richard Williams (Waiariki – WITSA) and Kent Lloyd (Lincoln – LUSA), in taking The Pledge at [whiteribbon.org.nz/act/the-pledge/](http://whiteribbon.org.nz/act/the-pledge/)

“We are taking The Pledge as a personal commitment to driving change and because violence hurts everyone,” says Hodkinson.

“This is my second year of involvement in the campaign and it’s great this year to see growing support from around the country. The only way things are going to change is by standing and acting together”.

Francisco Hernandez of Otago University Students’ Association agrees. “Allied to taking The Pledge we support every measure that can be taken to support women to study in a safe, fear-free, violence-free environment. We urge all male students to speak up whenever they know that violence is occurring and to take a stand”, says Hernandez.

Daniel Haines of Auckland University Students’ Association encourages students to use the end of year break as a time to reflect on any violent behaviour witnessed throughout 2013. “We need to walk into the 2014 year with the intention to make the places we work and study as safe as possible for women and to speak out against acts of violence”.

Richard Williams of Waiariki Institute of Technology Students’ Association says that it’s important for men to be a part of the solution, not the problem. “It’s not right to put women down, nor is it right to condone any act of violence by remaining silent when it happens, that’s why we’re taking The Pledge.”

Kent Lloyd of Lincoln University Students’ Association says the first thing men can do towards stopping physical and non-physical violence towards women is to understand what it is and the harmful impact it has. “Violence has a huge impact on women that no one should underestimate,” says Lloyd.

White Ribbon is an international campaign that asks men to show they won’t tolerate or remain silent about violence towards women and is now part of the United Nations annual calendar. In New Zealand the Families Commission took a leadership role for the campaign in 2006.
