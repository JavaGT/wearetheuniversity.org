Consumer justice an issue for students too

**Consumer justice an issue for students too**

The occasion of today’s World Consumers Day (15 March) is a timely reminder that basic consumer rights also apply to tertiary students, says the NZ Union of Students’ Associations.

“Tertiary students are one of the largest single consumer groups in New Zealand and they deserve the fullest possible protection against consumer exploitation,” says Pete Hodkinson, NZUSA President.

“Consumer exploitation takes many forms - from relentless fee rises, through to outrageously high rents for flats, through to rising public transport costs as being challenged in a campaign for fairer fares by students at Victoria University.

“Equally serious pitfalls for students as consumers are the ways that university and polytechnics market themselves and the lack of a source of comparative, consumer-based information as available to students in the UK, for instance, via the university.which.co.uk website,” says Hodkinson.

“As a first principle we believe consumer protection begins with consumer representation, which in the case of user-pays tertiary education can only be achieved through the student voice.

“One of the societal and economic themes I have been repeatedly returning to as NZUSA President is the dual status of students as both consumers and citizens.

“Having just completed a nationwide tour of campuses to promote citizenship issues, in conjunction with the Constitutional Advisory Panel and Commission for Financial Literacy, I have to say that we have a long way to go in raising awareness amongst young New Zealanders of their rights as citizens.  
“Equally a lot more effort is required to responsibly raise student awareness about their position as consumers, their right to be informed, and their right to not only be presented with choices, but to have the opportunity to make choices as educated consumers.

“Consumers around the world are being urged today to expose the very real damage caused by poor or non-existent consumer protection. As stated by Consumers International consumer protection is always part of the solution – whether the problem is faulty products, service providers ignoring complaints, or irresponsible lending. Students are not alone”.

Note: On 15 March 1962, President John F Kennedy gave an address to the US congress in which he formally addressed the issue of consumer rights. He was the first world leader to do so, and the consumer movement now marks 15 March every year as a means of raising global awareness about consumer rights.
