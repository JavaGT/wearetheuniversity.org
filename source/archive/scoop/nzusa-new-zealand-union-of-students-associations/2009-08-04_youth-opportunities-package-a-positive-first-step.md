Government’s youth opportunities package a positive first step

Student leaders are welcoming the Youth Opportunities scheme unveiled by Prime Minister John Key in Christchurch yesterday, but remain concerned over the direction of the Government’s wider support policy for those already engaged in higher education.

“We welcome the Youth Opportunities package and are especially pleased with moves to bring forward the implementation of the Youth Guarantee Scheme and the creation of employment opportunities in the community at a time when young people across New Zealand are feeling the harsh effects of the recession” said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.

“Extra funding for new places in the Institutes of Technology and Polytechnic sector are very welcome and needed, and particularly timely,” said Blair. “This sector is already stretched to capacity, and with rapidly rising youth unemployment we will likely see further increases in young people looking to enrol. Opening up access will be welcomed by learners and ITPs alike,” added King.

“We are also encouraged by the decision to provide ‘fee-free’ courses to students under 18 wishing to undertake study at ITPs and Wananga, though the Government’s new package worryingly contains nothing for those already in education, and we’re calling for this affordability to be extended to everyone wishing to retrain and upskill,” said King.

“We are however very concerned at the proposed removal of the Independent Youth Benefit, particularly during a recession, and NZUSA urges the Government to reconsider this allowance that provides a vital life line to a small but very vulnerable group of young people,” concluded King.

National’s Youth Opportunities scheme clearly shows an interest and commitment in addressing the growing issues around youth education and unemployment. NZUSA is now calling on the Government to broaden its scope to ensure others aren’t left to fall through the cracks too.
