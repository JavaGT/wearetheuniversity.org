**National forum aims to lift Pasifika student achievement**  
  
Pasifika tertiary students from around the country are meeting in Hamilton this week to discuss ways to raise achievement levels amongst their peers

NZUSA, in conjunction with the Waikato University Pacific Island Students' Association and Waikato Students’ Union, is hosting the ‘National Tertiary Pacific Islands Convention’ held at Waikato University between Tuesday the 6th and Friday the 9th. Over 100 students representing both universities and polytechnics will be attending.

The convention aims to highlight the importance of institutional support in ensuring academic success, in particular developing and implementing tailored policies, activities and services within tertiary institutions. Groups will discuss a number of key questions such as how the current tertiary environment impacts on Pasifika student achievement levels.

“The government’s Tertiary Education Strategy clearly signals that tertiary institutions need to focus on ensuring Pasifika students progress and achieve at higher levels of study. This will involve working with Pacific community groups and improving pastoral and academic support, learning environments, and pathways into tertiary education,” says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.

“Pasifika students and their students’ associations are keen to work with their institutions and the government on ensuring quality and success for all. This week’s convention will focus on providing answers to these challenges and opportunities,” concludes Delaney.

ENDS
