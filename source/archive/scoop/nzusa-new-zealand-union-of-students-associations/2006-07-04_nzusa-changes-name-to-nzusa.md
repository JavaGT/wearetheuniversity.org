NZUSA Changes Name to NZUSA
===========================

NZUSA Changes Name to NZUSA

The New Zealand University Students' Association will now be known as the New Zealand Union of Students' Associations after its mid-year conference agreed to the name change.

"The name has changed but the acronym and the goals will stay the same," said Joey Randall, Co-President of NZUSA.

"We have changed our name to reflect the fact that NZUSA is made up of Polytechnic and College of Education students' associations, as well as University members."

"NZUSA has a real commitment to represent the needs and aspirations of all students involved in public tertiary education in New Zealand. We want to involve other associations in our organisation and this change reflects how NZUSA is evolving."

"In a way it is back to the future as NZUSA was originally known as the New Zealand National Union of Students when we began life in 1929."

"NZUSA will stay committed to working for a better public tertiary education system. We will continue to campaign against fees, for a universal living allowance, greater public funding of tertiary education and a quality education for New Zealand students," Mr Randall concluded.
