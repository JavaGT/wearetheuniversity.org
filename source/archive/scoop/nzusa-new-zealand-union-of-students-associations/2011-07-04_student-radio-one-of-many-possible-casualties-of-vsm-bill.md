Student Radio One of Many Possible Casualties of VSM Bill
=========================================================

**Student Radio One of Many Possible Casualties of VSM Bill**

Student radio will not be the only thing silenced if Parliament continues to support an Act Party Bill that will undermine the services, facilities and vibrant campus environments that students currently use and enjoy.

Dunedin’s student-owned radio station Radio One has commenced a week of silence to protest a proposal to sell or disestablish the station in the face of the possibility of voluntary student membership (VSM), as proposed by the Act Party’s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill. The Otago University Students’ Association faces major cuts in revenue and hence its ability to maintain services, experiences, and representation for students under VSM.

Some students’ associations either own, or help fund and support, student radio stations which have become institutional traditions and make up an important and vibrant part of student life. Student radio provides students a voice on the airwaves, and is an important vehicle for the promotion of new and emerging New Zealand music.

Many who were involved in the opportunities offered through associations and student radio have gone on to highly successful careers and ventures. For example: • Current affairs presenter John Campbell started out in student radio at Radio Active at Victoria University

• News journalist Samantha Hayes has said Radio One gave her the chance to read her very first news bulletin, and it's where her career began

• Minister of Tertiary Education Steven Joyce cut his teeth in student radio at Massey University before going on to set up the very successful company Radioworks

“This Bill will undermine the voice of students as a group in society. VSM threatens the positive work made by thousands of volunteer hours, and the contribution student radio makes to community engagement on important issues, developing skills and leadership, and providing a platform for student musicians, artists and journalists,” says NZUSA Co-President David Do.

Waikato students lost their radio station Contact FM in 1998 when the Waikato Student Union, under VSM, sold its assets to try and stay afloat. Other stations such as Radio Control in Palmerston North (under MUSA) and the VBC in Wellington will also be under threat if the Bill is passed.

“The imminent threat of VSM is already causing many cuts to loom in student services and representation – cuts that otherwise wouldn’t be happening. Generations of students have enjoyed the services and opportunities provided by associations, and this shouldn’t be taken away from future students,” said Do.

“There are many ways to improve student life, representation, and services. Ripping the heart out of student culture in the name of pure ideology is not one of them. We call on National and Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce to be practical and pragmatic - drop your support for the Bill and let’s work together to ensure the best outcomes for students,” concluded Do.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
