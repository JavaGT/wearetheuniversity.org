NZ wins Gold at Student Winter Games in Italy

  
New Zealand snowboarder Natalie Good has won the women's competition in the snowboard slopestyle event at the International University Sports Federation's Winter Universiade in Trentino, Italy.

It is the seven-strong New Zealand team's first medal and the first gold medal for New Zealand in the history of the biannual event. The awards ceremony is being held overnight on the final day of the event.

Good won the event with 81.25 points. Further details and a photo are available at www.investintrentino.it/News/Snowboard-first-gold-medal-for-New-Zealand  
Good is studying a conjoint degree combining a Bachelor of Management Studies and a Bachelor of Law at the University of Waikato.  
She currently holds a Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship - awarded to students who are high academic achievers who are also achieving in the arts or sports - and in 2014 has the the opportunity to travel to Khumba Valley in Nepal next year, and work with and see first-hand the community projects Sir Edmund Hillary started.

Slopestyle is a type of winter sporting event where the goal is to perform the most difficult tricks while getting the highest amplitude off of jumps, with an emphasis on performing different types of tricks instead of doing one great trick repeatedly. Slopestyle is one of the most popular events at the Winter X Games. It will become an Olympic event, in both skiing and snowboarding forms, at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
