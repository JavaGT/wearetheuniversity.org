**International recognition of Student Volunteer Army demonstrates power of students**

Student leaders are congratulating and commending the Student Volunteer Army on its continuing efforts in Canterbury, and for the work the Army’s coordinators will do overseas.

“We congratulate Sam Johnson and Jason Pemberton on their coordination of the Army, and on being chosen to help establish a self-sufficient volunteer project made up of university students in areas hard hit by Japan’s recent massive earthquake and tsunami,” said David Do, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

The Student Volunteer Army was set up immediately following the devastating February 22 earthquake, and played a central and vital role in the clean-up efforts. Student Volunteer Army volunteers helped, among other things: remove 360,000 tonnes of silt; deliver 21,000 chemical toilets; delivered over 500,000 information pamphlets to residents; and lay sandbags alongside the banks of the Avon River due to concerns about high tides.

Students all around the country have also been remarkably willing to assist with the recovery however they can, such as raising tens of thousands of dollars and providing food to thousands of volunteers on the ground in Canterbury.

“The commendable work of the Student Volunteer Army shows that students are an important part of the community and are ready to lend a helping hand when it is needed. The fact that the Army’s work is being recognised and others are seeking to replicate it overseas shows the power of students when they come together to work for the community,” said Caitlin Dunham, NZUSA National Women’s Rights Officer.

“We are really proud of the Army organisers and all the students that helped out, and we wish Sam and Jason well in their future endeavours,” concluded Do.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
