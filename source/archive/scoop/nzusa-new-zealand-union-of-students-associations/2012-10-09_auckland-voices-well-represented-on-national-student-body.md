**Auckland voices strongly represented on national student body**

Student leaders from Unitec and the University of Auckland were elected this weekend to the national board of the NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

Shannon Pennefather, current president of the Students’ Association at Unitec (USU) and Dan Haines, president-elect at the Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) were elected to the roles of Vice-Presidents of NZUSA at NZUSA’s inaugural Congress held at Victoria University of Wellington from 5 to 8 October.

Pennefather will be serving on the board as an ITP sector council representative immediately, and Haines will take up his position as University sector representative from 1 January 2013 when he replaces current Vice-President Arena Williams, also of AUSA.

Wellington-based NZUSA President Pete Hodkinson – a former president of USU – has been re-elected to the role for a further one year term in 2013.
