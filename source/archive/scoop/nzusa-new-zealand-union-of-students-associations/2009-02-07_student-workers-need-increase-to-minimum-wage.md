Student workers need increase to minimum wage
=============================================

Student workers need increase to minimum wage

Along with thousands of other low wage workers, students will be hoping the government has heard their calls and will deliver a rise in the minimum wage when Cabinet meets on Monday.

“At a time when the cost of living is so high, and support for tertiary students is so low, a rise in the minimum wage would be a very positive and timely step for thousands of students around the country”, said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

With over ninety percent of students undertaking paid work to support themselves during study, minimum wage increases would directly benefit thousands of students and provide a useful and effective vehicle for stimulating the slowing economy.

“Low wage workers did not cause this recession yet they are the first to suffer as the going gets tough. With a rise to the minimum wage the National-led government would send a clear signal to these workers that they are valued members of our communities and that government recognises that making ends meet is hardest for those struggling with limited income and resources,” added King.

“New Zealander workers deserve reassurance that they will be able to pay their bills and continue to put food on the table. Student workers need to know they can afford to get to class each day and purchase essential books and learning resources,” said King. “Student leaders are calling on the government to acknowledge these needs and do the sensible and right thing by delivering a minimum wage increase,” concluded King.
