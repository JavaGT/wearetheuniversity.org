NZUSA commends 25 years since HLRA

**NZUSA commends 25 years since HLRA**

Students are joining others in the community Saturday(July 9) who are marking and commending 25 years since the passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act in 1986.

“Education has always been the primary focus for NZUSA. However, ‘homosexual’ law reform was also a key area of concern amongst students in the 1980s and an area of much needed social reform,” says NZUSA co-President David Do

NZUSA’s key objectives then included: working to represent the views of students on matters of concern to students, or of concern to students as members of society in general; and also functioning as a major, informed and principled pressure group with education, student welfare, and social reform (nationally and internationally) among its areas of concern.

“Tertiary students helped contribute to the energy and effort in pushing for passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act in 1986. NZUSA is proud to have been part of a progressive social  
movement towards a fairer country for everyone, including students,” says Do.

Since then, NZUSA continues to be committed to queer students and advocates for barrier-free education. Examples of NZUSA’s continuing work include:  
• supporting the first national UniQ conference in 1997\[1\]  
• supporting UniQ today through their annual national conferences and with a NZUSA National Queer Rights Officer position (NZUSA is also supporting this year’s UniQ conference being held at Waikato University this weekend)  
• supporting the Civil Union Bill and the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill in 2004  
• having policy that supports official representation of GLBTI students within students associations’ governance and management structure  
• opposing discrimination and violence on campus  
• having policy that opposes heterosexism as a form of discrimination  
“Congratulations to everyone who fought for progress in this country and for a fairer better society today,” concludes Do.

\[1\] UniQ is a network of queer students' groups at universities and polytechnics It is run by students (and staff) for students (and staff). While every group is independent from each other, UniQs all share similar goals, take part in national campaigns and meet once a year for the national UniQ conference.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
