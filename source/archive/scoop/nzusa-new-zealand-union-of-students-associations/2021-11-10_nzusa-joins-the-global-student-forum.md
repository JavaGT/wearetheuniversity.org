NZUSA Joins The Global Student Forum
====================================

[![NZUSA - New Zealand Union of Students' Associations](https://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1511/new_nzusa_logo_green.small.png)](http://www.students.org.nz) **Wednesday, 10 November 2021, 3:02 pm**  
**Press Release: [NZUSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZUSA)**

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has joined the Global Student Forum (GSF).

NZUSA joins 198 student unions from 120 different countries in the GSF, the worldwide umbrella organisation of democratic, independent and representative student organisations.

The NZUSA National Education Officer, Ellen Dixon, has been selected to represent the Pacific on the GSF Steering Committee due to her knowledge and expertise in student activism at a local and global level.

“It is an honour to be nominated by NZUSA to represent the Pacific on the GSF Steering Committee, and a privilege to stand in solidarity and partnership with the global student movement” says Dixon.

“Upholding student voice and human rights is essential, especially considering the existential threats students and youth are facing from climate change, economic uncertainty, and COVID-19. I acknowledge the transformative capacity of global student initiatives for education and the wider international community” says Dixon.

NZUSA National Vice President, Liam Davies says “Ellen’s extensive knowledge and experience in student and youth activism will put her in a good position to tackle the myriad of challenges students face globally”.

“NZUSA’s membership to the GSF, and the role we play in their governance structure, could not have come at a better time. COVID-19 has caused a myriad of issues that directly impact students, and for NZUSA and Ellen to champion the voice of the Pacific in a global setting is a welcome opportunity to share experiences and work together, to find common solutions”.
