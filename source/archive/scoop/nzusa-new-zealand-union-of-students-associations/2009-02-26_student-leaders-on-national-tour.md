Student leaders on national tour

New Zealand’s student leaders are in Palmerston North this week on the first leg of a month-long national tour of universities, polytechnics and institutes of technology.

“A key focus of our visits will be delivering tailored training and information to individual executives at our member students’ associations”, said Sophia Blair, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA). “The ability to be on campus and participate in local events, campaigns and meetings is an excellent opportunity to gain insight to the specific needs of particular campuses and it will greatly inform the work and priorities of our national office this year,” said Blair.

Engaging with local communities, supporting the town and gown relationship, and keeping student activism relevant and alive will feature strongly in the tour as the Co-Presidents visit cities and students from Auckland to Dunedin.

“We’re really looking forward to meeting with Vice Chancellors, Chief Executives and staff unions across the country regarding common interests and issues in the tertiary sector, and in particular how we can work together to further our goals”, said Jordan King, Co-President of NZUSA. “Of particular interest to us will be issues of access, quality and student representation, as well as funding to tertiary institutions and student support,” added King.

“2009 is going to be a challenging year for New Zealand, and we see tertiary education as playing a key role in preparing to get us through the short, medium and long term,” said Blair. “We’re looking forward to constructive discussions in all centres regarding both the opportunities for the tertiary sector, as well as seeking solutions to the many difficulties we face too,” concluded King.

The Co-Presidents are joined on the national tour by Jacqualene Poutu, Tumuaki of Te Mana Akonga, the parallel national representative body for Maori students.

NZUSA is a federation of seventeen students’ associations representing the common and collective interests of tertiary students nationwide. Formed in 1929, NZUSA celebrates its’ 80th anniversary this year as the national representative voice for tertiary students.
