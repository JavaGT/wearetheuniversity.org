Students to make $15 Billion warning
====================================

**Students to make $15 Billion warning**

13 December 2015

New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations

Student leaders from across Wellington today will hold a silent protest as student debt sets to reach $15 billion in February.

15 students will stand in front of the Hunter Building at Victoria University with 15 balls and chains symbolising the $15 billion debt mountain. Each ball will feature the size of their individual debt. More student leaders will be in attendance.

Student leaders are fed up with the Government putting its head in the sand over the mounting student debt. They say if the Government can front up on climate change, it can finally face up to the growing debt.

Since John Key came to power student debt has grown from $10 billion, or by 50 per cent by February.

**Where: Hunter Building lawn, Gate 1, Victoria University of Wellington**  
**Who: 30 student leaders representing 400,000 students across New Zealand**  
**When: 3.30pm Sunday 13 December**

**ENDS**
