Students Enthusiastic Supporters of Keep Our Assets Campaign

**Students Enthusiastic Supporters of Keep Our Assets Campaign**

This morning saw the official launch the Citizen’s Initiated Referendum campaign against the sale of state assets. The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is an active member of the campaign steering group.

“We know that lots of students are opposed to the sale of the state assets. We believe that they have a right to express their views,” says Arena Williams, Vice-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.

“We want to give students a chance to get politically involved in an issue where a decision is being made now, but the consequences of which it is our generation who going to have to live with.,” said Ms Williams.

NZUSA is concerned with falling levels of political participation by young people, most noticeably in the 2011 election, and sees this campaign as a way of re-connecting young people with political processes.

“With voting participation amongst young people at an all-time low, we are promoting this as an opportunity for young people to get active and express their views on this issue as a way of overcoming youth disengagement in the political process,” she says.

“While already politically engaged students are likely to be at the fore-front of the campaign, at least in its early stages, we see the conversations that take place around the collecting of students as vitally important in connecting other students with political processes and political activity.”

“We are gaining a great deal from working with the other groups who are involved in the Keep Our Assets campaign. ‘KOA’ means happiness and it is a joy to be able to work with them, and share our common concerns, but also to be able to work together to bring the opportunity to be involved in political activity to students.”

_NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929._
