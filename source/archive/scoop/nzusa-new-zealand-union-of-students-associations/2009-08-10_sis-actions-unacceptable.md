SIS Actions Unacceptable
========================

SIS Actions Unacceptable

Student leaders are very concerned today at news that the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service (SIS) has been spying on University Academics who, as part of their work and research, are critical of the direction of New Zealand’s economic & trade policies.

“Students and academic staff have a right under the Education Act to, within the law, challenge orthodoxy and put forward dissenting views and opinions even if they are controversial or unpopular. Academic Institutions themselves have a statutory duty to act as a ‘critic and conscience’ of society. It is unacceptable that the SIS may be monitoring Academic Staff who pose no security risk but are instead making an important contribution to society through fostering informed debate on important issues” Said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.

“Student leaders are particularly outraged at reports that academic staff - such as University of Auckland Professor of Law Jane Kelsey – have been spied on by the SIS for voicing well researched views for the purpose of enhancing public debate. Academics like Jane Kelsey pose absolutely no threat to New Zealand’s security, and should not be spied on for simply doing their job well.” said King.

“NZUSA supports calls made by the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) for a commission of inquiry into the activities of the SIS relating to academic staff, and students. Academic staff, students, and the public have a right to accountability from the SIS and need assurance that the agency is acting within the law and not targeting those who are simply wishing to make a contribution to public debate.” concluded King
