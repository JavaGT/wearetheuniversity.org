Rising Student Interest In Council Elections

**Rising Student Interest In Council Elections**

Students’ associations at university and polytechnic campuses around New Zealand are doing their bit to increase student interest in this year’s local government elections.

Pete Hodkinson, president of the NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) says there is noticeable rise in activity around the country aimed at encouraging all eligible voters to have their say about who will be elected for the next three years.

Kylie Jefferies, president of the Association of Students at UCOL in Palmerston North says her association has been actively promoting the elections and providing a platform for candidates to make their positions on various issues known to students.

“Here at AS@U we think that it is vitally important for students to take part in local body elections so that they can be supported by the community that they reside in. The more aware that local government is about what students need to continue living and thriving in the community the better the place will be for future students and their families”.

Francisco Hernandez at the Otago University Students’ Association agrees that it's vital for students to vote on issues that will affect them.

“Local issues affect students. Alcohol policy. Housing policy. Public transport. Rubbish and recycling collection. Student discounts for council amenities. When you think about it the list goes on.

“Local councillors will listen. At OUSA we've pushed for and secured a memorandum of understanding with the Dunedin City Council, we've pushed for and secured tertiary student discounts for 2014 with the Otago Regional Council, we've pushed for and secured a commitment from the Dunedin City Council to upgrade housing stock via minimum standards and we've pushed against and stopped a proposed Dunedin North Liquor Ban which had support from the University of Otago".
