NZUSA elects student leaders for 2009

The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations (NZUSA) has elected its national officers for 2009. Sophia Blair and Jordan King will be the Co-Presidents of NZUSA.

"2009 represents the 80th anniversary of NZUSA and is an important time to reflect on the importance and relevance of the student union movement in the fight for a fair and equitable education system" said Sophia Blair, Co-President of NZUSA.

Sophia was the Education Vice President at Auckland University Students' Association (AUSA) last year and currently half way through an honours degree in political studies.

"New Zealand still has a highly inequitable tertiary education system - fees are massively high and students are still the only group in society forced to borrow to live. I look forward to an active dialogue with the new government in working towards a quality and affordable debt free tertiary education system," said Jordan King, Co-President of NZUSA.

Jordan was the Rep Groups and Logistics co-coordinator for NZUSA last year and studying towards a degree in sociology and media studies. He is a current member of Victoria University council.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
