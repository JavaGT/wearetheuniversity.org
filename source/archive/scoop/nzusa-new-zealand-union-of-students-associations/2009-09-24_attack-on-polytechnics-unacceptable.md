Attack on Polytechnics unacceptable

Attack on Polytechnics unacceptable

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is supporting the actions of students around the country as they fight against the Education (Polytechnics) Amendment Bill.

“This Bill follows quickly on the heels of under-funding, increasing competition from the private sector and cuts to Adult and Community education,” said Sophia Blair, NZUSA Co-President. “These actions represent a concerted and appalling attack on the Polytechnic sector by the National-led Government and will be met with strong opposition,” said Blair.

The Bill seeks to remove the representative model of governance from polytechnics and institutes of technology, replacing it with numerous government appointees, drastically reduced Councils less than half their current size, a Chair handpicked by the Minister of Tertiary Education, and a right for the Minister to dump Council members as she sees fit.

“Research shows that representative governance is an effective and appropriate model for tertiary institutions, encouraging quality education, participation of stakeholders and communities, responsiveness to the need of students and business, and provides a healthy distance from political interference from Government,” said Blair. “In stark contrast, this Bill proposes a complete reversal and would see direct Government intervention and control in the affairs of Polytechnics and would steal away their autonomy and independence. This is completely outrageous and will see very negative outcomes for learners,” added Blair.

NZUSA member associations are taking action on their campuses and in their communities to highlight the negative implications of the Bill. The Association of Students at UCOL (AS@U) is today running a BBQ and petition as part of its ‘Kill the Bill’ campaign at its campuses in Palmerston North, Whanganui and Masterton. Waiariki Institute of Technology Students’ Association (WITSA) are also distributing ‘Kill the Bill’ fliers as part of an awareness-raising campaign, and Otago Polytechnic Students’ Association have an ongoing campaign where the Polytechnic is advertised for sale by the Prime Minister and Minister of Tertiary Education to highlight the desperate state of Government under-funding in the sector.

NZUSA strongly condemns this Bill and encourages all interested parties to utilise the Select Committee process with a submission opposing these drastic changes.
