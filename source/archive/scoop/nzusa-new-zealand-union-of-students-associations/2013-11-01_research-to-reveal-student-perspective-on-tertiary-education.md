**Research to reveal student perspective on tertiary education**

The NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has announced steps in the final stages of its new research programme designed to strengthen the voice of tertiary students at campuses throughout New Zealand in 2014.

The research programme has seen a series of nationwide consultations conducted over the last two months and moves to establish an innovative new network of Learner Advisory Panels.

The information that is being collected will complement NZUSA’s core membership of university and polytechnic student associations who are meeting for their annual congress in Wellington next week.

The programme’s first project – titled Better Student Information – surveyed students about factors that influence the decisions they take when making study choices. Responses were collected from a representative cross-section of 385 class and course representatives.

Initial findings from the project indicate that an overwhelming number of students are not receiving sufficient trustworthy information to inform either their study or career pathways, coupled with a sense that employment outcomes are being ignored.

A full report of findings will be released this month around the same time as submissions on the draft Tertiary Education Strategy close on 15 November.

The network of Learner Advisory Panels is being set up in 10 regions. Recruiting for the panels is intended to provide access to up to 200 students who will be called on to participate in a number of online focus groups and occasional face-to-face forums throughout the academic year.

A key launchpad for NZUSA’s research programme was a report about how to implement best practice for using the student voice at tertiary institutions to improve quality. This was published in conjunction with the national centre for tertiary teaching excellence Ako Aotearoa in May and is available at [www.akoaotearoa.ac.nz](http://www.akoaotearoa.ac.nz/) and [www.students.org.nz](http://www.students.org.nz/)
