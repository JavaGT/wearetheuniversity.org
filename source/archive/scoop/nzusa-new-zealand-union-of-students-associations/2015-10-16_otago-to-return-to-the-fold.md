Otago to return to the fold

**Otago to return to the fold**

15 October 2015

Students at the University of Otago have voted overwhelmingly to stay in the national student movement by a 26-point margin in referendum that closed at 4pm today.

Students were asked whether their local association, OUSA, should ‘withdraw’ membership or ‘retain’ membership of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.

56.22% of students who voted opted to stay, while 29.99% voted to withdraw. 13.79% abstained.

Mr McCourt says the result is impressive in the face of a leading referendum question and explanation notes that were submitted by the outgoing OUSA president who publicly opposed NZUSA.

“I’m glad we can put a year of disruption behind us. The 2016 Executive have said they will vote to re-affiliate at the earliest opportunity. Clearly they have the backing of Otago students to do just that.”

“We have spent a year proving to students that when we work together we can have a clear, considered and articulate voice. I look forward to working with the OUSA team to get important issues like the miserly 7 EFTS cap on the political agenda.”

Kahlia Fryer, the Lincoln University Students’ Association President says she welcomes the decision at Otago.

“It’s important that all student voices are heard on the national stage. Getting a solid recommitment from Otago is good for Otago students, - but actually good for all students too. We are better together.” she says.

McCourt says he hopes OUSA will now re-engage with the national student movement, especially as other associations look to join.

“This result follows an equally impressive vote from Vic students last month, giving NZUSA a strong consolidated membership. Now is the time for us to take an effective and growing student movement to the next level.”

OUSA’s membership of the national body expires on 1 December. NZUSA’s Congress, which elects the president, and sets the budget and strategic direction, will occur in mid-December.
