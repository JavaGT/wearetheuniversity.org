Young Leaders to Cast Election's First Votes on November 9
==========================================================

**Young Leaders to Cast Election's First Votes on November 9**

In a bid to mobilize the youth vote this election, young leaders will cast this election's first votes when advanced voting opens on Wednesday, November 9.

Young people historically vote in lower numbers than the general population and over 100,000 young people are still not enrolled to vote – the single largest section of the eligible voting population that is not enrolled.

"This year's election coincides with the beginning of summer break. After their exams, many students move away from where they are registered to vote to travel and work in other parts of the country" says NZUSA co-president David Do.

"Advanced voting gives students the opportunity to vote when they are still settled and concentrated on campuses."

"This election's referendum on our voting system makes this vote particularly important for young people" says 24 year old Victoria University Law Lecturer Kate Stone.

"The way we elect our parliaments impacts how relevant our political system is for young people, making them more or less likely to take an interest in decisions that affect their future."

"My generation is the most diverse New Zealand has seen" says New Zealand's youngest councillor, 20 year old Bronwyn Kropp.

"I support MMP because it brings more diversity to Parliament."

"More than 400,000 voters in New Zealand are aged 18-24, enough to determine the result of the election" says Victoria University Law Society President David Smith.
