Students welcome loan limit extension

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has welcomed the Government’s announcement today that they will extend the student loan borrowing cap for long undergraduate courses.

‘This doesn’t just benefit students, but also benefits the health and wellbeing of New Zealand. Allowing our future doctors, vets and dentists to finish their studies is a no-brainer,’ says National President Jonathan Gee.

Caitlin Barlow-Groome, President of the Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA), says that this announcement is great news for her students.

‘Otago University has one of the two medical schools in the country, along with dentistry. This announcement is great for these students, especially if they’ve hit the student loan cap due to completing another degree before getting into these competitive programmes.’

Gee says that the decision is likely to result in greater equity for students wanting to enter certain health professions.

‘We have heard stories of students from disadvantaged backgrounds take a little longer to realise their dreams of entering programmes like medicine. They shouldn’t be denied their dreams simply due to an arbitrary cap.’

‘Students have been calling for this extension for some time. We’re glad the Government has heard that call and kept its election promise.’

Gee says, however, there is still more to be done to remove unfair barriers to education.

‘This Government has made a commitment to a barrier-free education. We hope that the Government continues to keep its word and remove other barriers such as restoring the postgraduate allowance, which was also an election promise.’

“Our students are anxiously waiting.’
