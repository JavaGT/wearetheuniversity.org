Students to rally against Debt Sentence
=======================================

Students to rally against Debt Sentence

17 October 2015

  
In the last ten years fees at New Zealand’s largest university, the University of Auckland, have gone up 50.82%, or by over $2,400 per student per year. In the last five years alone fees have shot up by $1,400 (or 24.64%).

Now students are being asked to bear a growing burden at a time when nearly half of full time students struggle to pay the rent, and most are giving up on aspirations of home ownership in the city they love. The future looks increasingly bleak for Generation Debt.

Student debt reaches $15 Billion in February 2016, and the University of Auckland Council intends to add to it on Monday. Students have had enough, and we’ll be rallying against our growing Debt Sentence.

  
What:

Rally to oppose ever-increasing fees and inadequate student support

Speakers:

Rory McCourt

National Student President

Paul Smith

AUSA President

Susan St John

Associate Professor – Economics – The University of Auckland

Gareth Hughes

Tertiary Education Spokesperson – Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand

David Cunliffe

Tertiary Education Spokesperson – New Zealand Labour Party

Marama Fox

Co-Leader - Maori Party

When:

1pm, Monday 19 October 2015

Where:

The Quad, University of Auckland, 32 Princes Street, Auckland

Why:

The University of Auckland will be setting fees from 4pm the same day

Note: Fees calculations based on average annual tuition and compulsory services fees across Arts, Commerce, Engineering and Science at the University of Auckland 2005-2015 and 2010-2015.
