Students will welcome accountability and transparency

**Students will welcome accountability and transparency**

Students today have welcomed government proposals to ensure institutions are more transparent and accountable about the student services levies they charge.

Currently, most tertiary institutions charge student services levies which fund the provision of non-academic services.\* These compulsory levies sit alongside tuition fees for courses. These levies are different from student association fees, which are set by students and go to the students’ association not the institution.

“Tertiary students value and use non-academic services but have been increasingly concerned with massive fee hikes at some institutions in recent years. Institutions should behave responsibly and recognise the pressures that significant levy increases can pose on students. These proposals are a welcome step in the right direction,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

“Since the issue was raised last year, NZUSA has advocated for greater transparency and student oversight. We look forward to seeing further details and submitting on these positive proposals for student service levies,” says Do.

NZUSA welcomes arrangements that would ensure students have more input on student services.

“It is essential that students have oversight over these levies. This is the best way to ensure that services are responsive to students and that levies are kept under control. Without student oversight, you have taxation without representation” says NZUSA co-President Max Hardy.

Students already have a say at some institutions. At Victoria University, the student’s association works in partnership with the University to ensure the levy is controlled and spent on services students use and value. These arrangements work well because the involvement of students’ associations.

“Unfortunately some other institutions do not have as positive an approach and are content to levy students for services they do not have a say on. Hopefully this will now change.”

“While we welcome today’s proposals the unfortunate irony is that the Government is in the process of severely undermining any independent student voice at institutions, by supporting the Act Party’s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill,” concludes Do.

_\*Non-academic services could include things such as careers services, study support, health, counselling, accommodation, crèches, financial assistance. Some institutions also charge building fees and internet access fees, as well as one-off enrolment and/or administration fees._

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
