New Zealand First And NZUSA on Same Page on Scholarships

New Zealand First And NZUSA on Same Page on Scholarships

  
New Zealand First Deputy Leader and Spokesperson for Education, Tracey Martin, congratulates the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) on its advocacy for a First in Family Scholarship programme.

“We see this as a circuit breaker for some of our young people who would otherwise not consider aiming for a degree. Once one member of a family gains tertiary qualifications they are a role model for others to follow. This policy recognises that students from families in which tertiary education is not the norm will need additional guidance and support.

“The First in Family Scholarship is already one of New Zealand First’s education policies. We would establish an expert reference group that would bring this policy to fruition through the introduction of 2000 First in Family Scholarships a year,” says Mrs Martin.

“New Zealand First has enjoyed a constructive working relationship, developed over the last three years with NZUSA.

“At a time when students are virtually under attack on all financial fronts by the National government NZUSA has remained a vital advocate for students,” says Mrs Martin.

“New Zealand First and NZUSA share the core belief that education is an investment and it is the right of all New Zealanders, whatever their age, to access tertiary education without incurring insurmountable debt.

“Congratulations to NZUSA on this initiative. A vote for New Zealand First will see it implemented,” says Mrs Martin.
