**Press Release: [NZ Union of Students' Associations](https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZ_Union_of_Students'_Associations)**

  

### Wellington Youth Service to host candidates forum on youth issues tonight

One of the last and largest meetings of candidates and the community will be hosted tonight at Wellington's Youth Service, Evolve.

Over 30 candidates for Mayor, the District Health Board and the Wellington City Council will attend the forum at Espacio (the meeting space of Evolve) at 5 Eva Street (off Dixon Street), Wellington starting at 6pm tonight.

Candidates have also been invited on a tour of Evolve starting at 5.45pm.

The format of the forum (given the large number of candidates) will be either a question and answer session with a question on youth issues posed to all candidates or a 'speed dating' format where all candidates and community members in attendance get a chance to have a conversation face-to-face. The format will be decided depending of the numbers of members of the community in attendance.

Details:

\* Where: Espacio (opposite Evolve), 5 Eva Street, Wellington.

\* When: Live music and refreshments from 6pm (formalities to start at 6.30pm, candidates tour at 5.45pm).

\* What: An opportunity for all young people and all those passionate about youth issues to meet and question candidates for the local body elections.

\* Who: Over 30 candidates have indicated that they will attend.
