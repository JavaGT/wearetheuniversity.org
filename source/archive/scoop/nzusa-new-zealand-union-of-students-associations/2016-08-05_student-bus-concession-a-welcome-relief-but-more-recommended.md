Student Bus Concession a Welcome Relief but More Recommended

Student Bus Concession a Welcome Relief but More Recommended

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations supports the decision of the Waikato Regional Council to implement a 30% discount for Waikato University students on their BUSIT fares.

NZUSA's research shows that transport is a significant barrier for students accessing their tertiary education and employment.

NZUSA is aware that this subsidy was due to a significant level of lobbying of the Waikato Students’ Union (WSU) after the introduction of paid parking at the University last year.

“This is definitely going to support students at Waikato University. However, we would expect to see this subsidy extended to support for all students in the Waikato region including those at Wintec and Te Wānanaga o Aotearoa.”

Student Association at Wintec (SAWIT) President Logan Robinson says “parking is one of the biggest issues Wintec students encounter on both the City and Rotokauri campus. This is an opportunity to show potential and current students and residents of Hamilton that the governance, amenities and institutes are willing to work together to support students to learn, develop and reside within the city. SAWIT would love to see this rolled out to include Wintec students because we think it would be hugely beneficial to resolving the issues around parking as well as the financial strain many students find themselves under.”

“We believe that all students should have equal opportunities to access education and would strongly encourage Regional Council staff and Wintec senior leadership to engage and find a solution for our students.”

Higgins acknowledged that the announcement is an important first step NZUSA, and encourages this (and all) regional councils to implement a strategy that allows for the implementation of free transport for all tertiary students in their region.

“Free public transport breaks down one of the barriers that stops students getting to their classes. If we can break down these barriers we will give students a greater opportunity to succeed at a higher level and be better prepared graduates.”
