Campaign to Fix VSM Law Begins Today

**Campaign to Fix VSM Law Begins Today**

Students around the country should be enormously disappointed at tonight’s passage of ACT’s bill to end universal membership of students’ associations. By supporting the ACT party, National have rejected a lasting balanced position on students’ associations in favour of more political ping pong.

From the 1st January there will be no way that students can ensure that there is a mandated students’ association on their campus. Institutions will be free to recognise no association at all regardless of membership figures.

“There is no choice when there is no association to join. Many students and campuses will see their associations collapse under this new system. Others will see associations dependent and beholden to tertiary institutions.” says NZUSA co-President Max Hardy.

“Tonight’s vote symbolises the real disdain this Government has for students. In reality, National has shown none of their supposed pragmatism. Instead, National has chosen to enable the extreme ideology of a discredited fringe political party. By ignoring the overwhelming opposition, arguments, and evidence, National have shown their real colours,” says NZUSA Co-President David Do.

“There has been no outcry from students for this Bill. There have been no pro-VSM rallies. Support has only been strongly concentrated in the ACT and National parties, not amongst the student population,” says Do.

“Thousands of perspectives were raised against the Bill - not just from students, but from parents, graduates, universities, polytechnics, unions, community groups, Maori, and other individuals and groups in New Zealand and overseas. Tonight’s vote ignores all these voices,” says Do.

“We have also repeatedly sought to work with National on fairer alternatives such as a Kiwisaver-style easy opt-out solution that has the support of students and several parties in Parliament. We put forward proposals which would address National’s concerns, protect independent representation, and improve the current law,” says Hardy.

“Despite this, National continues to reward an ACT party that right now looks dopey, discredited, and in disarray,” says Do.

“This legislation is not sustainable in the long-term. Opposition parties are committed to repeal if there is a change in government so this vote will not stop this issue from becoming a political football again. We could have resolved this issue fairly and forever if National had adopted a balanced alternative to ACT’s extreme Bill.”

“Tonight will not be the last word on this issue,“ says Do.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
