### Government Should Secure Better Future with Budget

Students are looking towards the government’s Budget to see if there will be constructive action tackling the real issues facing students, tertiary education, and New Zealand.

“Students are clear in demanding a better future and the areas we need to address. The government has a real opportunity to show its commitment to invest in education, ensure fair access, and tackle student debt,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

“All New Zealanders deserve the opportunity to access the education that’s right for them. We get closer to the society we want and need by investing in quality education. To make this future a reality we need to support students while they’re studying, keep their independent voice, and not penalise our graduates with a huge student debt,” says Do.

“We should be investing in the people who will carry us into a socially and economically successful future, but diminishing government funding is putting the quality of education at risk. This budget needs to show that the government has shifted its focus in tertiary education from short-sighted cost cutting to real investment in our future prosperity. In this Budget, the government should prioritise investment in tertiary education,” says NZUSA co-President Max Hardy.

“The government’s previous two budgets have slammed the doors on thousands of potential students. It is incredibly short-sighted to be kicking people out of education when we have high unemployment and a high proportion of school leavers wanting further education. We could be investing in our future – but current policy is capping our potential. The Budget tomorrow should ensure that capable and willing New Zealanders have access to tertiary education,” says Hardy.

There is also widespread concern about rising government and household debt. Student debt, which is $11 billion and rising, also needs to be tackled.

“The debt New Zealanders are forced to take on for their education will negatively affect important life decisions like having a family or buying a house; it even sends some offshore for good. The government needs to address the drivers of debt – high fees and limited access to living allowances, and fix the unfair loan repayment rules to free a generation from the burden of student debt,” concludes Do.

“Tomorrow will show whether the government actually values education and the positive impact this can have on citizens and the economy. Students will be looking at the Budget to see if the government has the vision and policies that will bring New Zealand a better future through education,” concludes Hardy.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
