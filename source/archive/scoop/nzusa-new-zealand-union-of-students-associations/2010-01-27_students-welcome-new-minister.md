Students welcome new Minister for Tertiary Education

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) welcomes the  
appointment of Steven Joyce as the new Minister for Tertiary Education today and looks forward to working with him productively to maintain quality and access to tertiary education for all New Zealanders.

“We are pleased to see the Government continuing to place high priority on the tertiary education portfolio with Mr Joyce’s appointment,” says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.

NZUSA looks forward to building a cordial and positive working relationship with Minister Joyce.

“We hope he can use his business background to find innovative solutions to the current challenges of the tertiary sector rather than relying on blunt funding cuts,” NZUSA co-President David Do.

“We want to work closely with the Government and the tertiary sector to ensure that higher education is relevant and responsive to students,” concludes Do.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
