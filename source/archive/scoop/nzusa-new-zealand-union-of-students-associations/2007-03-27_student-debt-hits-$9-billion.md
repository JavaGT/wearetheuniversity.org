Student debt hits $9 billion

Student debt hits $9 billion

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is marking student debt hitting 9 billion dollars tomorrow.

“Students around the country will be marking another significant milestone of debt.” said Joey Randall, Co-President of NZUSA.

“While interest free took the sting out of debt it did nothing to address the drivers of debt. Fee increases have become inevitable and under Labour access to any form of student allowance has dropped to around 30% of eligible students.”

Living costs currently make up around 40% of student loans above 10,000 dollars and the average fees are around $4,000 a year.

“Students call upon the Government to immediately introduce a living allowance for all students and finally tackle the drivers of debt.”
