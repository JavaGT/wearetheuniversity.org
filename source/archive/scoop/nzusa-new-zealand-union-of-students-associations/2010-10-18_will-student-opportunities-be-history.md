Will student opportunities be history?

**Will student opportunities be history?**

Students’ associations have been working hard for students for over a hundred years and are reminding MPs this week to vote down an Act Party Bill that will undermine the services, facilities and vibrant campus environments that students use and enjoy.

“Students associations have made significant contributions to campus life and to wider New Zealand society over many decades. They have helped out struggling students, provided important social and networking opportunities, and have funded dozens of sporting and cultural clubs,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

“These opportunities and the supportive learning environment that associations foster are key in fostering vibrant and productive campuses alongside a quality education for New Zealanders,” said Do.

“Associations also function as an incubator for success. Many who were involved in the representation, media, sporting and social opportunities offered through associations having gone on to highly successful careers and ventures in the business, sporting, political and entertainment worlds,” says Pene Delaney, NZUSA Co-President.

“Labour’s Grant Robertson, National’s Paula Bennett, National’s Hekia Parata, and United Future’s Peter Dunne are all past Presidents of students’ associations. Champion rower Mahe Drysdale began his rowing career with university sport, and even our own Minister of Tertiary Education cut his teeth in student radio at Massey University before going on to set up the very successful company Radioworks,” said Delaney.

“Students’ associations have also achieved many wins for students over the years, such as the introduction of interest-free student loans after years of lobbying and research, successfully advocating for enhanced student support, and providing effective student representation throughout local and national levels,” says Delaney.

“Generations of students have enjoyed the services and opportunities provided by associations, and this shouldn’t be taken away from future students,” says Do.

“We urge National MPs to move beyond pure ideology and listen to the 98% of submissions against this Bill. We urge National to vote down the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill when it comes before the House for its Second Reading this Wednesday 20 October,” concludes Do

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
