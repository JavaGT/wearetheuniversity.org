Students vow to protect student services

Student leaders are reminding Members of Parliament of the flexibility and choice regarding membership of students’ associations already enshrined in legislation, as Roger Douglas’ Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill comes up for its’ First Reading today.

“This Bill is primarily about student choice and freedom of association – two principles already supported and protected in law,” said Sophia Blair, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA). “When the current law is flexible and inclusive, allowing for a variety of forms of membership, and when the majority of students are happy with the status quo, we do question the need for this Bill at all, and therefore recommend Members of Parliament vote it down today,” added Blair.

“Students’ associations provide essential independent advocacy and support for students, academic and welfare services, coordinate countless sporting and cultural clubs and organise annual social events such as Orientation,” said Blair. “Particularly during a recession students, like many low income earners, are really struggling and we see increased use of the services and facilities provided by students’ associations,” added Blair.

“This Bill would lower the education and welfare standards and opportunities of students by removing the very mechanism that exists to provide these, and tertiary campuses and students around the country would suffer,” said Blair.

“New Zealand’s current legislation already provides for genuine student choice, and consecutive National MPs and tertiary spokespeople have consistently reinforced this point,” said Blair. “This debate was settled in the 1990s when student said ‘no thanks’ to a similar proposal. The current law works well and the system is working. Does Roger Douglas want to trample over all of that and decide for himself what’s best for students?” said Blair.

“There really are much bigger issues facing the tertiary sector that Parliament would do well to focus on. Students deserve to retain the quality advocacy and representation that students’ associations provide, and NZUSA will fight any affront to students’ rights,” concluded Blair.
