Suggestion to Drop Loan Repayment Threshold Beyond the Pale

**Suggestion the Loan Repayment Threshold Should Drop “Goes Beyond the Pale” – NZUSA.**

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is alarmed at the suggestion that the threshold for loan repayments might decrease, as suggested yesterday by Tertiary Education Minister Stephen Joyce.

The loan repayment threshold is just $19,084. NZUSA has been calling for it to increase to the average wage, as in Australia, or 150% of the poverty level, as is proposed in a United States bill currently before the US House of Representatives.

“Increasing the repayment rates at all amounts to an effective tax increase for graduates. Some might be able to afford this, in which case they could make voluntary repayments to reduce their loans, but for many they simply have no spare money and to have extra deducted from their wage packets will be an impossible burden. The proposal goes beyond the pale,” said Pete Hodkinson, President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.

“This is especially true for those near the current threshold, and to impose extra obligations on people earning only $19,084 per year, or even less, is simply cruel.”

“According to research by Susan St John from the Child Poverty Action Group, the impact of the failure to index the loan repayment thresholds is already having a dramatic effect on the Effective Marginal Tax Rates of the lowest paid and most vulnerable New Zealanders.”

“A parent on the Domestic Purposes Benefit, with a student loan, now has to pay back that loan from the $100 a week she earns from a part-time job. Her effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) is 59.5%. If she earns $200 per week then her DPB starts to get cut, and including the loan repayment she has an EMTR of 99.5%. Who would work under those conditions, and how’s she meant to make the transition off a benefit as intended by the government’s welfare reforms?” said Hodkinson.

“There may be some graduates who could repay their loans faster, and perhaps the government should focus on them, but for those who can’t pay can’t be forced to pay, it will simply cause other social problems.”
