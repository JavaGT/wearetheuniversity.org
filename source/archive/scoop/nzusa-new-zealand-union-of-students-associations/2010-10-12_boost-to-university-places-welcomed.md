Boost to university places welcomed
===================================

**Boost to university places welcomed**

Students welcome today’s announcement of an extra 3,000 more university student places over the next two years as a useful boost for tertiary funding and are pleased the Government has heard the calls of student representatives and the sector about the negative impacts of underfunding. Students look forward to further Government initiatives to overcome fundamental constraints in the tertiary sector.

“Putting more funds into the university sector to support increased demand is a very positive step. It shows the government realises that the tertiary sector needs more funding to maintain quality and retain access,” says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.

“This is a good step in beginning to meet the high demand from students needing to access higher education. While many students have been turned away this year as institutions clamp down on entry, hopefully more students will be able to get into study and get ahead in future years,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

“Investing properly into tertiary education is one of the best ways to help meet the government’s goal of ‘closing the gap with Australia.’ We look forward to engaging with the government on further positive steps around proper investment into funding quality education.” concludes Delaney.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
