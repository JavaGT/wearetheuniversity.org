UK Conservatives Move to Strengthen Students’ Associations

**UK Conservatives Move to Strengthen Students’ Associations**

Students in New Zealand are hoping the Government will look overseas for inspiration in the way it ensures students are well-served and represented at their institutions.

The UK Conservative Government has recently announced proposals for major reform of their tertiary education system. The role of students’ associations in ensuring quality education and responsive institutions, and being an independent advocate for students were specifically mentioned in the government’s White Paper on Tertiary Education:

_“Students’ unions are an important part of the civil society within higher education institutions. Effective students’ unions are prime examples of organisations run for and by their members. They can help greatly in improving dialogue and facilitating stronger partnerships between higher education institutions and their students…. Students’ unions also play an important role in the pastoral care of students…These roles will become more important in the future.”_

Conservative Minister for Universities David Willetts has also praised the contribution of students associations in a recent speech:

_“Students’ unions are playing their part in their local communities…To local schools, hospitals, charities, friendly societies, I would add student unions….We value student unions. We salute them and what they achieve for and on behalf of students. Without them, universities would be much poorer institutions, as would the employers, causes and political parties who take on their alumni.”_

“It is great to see Britain’s Conservative government affirming the importance and value of students’ associations. Many of the sentiments expressed are applicable to the New Zealand context too,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

“Students’ associations work hard to serve students and improve education. Currently many are providing or preparing their reorientation weeks for students entering the second half of the year. We always look for ways to improve student services, representation, and experiences on campus, and we work with institutions constantly on this,” says NZUSA co-President Max Hardy.

“It is ironic that while the Conservative Party in the UK is seeking to strengthen the role of student associations, Act and National are trying to destroy them here with voluntary membership. In light of the UK experience, we call on National to drop its support for ACT’s destructive and unnecessary Bill. Let’s work together to ensure the best outcomes for students,” concludes Hardy.
