Media Release: NZ Student Associations alive and kicking!**

A gathering of student association representatives from universities and polytechnics around New Zealand will take place in Wellington next week, in a demonstration of their continued vibrancy and strength in the face of anti-student legislation passed in 2011.

Under the umbrella of the NZ Union of Students’ Assocations (NZUSA) more than 40 representatives from Auckland, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Canterbury and Dunedin will meet for the NZUSA’s inaugural Congress across four days from Friday 5 October to Monday 8 October.

“This is an occasion to rise above the flawed logic of those who oppose democratic student representation, and to reaffirm both the universally positive role played by students' associations and the proven value they deliver in supporting student rights and the student experience,” says NZUSA’s executive director Dr Alistair Shaw.

“It is also a chance to form a collective response to recent changes to allowances and access that have caused students disproportionate anxiety through 2012”.

“A key focus of the NZUSA Congress will be the research project that NZUSA is sponsoring – along with Ako Aotearoa, the national centre for tertiary teaching excellence – on the fundamental importance of the student voice to achieving quality tertiary education outcomes in Aotearoa New Zealand,” says Dr Shaw.

“The Student Voice project being conducted by Heathrose Research will provide a clear picture of the difference that active student engagement and student involvement makes to our tertiary education institutions, including wananga and private training establishments”.

The NZUSA Congress will be opened by Joris de Bres of the Human Rights Commission, who will speak about recent research on structural discrimination, before two days of future focused planning sessions and workshops.

The first day will begin with an inspiring presentation from Generation Zero campaigners on intergenerational 21st century topics that should compel more action from New Zealand politicians, such as climate change and public transport.

This will be followed on Saturday evening by the presentation of the 2012 NZUSA Medals under categories that include: Campus Life, Defence of Quality and Carrying the Torch.
