**Student leaders will work with Joyce to seek progress**

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) welcomes today’s reappointment of Steven Joyce as the Minister for Tertiary Education, with an expanded portfolio now including Skills and Employment. Student leaders look forward to working with him to ensure tertiary education is both relevant and responsive to students.

“We have a vision of a tertiary education system that is accessible and enables all students to improve their lives and contribute to the social, cultural and economic success of our communities and society. This includes a tertiary education system based on high quality learning and teaching practices, outstanding student experiences and learning environments, and no unfair barriers to education. We hope the Minister shares our priorities on this,” said NZUSA Co-President Max Hardy.

“We want to work with the Minister constructively on areas of agreement over the next term. For example these areas include:

• ensuring prospective students get relevant and useful information about their possible education options,  
• ensuring institutions are responsive to students’ needs,  
• ensuring students’ voices are heard within the decision-making processes of institutions and government; and  
• helping increase and accelerate achievement and progress for Maori and Pasifika students.

These are areas which will benefit students and improve the overall tertiary education system,” said NZUSA Co-President David Do.

“NZUSA looks forward to continuing to maintain a constructive and positive working relationship with Minister Joyce,” concluded Do.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
