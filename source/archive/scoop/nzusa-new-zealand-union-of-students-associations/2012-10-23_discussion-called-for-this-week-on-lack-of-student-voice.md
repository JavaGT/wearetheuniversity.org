Discussion called for this week on lack of student voice

**Discussion called for this week to explore lack of student voice**

An urgent meeting is being called between the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) and Belinda Clark, the chief executive of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC), so that the student body can be more fully informed about the reasons for halting learner representation at the TEC in 2012.

“The students and learners we represent feel as if they have been lead up the garden path because of the lack of communication throughout 2012 about the position for a student voice when the TEC Board meets, and the separate axing of the TEC’s Learner Advisory Committee,” says Pete Hodkinson, NZUSA President.

“We regarded the representative for students and learners at the TEC Board table as a case of best practice governance, as did previous Boards dating back to the TEC’s establishment 10 years ago. Being left in the dark all year about what was happening to this position on the Board, before being told this month that it was being disestablished, is extremely poor practice.

“On behalf of everyone who participates in tertiary education we don’t accept that the opportunity for meaningful input has suddenly become, to use TEC Chair John Spencer’s words, ‘significantly diminished’. It’s all very well for the Board to say it will continue to consult and engage with NZUSA but it says very little about the quality of decision making that we weren’t consulted or engaged with on this decision, which we believe should be reversed,” says Hodkinson.

“We appreciate the accurate acknowledgement given to the value that learner representation, via student peak bodies, has added to the TEC’s work on an organised and structured basis. If the TEC itself was going to be disestablished we might understand a shift in direction, but given that doesn’t appear to be the case we will be seeking an assurance that this was not a decision taken because of any other external pressures or Ministerial interference.

“As things stand the leading agency for tertiary education seems to be doing a disservice to all tertiary students in New Zealand by excluding any publicly transparent opportunities for independent student feedback, interaction and helpful scrutiny. At the governance level we believe there is a real disconnect now between the decision makers and the demographic of those who themselves invest in tertiary education, and we don’t believe that this is a sensible or defensible situation, either in democratic terms or as a basis for ensuring the long-term success of the Tertiary Education Strategy.

“One of the questions we have for the TEC is this: How can you implement policy and make clear judgements about the operational implications of new policy initiatives by excluding the structured representation of the student and learner voice? What message does treating us as second class citizens and keeping us out of the picture send?”
