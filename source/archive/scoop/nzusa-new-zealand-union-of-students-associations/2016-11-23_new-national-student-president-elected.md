“Get Student Issues on the Political Agenda” - New national student president elected.

Jonathan Gee was elected the 2017 national president of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) at the association’s National Congress held at Victoria University of Wellington over the weekend.

Gee says he is excited by the challenge: “There’s a General Election next year and it’s our opportunity to get student issues high on the agenda. With all opposition parties supporting some form of free tertiary education policy, and with the Government tasking the Productivity Commission to look into new models for the tertiary sector, this is our chance to make students’ views heard loudly and clearly”.

Linsey Higgins, the 2016 NZUSA president, welcomed Gee’s Election:

“Jono will be an outstanding leader for students, he brings a strong commitment to advancing students’ interests and proved in the ‘Student Friendly Wellington’ local body campaign this year that he is great at engaging with students and has an ability to work across the political spectrum.”

Gee says his focus for the year will be on drawing attention to the reality of the student experience.

“Whether it’s pushing to improve the substandard conditions that too many students live in, to increase the amount of student allowance that students get, addressing the mental health crisis that is plaguing our tertiary institutions, or combatting sexual violence in our campuses, NZUSA will be telling the story of student life and lobbying to remove the barriers students face.”

“I hope we can work with all parties to get a better deal for students, many of whom are finding it hard to afford to stay in study.” he says.

Gee says he also looks forward to building on the extensive research expertise that NZUSA has developed, in particular in the area of giving students a say over the learning experience that they receive.

“Empowering and advancing the individual, local and national student voice is at the heart of our mission.”

Gee, 22, is a politics and public policy graduate from Victoria University of Wellington where he is the current president of the campus students’ association. His term as NZUSA president starts 1 January.

About NZUSA: NZUSA is a national peak body for students’ associations at universities, polytechnics, wānanga and private training establishments.
