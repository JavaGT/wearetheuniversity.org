NZUSA to hold Tertiary Education Election Forum

**NZUSA to hold Tertiary Education Election Forum**

Students nationwide will get a chance to grill the politicians on the issues that matter to them tomorrow afternoon.

NZUSA is holding an Election Summit on Friday that will feature representatives from the main political parties speaking about their tertiary education policies to students and potential voters. The summit will also be streamed live online and on campuses around the country, allowing students to tune in from anywhere. Questions can be asked of the parties beforehand or live on the day.

“Tertiary education is important to the future of this country. Students are concerned about the quality of their education, the amount of support they receive, the debt they graduate with, the voice they have, and the economy they will enter once they finish studying,” says NZUSA Co-President David Do.

“We are all faced with a choice this election day. We want to ensure students are informed about what is on offer from the political parties in order to use their vote wisely. We encourage students to tune in online tomorrow, or if they’re in Wellington to come and watch in person. It’s important that the political parties know what students think about these issues and have policies that address them,” says NZUSA Co-President Max Hardy.

**Details of summit sessions follow:**  
Where: St John’s in the City, ground floor room, corner of Dixon and Willis Street, Wellington.  
When: 11:50am-3:30pm
