Victoria's fee rise unjustified

Victoria's fee rise unjustified

The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations (NZUSA) condemns the move by the Victoria University to apply to the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) to increase fees in Humanities, Law, Architecture and Education for students in the second trimester this year.

"Victoria University's proposed fee increase is reckless to say the least. It essentially means that students could face a 15% increase next year as current students will be exempt to the increase." said Joey Randall, Co-President of NZUSA.

The proposed increases are on top of the 5% increases that Victoria students are already paying this year.

"Victoria's council have taken the easy road out and focused solely on students in order to increase revenue. This is a failed tactic that serves only to indebt students further and does little to address government underfunding"

"We hope the Tertiary Education Commission has more sense than the majority of the current Victoria Council and rejects their claim for a 5% fee increase as they did in 2006," concluded Randall.
