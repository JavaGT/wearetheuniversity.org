Students demand Vice Chancellors tell the truth

Students demand Vice Chancellors tell the truth

Student representatives are shocked and disappointed that the New Zealand Vice Chancellors’ Committee (NZVCC) Briefing for the Incoming Minister continues to promulgate incorrect assertions on student financial support and is referring them to the government’s own Ministry of Education reports for clarification on the real story.

“While we support the NZVCC’s commitment to quality, accessible public university education, we are however extremely concerned at their continued misrepresentation of student support data and their calls for flexibility on fees”, said Jordan King, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

“Once again the NZVCC have held threats and misinformation over the heads of struggling students for political gain. This is a lazy and highly inappropriate manner in which to deal with serious issues of under-funding facing all parts of the tertiary sector – students, staff and institutions alike,” added King.

The NZVCC Briefing for the Incoming Minister requests increased public investment in universities, but worryingly adds that in its absence a loosening of fee setting policy is an appropriate alternative.

“New Zealand students already pay very high fees and shoulder a disproportionate burden compared to other OECD countries. Private expenditure on tuition fees is 40% of all expenditure on tertiary institutions, while the OECD average is only 27%”, said King. “Of further concern is that most of this is paid by individuals with student loans and this is a direct contributor to the massive $10b of collective student loan debt. Further indebting a generation is not the answer to the NZVCC’s problems,” said King.

In response to the OECD report in 2008, documents released by the Ministry of Education clearly affirmed NZUSA’s conclusion that New Zealand is about average on student support spending, with 23% of the tertiary budget going to student support compared to the OECD average of 18%. The balance of 19% is in the form of student loans which are paid directly to tertiary institutions as a fee subsidy from government.

“Given the already high fees students face, a time of economic uncertainty, and the increasing numbers of New Zealanders returning to higher education, calls for higher fees are inappropriate and unrealistic – people just can’t afford it,” said King. “NZUSA calls on the government to reassure students and their families that fee controls will remain, and urges the NZVCC to be constructive and fair in its lobbying,” said Blair. “Education is going to be a key factor in getting us all through these difficult times and a response that encourages participation in education rather than penalises students is what is needed at this juncture..” concluded King.
