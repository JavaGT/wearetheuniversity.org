**NZ Student President Speaking To Global Summit**

New Zealand student leader Pete Hodkinson takes to the world stage this week as a speaker at the Global Student Leadership Summit being held in London from today until 21 September.

Hodkinson, the current President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA), is speaking on the topic of challenges facing international cooperation between student unions, alongside representatives from the All Africa Students Union, Asian Students Association and European Students’ Union.

Hodkinson has been leading by example through his work this year with the University of the South Pacific (USP), having taken on the position of deputy chair of the Pacific Students Association just last week when participating in a USP event in the Solomon Islands.

On Saturday (NZ time), students attending the summit will join Sir Elton John and Jude Law at a concert being staged at the Olympic Stadium to support Peace One Day’s global truce campaign.

The UK’s National Union of Students (NUS) is mobilising students up and down the UK behind the campaign. NUS have put an international call out for all students, everywhere to give the Peace One Day campaign their support.

The Global Student Leadership Summit is being hosted by NUS as part of its 90th anniversary celebrations this year. The event is being held at the University of East London and is themed around access to education, quality of education, internationalism, education for sustainable development, sustainability and peace.

After the summit, NUS will publish a report summarising key themes and agreements, a summary of the collective action planned, and an assessment of the strength of global student representation. The report is expected to include a group charter of values and aspirations, along with case studies of delegate experiences and stories.
