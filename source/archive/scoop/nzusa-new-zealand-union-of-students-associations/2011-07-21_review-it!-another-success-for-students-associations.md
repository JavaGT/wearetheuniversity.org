### **‘Review It!’ another success for students’ associations**

NZUSA is congratulating Massey University students’ associations on the launch of Review It!, a new survey designed to review courses and improve quality and student choice, developed in collaboration with Massey University.

Launched just this semester, thousands of students have already used it to rate first semester courses on the quality of the teaching, resources, workload and assessment they experienced in their papers.

“We commend this great example to drive successful student engagement. Prospective students will find this feedback useful and informative in making course choices, and the university will have a great insight into areas needing improvement,” said David Do, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

Review It! asks students to review the paper(s) they have completed and make their review(s) available to future students. Understanding how other students found course delivery and content is important in determining course choices. There are also benefits from helping the student reflect on their learning process. If a paper has problems the department can move quickly to improve things for future students. It also provides recognition of sustained delivery of excellent learning experiences.

“This project is a great example of students’ associations working in partnership with tertiary institutions to enhance quality and improve responsiveness to students. This complements other existing work students’ associations do to contribute to quality assurance - such as alternative course handbooks, similar websites such as RateMyCourse run by Unitec Students’ Union, and class representatives being part of an overall democratic representative structure under their association,” said Do.
