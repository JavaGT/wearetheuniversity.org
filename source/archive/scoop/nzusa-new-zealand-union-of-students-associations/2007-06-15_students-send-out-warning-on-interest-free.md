Students send out warning on interest free

**Press Release: [New Zealand Union of Students Associations](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Union_of_Students_Associations)**

Students send out warning

“Students are warning that National should in no way change the interest free policy on student loans should they become government in 2008” stated Josh Clark from New Zealand Union of Students Associations (NZUSA)

“With 500,000 borrowers and their families now enjoying the benefit from no longer paying off loans with interest any change would greatly impact many New Zealanders”.

“With student debt at over 9 billion and continuing to rapidly grow National should be creating policy to address this issue not undoing the positive work that has been done”.

“NZUSA is calling on National to commit to New Zealand students that they will not change the interest free policy” concluded Josh Clark Co-president of NZUSA.
