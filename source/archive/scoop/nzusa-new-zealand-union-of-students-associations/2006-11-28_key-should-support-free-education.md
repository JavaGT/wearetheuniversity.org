Key Should Support Free Education

Key Should Support Free Education

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) congratulates John Key on his promotion to leadership of the National Party.

“Mr Key has built his reputation on the fact that he came from a state house and wants to give all New Zealanders the opportunities he had,” said Conor Roberts, Co-president of NZUSA.

“We are encouraged by Mr Key’s affirmation of the positive effects of the welfare state. He is an example of what can be achieved through access to public housing and the free education he received that set him up.”

“We hope that Mr Key actually commits to giving all New Zealanders the same opportunities he had, such as the free education he received, and the promotion of his background is not simply being used as cynical political rhetoric.”

“We also congratulate Bill English on his promotion to Deputy Leader and Finance Spokesperson. NZUSA has had a good relationship with Mr English when he held the shadow education portfolio and we look forward to working with the next spokesperson,” Mr Roberts concluded.
