Students agree with ACT logic

### Students agree with ACT logic

Students are calling on the ACT party to withdraw a Bill that is widely opposed by submitters and the public, and will not lead to an enduring solution on an issue important to the stakeholders affected.

Parliament is continuing its consideration of Heather Roy’s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill in committee stage tonight. The Bill poses a major threat to student services, representation, and independent voice that students’ associations provide for tertiary students.

“The ACT Party has recently opposed the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Bill by arguing that it was overwhelmingly opposed by submitters, those directly affected by the Bill were opposed, and that it may not be an enduring solution to the issue. The same arguments also apply to the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill,” says Jacqualene Poutu, Tumuaki of Te Mana Akonga.

“The public submissions process has shown overwhelming public opposition to this Bill…As Parliamentarians, we all have an obligation to represent the views of the those who elected us, and the view throughout New Zealand… is that this Bill must be withdrawn,” \[1\]

Fact: Over 4800 submissions were received by the Education and Select Committee on this Bill, and an overwhelming 98% were against. Submitters were from students, parents, tertiary institutions, iwi, Maori, and a wide range of community groups.

“It is obvious from the divisions highlighted in this report that, should this Bill pass, it will do so with no discernible support from the New Zealand public. This includes, critically, those stakeholders directly affected by the Bill’s contents…. Without the support of these stakeholders, and others like them, an enduring solution will never be found.” \[2\]

Fact: An independent public opinion poll by UMR Insight in November 2010 showed that 77% of respondents felt that students should decide the structure of membership of their associations, compared with just 17% that believed it was the Government’s decision, and 6% who were unsure.  
The current law is also a compromise, passed by the last National Government in 1998. In its minority Select Committee report, Labour has said it will repeal the Bill if it comes back into government.

“Members of Parliament have a duty to represent the views of the people who elected them…As such, they cannot in good conscience continue to support legislation that submitter after submitter does not want passed into law.” \[3\]

“ACT should practice what they preach and apply the same logic to this Bill. An enduring solution can be found, but not through passing this unnecessary and destructive legislation. We call on this Bill to be withdrawn so that we can start working together on improving student services and representation in this country, not destroying them,” concludes NZUSA co-President David Do.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929. Te Mana Akonga is the national Maori tertiary students’ association and is a parallel organisation to NZUSA.
