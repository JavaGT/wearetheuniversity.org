Healthy Homes Bill Succeeds Where Government Bill Failed
========================================================

[![NZUSA - New Zealand Union of Students' Associations](https://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1511/new_nzusa_logo_green.small.png)](http://www.students.org.nz) **Friday, 6 May 2016, 1:45 pm**  
**Press Release: [NZUSA](https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZUSA)**

The Healthy Homes Guarantee Bill that passed its first reading yesterday will hopefully make progress to remedying the shortfall that the Residential Tenancies Bill failed to address.

NZUSA President Linsey Higgins is optimistic about the new Bill and its focus on requiring warm, dry, insulated housing.

“We believe if the government legislates for adequate ventilation, insulation and heating they will have achieved a trifecta that allows students to succeed at their studies.”

“We know that cold and mould is making it hard for students to succeed at their studies and remain free from what can be lifelong illness. Supporting students in their youth will reduce their dependency on the health system as they age.”

\"We presented countless examples to the Select Committee on the government's Bill showing that students currently live in houses that make them sick, and that the current rules do not prevent this. Extending the minimum standards to include ventilation and heating, as Andrew Little's Bill does, will dramatically improve the lives of these students."

“Students just want to live in houses that don’t make them sick. We don’t think this is too big of an ask."
