Students expect immediate action from Hodgson

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) is today welcoming the appointment of Pete Hodgson as the new Minister for Tertiary Education and Maryan Street as Associate Minister for Tertiary Education, however they warn that they’ll be kept very busy addressing the needs of students and the tertiary sector.

“After a long wait, students expect the new Minister to finally deliver on Labour’s promise of accessible and affordable education for all” said Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

“With more students taking on increasing levels of debt, and Government spending on student support actually decreasing, it’s now time for action. Students will be looking to the Minister for strong leadership and urgent progress on improving access to student allowances”, said Randall.

A recent IRD report highlighted that average borrowing of students had increased with 499,259 New Zealanders now owing a massive $9.4 billion.

“We look forward to a positive and constructive relationship with the new Minister, and wish him well in his new role”, concluded Randall.
