Government needs to quash rumours on student loan changes

Students are alarmed at speculation that the Government may be looking to reintroduce interest back onto student loans in the forthcoming budget.

Statements made in this week’s Trans Tasman political newsletter indicated that government officials had been working on changes to the interest free student loan policy

“The National Party promised before it was elected that it would not remove the existing interest free student loan policy that Labour introduced in 2005. Any move to reintroduce interest onto student loans would be a clear case of a broken election promise to students, graduates, families and communities.” said Jordan King, Co-President of The New Zealand Union of Students' Associations (NZUSA).

“Any plans to charge interest on student loans would constitute the biggest step back in tertiary education since the introduction of the student loan scheme in 1992,” said King. “Given that student debt now sits at $10 billion dollars, any move to increase the burden of debt on students at this present point would be reckless, duplicitous and regressive.” King added.

NZUSA calls on the Government to quash these rumours and provide clarity and piece of mind for students and graduates who are already facing a tough time in this recession. The Government needs to confirm, before the budget, that this rumour is simply untrue and reiterate its support for students that it guaranteed during the 2008 election campaign.
