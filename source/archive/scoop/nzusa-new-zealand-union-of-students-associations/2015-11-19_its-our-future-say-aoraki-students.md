**‘It’s our future’ say Aoraki students**

19 November 2015

Media Release: New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations

The newly announced CPIT-Aoraki polytechnic has been put on notice. Students and staff held a rally today at Aoraki’s Timaru campus to launch a community campaign around the merger taking place between the two institutions.

National student President Rory McCourt spent the day meeting with students who said they wanted their values reflected in the new institution.

Joe Smith, a first-year Art student said that at Aoraki the tutors really cared, and caring staff had to be part of the future for students in South Canterbury.

Of the tutors Joe said “They find ways to get the information into your head. Often they know what’s going on for you before you’ve said it, or even know yourself.”

Many other students said caring staff should be at the heart of the new institution. Malcolm, a mature-age carpentry student studying at Aoraki through CPIT, said that “aroha” was the most important thing, and opportunities had to exist for the next generation in the regions.

Student Ethan Jaycock, who had recently moved from nearby Temuka to Timaru, said the future is in stable and secure learning.

“Students have got to know that their courses will continue. I’ll be pretty upset if they start chopping and changing our courses. It's our future that's at stake” he said.

All students agreed that the future was in local, face-to-face provision.

Mr McCourt told the rally that the purpose of the campaign was to put the new institution on notice.

“The future won’t be decided in Christchurch. The future will be decided here, by the staff and the students and the community” he said.

“Our message to CPIT-Aoraki is simple: We’re here, we’re watching and we’re not going anywhere. If they try to cut a course here, or cut provision there, -we’ll be watching. And we won’t let them get away with it.”

Mr McCourt warned that, with the economic future of South Canterbury looking bright, it was important the new institution did not risk that opportunity with shoddy online replacement of essential courses.

“They’ve got to back local provision and local jobs. That’s the what a good future for students here looks like.”

Mr McCourt spoke at the midday rally alongside Tertiary Education Union National President Sandra Grey and TEU Branch President Carol Soal.

Carpentry students performed an impromptu haka for Ms Soal, honouring her for her advocacy for Aoraki staff and students.

This was Mr McCourt’s third visit to meet with students about the merger.
