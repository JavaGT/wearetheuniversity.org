**NZUSA Media Release – 11 December 2013**

**University of Auckland student president elected to lead NZUSA in 2014**

The nationwide membership of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations today elected Daniel Haines, 23, to be the NZUSA President for 2014.

“I am honoured to have been elected today and am excited by the prospect of increasing the amount of collective energy and unity needed to ensure the student voice in 2014 is heard loudly and clearly,” said Haines, who will take up the position from next week.

Haines is currently finishing his term as the 2013 President of the Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) having also served as Administrative Vice President at AUSA the previous year.

A politics and law student, Haines’ secondary school was St Peter’s College in Epsom, Auckland.

The NZ Union of Student’s Associations has just concluded both a special general meeting and two days of training workshops that were open to all incoming presidents of student associations from around New Zealand.

NZUSA currently has 11 members – seven from the university sector and four from institutes of technology and polytechnics.
