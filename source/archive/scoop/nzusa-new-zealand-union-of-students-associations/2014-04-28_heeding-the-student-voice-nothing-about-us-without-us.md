Heeding the Student Voice – Nothing About Us Without Us

28 April 2014

  
New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations

Today, student leaders and Polytechnic staff are attending a two-day summit in Wellington, which will investigate how listening to student voice directly enhances the quality of academic programs.

“This is the first conference organised by students with widespread participation from staff and students. This collaboration reflects the natural partnership that exists in advancing the collective goal of tertiary institutions. Better decisions are made when staff and students work together to reach the common goal of a better tertiary experience”, said New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations President, Daniel Haines.

“The conference is a continuation of the research that NZUSA and Ako Aotearoa have already conducted, investigating the importance of the student voice. Those in attendance today are the right people at their respective institutions to make a meaningful impact. This summit is goal oriented; focusing on a future framework that facilitates a strong staff-student working relationship.

“Summit participants will include the Chief Executive and a senior staff member from Student Participation for Quality Scotland (see www.sparqs.ac.uk) which is acknowledged as a world-leader in building partnerships between institutions and students to utilise the student voice to enhance quality”, said Haines.

The summit is financially supported by the Metro Group of ITPs, NZITP, Ako Aotearoa, and the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations.
