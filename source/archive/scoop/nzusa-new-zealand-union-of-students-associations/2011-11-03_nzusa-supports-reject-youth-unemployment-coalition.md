NZUSA supports ‘Reject Youth Unemployment’ coalition

NZUSA is pleased to be a founding member of the Reject Youth Unemployment coalition, to be launched this afternoon.

The aim of the coalition and campaign is to bring a community and youth voice to the issue of high youth unemployment and the lack of opportunities available for young people in New Zealand. Its purpose is to advocate for a stronger Government response to youth unemployment.

Youth unemployment for 15 to 19 year olds has skyrocketed from 17% to 27.5% in May this year. Youth unemployment is also very high for 20-24 year olds.

Tertiary students are part of this picture. NUSA’s 2010 Income and Expenditure Survey found that 65% of students were employed in regular or casual work during the academic year, significantly down from 90% in 2007, indicating that students have borne the brunt of the recent economic recession which has resulted in high unemployment rates. Graduates are also facing a difficult job market.

“Post-secondary education, whether through university, polytechnic, industry training, or other schemes, provides a valuable pathway out of youth unemployment. This level of education needs to readily accessible, relevant to youth, and of high-quality and this will require adequate levels of investment to ensure these opportunities are open to everyone,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

“Many prospective students are also finding it hard to get into work or training. It is vitally important that we improve and build on the creation of sustainable pathways for young people. For example, the polytechnic sector is particular well placed in this space and should be properly supported to enable this,” says Do.

“Young people want to achieve and contribute, but as a country we need greater investment in youth transitions between school and future pathways, investment in jobs, education and training and making a call for young people to be treated with dignity within the system,” concludes Do.

NZUSA Co-President David Do will be speaking briefly at the launch (at 12pm, at Zeal Youth Centre, 103 Ghuznee Street (above Bodega), Wellington),

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
