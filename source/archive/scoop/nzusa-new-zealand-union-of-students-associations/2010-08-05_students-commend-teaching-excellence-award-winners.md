**Students commend teaching excellence award winners**

Student leaders are sending their congratulations to the winners of the 2010 Tertiary Teaching Excellence Awards.

The 11 winners were announced last night at a parliamentary ceremony hosted by Hon Steven Joyce, the Minister for Tertiary Education. The winners come from universities and institutes of technology and polytechnics all across the country.

“Great teaching is vital to the student experience and the quality of education a student receives. It is wonderful to see teaching excellence continue to be recognised at a national level,” says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.

“It is particularly important that teachers are student-centred, teach in ways which engage students, and promote effective learning appropriate to the subject level and the background of the students. The Award winners have demonstrated sustained excellence in teaching/facilitating learning appropriate to the students,” says Delaney.

NZUSA nominates one student representative to sit on the Awards selection panel, and supports the work of Ako Aotearoa in fostering the best possible educational outcomes for all students.  
“We share Ako Aotearoa’s view that teaching and learning are two interactive parts of the whole education experience. Learning should be active and learners have rights as well as responsibilities. Teachers can improve the way they teach by interacting with active learners, encouraging student autonomy, and acknowledging the experience of the student,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

“We hope that tertiary teaching across the board continues to improve through the positive influence of these Awards, despite the current constraints in the tertiary sector,” says Do.

“Congratulations to all the winners, Ako Aotearoa, and to all those who participated in the process,” concludes Delaney.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
