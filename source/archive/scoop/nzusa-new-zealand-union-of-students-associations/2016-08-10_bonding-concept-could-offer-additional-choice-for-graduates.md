Bonding Concept Could Offer Additional Choice for Graduates

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations has welcomed Labour Party leader Andrew Little's floating of the idea of bonding graduates to public sector jobs in exchange for support with reducing their student loans.

“As with any idea, we think it is important to get the perspectives from a number of parties including those affected before making a commitment to any policy” says NZUSA President Linsey Higgins

“However, we support any ideas that address the skyrocketing levels of student debt. While we know that some graduates may not want to bond themselves, others will relish the opportunity for secure employment and decreased loan repayment times.”

“We know that a number of public service jobs are generally lower paid than the private sector and these jobs have contended with flat wages for some time. Many of these low paid public service jobs are dominated by women and any efforts to decrease repayment times would be a significant measure in creating greater levels of equality.”

“The system of bonding worked very well in the past with groups such as teachers, nurses and doctors and continues to work well for doctors who commit to working in rural areas. Some of these public sector roles are crucial to ensuring the wellbeing and success of our society such as teachers, teacher aids, nurses, care givers, social workers, doctors. We would encourage efforts to support people in these occupations in the private sector as well.”

“Bonding in exchange for student loan repayment assistance is an issue that we will be asking students about when we visit campuses over the latter half of this year.”

“We would also like to acknowledge other parties who have already made commitments to similar schemes, including New Zealand First.”

“Finally we look forward to the opportunity to explore this issue further with the Labour Party, and other parties, in order to identify the groups, and occupations, who may benefit significantly by this idea and could be addressed as a matter of priority. We naturally would also seek to incorporate the voices of students.”
