NZUSA welcomes housing “big step”

9 July 2015

New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations  
The national student union NZUSA is cautiously welcoming Building and Housing Minister Nick Smith’s announcement that landlords will be required to insulate rental properties, but says the Government must get the new law right before it will get the union’s sign off.

NZUSA President Rory McCourt says minimum standards are long overdue and requiring retrofitting of ceiling and underfloor insulation over the next four years will both improve the health of tenants and save the lives of children and chronically sick New Zealanders.

“We’re pleased that the Government has finally acknowledged the serious problem of houses that make us sick. Now the challenge will be to get the law right, making sure all rental houses have insulation, heating and a way tenants can know if it’s safe to live in.”

Mr McCourt says the union has some ideas about how the proposal can be improved.

Specifically, the union wants the standards to include a form of cost-efficient heating, such a heat pump, and for houses to be only rented out after being independently certified as not being damaging to the health of tenants.

“The Government has taken a big step and we look forward to working with them to get this law right through the select committee process.”

Mr McCourt says the adoption of NZUSA’s ideas shows the value of the national union and that progress for students can take place under a National government when students work together.
