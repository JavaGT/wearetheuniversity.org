**Tertiary Students Voice Ideas On Constitutional Change**

The Constitutional Advisory Panel has been working closely with the NZ Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) to gather views of university and polytechnic students from around the country on the big question of what it might take to change the way New Zealand is governed in the future.

The idea for the Big Questions tour was initiated by NZUSA president Pete Hodkinson who has travelled to 13 campuses over the last fortnight with intense forums scheduled at Waiariki Institute of Technology in Rotorua and the universities of Otago, Lincoln, Auckland and Victoria University of Wellington (taking place tomorrow, 8 March).

During the tour Hodkinson has held discussions with panel members Emeritus Professor John Burrows QC, Sir Tipene O’Regan, Dr Ranginui Walker, Bernice Mene, Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith and Peter Chin.

“Given the long period of engagement and time for submissions that the Panel is working to, I’m expecting the level of tertiary student interest in the issues being raised should be significant,” says Pete Hodkinson.

Questions, challenges and ideas raised at the forums have included:

• What could be changed to create a greater sense of deliberation between our populace and our elected representatives?

• What is the end goal for New Zealand after grievances settled through the Waitangi Tribunal have run their course?

• What is tino rangitiratanga in a modern context? Does it reside soley with the Iwi Leaders Forum?

• What lessons can be learnt from constitutional arrangements in place in other countries such as the Swiss Federal Council, and constructive demonstrations of ‘people power’ as seen in Iceland?

• What role could be played in the future by new forms of e-democracy and better systems of regular referenda?

• Would one way of balancing out the influence of the grey tsunami posed by baby boomer generation be to weight the voting system so that younger voters are given an “extra vote”, or to consider lowering the age when people become eligible to vote to 16 years of age (as currently proposed in the UK)?

At the event co-hosted with the Auckland University Students’ Association on Monday of this week a concern was expressed at the undermining effect on democratic discourse caused by the “demise of true public service television.

One student said he had been completely disillusioned by watching Parliamentary debates where only a quarter of MPs might speak and where all MPs had “already decided which way to vote”. Concern was voiced also at a perceived need for “more vocal” representation of New Zealand’s Pacific communities.

Given the circumstances and histories that are unique to Aotearoa New Zealand, a widely agreed caution was expressed against looking overseas for approaches to constitutional change, or, equally speaking, ignoring the “super diverse nation” that New Zealand has become and will likely continue to become within the Asia-Pacific region.
