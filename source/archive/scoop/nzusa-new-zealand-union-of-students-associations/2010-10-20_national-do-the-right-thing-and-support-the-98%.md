National – do the right thing, and support the 98%

National – do the right thing, and support the 98%

Student representatives are calling on MPs to oppose the Act Party’s Bill attacking student services and representation tomorrow evening(Wednesday) in Parliament.

“98% of the 4800+ submissions were against the Bill, and over the past few months the Select Committee heard dozens of success stories about the good work of students’ associations. Students will rightfully be expecting this Bill goes no further,” says NZUSA Co-President Pene Delaney.

The Act Party’s Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill is due for it’s second reading tomorrow night. It seeks to change the method by which students become members of their students’ association.

The current law, passed by National in 1998, already allows students choice in determining what sort of membership model they want via referenda, and also enables students to individually opt out of membership through conscientious objection and financial hardship.

The Act Party Bill is trying to replace the status quo by removing students’ choice and putting important student services, representation, and welfare at risk.

“Students haven’t asked for this Bill, the sector doesn’t want it, and experience in both Australia and New Zealand shows it has disastrous results,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

“National can do the right thing tomorrow evening by moving beyond pure ideology and listening to the 98% of submissions against this Bill. We hope MPs see sense and heed their calls to oppose this unnecessary and unworkable Bill,” concluded Do.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
