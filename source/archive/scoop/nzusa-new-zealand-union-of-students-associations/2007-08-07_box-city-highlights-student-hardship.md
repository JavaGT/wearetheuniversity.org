‘Box City’ highlights student hardship

‘Box City’ highlights student hardship

Victoria University students will be raising awareness of student hardship and highlighting the need for universal student allowances when they erect a temporary cardboard Box City in the Quad at the Kelburn Campus from midday tomorrow. The Box City is a joint initiative between the Education Action Group and the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA).

“With the current lack of Government support, and increasingly high housing and living costs, many students are really struggling to make ends meet” says Joey Randall, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA).

Numbers of students receiving an allowance have been decreasing since 2001, and currently less than a third of tertiary students receive an allowance. Thousands more are left with little choice but to rely on the student loan scheme to support themselves to live while studying, resulting in high levels of debt.

“A universal living allowance would enable to students to focus on their studies rather than where the next dollar is coming from and whether they can afford next week’s rent”, said Randall.

“The Labour Government must take action now. Back in 2005 they promised that fifty percent of students would receive an allowance. While Labour continue to procrastinate over implementing this election promise, many students are struggling to keep a roof over their heads”, said Randall.

NZUSA calls on the Government to introduce a universal living allowance for all students to address the inherent discrimination that sees students remain the only group in society who are expected to go into debt in order to meet basic living costs.
