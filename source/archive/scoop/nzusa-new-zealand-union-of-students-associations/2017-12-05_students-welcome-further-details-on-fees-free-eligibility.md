**Students Welcome Further Details on Fees-Free Eligibility**

  
The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) has welcomed today’s release of eligibility criteria for the Government’s fees-free policy.

‘We welcome the release of further details on fees-free eligibility’, says National President Jonathan Gee.

Fees such as the Compulsory Student Services Fee (CSSF) are also covered by fees-free.

‘For free tertiary education to be genuinely free, it is important that other fees outside of tuition fees are also covered by the policy. We are glad that these more hidden and unexpected costs like the CSSF are also covered.’

Those completing industry training under the fees-free policy will be eligible for 2 years, to reflect the equivalent of a fulltime year at a tertiary provider.

‘This gives real options for prospective students, and will hopefully level the playing field between trades training and university’.

Gee acknowledged the work of officials in getting the fees-free policy to this point.

‘We appreciate the work of officials in getting the policy to this point, and appreciate their responsiveness to our questions.’

Gee says that students’ associations will be keeping a close eye on the how the eligibility process plays out from here.

‘There will be some prospective students who have complex circumstances in determining their eligibility, such as new New Zealanders and adult learners. It’s important that the process from here continues to be responsive, with clear appeals processes.’
