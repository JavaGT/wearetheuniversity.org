NZ scores a Bronze at World University Games

Decathlete Brent Newdick claimed a Bronze medal at the World University Games being held in Kazan, Russia, yesterday – the New Zealand team’s first medal in the event which runs until next Wednesday 17 July.

"After an agonising three fourth placings we finally hit pay dirt tonight with a gutsy performance from Brent Newdick our decathlete in coming third behind Belgium’s Thomas van der Plaetsen and Russia's Sergey Sviridov,” said team services coordinator Evelyn Williamson.

Williamson said Newdick’s result was especially commendable considering it was his first hit out after a lengthy period off with injury, the added headache of his pole vault poles getting lost on the way to Kazan and the fact that weather delays stretched the Decathlon competition out until 11pm.

Also in the track and field Angie Smit of Rangiora ran a strong , confident 800m (2:00:03) to qualify her for the upcoming World Champs in Moscow.

A team of 37 athletes are representiung New Zealand at the 27th World University Summer Games. Competitors have been pursuing medals in aquatics, athletics, gymnastics, rowing, sambo (martial art), table tennis and weightlifting.
