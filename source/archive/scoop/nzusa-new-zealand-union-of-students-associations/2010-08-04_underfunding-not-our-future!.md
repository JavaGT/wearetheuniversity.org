Underfunding? Not our Future!

**Underfunding? Not our Future!**

Government underfunding continues to make it harder for Kiwis to get ahead.

Last night’s TV1’s Closeup programme featured several students who were affected by underfunding in the tertiary sector, including a student who was denied entry, a teaching student who is now forced to take her courses online halfway through her degree, and high schools students now uncertain about their future.

“The buck stops with the Government on this. The Government appears happy to stand by as underfunding makes it harder for Kiwis to get ahead,” says NZUSA Co-President David Do.

“We looked towards the Budget to address underfunding but its failed to do that properly, and that’s why we’re seeing those young people being turned away, and courses being cut,” says Do.

“This is affecting the very people who need education now more than ever. We saw that in that story, those are young people who want a brighter future, they want to stay here and help us all grow, but they’re being held back because the government is failing to properly invest in education,” says Do.

“Older people are also being affected by underfunding, not just the young. Some of those who were made redundant during the recession and have been job-hunting since without luck, planned to up-skill or retrain in order to improve their employment prospects. Their options are now being closed off too,” says NZUSA Co-President Pene Delaney.

“The Government talks a lot about closing the gap with Australia, but when it comes to tertiary funding we’re falling behind,” says Delaney.

For the past two budgets, the Australian Government has put in billions of extra dollars to universities, student support, and vocational training. In contrast, the past two budgets here have seen almost no increases in funding to meet demand and increase quality.

“If the Government really wants to close the gap with Australia, they need to put their money where their mouth is. Otherwise it is empty words from John Key and Steven Joyce while thousands are left out in the cold,” says Delaney.

“To copy a recent ad campaign - we all know that every cigarette is doing you damage, and every year of underfunding is doing damage to universities and polytechnics too. Underfunding is not our future,” concludes Do.

NZUSA calls on the Government to immediately increase investment into universities and polytechnics, so that New Zealanders continue to have a genuine chance to access a high quality tertiary education.

NZUSA is the national representative body for tertiary students and has been advocating on student issues since 1929.
