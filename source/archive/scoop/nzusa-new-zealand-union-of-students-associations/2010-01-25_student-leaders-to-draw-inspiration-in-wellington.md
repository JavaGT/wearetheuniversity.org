**Student leaders to draw inspiration in Wellington**

Student leaders from universities and polytechnics around the country are converging in Wellington this week for the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) January Conference.

“Students will be facing a year of challenges ahead. Difficult financial times are hurting students’ job prospects, and there is growing concern over preserving access to higher education. We are also seeing attacks on student representation from changes in polytechnic councils,” says NZUSA co-President Pene Delaney.

“This conference will equip their representatives with the skills and knowledge to face them and stand up for students,” Delaney added.

Norman Kingsbury will be a keynote speaker at the conference on Friday afternoon. Since being NZUSA vice-president in 1955, Mr Kingsbury has acquired a long and distinguished career in tertiary education and is well respected throughout the tertiary sector.

“We are honoured to have Mr Kingsbury speak to the next generation of student leaders. We are sure his journey in education will inspire our delegates in their quest to get the best for students,” says NZUSA co-President David Do.

Formed in 1929, NZUSA continues to inform and support local student associations to ensure tertiary students are properly supported in tertiary education.
