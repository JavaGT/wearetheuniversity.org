Students Launch Training Incentive Allowance Petition**

The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations is launching a nationwide petition today calling on students and the public to register their opposition to the axing of the Training Incentive Allowance by the Government in the 2009 Budget. The Petition urgently requests that the Government reinstate the allowance and highlights the beneficial effects the TIA has had on allowing those on fixed incomes to access higher education and move into the labour market over the many years it has been available.

“The Government has emphasised on numerous occasions the importance of having people access further and higher education to improve skills and create pathways into the workforce. The Training Incentive Allowance has allowed so many people to do just that, there is no reason why it should be stopped now” said Sophia Blair, Co-President of the New Zealand Union of Students’ Association.

“This cut is a giant backwards step given the current economic climate and the need to provide positive and productive educational opportunities for all New Zealanders. We don’t find this at all acceptable and call upon students and the public to sign the petition and have your voices heard” said Blair

“Instead of a focus on up skilling New Zealanders through education and into employment, the Government has adopted a ‘shut up and shut out’ policy - silencing those who have been denied access to education” concluded Blair.

The Petition will be distributed at all University, Polytechnic, and Institute of Technology campuses in New Zealand as well as to Members of Parliament and Community Organisations. For copies of the petition or for more information contact the NZUSA Federation Office on 04 498 2500
