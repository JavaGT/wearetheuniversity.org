**AUT University recognised for sustainability and energy efficiency**

AUT University has been announced as the winner in the Mega Efficiency Impact category and also received a Judges’ Commendation for the EECA Business Energy Management Award at the 2013 NZI Sustainable Business Network Awards.

Winning an award at New Zealand’s longest standing sustainability awards highlights AUT’s continued commitment to becoming a more sustainable organisation and follows the Highly Commended Carbon Reduction Award AUT received at the Australasian Green Gown Awards earlier this year.

These awards are recognition of AUT’s contribution to environmental sustainability as a university – through our research and innovation and our practices and operations as a large organisation.

AUT’s winning approach to sustainability has so far focused on transport, energy and waste. Success in these areas has been achieved by implementing initiatives such as the alternative transport programme, which incentivises staff to travel to work using public and other transport options, lighting upgrades, more efficient boilers, painting building roofs white to reduce heat gain within buildings, the introduction of worm farms, Molok bins (underground recycling bins) and ensuring that staff and students can responsibly recycle plastic, paper, cardboard, glass and cans.

The NZI Sustainable Business Network Awards are New Zealand’s most prestigious sustainability awards. They celebrate the contribution businesses and individuals are making to transforming New Zealand to a model sustainable nation. Winning at these awards acknowledges AUT as an organisation focused on making it a great place to study and work.
