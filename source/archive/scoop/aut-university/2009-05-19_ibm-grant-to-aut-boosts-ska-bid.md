IBM Grant To AUT Boosts SKA Bid

A grant of specialised hardware, software, and research time to AUT University by IBM will strengthen New Zealand’s chances of co-hosting the world’s biggest radio telescope project.

AUT leads the New Zealand arm of the Australasian Consortium striving towards a role in the international Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project, with total cost of approximately NZ$4.6 billion dollars.

IBM will provide research time as well as specialised hardware and software including IBM’s new first of a kind computing solution, System-S. This will be the first research application of this technology platform in the Southern Hemisphere, demonstrating software correlation of radio astronomical data using System S on IBM’s cell based blade platform.

The grant has been provided under IBM’s Shared University Research (SUR) Awards scheme, which aims to support research in areas of significant interest to the recipient university and IBM. IBM has also invited AUT to join its Academic Initiative, which will help AUT to access the latest technology and tools available.

Director of AUT’s Institute for Radiophysics and Space Research, Professor Sergei Gulyaev, said the IBM grant means AUT will have a greater capacity to contribute to SKA.

“This equipment and software will allow us to simulate and test the process of streaming colossal amounts of radio astronomical data with the incredible speed that SKA demands. This award will open a great opportunity for AUT staff and research students to work closely with IBM’s best researchers in the US, Australia and New Zealand. This puts AUT and the Australia – New Zealand bid in an even stronger position,” said Professor Gulyaev.

Managing Director of IBM New Zealand, Jennifer Moxon, said the company is keen to support New Zealand’s research sector.

“IBM is delighted to support a breakthrough science initiative such as this through the application of our technology and expertise. We see this as a further step in the relationship with AUT and believe that the contribution will strengthen the New Zealand bid to co-host the SKA project,” said Ms Moxon.

“As we work towards hosting SKA, we need to ensure we have the right technology and funding. IBM’s generous support is a major step in the right direction,” says Professor Gulyaev.
