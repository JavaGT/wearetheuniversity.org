Electioneers 'must target Maori and young voters'

The country's local body elections are looming and AUT University's Local Government Centre manager Nic Mason says now is the time for campaigners to address low voter turnout by Maori and young people.

She says as local body politicians embark on the 2007 campaigns they will need to work smart to connect with Maori and people aged 18-24.

\"Local government elections attract fewer and fewer voters each year, "she says. "Alarmingly, a significant number of people who don't participate in this vital democratic process are Maori and young people."

"Research carried out since the last elections suggests campaigners are not using all the tools available to reach these groups, such as the internet."

Ms Mason warns that local and national democracy will suffer if this year's elections do not capture these declining voter populations.

A Commonwealth Local Government Research Seminar being held this Monday, March 26 will address these and other issues. The event is being co-hosted by the LGC, part of AUT's Institute of Public Policy.

The seminar is an academic forum where researchers submit findings from across the Commonwealth.

Speakers from South Africa, India, Cameroon, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom will present at sessions on democracy, equity, governance and the future. They will cover topics on democratic decentralisation, local government gender representation and service delivery.

Christine Cheyne from Massey University will present: 'Local political participation: enhancing voter turnout among Maori and young people'.

She will discuss how Maori and young voters have become alienated from the local government campaigning and suggest solutions such as early targeting school-aged children via the curriculum.

The event is a lead up to the Commonwealth Local Government Conference 2007 in Auckland next week.

The LGC was set up in 2006 as a 'think tank' committed to research, teaching and consultancy in the areas of local government and governance. The centre draws together academics from throughout New Zealand.

The Institute of Public Policy is a research and development centre at AUT University. It provides independent research and advice on economic and social development in New Zealand and comparative countries.

Commonwealth Local Government Research Seminar: 9am - 3pm, Monday, March 26 AUT Wellesley Conference Centre (WA224B) AUT University

Attendance is free and open to the public
