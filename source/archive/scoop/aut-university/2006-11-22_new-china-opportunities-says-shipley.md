New China opportunities, says Shipley
=====================================

Kiwi businesses need to prepare for new China opportunities, says Shipley

Chinais the new frontier of opportunity for New Zealand businesses but people need to have their planning in place to be successful, says business consultant and former New Zealand prime minister Jenny Shipley.

“The government is working hard for a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with China. Today is the right time for New Zealand business to get their strategy sorted so they can maximise the advantages once the FTA is in place,” she says.

“The Trade Agreement will be a breakthrough document and set a global precedent. It will give New Zealand businesses a great deal of opportunity as foreign investors will be interested in them because of the competitive advantages they will have over others doing business in China. I endorse the current government’s and prime minister’s drive to see it happen.”

Jenny Shipley joins former World Trade Organisation director-general Mike Moore to address the AUT University-hosted China Business Forum ( http://www.chinabusinessforum.co.nz/ ) in Auckland next Thursday, November 30.

The pair, who are regular visitors to China, believe the forum is an ideal format to hear the latest about trends in the China market.

Former New Zealand prime minister Mike Moore says the timing is right to talk about the practicalities of doing business with China.

“It’s easy to get things wrong in China,” he says. “I was first there in 1984 and things are very different now. It’s a rapidly changing market and its young people are hungry in business.”

“There are a lot of Kiwis up there now and a lot of international businesses engaging with China. It’s time for New Zealand businesses to get on board.”

Jenny Shipley believes the China Business Forum ( http://www.chinabusinessforum.co.nz/ ) will provide invaluable insights on China.

“It includes the latest information on China’s economy, analysis on how the market is functioning, up-to-date information on the FTA, great role models from importers to exporters, to services provided between New Zealand and China. It also looks at the scale and preferences of consumer behaviour in China today.”

But Jenny Shipley advises businesses with an interest in China to take a position early.

“I’m keen to see New Zealand move in this rapidly advancing economy but businesses need to look for potential partners in China and think and act globally,” she says.

Jenny Shipley and Mike Moore will be joined by Economist Intelligence UnitShanghai Corporate Network Director Mary Boyd, ANZ China President Andrew McGregor, and IBM Software Group director Asia Pacific, SMB and Channels, Nick Redshaw.

Other companies involved include Mega Trends Asia Villa Maria Estate, The Warehouse and Glidepath Group.

Mike Moore says the discussion has moved beyond politicians with great vision and is now down to the detail.

“It’s serious business people locking down the deals,” he says. “This programme is full of excellent practitioners who understand doing business with China. Go to the forum, sit alongside these people and learn what they know.”

This event is designed as a highly practical day which aims to get people motivated, stimulated and informed, says Jenny Shipley.

The China Business Forum ( http://www.chinabusinessforum.co.nz/ ) will focus on managing relationships with Chinese Government officials and business, address cultural needs and look at how to differentiate the Kiwi brand in China.

Opening speakers include Minister for Trade Phil Goff, Chinese Embassy Charge d'Affaires Zhao Yanbo, Chairman Asia New Zealand Foundation and ANZ National Bank Sir Dryden Spring and AUT University Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack.
