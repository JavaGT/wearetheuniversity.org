New Zealand’s Definitive Income Tax Guide Released

New Zealand’s Definitive Income Tax Guide Released

New Zealand’s definitive income tax guide is being launched this week (23rd August 2004).

Income Tax in NZ is the first major in-depth approach to income tax law since the 1976 edition of Molloy on Income Tax, says one of the book’s main authors, Dr Chris Ohms, and is the result of 14 years collaborative work.

“This is the first time since Molloy that such a comprehensive coverage of the New Zealand income tax system from a legal perspective has been written. This work concentrates on the income tax legislation itself and how it has been interpreted and applied by the courts in New Zealand guided by cases from other jurisdictions such as Australia and the United Kingdom,” says Dr Ohms.

Income Tax in NZ is aimed at tax practitioners, lawyers, accountants, and law and commerce students seeking to understand income tax law as it applies in NZ under the Income Tax Act 1994.

The authors come from a range of academic and tax practice backgrounds. Their aim is to encourage a deeper appreciation and understanding of the New Zealand tax system by providing detailed analysis of its legal interpretation and practical application.

The project commenced in 1990. Main authors Dr Chris Ohms and Nigel Smith are accompanied by two other main contributors - the late Associate Professor Garth Harris of University of Auckland and Mr Casey Plunket who is a tax partner at law firm Chapman Tripp.

This book fills a gap in the market as there is no legal treatise on tax law - NZ lawyers, accountants, IRD and Judges needed a legally focused textbook that was more than a simple tax guide.
