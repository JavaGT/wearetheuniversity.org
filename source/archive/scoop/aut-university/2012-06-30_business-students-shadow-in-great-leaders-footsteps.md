Business students shadow in great leaders’ footsteps

Students from two local high schools and AUT University were given the chance to shadow four Blake Leaders this week, as part of AUT Business School’s Shadow a Leader - organised to coincide with the Sir Peter Blake Trust’s Leadership Week.

The Blake Leaders, who are recognised in varying areas of expertise, included Chris Quin (2010 Blake Leader) - considered to be the leader in the ICT industry in New Zealand; Rachel Paris (2009 Blake Leader) - Partner at Bell Gully and known for her ground-breaking work in the legal community; Ngariumu Blair (2010 Blake Leader) - known for his work on promoting Maori community issues; and Annette Fale (2007 leader) - highly regarded for her work in event management and her work with The Halogen Foundation.

The students were chosen to take part based on their strong leadership and business skills – as recognised by their teachers and academics. They included Akshay Dandekar and Natalie Ng from Onehunga High Business School; Tara Collins and Liam Chelley from Takapuna Grammar School; and Justin Maloney, Troy Summerton, Rhiannon Snell and Barrett Owen from AUT’s Faculty of Business and Law.

Following an early breakfast at AUT Business School on Thursday 28 June, one high school student and one university student then each headed out to shadow the work of one of the Blake Leaders for the day. All four groups also attended a Dean’s Leaders Luncheon at Four Seasons restaurant with Dean of AUT Business School Dr Geoff Perry, industry leaders and guest speaker Sam Johnson from the Canterbury Student Volunteer Army (SVA).

Geoff Perry says the recognition given to Blake Leaders by the Sir Peter Blake Trust for their significant leadership contribution made this an incredible opportunity for the business students.

“Part of our mission at AUT Business School is to ensure our graduates have the opportunities to maximise engagement with industry. For these students to have the chance to see these highly respected and successful Blake Leaders in action, leaders who come from many different sectors of our society, is inspiring and great experience for them.

“We are in the business of educating New Zealand’s future leaders, and what better way to inspire leadership than to see it in action. The theme of Leadership Week this year is Dare to Dream, and that’s exactly what we hope this event has achieved,” says Geoff Perry.

Blake Leader, CEO of Gen-i, and Acting CEO of Telecom Chris Quin said he was happy to be approached to take part in this rewarding event.

“Leadership is about being more than you say. The AUT ‘Shadow a Leader’ day is a great and challenging opportunity to hopefully inspire some future leaders.”
