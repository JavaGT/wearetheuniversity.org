Top 16, Latest Show From Video Artist
=====================================

Top 16, Latest Show From Video Artist

In association with AUT University and the University of  
Auckland, Top 16 is the latest show from innovative  
Auckland-based video artist, Janet Lilo, a recent graduate  
of AUT’s Master of Art and Design programme. Top 16 refers  
to a popular application amongst users of a personal webpage  
called bebo, which easily identifies a user’s or a  
group’s most important and popular friends, family members  
and fans.

Based on the idea of profiling one’s self or identity,  
Lilo manifests her inspiration from this virtual space by  
using it as a template for the installation-based works. Top  
16 is an exploration of these two spaces merged, with the  
gallery serving as a physical space for viewing, commentary  
as well as exhibiting current profiles of bebo members.

Given the recent media hype regarding the violent death of  
17-year old Augustine Borrell and the online surrender of  
the main suspect that was followed with a hasty closure to  
the suspect’s bebo website, Top 16 seeks to highlight the  
overlap between public and private space: censorship of the  
individual and the community, appropriation of image and  
text, audience appeal and popularity and the wider context  
of popular culture and networking.

Curated by Louise Tu'u, TOP 16 opens on Thursday 6 October,  
6-8pm

TOP 16 show dates: Opening hours to the general public:  
Friday 7 – 12 October 2007, 10am- 5pm (Not open on the  
weekend)

Location: Gallery 3, 39 Symonds St, Cnr of Symonds St and  
Mount St,  
Auckland Central (It’s a brick building)
