Abbott Appointed Pro Vice-Chancellor For Aut’s North Shore University Campus

Professor Max Abbott has been appointed to the new position of Pro Vice-Chancellor North Shore to represent Auckland University of Technology in North Shore City and Rodney, particularly in relation to the work of AUT’s North Shore University Campus at Akoranga Drive.

Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack said the appointment marks a new phase in the development of the University as a multi-campus institution.

“The North Shore Campus has grown rapidly in recent years and we are considering expanding it to be more comparable with the AUT Auckland City Campus, and more than doubling its present size. Professor Abbott will play a leading role in strengthening relationships with local government, business and community organizations as the development occurs.”

Currently Professor Abbott is Dean of the Faculty of Health, based on the North Shore Campus. He will retain this role concurrently with his Pro Vice-Chancellor position.

Professor Abbott has strong links to the region as Dean and as elected board member and Deputy Chair of Waitemata District Health Board. He is also Patron of Raeburn House (North Shore Community Health Network).

Professor Abbott is also internationally renowned for his research in public and mental health. Prior to joining AUT he was National Director of the Mental Health Foundation and President of the World Federation for Mental Health. He has served on numerous government advisory committees and played a leading role in developing a number of community health and welfare organizations.

“AUT’s North Shore Campus has over 400 staff and 6,000 students. Most students are enrolled in degree and postgraduate programmes in various health disciplines, teacher education and sport and recreation,” said Professor Abbott. “A number of specialist research institutes and health and rehabilitation clinics are also based here.”

McCormack said that the University intends to expand the range of programmes offered at the North Shore Campus.

“Rapid growth in student numbers has been accompanied by the recent addition of an $8 million sports stadium, podiatry and oral health clinics, campus reception and administration building and new lecture theatres. Two of these received national architectural design awards. Late last month a $4 million rehabilitation research and teaching facility was opened and the library is currently being rebuilt as a state of the art learning centre.”

AUT’s two major campuses are only 10-15 minutes apart and connected by a regular shuttle service. AUT North Shore is also a doorway to AUT Auckland City and vice versa.”

“The appointment of Professor Abbott to this new role is part of a restructuring of the Auckland University of Technology’s leadership which sees the introduction of six Pro Vice Chancellors in key areas for development”, said McCormack.
