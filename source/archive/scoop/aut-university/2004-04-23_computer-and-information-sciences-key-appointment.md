Key Appointment for AUT’s School of Computer and Information Sciences

Auckland University of Technology has appointed Professor Felix Tan as Head of School for the School of Computer and Information Sciences (SCIS). Internationally recognised for his work in the global IT field, Professor Tan has previously held visiting positions with the Department of Information Systems, National University of Singapore and Richard Ivey School of Business, The University of Western Ontario, Canada.

Professor Tan is the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Global Information Management, the Vice President of Research for the Information Resources Management Association, the Asia-Pacific Representative on the Council of the Association for Information Systems, and the Editor of the ISWorld Net's EndNote Resources page.

His current research interests are in electronic commerce, global information management, business-IT alignment, and the management of IT. Professor Tan has published widely in journals and refereed conference proceedings. He has also published six books in the global IT field and is Editor of the book series “Advanced Topics in Global Information Management”.

Professor Tan has a Doctor of Philosophy and Master of Philosophy with first class honours from The University of Auckland, and a Bachelor of Economics from Melbourne’s Monash University.

As Head of SCIS, Professor Tan will lead the school’s strategic developments and direction. Research and curriculum in SCIS is a unique blend of computer science and information systems. Professor Tan hopes to build on the combination of these disciplines to develop programmes that are distinctive to AUT.

SCIS has four internationally prominent research groups: Knowledge Engineering and Discovery Research Institute (KEDRI), Institute for Information Technology Research (IITR), Software Engineering Research Laboratory (SERL) and the Centre for Research on Information Systems Management (CRISM).
