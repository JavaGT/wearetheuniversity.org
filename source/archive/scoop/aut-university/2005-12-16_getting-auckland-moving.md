Getting Auckland Moving

The wellbeing of Auckland’s population is set to benefit from a new partnership between AUT University and the YMCA Auckland.

AUT and the YMCA Auckland, two of Auckland’s largest and most recognised organisations, are joining forces to develop and run activity programmes, provide students with employment opportunities and combat many of the health and fitness issues facing communities.

AUT’s Sport and Recreation Division will work with the YMCA on a variety of projects from next year, with AUT providing expertise and experience in research, education and service.

The YMCA is Auckland’s largest provider of fitness exercise and community based activity with 11 fitness clubs, four pools and eight community sports and recreation facilities.

The first joint project is working on the delivery of the Never 2 Old Exercise Programme, a community exercise initiative developed by AUT for people over 60 years.

“The collective knowledge and experience of both organisations in this area of exercise programming will provide exciting new opportunities for Auckland’s older population,” says YMCA Chief Executive John Fairhurst.

AUT Deputy Vice Chancellor Phillip Sallis says this partnership will provide Auckland with professional and effective programmes for all ages and abilities, and make a positive contribution towards SPARC achieving an “active nation”.

“This is an important step towards reaching a wider community and attacking some of the biggest health and fitness issues, such youth obesity and the lack of exercise opportunities for senior citizens,” he says.

A research project by AUT masters students on YMCA brand perception is also planned for early 2006.
