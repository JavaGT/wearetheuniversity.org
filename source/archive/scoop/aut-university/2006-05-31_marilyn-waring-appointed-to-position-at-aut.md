Professor Marilyn Waring has been appointed to The Institute for Public Policy (IPP) at AUT University.

The former Raglan and Waipa National MP is a world-renowned political economist, feminist, development consultant, farmer and author. She has a PhD in Political Economy from Waikato University.

Professor Waring sits on The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Board of Directors. She joins AUT from Massey University (Albany) where she was Professor of Public Policy and directed the Master of Public Policy degree programme.

In 1975, at 22 years old, Professor Waring became New Zealand's youngest Member of Parliament. She remained in office until 1984.

At AUT Professor Waring will supervise a growing number of Doctoral and Masters thesis students and pursue major international opportunities across a broad range of public policy issues.

"We are delighted to welcome Professor Waring to the university," says Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack.

"Her academic reputation and considerable experience will further strengthen our Institute of Public Policy."

Professor Waring says AUT has distinguished itself in the Auckland and New Zealand tertiary environment.

"AUT impresses me as a university with clear goals and focus. In my new position I will be able to use my skills strategically and produce my best research and supervision work.

"It's an opportunity we all wish we had at some time in our paid work, and I am delighted to have found a university where this is possible."
