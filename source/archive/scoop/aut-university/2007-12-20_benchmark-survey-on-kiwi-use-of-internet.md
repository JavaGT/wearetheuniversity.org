Benchmark survey on Kiwi use of internet

AUT University has released the findings of a benchmark survey looking at how New Zealanders use the internet.

The survey, led by AUT University's Professor Allan Bell, is part of the World Internet Project (WIP) - an international collaborative project looking at the social, political and economic impact of the internet and other new technologies.

Some of the key findings include:

\- New Zealanders' use the internet heavily to conduct their everyday business, 83% of users access information about products online, and 60% buy things online. 51% pay bills, and 62% make travel reservations or bookings. 68% use their bank's online services.

\- 29% of the users access the internet through wireless or mobile phone. 68% have broadband at home, while 31% have dialup. Those without broadband at home are more likely to be older, live in rural areas and have lower household incomes than broadband users.

\- An important proportion of New Zealanders generate their own content on the web, especially those under 30 years. 13% of all users have their own website.

\- 27% have posted messages on discussion/message boards, and 33% have posted pictures, photos or videos on the web. 10% have their own blog, with 21% of bloggers being under 20 years of age.

\- Respondents rate the internet above all other sources as an important or very important source of information (62%), compared to newspapers and television (both 54%) and radio (46%). The internet even rates above interpersonal sources such as family and friends (58%), despite non-users being included in these responses.

\- Socialising is a major use of the internet, and 77% of users check their email every day. 10% participate in multi-player online games at least daily, and 16% participate in social networking sites like MySpace or Facebook at least daily.

\- 81% of the sample of New Zealanders use the internet

\- Internet access, usage, capability and attitudes are all strongly graded by New Zealanders' age, income and area of residence. The younger, wealthier and more urban people are, the more connected and confident they are online.

\- Most people believe the internet is considerably enhancing their social contacts rather than diminishing them.
