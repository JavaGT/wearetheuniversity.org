AUT Open Day

AUT, New Zealand’s most contemporary and fourth largest University, will open its doors to the public this Saturday (April 9) with an Open Day extravaganza.

Prospective students and their families are invited to come along and explore career and study options, talk to lecturers, graduates and current students, and experience campus life – from attending lectures to enjoying the social and recreational aspects.

There is also the chance to win a $5000 student starter pack.

Budding TV presenters can try out their on-camera communication skills at a mini TV studio, with some expert guidance from AUT staff members and Mâori Television stars Julian Wilcox and Veeshayne Armstrong. The winner gets an iPod Shuffle.

Visitors can get one-on-one advice about courses offered in Applied Humanities, Business, Design and Creative Technologies, Health and Environmental Sciences, Mâori and Pasifika Development and much more.

There’ll be displays, live entertainment, food, stalls and tours at both the Wellesley St and Akoranga (North Shore) campuses, with free shuttle buses between campuses.

Open Day organiser Natalie Jessup says AUT has moved its Open Day to a weekend event as many high school students cannot attend on weekdays because of the NCEA workload.

“It also gives parents and people in the work force the chance to come along and see just how much is available at AUT,” she says.
