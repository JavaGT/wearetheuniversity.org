AUT Professorial appointment: Kiwi professor returns home

Roger Marshall PhD (University of Western Australia)

Dr Roger Marshall has been appointed AUT University’s Professor of Marketing in the Faculty of Business.

The appointment marks a move home for the professor who returns from 13 years teaching and researching at the prestigious Nanyang Business School at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.

Previously, he taught at the University of Auckland following a 20-year career in business.

Professor Marshall offers strong research leadership in marketing. He has published extensively in the areas of brand equity, retail pricing practice and opinion leadership. His current research interest lies in relationship marketing and industrial buying centre dynamics.

Professor Marshall received his PhD in consumer psychology from the University of Western Australia in 1990. He brings experience in executive development and consulting, which he says adds credibility and interest to his classroom teaching.

“Singapore gave me a rich personal and learning experience which I’m now taking to AUT. And I am thrilled to bring my wife and young daughter home,” he says.

“I am looking forward tremendously to being part of the AUT business team. I find it hard to think of a life I would rather be leading or a more vibrant place to be leading it in – it is just so good to be home again.”

In Singapore, Dr Marshall’s consultancy experience included: marketing high-technology with Motorola (Commercial and Government Information Solutions Division), Daimler-Chrysler Ltd and LSI Logic (semiconductors); and key account marketing with Singapore Power, DHL, Capital Land (serviced apartments) and OCTEL (industrial chemicals).
