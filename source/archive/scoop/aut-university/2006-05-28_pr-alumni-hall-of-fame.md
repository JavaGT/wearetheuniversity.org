Porter Novelli and AUT announce PR alumni Hall of Fame partnership

Auckland, May 26 2006: Porter Novelli and AUT University have formed a partnership to recognise the achievements of AUT alumni and are excited to announce the launch of New Zealand’s first Public Relations Alumni Hall of Fame.

PR graduates from AUT University will be evaluated on their contribution to the Public Relations industry by a judging panel of leading practitioners, led by the Chairman of Porter Novelli, Cedric Allan. The first Hall of Fame members will be inducted in 2007.

The panel of high profile judges will review the depth and range of achievements of AUT alumni with PR majors. Those who have made notable and impressive contributions will be inducted into the Hall of Fame at an annual event.

Porter Novelli New Zealand Managing Director Jane Sweeney says the partnership marks the continuation of the close relationship between AUT and Porter Novelli.

"Porter Novelli is delighted to deepen their existing relationship with AUT in launching the PR Alumni Hall of Fame. For over 20 years now AUT has been providing corporations, organisations and PR agencies with excellent practitioners. They start out as graduates in 'work ready' mode, hungry to make their mark, and many now lead large teams of communications professionals.

“As leaders in the communications field, we wanted to recognise and reward excellence in PR practice, and show our appreciation of the vital role AUT’s School of Communications Studies plays in providing high calibre practitioners,” says Jane.

AUT has trained some of New Zealand’s most high profile practitioners who have gone on to receive national and international accolades for their achievements.

AUT’s Curriculum Leader of Public Relations, Senior Lecturer Joseph Peart believes the Porter Novelli/AUT Hall of Fame will be a benchmark for industry excellence.

“We are grateful to Porter Novelli for another innovation,” he says. “It fits with the creativity we foster, which began with a student-operated PR agency working for charities and continues with the student society of future practitioners.”

AUT’s PR Alumni Chapter was launched last year, with support from Porter Novelli.
