AUT to cap record number of students in autumn graduation

In what will be AUT University's largest graduation, around 3200 graduands will have their qualifications conferred at ceremonies starting on Wednesday, March 21.

Seven ceremonies will be held at the Auckland Town Hall over three days and more than 1800 graduands are scheduled to be capped in person.

Among those graduating will be seven doctors of philosophy. They are:

Tristan Bellingham, who studied the mechanochemical remediation of persistent organic pollutants and other organic compounds in contaminated soils.

Youhua Du, whose PhD involved an in vitro investigation of the stiffness response of contracted airway smooth muscles (ASM) under different external vibrations.

Aaron Gilbert, a senior lecturer in AUT's Faculty of Business, who completed a thesis on the efficacy and microstructure effects of insider trading regulations.

Rosemary Godbold, a lecturer in AUT's Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences, who completed a philosophical critique of the best interests test as a criterion for decision making in law and clinical practice. The best interests test is the legal mechanism for making treatment and non-treatment decisions on behalf of adults who lack capacity.

Jill Poulston, a lecturer in AUT's School of Hospitality and Tourism, who focused her research on ethical issues and workplace problems in commercial hospitality.

Thomas Samuel, whose research focused on the impact of trade liberalisation on economic structure and performance.

Guest speakers include the Millennium Institute of Sport and Health CEO Mike Stanley, Auckland District Health Board executive director of nursing and midwifery Taima Campbell, Porath Executive Search managing director Mark Porath, Idealog magazine founder Vincent Heeringa and Pacific Business Trust chair Pauline Winter.
