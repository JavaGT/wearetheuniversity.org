FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday 27 May 2011

  
AUT University’s international connection crosses the South Pacific Ocean

AUT University has opened a special connection across the South Pacific, signing an agreement to collaborate with the University of Hawai’i (UHM), at Mānoa, in Hawai’i.

The Memorandum of Understanding is a commitment between the two institutions to promote collaborative research, educational developments and enrich understanding.

AUT University will provide a 12 month fulltime exchange for students and staff each year. Facilitating opportunities to participate in joint research activities and internationally funded projects that will benefit the community.

Director of Pasifika Advancement at AUT University Pauline Winter says the relationship between the universities is a testament to AUT’s strengths in research and teaching.

“This provides an opportunity for AUT to share its ground-breaking research and teaching, proving that even though there is a large ocean that separates us, we are still connected”.

“So much of our pacific culture stems from the original travellers from Hawaiki - who influenced much that is unique about New Zealand. Now, through this exciting new venture we can share knowledge, research and education together” says Pauline.

A group of senior academics represented AUT at the signing of the MOU including;  
Pauline Winter, former Pacific Business Woman of the Year and recipient of a Queens Service Order (QSO) in 2008 acknowledging her work in business and the Pacific communities. Dr Pare Keiha, Dean of Te Ara Poutama, awarded a QSO in 2008 for his service to business, education and Māori. Dr Tania Ka’ai Director of Te Ipukarea - The National Māori Language institute and the newly established International Centre for Language Revitalisation (ICLR), and Professor John Moorfield awarded the QSO in 2010 for his services to Māori language education.

Chancellor of AUT, and former Governor General of New Zealand Sir Paul Reeves signed the agreement along with the Chancellor of UHM, Virginia Hinshaw.
