Not your average corporate box!
===============================

Not your average corporate box!

Business leaders, politicians and celebrities swapped their home comforts for a concrete floor to raise awareness and money for Auckland’s homeless last night. The 61 participants who slept rough in AUT University’s city campus have collectively raised $123,470 so far, with some individuals receiving donations close to $10k.

Organisers of the LIFEWISE Big Sleepout, now in its third year, would like to thank all those who generously donated.

The participants endured wind, rain and downright uncomfortable conditions in good humour for this important cause. Homelessness is not an issue isolated to a small section of society, anybody can have an unforeseen change of circumstances leaving them vulnerable – even the people who volunteered their time last night.

Vernon Sorenson, a LIFEWISE success story, had only one word to say to all those who took part – “thanks”. Vernon made a video story about his time being homeless and how LIFEWISE helped and supported him to get him off the streets. He was on hand to chat to participants about his experiences.

LIFEWISE General Manager, John McCarthy, says the total raised reflects the incredible efforts put in by the group. “We’ve seen some very competitive behaviour to raise funds this year surpassing previous years of total funds raised.

“I’d personally like to thank each and every one of the group for sticking it out and not heading home even though their cardboard mattress offered little padding from the cold and there was minimal protection from the rain.”

It is anticipated that the total will rise over the coming few days as participants talk about their ‘rough sleeping’ experience with family, friends and colleagues.

“As well as thanking the 61 individuals involved, I’d like to acknowledge the support of AUT University. Not only did they host the event in Hikuwai Plaza, but once again Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack was also one of the 61 brave people sleeping outside.”
