Big brother keeps an eye on New Zealand environment

**Big brother keeps an eye on New Zealand environment**

Threatened species like the world's rarest dolphin - the Maui Dolphin - will receive a helping hand thanks to reconnaissance technology better known for its military intelligence use.

AUT University has just taken ownership of a UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) - commonly known as a drone – to monitor species conservation and map the country’s environment.

“UAVs are essentially defence technology, however, their application is increasing globally for a range of other purposes including conservation, biosecurity, mineral exploration, fisheries management, traffic monitoring and other scientific research,” says Professor John Brooks, a microbiologist and Head of Research at AUT University’s School of Applied Sciences.

“Conservation is so pivotal to New Zealand’s cultural identity. Using this high-tech equipment will help us to better understand and manage our environment and population numbers. It will also help to advance conservation research in New Zealand.”

The UAV will be used for a range of research purposes including monitoring the numbers of Maui Dolphins – the world’s rarest dolphin; mapping island vegetation restoration, mapping the rehabilitation of mining sites in New Zealand, and monitoring sea bird populations to name a few.

Already leaders in marine conservation research, AUT recently partnered with the Department of Conservation (DOC), adding a terrestrial component. “Working with DOC will enable the social aspect of conservation, which is critical to the success of all conservation initiatives,” says Professor Brooks.

One of the areas both parties are keen to develop is monitoring and surveying through geographic information systems (GIS) mapping techniques.

Dr Barbara Bollard-Breen, an expert in geographic information systems and ecosystem management, says the remote sensing capability of the UAV will provide AUT and DOC greater capacity for habitat mapping and marine and terrestrial surveillance.

“The UAV gives us the opportunity to look very closely at parts of the environment that would only be possible using low resolution satellite imagery. It also allows us to canvas a far wider area than is physically possible from the ground and gather more accurate environmental data and information about our natural resources.”

Supporting local industry, AUT acquired the UAV from Skycam UAV NZ Ltd, based in Palmerston North. Working with the New Zealand Defence Technology Agency, Skycam has led the development of UAVs since the early 1990s.

AUT is the first university in New Zealand to use the innovative UAV technology specifically for conservation purposes.

**Notes:**  
• A UAVs flight is usually controlled remotely by a navigator, or pilot, though the AUT system also has a sophisticated on-board autopilot.

• The AUT University UAV will have a cruising speed of 30 knots and a flying range of approximately 27km.

• The UAV is powered by a high performance electric motor, so is silent, resulting in no disturbance to wildlife when it flies over.

• Other features: an 8 mega pixel still camera with a range of filters to enable visible and near-infra red imaging, or a full motion stabilised video camera with 10x proportional optical zoom.

• Lead researchers using the UAV are Professor John Brooks (_also an experienced glider pilot_) and Dr Barbara Bollard-Breen. Both will undertake extensive training in the operation of a UAV in August and will be responsible for mission planning and safe operation of the UAV.
