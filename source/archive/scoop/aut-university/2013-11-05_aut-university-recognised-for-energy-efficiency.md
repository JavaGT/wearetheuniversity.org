**AUT University recognised for energy efficiency**

AUT University has been announced as a finalist for the Mega Efficiency Impact category and for the EECA Business Energy Management Award in the 2013 NZI Sustainable Business Network Awards.

Being named as a finalist in New Zealand’s longest standing sustainability awards highlights AUT’s continued commitment to becoming a more sustainable organisation and follows the Highly Commended Carbon Reduction Award AUT received at the Australasian Green Gown Awards earlier this year – the only New Zealand university to receive this.

AUT has been named as an awards finalist for our approach to sustainability which focuses on transport, energy and waste. Achievements in these areas have been by implementing initiatives such as the alternative transport programme which incentivises staff to travel to work using public and other transport options, lighting upgrades, more efficient boilers, painting building roofs white to reduce heat gain within buildings, the introduction of worm farms, Molok bins (underground recycling bins) and ensuring that staff and students can responsibly recycle plastic, paper, cardboard, glass and cans.

The NZI Sustainable Business Network Awards are New Zealand’s most prestigious sustainability awards in New Zealand. They celebrate the contribution businesses and individuals are making to transforming New Zealand to a model sustainable nation. Becoming a finalist at these awards acknowledges AUT as an organisation focused on making it a great place to study and work.

The awards evening will be held on Thursday 21 November at Auckland War Memorial Museum and AUT is hoping for success which will confirm that we are heading in the right direction towards creating a university for a more sustainable world.
