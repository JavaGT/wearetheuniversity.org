AUT hosts international forum on Auckland region

An international team of experts in regional development will put Auckland under the microscope next week when the Metro Project comes to life.

The public will have the chance to hear the overseas experts speak at a forum at AUT University’s Wellesley Campus on Tuesday, May 2, from 5pm-7pm.

The forum is co-hosted by AUT’s Institute of Public Policy (IPP) and Auckland City Council. Auckland Mayor Dick Hubbard will open the event and IPP Director, Professor Ian Shirley will chair it.

An international review team of six, headed by Greg Clark, advisor on City and Regional Development to the OECD, has been invited to Auckland for the Metro Project. The team (listed below) will work with local experts to develop action plans and help Auckland realise its potential as a world-class city-region.

The Metro Project is based on a partnership between the IPP, Committee for Auckland and the Auckland Regional Council, with key involvement by central government and the Growth and Innovation Advisory Board (GIAB).

AUT Chancellor Sir Paul Reeves will welcome the international review team to Auckland with a mihi on Monday, May 1. AUT will also host a forum on Maori economic development issues and opportunities at the Horotiu Marae on Wednesday, May 3, as part of the Metro Project.

On Thursday, a full-day symposium, organised by the Committee for Auckland at the Aotea Centre, will focus on the areas of human capital, infrastructure, business capability and innovation, and the 2011 Rugby World Cup.
