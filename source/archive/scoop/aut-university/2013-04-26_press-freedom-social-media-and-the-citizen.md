**Does social media mean press freedom is now for everyone?**

**The theme for this year’s UNESCO World Press Freedom Day on May 3, _“Safe to speak: Securing freedom of expression in all media”,_ broadens the debate. It opens the way for an exploration of the libertarian origins of press freedom and the advent of social media and citizen journalism at a time when we are looking for new models of media responsibility and ethics – beyond a social responsibility model – some of which embrace cultural and religious notions of truth and story-telling.**

****Dr Mark Pearson** is Professor of Journalism and Social Media at Griffith University, Australia, and has long been an advocate of press freedom. He is the Australian correspondent of the Paris-based global media freedom advocacy organisation Reporters Sans Frontières (Reporters Without Borders). Professor Pearson has combined careers in teaching and journalism. He was special reports editor of _The Australian_ newspaper and his work has been published in the _Wall Street Journal, Far Eastern Economic Review, The Fiji Times_, the Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers Association _Bulletin_ and Crikey.com.au**
