**BuzzShift’s Cameron Gawley to talk ‘digital disruption’ at _The Project_**

Organisers of _The Project: Digital Disruption_ have announced the final four names on the speaking line-up, including American digital strategist Cameron Gawley.

Gawley, a self-described serial entrepreneur and growth hacker, was named as the fifth most influential ad exec on Twitter by _Business Insider_ in 2013. Since launching his first IT business at the age of 18 he has built up several other companies, including digital strategy agency BuzzShift, as well as helping other entrepreneurs as a mentor and angel investor.

“Designing digital activity that connects with people individually but is still measurable, trackable and scalable is what interests me most right now,” says Gawley.

B Team CEO Derek Handley, New Zealander and former president of SAP North America Geraldine McBride and IT leadership expert Charles Araujo are the other additional speakers, completing a diverse group of more than 30 international and local experts who will speak on digital disruption at _The Project_.

_The Project: Digital Disruption_ will be held on April 30 and May 1 and is presented by AUT University, The US Embassy of New Zealand and Social Media New Zealand (SMNZ).

The event will bring together innovators and world-class minds from the Pacific Rim and further afield, examining how digital disruption is changing the way we live and work and how organisations are leveraging the opportunities created by digital disruption to transform their businesses.
