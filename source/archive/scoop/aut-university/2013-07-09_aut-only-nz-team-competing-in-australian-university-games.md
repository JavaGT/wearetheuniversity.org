AUT only NZ team competing in Australian University Games

**AUT only NZ team competing in Australian University Games**  
AUT University is proud to be the only University from New Zealand participating in the 2013 Eastern Australia University Games, sending four teams to compete in hockey, touch rugby and volleyball. AUT is also the only international contingent attending this tournament, with the rest of the teams made up of Australian competitors.

Held from 7 to 12 July, the Eastern Australian University Games are the largest of three regional University Games held across Australia, with 18 tertiary institutions and around 3000 student athletes competing this year.

AUT’s Women’s Hockey team are the current New Zealand University Games Champions, so stakes are high to defend and push that title in an international arena. The Women’s Volleyball squad have been training three times per week to sharpen their skills to take on the Australian teams. Led by New Zealand representative Tivoli Guthrie, AUT’s Men and Women’s Touch Rugby teams boast six other New Zealand representatives in the squad.

AUT is off to a good start after day one brought wins for all the teams. The Women’s Volleyball team had three straight set wins in both games. The Men’s Touch team took away a 15-3 win against the University of West Sydney (UWS) and 13-0 against Charles Sturt University (CSU); while the Women’s team won 8-0 against UWS and 16-0 against CSU. Notably, the Women’s Hockey team won over the hometown favourites University of Wollongong 4-0 and also against UWS 4-1. A great start from all teams puts AUT in a prime position to bring home some silverware and continue winning over their Aussie rivals.
