**Impressive cohort of business support organisations feature in annual awards**

Behind every business success story is a support network of organisations that make their achievements possible.

The _AUT Business School_ Excellence in Business Support Awards is the only national performance measure for New Zealand business support organisations.

Finalists in the awards have been announced today and include a new cohort of dynamic support organisations.

“AUT’s Business School differentiates itself with the depth of engagement with industry for the benefit of staff and students. These annual awards are one of the ways we demonstrate our commitment to industry,” says AUT Business School Acting Dean, Professor Kate Kearins.

This year, along with all entrants needing to demonstrate their social and environmental credentials, five organisations have made it to the final of a specific category recognising Sustainability Support. With four outstanding finalists in the Leadership category, the calibre of individuals stepping forward continues to impress.

Final applications are evaluated by academics from the AUT Business School. Evaluation of applications is overseen by the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation.

In evaluating applications, the judges will consider: leadership and planning, customer and market focus, provision of business support and evaluation and improvement, with a focus on results.
