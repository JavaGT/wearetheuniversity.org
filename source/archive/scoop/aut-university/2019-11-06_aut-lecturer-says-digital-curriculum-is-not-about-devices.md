**AUT Senior Lecturer Says Digital Curriculum is Not About Devices**

As AUT prepares to host CS4HS for the third year in a row, Senior Lecturer in Engineering, Computer and Mathematical Sciences Dr Mahsa Mohaghegh says the digital curriculum is not about devices, but design and critical thinking.

  
Dr Mahsa Mohaghegh says the free two-day professional development conference, supported by the Google Education Fund, is a crucial opportunity for primary and secondary teachers to learn new skills ahead of the digital curriculum coming into effect for years 1 – 13 in 2020.

  
CS4HS offers two days of free talks, hands-on workshops and keynote addresses on key topics relating to the use of digital technology in our primary and secondary schools. It is held at the AUT City Campus on 14 and 15 November.  
“Many assume the digital curriculum equals devices in classrooms. Our focus for CS4HS is to explore the latest in design and critical thinking, giving teachers hands-on experience they can put into action straight away in the classroom,” says Dr Mohaghegh. “The technology itself is the tool – we want our teachers to feel empowered to teach students about the possibilities of technology, which will help them develop the flexible skills and mindset needed to cope with an ever-changing future.

  
“Our repeat attendees tell us that the network of colleagues they establish and the ready-to-deploy modules they gain at CS4HS makes it valuable professional development. We know teachers want to make the digital curriculum relevant and engaging for their students, and CS4HS helps them do that.”
