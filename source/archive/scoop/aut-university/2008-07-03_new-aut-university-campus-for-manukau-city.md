New AUT University campus for Manukau City

New AUT University campus for Manukau City

AUT University welcomes the Prime Minister's announcement today of the Government's $25m investment to establish the University's new campus in Manukau City. The Government's investment goes towards AUT's purchase and development of the former Carter Holt Harvey site on Great South Road.

\"The future of Greater Auckland is inextricably linked to the future of Manukau," said AUT Chancellor, Sir Paul Reeves. "In our modern, knowledge-intensive world, we know that education is the key to success. So bringing a university to this city is an important step towards giving the people of Manukau the full access to education that they need and deserve."

"Population demographics and economic projections all indicate that Manukau City's need for a university campus is immediate," said AUT Vice-Chancellor, Derek McCormack. "In 2004 the city identified that it will need at least another 10,000 people with university degrees by 2012. Yet for many residents, the cost and time it takes to get to and from Auckland City is prohibitive, meaning university has simply not been an option, until now.

"Other New Zealand cities of Manukau's size - and smaller - have both a polytechnic and a university. Manukau City will now be equally endowed, "said Mr McCormack.

"AUT University is the Government's logical partner in this initiative," said Mr McCormack. "Our growth shows we are good at attracting students into undergraduate and post-graduate study and we are successful with Maori, Pasifika and new-settler students. We have been working with the City Council for the past three years to determine how best to establish a university campus, so it is very exciting to see it come to fruition, thanks to the Government's investment.

The new campus will open in 2009. AUT will relocate its Innovation Centre (formerly known as AUT Technology Park), which consists of some research institutes, a commercialisation centre and a business incubator. The first programme offered will be Pacific Early Childhood Teacher Education.

In 2010 the University will begin offering a wider range of degree and post-graduate programmes, tailored to student and community needs. Between now and then AUT will undertake a consultation programme with the local community, Manukau Institute of Technology and other education providers, to determine the most relevant and desirable mix of programmes.

"We see our role as complementing the other providers and we want to work collaboratively with them," Mr McCormack said.

"This is an ideal site in almost every respect," he added. "It is attractive, with quality buildings; safe and secure for students; close to amenities and has plenty of green space, making a very pleasant place to study and do research. The people of Manukau deserve no less."
