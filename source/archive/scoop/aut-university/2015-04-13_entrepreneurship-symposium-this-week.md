Entrepreneurship Symposium this week

**Entrepreneurship symposium focused on connection between business and research**  

A broad cross section of entrepreneurship experts including experienced and emerging entrepreneurs, researchers and business leaders will share insights at an AUT University symposium on Wednesday 15 April.

Keynote speakers include award-winning New Zealand engineering entrepreneur Bill Buckley (who will speak on entrepreneurial resilience), Professor Norris Krueger from the School of Advanced Studies, University of Phoenix and Entrepreneurship Northwest (‘Growing the mind-set of an expert entrepreneur & how to nurture a healthy entrepreneurial ecosystem”) and AUT Professor of Entrepreneurship Trish Corner (“Research into entrepreneurial processes: start up and failure”).

Entrepreneurship researchers and business leaders will also present on topics under the themes of ‘crafting entrepreneurial opportunities’ and ‘the social and indigenous view of entrepreneurship’.

Dr Ella Henry, a senior lecturer in Te Ara Poutama (AUT’s Faculty of Māori and Indigenous Development) will speak on the topic of Māori and entrepreneurship, and AUT Business student and entrepreneur Adriana Christie will speak about ‘business with a greater purpose’ in New Zealand.

The Entrepreneurship Symposium is presented by the Management Department of the AUT Business School, in partnership with the Entrepreneurs’ Organisation, Auckland.

“This inaugural symposium aims to create an ongoing dialogue about entrepreneurship from many different perspectives. The focus is on sharing knowledge and creating connections between those who work, research and teach in this field,” says the Head of AUT’s Management Department, Professor Stephen Teo.
