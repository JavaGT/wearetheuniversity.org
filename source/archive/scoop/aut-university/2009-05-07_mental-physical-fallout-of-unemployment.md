Mental/physical fallout of unemployment

Mental and physical fallout of rising unemployment needs attention

More attention needs to be given to the psychological and physical wellbeing of New Zealand’s rising population of unemployed, according to a leading health advocate.

With unemployment expected to reach a seven-year high of 5.3%, Max Abbott, Professor of Psychology and Public Health at AUT University, said work placement initiatives are not enough to address the problems of the unemployed.

“New Zealand needs to take action to buffer the escalating human and social costs of rising unemployment and set the scene for future economic growth.”

\"While Work and Income measures to help get people into work are good and should be continued, many people won't find jobs and will experience longer periods of involuntary unemployment. This often leads to feelings of failure, rejection and self-blame. Some people withdraw socially and over time lose the motivation and confidence to seek work and face further rejection."

Professor Abbott said this contributes to physical and mental health problems among unemployed people, who are at high risk for a wide range of health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and mental health disorders.

“Unemployment is about much more than obtaining an income. Paid employment provides a time structure, enforces activity, involves regular contact and shared experiences with other people, links people to wider goals and purposes and defines important aspects of personal status and identity.”

"Although attention needs to be given to expanding employment opportunities, helping people find jobs and increasing access to training and education, there will still be a growing void to be filled if we are to reduce a great deal of human suffering and position people to move into work when the economy picks up. This includes helping people find other ways of meeting the psychological and social needs met by paid employment."

Professor Abbott has endorsed the NZIER’s appeal for greater emphasis on targeted training programmes.

Professor Abbott said AUT University turned away many hundreds of students this year because of a Tertiary Education Commission limit on student numbers. Many were in health sciences and education, areas with current workforce shortages and greater short-falls projected in future years.

"We don't know where all the students turned away from higher education nation-wide have ended up but it is likely many are unemployed or under-employed in jobs that displace school leavers with lower qualifications."

Professor Abbott said it would make good sense to both expand targeted training programmes and lift the cap on places in tertiary education, especially in job-rich fields.
