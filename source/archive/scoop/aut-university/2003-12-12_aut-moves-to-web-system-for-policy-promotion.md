AUT moves to web system for policy promotion

AUT moves to dedicated web system for policy promotion

The Auckland University of Technology has moved to a fully dedicated web system for its policy promotion and management.

The AUT Policies Online database has been designed and developed by the AUT Web Centre and its contractors iSITE, in close collaboration with members of staff who will be engaged in uploading, updating and reviewing policies. The database went live today, 12 December.

AUT Policies Online project manager Dr Mike Bondesio says the online system is designed to provide quick, but highly secured access, to staff and students to all policies that are of concern to them.

“Link buttons will be provided from major AUT Web sections. Policy implementation is also catered for through the provision of links to related policies, guidelines, and downloadable forms.”

AUT Policies Online comes equipped with tools that ensure a secure and controlled electronic environment to those who are responsible for creating and reviewing policies.

“Policies are being progressively added to the database. Currently we have uploaded all approved Staff, and Academic(Teaching) and IT Services policies. All remaining policies will be uploaded in the near future, with Finance policies next in the queue.”

“As a University of Technology we believe it is important that AUT is a leader in the implementation of technology into the delivery of programmes and university administration.”
