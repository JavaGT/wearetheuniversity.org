Interstices looks at NZ's architectural culture

Interstices looks at New Zealand's architectural culture

Seventeen years on from the first issue of Interstices: Journal of Architecture and Related Arts, the publication's seventh issue says progress toward a refined architectural culture in New Zealand is still hampered by the restrictions of immediate commercial appeal.

The same restrictions have meant that the journal itself only appeared intermittently until last year. In the architectural environment, however, positive progress means that the integrity of historical building is better protected and the recognition of a more cohesive and sustainable architectural approach has led to the inauguration of the Auckland City's Urban Design Panel.

Likewise, conditions of production for the Journal have improved so that this issue is appearing on schedule.

Gen-ius/Gen-ealogy, is being launched this month and explores genius and genealogy as common threads within architecture and art.

The current issue also features the first English translation, by Laurence Simmons, of Giorgio Agamben's 2004 essay Genius, the same text that provided many contributors with a common platform for their reflections on genius and genealogy.

The official launch will be held on October 10 at the National Institute of Creative Arts and Industries (NICAI) Conference Centre. At 6pm, University of Auckland Associate Professor Laurence Simmons will deliver a lecture looking at how and why film critics get things wrong. His lecture will discuss some of the critics' misperceptions of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo and what it can teach the audience about the dynamics, both thematic and formal, of the film.
