Callaghan Innovation and AUT have strong synergies
==================================================

**Press Release: [AUT University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University)**

Callaghan Innovation and AUT University have strong synergies.

Off the back of the Statement of Intent announcement by Minister Joyce yesterday about Callaghan Innovation, AUT University is looking forward to engaging with the organisation in market-facing innovation and technology research.

“AUT has a culture of willingness and flexibility when working with business and industry that make us an ideal partner.

“We see strong synergies between the Callaghan Innovation Statement of Intent and AUT’s industry-focused research and consultancy strategy. We welcome the prospect of creating closer working ties with its research teams and industry partners and we know this will create great opportunities for students to engage in projects and gain industry-based experience,” says AUT Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack.

AUT is currently working with Callaghan Innovation in development of its industry engagement strategy.
