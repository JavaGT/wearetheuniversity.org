Mixing it up with AUT

**Mixing it up with AUT**

AUT University has created an innovative and fun way for students to discover career options, while building a unique music track, via the new online quiz CareerTracks.

CareerTracks gives school students a chance to learn something about themselves and explore career options in their own time and on familiar technology. There are nine multi-choice questions which draw out the personality types of the user.

CareerTracks is based on Dr John Holland’s ‘Theory of Career Choice’, where Holland theorises that people and occupations fit into six types or codes. AUT matched each of AUT’s degrees with Holland’s codes – the resulting personality types and matched degree courses for each user are shown on the CareerTrack’s results page. The quiz results and music track can be emailed to the user.

There are thousands of pieces of music stored to ensure each track created is unique. The process of answering questions creates a layering of tracks that builds an original piece of music. Students can use CareerTracks as many times as they want and will get a free and original piece of music each time. It’s up to the user what they do with their track – it could be shared on Facebook or mixed into a DJ set.

The use of music composition with a career tool hasn’t been done before and AUT hopes its uniqueness will attract a high level of youth engagement.

The technology behind the application makes it portable and scalable, and reinforces AUT’s reputation as a contemporary university offering innovative and stimulating learning experiences. It’s housed on the AUT website and Facebook, and readily accessible for iPads and smartphones.
