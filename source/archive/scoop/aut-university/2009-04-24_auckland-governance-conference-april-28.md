**Press Release: [AUT University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University)**

  
**Impressive guest and speaker list sets the scene for a topical conference.**

The future of Auckland’s governance has been dominating the media recently but what will the changes mean for business, the ratepayer and Auckland’s development?

A guest list that reads like a ‘who’s who’ of New Zealand local governance , politics and business is set to attend AUT University’s, Institute of Public Policy, Auckland Governance Conference. The conference includes local and international speakers of notable repute and is your chance to hear what the Government’s decisions actually mean for the governance of Auckland.

Attendees will listen to presentations from Robin Hambleton, Professor of City Leadership at the University of the West of England, the Hon Jim McLay, Michael Barnett and the Hon Peter Salmon, the chair of the Royal Commission inquiry into Auckland’s governance.

The conference, to be held on April 28, will look closely at what the Government’s decisions mean at both a local and a regional level, the checks and balances the Government should put in place and the risks. There will also be an opportunity to look at how the Minister for Local Government’s high standards for transparency and accountability can be met within a single mega-council.

The day will finish with a reflection on the day’s discussions and a question and answer session for a selected panel which includes Elizabeth Rowe, Jim McLay, Robin Hambleton, Peter McKinlay, Ngarimu Blair and Christine Cheyne
