Comment re: “Bill introduced for synthetic crackdown”
=====================================================

**Press Release: [Auckland University of Technology](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology)**

**PROFESSOR MAX ABBOTT, PRO VICE-CHANCELLOR AND DEAN OF THE FACULTY OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES AT AUCKLAND UNIVERISTY OF TECHNOLOGY (AUT)** – strongly supports the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill introduced to Parliament today.

However, in the longer term, he believes that police discretion not to prosecute for the possession and or use of small quantities of illegal drugs should be replaced by decriminalisation and a mandatory health response.

“People should not be dragged through the courts and imprisoned for minor drug use or possession.”

Professor Abbott says the legislation, when passed, will provide flexibility to rapidly bring dangerous new or emerging drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act and give police stronger powers of search and seizure. It will also apply stronger sentences to suppliers of the synthetic drugs that have been directly responsible for the deaths of over 50 people in the past two years.
