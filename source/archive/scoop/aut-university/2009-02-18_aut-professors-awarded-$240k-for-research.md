Ako Aotearoa announces first national project fund recipients

This February, Ako Aotearoa, The National Centre for Tertiary Teaching Excellence, announced its commitment of over $1.3 million dollars (including GST) to support projects that strategically improve tertiary teaching and learning.

Nine major projects join the three Doctoral Scholarship proposals announced last November to receive funding under the Centre’s National Project Fund, which was in operation for the first time last year.

The nine projects are spread over three streams of the fund, with five Research and Implementation, three Māori Initiative Projects, and one Collaboration Project being selected from the substantial pool of submitted proposals.

Spanning the diversity of the tertiary sector, the projects will involve Adult Community Education (ACE), Industry Training Organisations (ITOs), Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics (ITPs), Wānanga, and Universities. A number of the projects also involve cross-organisational and cross-sector collaborations.

Dr Peter Coolbear, Ako Aotearoa National Director is delighted with the outcome of the funds first round.

“The projects are first rate and have every potential to successfully meet the aims and goals of the fund,” he says. “They are either implementation projects designed to have direct impact on improving teaching and learning, or important pieces of use-inspired research.  

“The selection panels have done an excellent and careful job of identifying projects that not only best align with the vision of Ako Aotearoa, but also have the capacity to build on existing knowledge, have the potential to lead to benefit to learners, have extremely capable teams, and offer overall value-for-money.”

The key goal of the fund is to enhance educational outcomes for learners, but in pursuit of this we are also looking to promote collaboration across and within different parts of the tertiary education sector, contribute to the development of a more coherent knowledge base of effective tertiary teaching and learning in Aotearoa New Zealand and build research capability and capacity.
