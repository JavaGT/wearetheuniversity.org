AUT University educating young leaders in New Zealand first

  
In a New Zealand first, AUT University is currently hosting 25 of Brazil’s future young leaders as part of the Brasilia without Boarders programme. The programme is a Brazilian Government initiative to build up the skills and experience of the future leaders of Brazil through knowledge exchange.

AUT is the only New Zealand University, and the only University outside the USA and Europe, to successfully bid to host a group from this programme. Other countries, considered as New Zealand’s main competitors for international students such as Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada, missed out.

The programme, developed by AUT, is successful because of the AUT difference it offers; the exciting and diversified four week schedule combines global leadership education provided by top class AUT tutors with a true New Zealand cultural experience.

The programme was designed and developed by Jan Fitz-Gerald, Director of International Programmes at AUT, with the new global citizen in mind. There are three main segments: English for Business Communication, Creating Tomorrow’s Global Leaders and Te Mauri Aotearoa (Spirit of New Zealand).

This is the second time that group leader Anderson Pinherio da Silva has taken part in the programme, travelling to Hague University last year. Anderson is currently studying economics and works as a Police Officer. Anderson says “I wanted to come to New Zealand to study at AUT this time because I wanted to be able to experience the New Zealand way of life. There is so much opportunity here, as well as the emphasis on getting a good education. The programme so far has been amazing and has exceeded all of our expectations. Jan has really done such a great job.”

The students arrived at AUT on Monday 4 August and were welcomed with a powhiri at Ngā Wai o Horotiu Marae. Since then they have been able to experience the strong pacific culture at the Mangere Markets, sit in on an Auckland Council meeting and have enjoyed a trip to Wellington to meet with Hon Peter Dunne, visit Te Papa and visit the Brazilian Embassy and chat with the Brazilian Ambassador to New Zealand HE Eduardo Gradilone. The group has also been completing English for Business courses and has heard from various inspiring speakers.

The group departs this Saturday.
