AUT a contributor to the New Zealand Story

**AUT a contributor to the New Zealand Story**

AUT University represented the New Zealand education sector today at the launch of the New Zealand Story initiative. AUT’s Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack spoke alongside Prime Minister Rt Hon John Key and Minister for Economic Development Hon Steven Joyce about the importance of increasing New Zealand’s reputation overseas. AUT was involved in developing the educational aspects of the New Zealand Story.

The New Zealand Story project was introduced in the _Building Export Markets_ progress report as part of the Government’s Business Growth Agenda, and received additional funding of $2m in the 2013 Budget.

The initiative was developed over the last year with input from leaders in the primary sector, manufacturing, government, export education and the Māori community, with an aim to help overseas markets buy into the unique story of New Zealand and its people. Three central ideas were established:

1\. ‘Kaitiaki’ – the care of people and place. We want to welcome people to our country as friends.

2\. Integrity – mana is embodied by trust, honesty and humility. New Zealanders pride themselves on being easy to work with and humble in our achievements.

3\. Resourcefulness – We have the ’number 8 wire’ approach to thinking. We are always innovative and have a different way of thinking about things. This allows us to be innovative with our designs and services.

Minister Joyce says “This project is about expanding the international brand beyond the scenic beauty of the country to include attributes like our excellent education system, Māori heritage and our welcoming friendly approach.”

A toolkit of resources makes up the core elements of the New Zealand Story and will be available through www.newzealand.com. The toolkit includes key messages, imagery, video, music and guidelines for use. These resources are available to businesses and schools/universities in both the public and private sectors to use to tell their own story.
