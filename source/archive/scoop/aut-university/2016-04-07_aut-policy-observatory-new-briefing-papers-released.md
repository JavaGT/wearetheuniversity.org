**AUT Policy Observatory: New briefing papers released**

Three new briefing papers are now available on The Briefing Papers website:

**The Precariat and the Future of Work**  
_Guy Standing, Professor of Development Studies, School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London._

“For many foreign observers, New Zealand seems like an oasis, while the rest of the world economy plunges from crisis to crisis. But no country can escape the forces of globalisation, the ongoing technological revolution and the slow fuse impact of several decades of neo-liberal policies that have transformed the basis of the economic system and the social structures around it.”

_A Universal Basic Income may be a good idea – but we will still need social security that works_  
**Michael Fletcher, Senior Researcher, The Policy Observatory and Convenor of the Social Policy Network.**

“Strong arguments, both philosophical and practical, can be made for incorporating a UBI into our tax-benefit system. But if our objectives include social security – ensuring an adequate minimum living standard for all and minimising poverty – then we will still need an effective social assistance system sitting alongside it…”

_Universal Basic Income and Income Tax Reform_  
**Keith Rankin, economic historian and economics lecturer, Unitec.**

“The New Zealand Labour Party is investigating, among other things, the adoption of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) as a means of ensuring reduced economic insecurity in the face of an increasingly precarious labour market.”

The Briefing Papers are part of AUT’s Policy Observatory, which brings together top scholars to produce independent, peer-reviewed research on the policies and practices that shape the way that New Zealand responds to issues. The latest briefing papers, research reports and commentaries can be found on The Policy Observatory website and Twitter.
