MEDIA RELEASE:

AuSM Orientation 2010

Fat Freddy’s Drop will headline AuSM Orientation 2010 and AUT University students can snap up tickets for as little as $5.

While other venues are charging more than $80 a ticket for Fat Freddy’s concerts, AuSM is offering $5 earlybird tickets to AUT students, $15 to other tertiary and $40 for the public. Door sales will be $30 for all tertiary and $40 for the public.

AuSM Student President Veronica Ng Lam said the organisation slashed ticket prices to make the gig more accessible to its members.

“AuSM exists to provide an entertaining, supportive and safe environment for students to enjoy when they are studying at AUT, not to make money.”

Ng Lam said tickets were already selling fast from AuSM, AUSA and Eventfinder and the event was expected to sell-out.

AuSM Orientation will run from March 1 until 12 with highlights including Smashproof, Sons of Zion, IPW Wrestling, live Red Bull DJs and I Am Giant.

High profile funny guys Jamie Bowen (Pulp Comedy), Steve Wrigley (7 Days) and Ben Hurley (@Seven) will also take to the stage for a free comedy night at Vesbar on March 8.

“Aside from Fat Freddy’s and the Diamond Day at Ellerslie Race Course all AuSM Orientation events are free to AUT students and we will also dish out 800 free hot lunches every day. We want to make those first two weeks of semester as care-free as possible,” said Ng Lam.
