AUT University fees set for 2006

The Council of AUT University voted last night to increase tuition fees for domestic enrolments by $189 per undergraduate and pre-degree student for 2006, taking fees to $3987.

With the support of AuSM, AUT’s Students’ Association, the University has maintained a flat fee structure across all undergraduate and pre-degree programmes.

Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack said the 5% increase was necessary to help ensure the University continued to advance the quality of education and meet student demands.

“We are part way through a decade of transformation, requiring rebuilding and

investment in capability and enhanced quality,” said Mr McCormack.  
“AUT did not apply to go outside the fee maxima set by the Government and our fees are still among the lowest in the country,” Mr McCormack added. “While the Council would prefer not to have increased tuition fees, it is in no-one’s interest for the University to reduce its standards.”

AUT is also raising the fee for post-graduate programmes by $500 (13%) per domestic student. The tuition fee for most domestic post-graduate students in 2006 will be $4293.

“Since its introduction the PBRF system has progressively cut back the tuition funding for postgraduate students to the point where postgraduate programmes are now barely viable. Higher fees for these programmes are justified, particularly at a time when AUT University is investing heavily in research infrastructure.”

Government funding in 2006 will only increase by 2.6% - well below the anticipated rate of inflation. This adds further financial pressure to all universities.
