AUT research reveals public desire for access to Onehunga Wharf

  
A survey on the use and tourism potential of the Manukau Harbour has revealed strong support for allowing public access to the Onehunga Wharf as a hub for community and visitors.

AUT University’s New Zealand Tourism Research Institute (NZTRI) surveyed 272 visitors to the area and 688 residents on behalf of the Manukau Harbour Restoration Society.

Results show that the majority of respondents strongly agreed with the idea of developing Onehunga Wharf as a hub to provide facilities for passenger ferries, boat charters and water taxis to improve transport options and linkages across the Manukau Harbour.

Visitors and residents were generally in favour of opening up Onehunga Wharf and both visitors and residents strongly disagreed with the suggestion to leave the wharf as it is.

AUT Professor Simon Milne, who led the research says, “Seventy seven per cent of visitors and 87% of residents surveyed were largely in support of redeveloping the Onehunga Wharf and opening it up to the public. I think that’s a good indication of the benefits it will bring to the community as a public space.”

Survey responses also included suggestions on how the wharf could be developed including cafes, bars, restaurants and a fish market. “In the past the wharf served communities around the harbour. We see it playing this role again in the future, with a lively Onehunga as a hub for transportation, services and recreation, especially with the foreshore restoration underway”, says Jim Jackson, chair of the Manukau Harbour Restoration Society which commissioned the study.

Suggestions for the wharf included a location for marine-related industry, a museum, marine and harbour heritage education as well as a visitor centre.

“The fishing industry is an important part of the history of the wharf. It was good to have this acknowledged in the survey and see public support to provide improved facilities for the fishing fleet. Tourists and residents enjoy watching fish being landed and New Zealand has a unique story to tell about sustainable fishing with its world leading quota management system. This will add value to any future development” says Shane Walsh, Inshore Manager, Sanford Limited

The majority of visitors completing the survey were Aucklanders from outside the Manukau Harbour area. The most frequently visited areas were the Waitakere Ranges, Waiuku and the Awhitu Peninsula and the Mangere-Otahuhu area. Visitors commented on the level of pollution around the harbour and poor infrastructure and facilities. This was echoed by the residents who, while they value the natural environment and recreation opportunities so close to the city, also rate pollution and lack of local infrastructure and facilities as least appealing aspects of living in the area.

“It is pleasing to see the results from the survey show that visitors and residents support the vision and strategies the Manukau Harbour Forum has for the whole harbour and how important the wharf at Onehunga is to opening up the harbour to all the communities around it” says Jill Naysmith, Chair of the Manukau Harbour Forum.

All the results of the survey can be found on the website of the Manukau Harbour Restoration Society at www.mhrs.org.nz together with Phase 1 of the study which provided information on activities and amenities around the harbour.

The Manukau Harbour Restoration Society thanks the nine local boards of the Manukau Harbour Forum of Auckland Council for funding for the study of which the survey is a part: “Unlocking the recreation and tourism potential of the Manukau Harbour”.
