AUT first in NZ to use Xero Lifelong Learning Platform

AUT students are the first in New Zealand actively working on the Xero Lifelong Learning Platform (XLLP). Being the forerunner in embracing new technology in its accounting curriculum, AUT is also the first university to look at becoming a Xero education partner and have the opportunity to certify accounting tutors in Xero.

Leaders in the New Zealand, Australian, and United Kingdom cloud accounting markets, Xero is a global small business accounting platform for small businesses and their advisors.

Michelle Taggart, Xero’s Community and Industry Education Manager, said: “Being the first university department to use the Xero Lifelong Learning Platform and become certified with Xero is a great moment to celebrate. I am so impressed with the commitment of AUT’s teaching staff to embrace new technology, learning and curriculum. We look forward to building a strong partnership with AUT.”

Professor Kate Kearins, Dean, AUT Business School, said: “We are pleased to collaborate with Xero, with the aim of offering our staff and students locally and globally relevant learning opportunities. Our partnerships with industry are key to ensuring our students graduate with skills relevant to today’s workplace.”

AUT accounting lecturers undertook a full day training session to become formally qualified Xero educators.

The training is the result of an AUT initiative to not only to gain more in-depth knowledge on Xero, but also to explore the potential of how AUT might further incorporate Xero to enhance the learning experience of our students.

Professor Asheq Rahman, Head of Department, Accounting said: “One of our focus areas as a department over the last few years has been to introduce accounting students to new and emerging technologies in the field. Our certification with Xero has increased the suite of accounting software we now teach in our papers. We’re looking forward to continued engagement with Xero, and the value it brings to our teaching this dynamic discipline.”

The introduction of XLLP to the curriculum and certification with Xero is another step towards providing our graduates a critical edge in today’s fast-changing workplace. It arms them with the skills needed to stay ahead of technological developments in accounting fields and to become work-ready graduates.
