New journalism scholarship announced

AUT University and community newspaper Indian Newslink have launched a journalism scholarship in a bid to boost the standard and practice of the profession.

Indian Newslink will pay the tuition fee, Student Services Fee and Student Association Fee for one student admitted every year into one of the university’s one-year postgraduate programmes, including the postgraduate diploma in Communication Studies (journalism) and the Bachelor of Communication Studies (Hons).

The programme, open to all New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, is aimed at creating a new generation of quality journalists and foster professional standards of journalism in New Zealand.

Indian Newslink publisher Ravin Lal says, as a community newspaper entering its 10th year the publication wanted to “give something back to the community”.

He says because of the Indian community’s strong interest in education, the topic has been always been a focus of the newspaper.

AUT University vice-chancellor Derek McCormack says the university is thrilled to have a partnership with Indian Newslink.

“I think it’s a really strong initiative to support us with this scholarship and hope that the rest of the news media will take note and follow their lead.”

The first scholarship will be awarded this year, for the 2010 intake.
