AUT Disappointed by Inaccurate Reporting

AUT Disappointed by Inaccurate Reporting

AUT’s Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack this morning expressed his disappointment at the woeful standard of reporting in today’s NZ Herald, namely the article headlined, “National slams pet pedicure uni course’. The story implies that AUT runs a course in animal homeopathy; AUT runs no such course.

“That report is completely false,” said Derek McCormack. “If Mr English’s office had bothered to check the facts before misinforming him, and if the NZ Herald had bothered to check, they would have realised that all AUT does is rent a room on weekends to the Bay of Plenty College of Homeopathy. In other words, we’re trying to get some financial return from an empty space and that is the limit of AUT’s involvement.”

In light of the current controversy over some non-degree tertiary courses it behoves commentators to carefully check their information, as inaccurate comments can do considerable damage to reputations.
