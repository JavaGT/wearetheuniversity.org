Be Fascinated at AUT University
===============================

**Be Fascinated at AUT University**

AUT University is inviting Auckland to be fascinated at the School of Art and Design Festival, AD13.

The festival is a showcase of every area of design at AUT including, product design, graphic design, visual design and spatial design.

Tonight is the industry launch of the event and an opportunity for students to show their work to potential employers, before the public are invited to come and see what our talented students have created this year.

The festival is open Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 10am until 6pm daily and spaces right across the AUT City Campus are being utilised.

Just one of the works being presented during the four-day festival is Neerali Parbhu’s _‘Sprout’_ IV pole project, currently being developed. Once development is finished, this product will be in use at Starship Children’s Hospital, thanks to support from the Starship Foundation and Mercury Energy.

Also part of the festival is the AUT Fashion Showroom, a chance for guests to see more of the AUT fashion student work, before or after the AUT Rookie Fashion Show on tomorrow night at Shed 10, Queens Wharf, Auckland.
