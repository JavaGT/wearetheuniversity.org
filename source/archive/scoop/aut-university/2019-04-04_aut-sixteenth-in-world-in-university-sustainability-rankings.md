Auckland University of Technology (AUT) is sixteenth in the world in the newly released Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings that assess the social impact of universities against the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Of the seventeen goals, AUT ranked number two for Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11) covering sustainable practices such as research promoting remote working, affordable housing, and investment in art and heritage.

In Gender Equality (SDG 5) AUT is ninth in the world, recognising the percentage of research by female academics, outreach to female students in areas including STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and policies implemented to enable gender equality.

New Zealand universities have excelled in the rankings with University of Auckland achieving first place and Massey University placing number 38.

The rankings support AUT’s commitment to the United Nations SDGs, highlighted by the launch of itsSustainability Roadmap in 2018.

Chair of the AUT Sustainability Taskforce, Professor Thomas Neitzert noted that work in the area of sustainability is ongoing and in line with AUT’s deliberate focus on technological transformation, external impact and industry connections.

“Our students, stakeholders and community expect sustainability to be a priority for AUT. We believe advancing knowledge and understanding of the issues and opportunities around creating a sustainable future is essential,” said Professor Neitzert.
