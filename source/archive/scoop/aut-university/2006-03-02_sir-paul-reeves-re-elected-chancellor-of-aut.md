The Council of AUT University has announced the re-election of Sir Paul Reeves as the University's Chancellor and Jocelyn Martin as Pro Chancellor in 2006.

Congratulating Sir Paul, the Vice-Chancellor, Derek McCormack said the University was delighted that Sir Paul was to remain as Chancellor and looked forward to his continued contribution to AUT’s development.

"Sir Paul is a great asset to AUT University and we are delighted that he has accepted re-appointment as Chancellor," Derek McCormack said.

"My appointment as the University’s Chancellor is an honour and I am thrilled and humbled by the opportunity," Sir Paul said. "AUT is an innovative and contemporary university that is pro-active in addressing the issues facing tertiary education.”

Sir Paul has had an extensive career in public life, including a term as New Zealand Governor General. Currently he works independently as a director and consultant in several spheres of government in New Zealand, and in the international sphere for the Commonwealth Secretariat. This is his second year on AUT’s Council and his second term as Chancellor.

Jocelyn Martin has been re-elected for a second term as Pro Chancellor. She is a partner in the law firm Minter Ellison and has been on the AUT Council as a Ministerial appointment for three years.
