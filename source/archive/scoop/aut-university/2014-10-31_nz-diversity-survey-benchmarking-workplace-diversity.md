**NZ Diversity Survey - benchmarking workplace diversity**

  
AUT University’s New Zealand Work Research Institute (NZWRI) has released a report on diversity in New Zealand workplaces.

The report, based on data collected from business owners and employers between November 2013 and August 2014, is available at: http://[www.workresearch.aut.ac.nz/nzdiversitysurvey](http://www.workresearch.aut.ac.nz/nzdiversitysurvey)

Professor Tim Bentley, Director of the NZWRI, led the research in collaboration with the EEO Trust and the Chamber of Commerce, Northern.

**Key findings**

**Important diversity issues**  
The diversity issues most commonly perceived as important to organisations were: wellbeing, ageing workforce and flexibility. For many of those issues, organisations had a policy or programme/initiative in place, particularly for bullying and harassment (more than 80% of organisations). But less than 40% of organisations had a policy or programme relating to the ageing workforce.

**Most common diversity practice**  
Flexible work arrangements including teleworking were the most common diversity practice, with approximately 60% of respondents’ organisations having staff members that telework at least one day a week.

**Female representation**  
On average females held just under half of leadership and governance roles, but in both cases the proportion of female representation decreased with increased organisation size.

**Disability and accessibility**  
Nearly 75% of respondents reported that their organisations were accessible for people who live with disabilities, a figure that improved as organisation size increased.

**Ethnic minority representation**  
Less than 40% of respondents’ organisations had ethnic minority representation within their leadership or decision-making teams, with representation more likely in larger organisations.
