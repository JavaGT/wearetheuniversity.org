**Designer molecules enabling major advances in biomedical science**

Imagine being able to modify the surface characteristics of living cells to achieve an endless range of biomedical benefits. Professor Stephen Henry, Director of AUT University’s Biotechnology Research Institute and CEO of KODE Biotech Limited, has developed a technology which makes this possible enabling breakthroughs in quality control systems for blood grouping and diagnostic research, and a range of novel therapeutic applications.

While studying blood group systems, Henry invented a novel biomedical platform called KODE™ Technology using a natural molecule with an ability to ‘hop’ onto cells. A limitation of this first generation of KODE™ Technology was the limited solubility of the natural molecule.

“Together with my Russian colleague Professor Nicolai Bovin we took this natural molecule and completely re-engineered it so that different elements such as carbohydrates, peptides, proteins, biotin and fluorophores could be added to it. These synthetic molecules (KODE™ Constructs) had the added benefit that they were readily dispersible in water.”

This second generation of KODE™ Technology is a range of constructs with an almost unlimited repertoire of bioactive head groups. In the form of a KODE™ Construct these head groups can be quantitatively attached to the outside of cells. This simple technique opens up substantial new opportunities for research into novel diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

“It is the combination of dispersiblity in water, spontaneous incorporation into cell membranes, and low toxicity that makes KODE™ Constructs such a valuable research tool,” says Henry.

KODE Biotech Limited is now both licensing KODE™ Technology to transnational companies and selling KODE™ Constructs for research and development use via its subsidiary KODE™ Biotech Materials Limited.

The first major product arising from the use of KODE™ Technology is a blood grouping quality control system. AUT scientists were able to control the attachment of specific amounts of blood group A and B molecules onto group O cells and thereby create a blood grouping analytical quality control system.

Research into the attachment of other carbohydrate and peptide molecules onto red blood cells has now created a range of designer cells (“kodecytes”) that can be used in existing blood grouping platforms for diagnostic purposes. The capital and training costs associated with establishing new laboratory assays are thereby reduced.

Work in the area of assisted reproductive technologies has seen the development of KODE™ modified “sticky” embryos.

“Early results are showing that these “sticky” embryos have the potential to improve implantation rates, but a lot more research is required before a clinical product eventuates,” says Henry.

Further advances in the area of immunology, both diagnostic and therapeutic, are anticipated to have substantial impact on transfusion and transplantation. Early work has also shown the potential of KODE™ Constructs as therapeutics to inhibit viral infection, including HIV, possibly by acting as non-functioning receptor mimics.

“Although further extensive research is required the technology looks promising as a viral therapeutic,” says Henry.

More recently KODE™ Constructs have been investigated for use in inkjet printers. The properties of the molecules have proven to be particularly good in the fabrication of bioarrays using the type of inkjet printer many people have in their home or office.

“KODE™ Constructs are a new class of molecule with a novel combination of properties. At this stage, their uses are only limited by the imagination of the user,” says Henry.

KODE Biotech Limited’s existing licensees and research partners include pharmaceutical companies, medical research institutes and universities. KODE Biotech Limited works with its research partners to evaluate the use of KODE™ Technology in a new application and then licenses the use of KODE™ Constructs for use in that application. The role of its subsidiary company KODE Biotech Materials Limited is to ensure that quality-assured KODE™ Constructs are available for commercialization by KODE Biotech Limited’s licensees.

“We have a product in the market that is generating its own momentum. My driver is to try and get global uptake of KODE™ Technology. I would hope that within 10 years’ time, every diagnostic and research laboratory in the world will be using some form of KODE™ Technology, plus I hope to see a variety of therapeutic applications as well.”
