Next week AUT University hosts the Minister of Health, the Hon. Tony Ryall, where he will discuss the Government’s health agenda.

The Minister is one of four speakers who feature in the 2011 AUT Public Lecture Series, hosted by Max Abbott, Professor of Psychology and Public Health and Dean of AUT’s Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences.

Professor Abbott says this year’s lecture series will address a range of issues pertinent to social development and overall health and wellbeing of the nation.

"Part of a university’s statutory responsibility is to be an informed critic and conscience of society. New Zealand faces enormous challenges in meeting the health needs of an ageing, ethnically diverse population. Subsequently, the purpose of this lecture series is to address priority issues affecting the health sector and generate public debate.”

Speakers include:  
\- 26 September: **Hon. Tony Ryall, Minister of Health** – The Government’s health agenda.  
\- 17 October: **Professor Iain Martin, former Dean of the University of Auckland’s Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences** – Serving two masters, bridging the education/health agenda’s.  
\- 31 October: **Dr Dale Bramley, new CEO of the Waitemata District Health Board** – Lifting the performance of the public health system.  
\- 7 November: **Professor Jonathon Gray, Director of Ko Awatea at Counties Manukau District Health Board** – Supporting system improvements.

**Event details**: Mondays, 4.30 – 6.00pm, AUT University North Shore Campus, AF Conference Centre, 90 Akoranga Drive, Northcote, Auckland.
