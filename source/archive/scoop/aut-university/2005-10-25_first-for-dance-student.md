First for Dance Student

AUT University’s Masters of Health Science student Jennifer de Leon’s ground-breaking thesis has been awarded First Class Honours.

The 49-year-old is the first person in New Zealand to have a dance performance accepted as part of a Master’s degree thesis (along with a written exegesis of 45,000 words).

This achievement is even more significant considering Jennifer had a motorbike accident in 1989.

"I was told I would never walk again – let alone dance," says Jennifer.

Since then she has had nine leg and knee operations (the latest in September) and seven years on crutches.

To celebrate this achievement, Jennifer is performing her dance work Stillpoint to the public on November 1 - 2 at 8pm, Hopetoun Alpha, Auckland City. Tickets are $20 or $10 for students, bookings phone (09) 3761 671.
