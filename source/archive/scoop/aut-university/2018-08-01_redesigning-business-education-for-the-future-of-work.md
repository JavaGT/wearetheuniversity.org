AUT Business School and the School of Economics are refreshing the Bachelor of Business to ensure its students continue to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to succeed in a rapidly changing business world.

Business leaders tell us they need graduates to be agile, creative and able to work effectively across different functions in a business, says Professor Kate Kearins, Pro Vice-Chancellor and Dean, Faculty of Business, Economics and Law.

“We have optimised our already very effective business degree to ensure our graduates are ready to thrive in the ever-changing world of work,” she says.

From 2019 students enrolling in the flagship Bachelor of Business will be embarking on a programme of study, developed in conjunction with industry leaders, that lets students study multidisciplinary subjects alongside a business specialisation.

“As a university we set ourselves apart with a teaching philosophy that prioritises student engagement and emphasises action-based learning experiences,” says Professor Kearins.

“At the heart of our teaching and research is collaboration with business, the professions and the community.”

All students will undertake workplace experience, either through a work placement, an applied research project or by starting a business venture before graduating. Many students are graduating with a job offer secured from their placement.

A focus on social impact is one of the enhancements made to the Bachelor of Business. By studying contemporary issues students consider ethical approaches to business decision-making and problem solving, and develop an enhanced understanding and appreciation of what it means to practice business in a responsible way.

“We want to inspire our students to make a difference in the business world and beyond,” Professor Kearins says.
