AUT celebrating Pride Parade

Watch out Auckland! The Fabulous Makeover Girls, Buffy and Bimbo, will be swinging down Ponsonby Road aboard the AUT University float at this year’s Auckland Pride Parade.

Well known in the Rainbow community since 1997, Buffy and Bimbo are the alter egos of Kevin Baker and Jonathan Smith respectively. Kevin, currently works as the Head of Counselling at AUT and Jonathan is a self-employed event manager, who is managing the AUT entry this year.

When asked of their involvement with AUT the girls stated “We are delighted to be involved with the 2015 AUT Pride Parade Float. AUT is a very strong and pro-active Rainbow friendly university so we want to give back by showing our support to their students and staff. Congratulations to the float production and design team as the float concept is fantastic.”

AUT’s entry into the parade can be seen on Saturday 21 February from 7pm.

Note to editors: AUT University has become the first tertiary provider in New Zealand to be awarded a Rainbow Tick for the level of engagement and support shown to the Rainbow community both internally and externally. For information about AUT’s Rainbow Tick click here.
