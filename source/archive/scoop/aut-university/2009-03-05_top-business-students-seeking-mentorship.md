Top business students seeking mentorship

AUT University’s top business students are seeking mentorship from New Zealand’s best business leaders.

Students in Free Enterprise (SIFE AUT) develop projects for community groups to improve – and sometimes save – lives.

Past projects have included a successful pilot blood donation campaign targeting 18-25-year-olds; mentoring low income families on how to gain wealth through health; and providing work skill seminars and support for young mothers seeking to return to the workforce.

SIFE AUT president and Masters of Business student Clare George says by supporting the students, business mentors will be supporting some of New Zealand’s most deserving communities.

“Our thirst for knowledge is fuelled by New Zealand’s best business professionals’ desire to share it,” she says. “In 2009, we intend to build a strong army of national advisors to ensure we give Kiwi community groups the best support possible.”

George adds that in recessionary times businesses are financially strained but this is an opportunity for them to help without reaching into wallets.

“Corporate social responsibility is increasingly important and we hope that asking for business professionals to lend us their time that the end result is creating a better New Zealand from the ground up.”

SIFE AUT is seeking advisors from all business disciplines and work experience, “from those fresh in the workforce, to CEOs,” adds George.

SIFE AUT represented New Zealand at the SIFE World Cup the past three years in a row and were placed in the top 16 teams in the world from 1800 institutions.
