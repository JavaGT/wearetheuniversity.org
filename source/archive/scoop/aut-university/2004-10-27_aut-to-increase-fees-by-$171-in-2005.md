AUT to increase fees by $171 in 2005

The Council of Auckland University of Technology voted last night to increase tuition fees for domestic enrolments by $171 per student for 2005.

Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack said the modest increase was necessary to help ensure the University continued to meet the needs of students.

“Our fees are still among the lowest in the country. While the Council would prefer not to have to increase tuition fees, it is in no-one’s interest for the University to cut back on growth or reduce standards.

“Over the past four years AUT has been one of the fastest growing universities in the country. We are committed to a programme of development which will enable us to meet the needs of current and future students.”

Mr McCormack said that while the Council was reluctant to increase fees, it was more reluctant to reduce the value the University can deliver to students and stakeholders.

At the request of AUSM, AUT’s Students’ Association, the University has maintained a flat fee structure across all degrees. The 2004 student tuition fee is $3627 per annum and this will increase to $3798 for 2005, an increase of 4.7% on 2004.
