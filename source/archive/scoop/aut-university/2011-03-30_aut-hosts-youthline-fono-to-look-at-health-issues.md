**AUT hosts Youthline Fono to look at health issues affecting Manukau youth**

Tomorrow AUT and Youthline Manukau are hosting a Youth Health Council Fono where up to 300 secondary students will look at key health issues affecting Manukau youth and the difference health promotion makes in the community.

Taking place at AUT’s Manukau campus, year 12 and 13 students from across the region will consider a variety of health and social issues from healthy eating to alcohol and drug harm.

The role that health promotion plays in the community can make a huge difference by helping people to take responsibility for their health and to make healthier lifestyle choices, says Ruth De Souza, programme leader for Health Promotion at AUT and coordinator of the National Institute for Public Health and Mental Health Research (NIPHMHR).

“Prevention is better than cure. Many health and social issues such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, alcohol and drug harm are largely preventable. Health promotion practitioners work with individuals and communities to improve health and prevent illness and disease.”

Youth Health Councils play a vital role dealing with the entire wellbeing of a person, often setting up initiatives to improve the health status of youth, says Grace Taylor, Youth Development Worker at Youthline.

“If youth can be supported to take responsibility for their own health and wellbeing and to make positive changes now, the flow on effects for the future will be invaluable.”

A report from the Counties Manukau District Health Board in December highlights the need for Youth Health Councils - it states that less than 1 in 10 adults in Counties Manukau aged 15 and over are leading a healthy lifestyle.

De Souza says that one of the key impacts of health promotion is working with the community.

“Manukau is one of the most dynamic places in New Zealand. As the first university in the Manukau area, AUT are playing an important role towards improving the health and wellbeing of this multi-ethnic community.”

The Fono - supported by Counties Manukau District Health Board and the ASB Charitable Trust - will also help connect students who have an interest working in the health care sector with people they could potentially work with.
