Celebrating Elwyn Richardson’s legacy of art in education
=========================================================

**Celebrating Elwyn Richardson’s legacy of art in education**

Artists, teachers and researchers will celebrate the legacy of renowned educationalist Elwyn Richardson at a symposium with art exhibition on Wednesday 17 July. 

Until his death in December 2012, Richardson championed the role of art in education, and is credited with making a lasting change to local and international education policy.

AUT University’s School of Education is hosting the 17 July event at its North Shore Campus.  Speakers who will reflect on Richardson’s education philosophy include Professor Helen May from the University of Otago, Dr Margaret McDonald, who wrote her doctoral thesis about Richardson, and AUT School of Education Research Associate Dr Joce Jesson.

The exhibition accompanying the symposium, _Art at Work_, will feature archival children’s work and contemporary artists’ work curated by Janita Craw and Victoria O’Sullivan.  The exhibition includes works by Jim Allen (a long-standing friend and colleague of Richardson) and potter Barry Brickell.  Artist Martin Langdon will also help to bring Richardson’s ideas alive on the day, with a hands-on printmaking experience.

“This event will touch a major period in New Zealand educational and art history.  The idea behind it is to strengthen the community of interest in art, art education, the history of New Zealand education and progressive education,” says symposium organiser, Senior Lecturer Janita Craw.
