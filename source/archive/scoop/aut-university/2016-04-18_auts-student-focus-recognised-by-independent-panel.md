**AUT’s Student Focus Recognised by Independent Panel**

An independent audit has shown AUT students benefit from the University’s focus on providing opportunity and being ‘genuinely centred on teaching, learning and student engagement’.

The AUT Academic Audit Report from the Academic Quality Agency (AQA) has commended “the priority placed on being student-focussed, prioritising excellent teaching and enhancing student opportunity and success”.

Released on 18 April, the audit report states “AUT is characterised by a philosophy which is widely understood by staff and is directly translated into practice”.

Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack says the AQA Academic Audit Report underlines a key philosophy.

“Overall, we are very pleased with the audit result which confirms the directions we are taking to achieve an enriched experience of advanced education for our students.”

Among the 11 commendations were a number relating to the development of the University’s campuses through a systematic, internationally benchmarked approach to learning space design that provides an inclusive and safe campus for all students and staff. The audit made special mention of the success of the AUT South Campus initiative, which saw the development of the first and only university campus in South Auckland.

In relation to its students, the University was commended for a proactive and inclusive approach to enhancing student engagement, as well as for identifying the learning needs of students, providing appropriate support, and maximising access to that support. Of particular note was the very high proportion of students – over 80% – who took part in work-integrated learning.

Receiving a more general commendation was the way AUT’s approach to planning, decision-making, monitoring, analysis and reporting was evidence-based and data-driven. Other commendations related to programme approval processes, academic integrity, postgraduate processes and procedures, and the training and support of academic supervisors.
