============================================================

**Press Release: [AUT](https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT)**

**Finalists for the 2015 AUT Faculty of Business and Law Excellence in Business Support Awards have been announced today.**

“The importance of excellent business support runs through everything we do in the AUT Faculty of Business and Law, from teaching to research to co-operative education and industry engagement,” says AUT Dean of Business and Law, Professor Geoff Perry.

“The large number of entries from technology companies this year highlights the important role technology can play in enhancing business support, and entrants in the two technology categories have achieved particularly strong scores at this stage.”

Finalists for each of the ten categories have until 17 July to submit their final applications, which will then be evaluated by academics from the AUT Business School. Evaluation of applications is overseen by the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation.

In evaluating applications the judges will consider: leadership and planning, customer and market focus, provision of business support and evaluation and improvement, with a focus on results.

Now into their tenth year, the AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards are the only national performance measure for New Zealand business support organisations.

Winners of the ten category awards and the supreme award will be named at a gala dinner on 29 October.
