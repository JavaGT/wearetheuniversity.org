If the answer is yes, read on: these are some of many diverse dance styles being showcased to the public next week at the “Soul’d Out Dance Show”, performed by students from the Auckland University of Technology as part of their Bachelor of Dance (BDance) degree.

Kirstie Shand from west Auckland, Brony Gale from east Auckland and Sarah Tenwolde from the North Shore are three of eighteen students studying AUT’s dance teacher education-focussed BDance programme.

For the past 15 weeks they have all been rehearsing for their end of year performance at Epsom Girls Grammar School.

Susan Graham, lecturer, says dancing before an audience gives the students an opportunity to share and showcase their creative and artistic work upon completion of their end of year programme assessments.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for the students to demonstrate what they have learned over the past year of studying dance,” she says.

“Staff and students from the programme have created a visual feast of original dance works for the performance, and we invite all dance enthusiasts to come along. It will be a great night!”

There will also be guest appearances by students from the Auckland City Theatre Academy, led by the renowned Donnell family.

Tickets are available for the show from Ticketek and all proceeds will support the MOVE AUT Dance Foundation Alumni or Epsom Girls Grammar School Creative Arts Centre Funds.

Date: Tuesday 18 November 2003 Venue: Epsom Girls’ Grammar School Hall, Epsom Time: 8 pm Cost: Adults $12, Student $10, Group of 10+ $8 each.

All welcome.
