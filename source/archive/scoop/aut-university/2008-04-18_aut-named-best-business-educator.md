AUT named best business educator

AUT Business School has been named New Zealand's best business educator at the Vero Excellence in Business Support Awards 2008.

Around 96% of New Zealand businesses are small-to-medium sized and the awards recognise organisations and individuals that support them.

AUT's real-world approach to teaching its business degree students was key to its success in the awards. This includes strong links with industry leaders who also contribute to curriculum development, a unique student co-op internship programme and an emphasis on students creating real and successful businesses which have to post a profit.

Another factor was the Business School's building which was codesigned by Business Dean, Professor Des Graydon. Students sit around tables in small purpose-built classrooms which encourages discussion with teachers and each other.

BDO Spicers chairperson Judith Stanway says the awards celebrate the best in New Zealand business support.

\"BDO Spicers is continually impressed by AUT's ability to take the pick of international best practice models and implement them in the highly competitive New Zealand education market," she says. "In particular the co-op placement programme is widely recognised as developing work-ready graduates with a real understanding of the business environment."

The awards were announced at a black tie gala dinner last night attended by Minister for Small Business the Honourable Clayton Cosgrove and New Zealand's leading SMEs.

The AUT Business School was one of 48 finalists in 11 award categories ranging from large businesses, public private sector partnerships and not-for-profit. Entrants in the education provider category included the University of Otago, Lincoln, Massey and Canterbury universities, The Knowledge Gym and The Results Group.

Vero Insurance chief executive Roger Bell says through their support, the award winners have given New Zealand companies a competitive and sustainable edge.

"The AUT Business School joins the prestigious list of award-winners that demonstrate international levels of best practice in their businesses and have quality support as a key 'point of difference'," he says.

Finalists were chosen after a "rigorous and objective evaluation" by the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation which manages the awards and the winners represent the top of the crop, he says.

AUT Tech Park (now AUT Innovation Park) was a finalist in the High Growth Sector.
