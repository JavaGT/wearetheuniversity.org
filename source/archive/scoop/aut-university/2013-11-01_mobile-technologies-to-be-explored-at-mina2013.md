**Mobile social media, mobile technologies, production and aesthetics to be explored at MINA2013**

From November 18 – 22, 2013 AUT University will be the home of a series of events exploring mobile technologies in film, education, business and creativity. The week begins with a two-day mobile filmmaking workshop, and moves into the Mobile Creativity and Mobile Innovation Symposium and International Mobile Innovation Screenings.

The events are co-hosted by MINA (Mobile Innovation Network Aotearoa), Colab (AUT University) and School of Art & Design (AUT University) in collaboration with the School of Design at the College of Creative Arts (Massey University, Wellington).

The 2013 MINA Symposium and Screening is centred around the question, _‘how are mobile and social media technologies used to create innovation through creative and cultural practices?’_ and will seek to answer this question through presentations of papers, workshops, poster presentations, performances, project showcases and mobile screenings in situ and via live web-broadcasts.

The key events are:

**3rd Mobile Creativity and Mobile Innovation Symposium**  
21 - 22 November | 9am – 6pm  
The Symposium provides a platform for filmmakers, artists, designers, researchers and industry professionals to debate the prospect of wireless, mobile and ubiquitous technologies in art and design environments, education, and the creative industries. Keynote speakers are **Helen Keegan (University of Salford, UK)** and **Larissa Hjorth (RMIT University, Australia).** Presenter topics range from _‘Twitter, Instagram and Micro Narratives’, ‘Collaborative Mobile-Mentaries (mobile documentary)’, ‘The Brown Book: Māori in Screen Production’_ to _Instagram Video and the Creation of Slow Media, ‘mobile location-based augmented reality gaming’_ and _‘the democratization of Mobile Filmmaking’._
