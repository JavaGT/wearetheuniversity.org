Media release about the Metro Project Maori Economic Development Forum at AUT's Te Horotiu marae tomorrow (Wednesday):

Forum explores Maori economic development

The importance of Maori participation in any economic development strategy for the Auckland region will be outlined to an international panel of experts at a forum at AUT University tomorrow.

The Centre for Maori Innovation and Development, a joint venture between AUT University and Auckland University, is hosting the forum for the international review team which is visiting Auckland this week as part of the Metro Project.

Facilitator Amokura Panoho says the kaupapa of the forum is to highlight the strategic role of Maori in six key areas: academia, business and commerce, the workforce, asset base (Maori relationship to the land, sea, mountains and rivers), Maori relationship with the Crown, and the creative sector.

We have selected six speakers who will ensure the review team receives quality information that assists them in their advisory role for the Metro Project, says Ms Panoho.

The Metro Project is based on a partnership between AUTs Institute of Public Policy, Committee for Auckland and the Auckland Regional Council, with key involvement by central government and the Growth and Innovation Advisory Board.

The international review team of six, headed by Greg Clark, advisor on City and Regional Development to the OECD, is working with local experts to develop action plans and help Auckland realise its potential as a world-class city-region.
