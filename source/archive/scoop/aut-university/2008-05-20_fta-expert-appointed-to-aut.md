FTA expert appointed to AUT

Free Trade Agreement expert Dr Rahul Sen has been appointed as lecturer of business economics at the AUT Business School.

Dr Sen received a Doctor of Philosophy in Economics from the National University of Singapore and has an extensive research background in regional economic integration issues in the Asia-Pacific, particularly Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).

His expertise gained global recognition at the 2006 IMF-World Bank Annual Program of Seminars in Singapore which included his paper on FTAs and the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (ASEAN) member countries.

Dr Sen has also been invited to present his views on Asian Trade policy at international forums organized by groups including the CESIfo Munich, SWP-Berlin, and Friedrich Ebert Stiftung.

Prior to joining AUT, Dr Sen was a Fellow with the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) from 2003-07 based in Singapore. At ISEAS, Dr Sen was responsible for co-editing the ASEAN Economic Bulletin journal and coordinating the activities of the institute's Trade Policy Unit.

At AUT, Dr Sen teaches International Trade Economics in the bachelor of business degree. He says he's looking forward to embracing AUT's teaching philosophy

"The focus on staff-student interaction and student-centred learning in small classrooms is unusual but highly effective," he says. "I have learnt very quickly that only the highest quality teaching and research is acceptable here.

"This is challenging but very rewarding and I look forward to playing my part in this exciting environment."

Dr Sen is author of several books, book chapters and media articles.
