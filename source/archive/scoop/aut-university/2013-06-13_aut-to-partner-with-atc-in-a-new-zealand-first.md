**AUT to partner with ATC in a New Zealand first**

AUT University is investing $5 million in the Waterfront Theatre Project at Auckland’s Wynyard Quarter’s Innovation Precinct. The new partnership with Auckland Theatre Company (ATC), whereby AUT will own 15% of the limited liability company established to develop, own and maintain the new theatre, is the first of its kind in New Zealand.

AUT is delighted to be working with ATC, Auckland’s flagship professional theatre company, on an initiative that strengthens Auckland’s creative economy, promotes the waterfront as a visitor destination and showcases the region’s performing arts.

“The new theatre will be a centre for cultural development and expression in New Zealand and AUT is thrilled to be part of bringing that to Auckland. The initiative is an investment in our community, and a relationship that will benefit students, the artists and wider society”, says AUT’s Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack.

AUT’s ownership interest in the theatre will provide benefits and opportunities in a wide variety of AUT disciplines that interface with performing arts, including arts management, education, event management, languages and cultures, art, spatial design, fashion design, creative technologies, creative writing and media studies.

The new partnership between AUT and ATC builds on an existing relationship between the two organisations, outlined in a Memorandum of Understanding signed by both organisations in 2012, which focuses on supporting the business of theatre through education and research.

The Waterfront Theatre Project includes a 600-seat theatre, designed specifically for drama and dance, access to a 200-seat auditorium within the adjacent ASB head office development owned and developed by Kiwi Income Property Trust, a shared courtyard and other facilities. The new theatre will become the permanent home of ATC.

AUT University has an excellent report card when working with other organisations, a great example being the highly successful AUT Millennium Institute, which is a partnership between the University and the Millennium Institute of Sport and Health. The new Waterfront Theatre will provide similar opportunities in the field of theatre arts.

“Throughout history great cities have established themselves by being centres of learning and culture. AUT and ATC, as anchor institutions in the cultural life of the region, are convinced of the potential this partnership has to contribute to Auckland’s standing as an international city”, says Mr McCormack.
