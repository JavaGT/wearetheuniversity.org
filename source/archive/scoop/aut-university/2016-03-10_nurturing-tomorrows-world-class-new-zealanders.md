Nurturing tomorrow’s World Class New Zealanders

**Nurturing tomorrow’s World Class New Zealanders**

Partnering globally successful business people with first in family university students is at the heart of a unique mentoring initiative launched by Kea and AUT yesterday.

Fifteen students completing degrees in areas as diverse as hospitality and paramedicine will partner with business professionals who will guide and inspire them as part of the AUT Mentoring programme supported by Kea’s Global Network.

Many of the students are second year Woolf Fisher First in Family AUT Scholarship recipients and all have been carefully matched with professionals in their area of study.

Intensive Care Paramedic Haydn Drake from St John New Zealand will be mentoring Bachelor of Health Sciences student Kaycee Bottcher while London-based Sales Director of Orion Health, Belinda Allen will be sharing insights and inspiration with Rebecca Harris who is completing a Bachelor of Business degree.

Other mentors include a head chef, a youth services advisor, journalists, television presenters, a software developer and a health researcher.

According to AUT Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack, the concept recognises the need to help students qualify with insights into the reality of their chosen career and exposure to their industry, as well as achieving excellent academic results.

“AUT is focused on providing wide-ranging student experiences that complement their academic learning and in turn increase their employability. Our partnership with Kea provides a unique opportunity for our students to grow and learn with help from internationally experienced New Zealanders.”

“This partnership is about paving the way for future Kea and World Class New Zealanders.”

Kea’s World Class New Zealand Network Global Director Ngapera Riley noted that successful mentor relationships provide support, a global viewpoint and inspiration.

“We’re delighted that members of the Kea Global Network have made the commitment to assist AUT students and help them on their journey.”

“Kea’s network embraces hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders who live or have lived overseas and we believe their experiences can provide valuable perspective for mentees.”
