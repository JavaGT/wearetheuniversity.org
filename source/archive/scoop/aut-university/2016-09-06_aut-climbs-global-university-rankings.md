AUT climbs global university rankings

  
AUT has moved up 39 places since 2014 and now ranks in the top 450 universities in the world, according to the latest QS World University Rankings.

New Zealand’s youngest university ranked 33rd in the world for attracting international students and 64th for attracting international academic staff.

All of the country’s eight universities are in the top 3% of global universities.

AUT Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack says the improvement in rankings over time reflects AUT’s growth and focus on providing a vibrant learning and research environment.

“AUT is New Zealand’s fastest growing University and our focus is on providing a contemporary learning experience for our students.  
“It’s pleasing to see AUT recognised once again for our international outlook. Our students gain cross-cultural experience dealing with the complexity of many people coming together from different backgrounds.

“Evidence shows students within a diverse educational environment develop more critical thinking skills and more analytical skills simply by having to grapple with the different perspectives that come forward in discussions,” he said.
