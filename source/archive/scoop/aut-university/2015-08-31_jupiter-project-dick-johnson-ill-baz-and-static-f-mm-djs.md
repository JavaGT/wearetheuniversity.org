AUT’S STATIC FM PRESENTS

Jupiter Project, Dick Johnson, Ill Baz And Static F\\Mm DJs

Galatos Ballroom, Friday 25 September

in Support of the New Zealand Music Foundation.

AUT’s Static FM is hosting some of the nation’s best up-and-coming electronic artists at Galatos on Friday 25 September. The station has an exceptional line-up planned featuring world-class artists and DJs in an evening that will progress into the night from local DJs to a full-on dance party with fantastic light and sound throughout.

Static FM, the city’s cutting edge on-air/ online broadcaster, has its roots in the broadcasting course at Auckland University of Technology’s central Auckland campus. It is hosting the event to showcase its commitment to top local EDM talent and in support of the local live music scene. It is also using the opportunity to raise funds for music projects nationwide that will change the lives of New Zealanders in need, with all proceeds from the show going to the NZ Music Foundation.

Headliners for the night are Jupiter Project, New Zealand’s renowned EDM/RnB duo, who are taking the world by storm with a refreshing sound that has splashed onto the local scene encompassing alternative hip-hop, indie rock and electronica. Often compared to the likes of N.E.R.D. and Phoenix, Jupiter Project are an indietronica collaboration of vocalist Gavin Correia and music producer Marty Rich. The boys were recently announced as one of the first signings to the line-up of one of the southern hemisphere’s biggest music festivals, Rhythm and Vines, and have recently returned from the US where they have been working on their debut album. Their highly anticipated EP, “Get It Boyz”, was released in June this year reaching the top 5 in The New Zealand Top 40 Albums within a week. The duo takes pride in recreating their catalogue of new songs into a vibrant and high-energy show that the iconic Galatos is excited to host.

AUT’s Static FM is also proud to showcase English born, New Zealand-based house DJ, Dick ‘Magik’ Johnson. With some 50 international releases to his name, Johnson has been a heavyweight on the EDM scene since the late 80s. The producer, radio broadcaster and label boss DJ has just dropped his first full EP, “Deep and Under”, this August. A deep and full sound that carries golden grooves through the house floor, Johnson is sure to leave the dance floor quivering.

Later in the night, AUT and Static FM brings you a prominent young local DJ whose track list knows no bounds, Ill Baz. A Base FM radio DJ, Baz has been on the EDM scene for several years now. With an evident respect for the craft, he has collaborated with the likes of Raiza Biza, released his own official track, “Get Own Down”, and is known for filling dance floor venues from 1885, to Tyler Street Garage and the Ponsonby Social Club. Ill Baz’s talent has solidified him a spot in two local bands; ‘Eddie Numbers’ and ‘The Shade’, who have played Rhythm and Vines and Northern Bass.

Static FM organiser Thomas Thexton is excited about being able to put on such a high profile EDM gig at the the Galatos Ballroom and thinks it's an amazing event for young electronica fans. “This concert has been a combination of efforts from our group and we could not be happier with the artists. We’re excited to bring this fantastic lineup to current and new listeners of AUT’s Static FM.”

  
Peter Dickens, General Manager of the New Zealand Music Foundation says, “We’re excited and very grateful that Static FM has chosen to support the charity with the proceeds from the show. It’s going to be a fantastic night, it’s an amazing lineup and we’d like to thank all the artists for their help as well. Support like this is vital in helping us to reach many more people in need around NZ with projects that will change lives through the magic of music.”

The station has been supported by local and international organisations who have all rallied to the cause. Oceania is providing fantastic light and sound for the show, while Phantom Bill Stickers has provided invaluable promotional support. Ultimate Ears have kicked in with giveaways of their industry-leading bluetooth speakers as well as on-site attractions and Galatos itself has provided invaluable help for the concert.

Static FM has announced the release of a very limited number of tickets through Under the Radar and urge people to buy quickly as these will sell out. Ample discounted tickets for AUT students will also be released.

Tickets are $15 with AUT ID, $20 general public or $25 with donation to the NZ Music Foundation. They are on sale now at undertheradar.co.nz.
