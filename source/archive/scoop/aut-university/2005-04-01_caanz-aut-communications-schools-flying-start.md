CAANZ/AUT Communications School's Flying Start
==============================================

For Immediate Release:  
April 1 2005

CAANZ/AUT Communications School Off to a Flying Start

Two weeks out from the official launch of the new Communications Agencies (CAANZ)/ AUT Communications School and already three of the professional development courses are sold out.

The Communications School has been developed, as a partnership between CANZ and AUT, to deliver a high-quality training programme for communications professionals.

The programme, when fully developed, will offer professional development opportunities across communications disciplines such as account strategy and management, media strategy, creativity and business skills like presentation and negotiation – all delivered by respected industry practitioners or academic professionals.

The CAANZ/AUT Communications School has been based on the highly successful IPA (Britain) and AFA (Australia) education models. These programmes are now an essential component for the vibrant and prosperous communications industries in those countries.

The Association of New Zealand Advertisers (ANZA) representing marketing professionals, is also behind the programme. Members of both CAANZ and ANZA will be given preferential rates and placement on the appropriate courses.

CAANZ President, Andrew Stone says the development of the School is a milestone for the industry.

“ For years we’ve been talking about the need to develop a truly professional pathway to excellence with our people. This programme will do just that.”

“We’re very fortunate to have developed a partnership with AUT for the development and delivery of the School. As a result the programme offers the best of all worlds - academic excellence and industry grounded content.”

The Dean of the AUT’s Business School, Professor Des Graydon, says it’s a match that delivers considerable value for both parties.

“Not only do we keep in touch with current professional practice and with leading practitioners, but students also gain valuable university degree credits they can put towards under-graduate or graduate studies at the AUT.”

“The close working relationship between industry and the University will also provide a springboard for research that will benefit the wider industry. The University has already made a commitment to expanding its research base in this sector and the knowledge developed will clearly benefit the marketing discipline,” said Professor Graydon.

The 2005 programme for the CAANZ/AUT Communications School will deliver at least 7 courses, across three levels of industry experience, in its first year. These cover the disciplines of Media Strategy, Account Management, Persuasive Communications and Presentation Skills.

Work has already begun on expanding the courses for 2006 to include four stages of experience and the development of courses for Creative Skills.

The official launch of the CAANZ/AUT Communications School is set down for April 19, but already three of the papers on offer – Media 1, Media 2 and Account Management 1 – have sold out. Consideration is now being given to repeat some of the more popular courses throughout 2005.
