AuSM Orientation Festival @ AUT University Monday 20 February to Friday 3 March 06

Spread over two campuses and two weeks, the 2006 AuSM Orientation Festival at AUT University aims to provide entertainment and enlightenment to a diverse range of students.

Thus the range of performers crosses musical boundaries to include Drum n Bass (Concord Dawn), Hip Hop (Savage), Reggae/Dub (The Black Seeds), Rock (Elemno p) and Punk (The Bleeders).

But there's more to an AuSM Orientation than just bands, also part of the programme are DJ's (Logikal), a Hypnotist (Guy Cater), Comedy (Sam Wills)and even a Wrestling Demonstration (IPW)

And for the first year AuSM has arranged a discounted price for AUT students wishing to go to the Annual Outdoor Summer Shakespeare production, this year being “The Comedy of Errors”, which is held annually at the University of Auckland.

All events are free to AUT students (unless indicated) public tickets to major events are available from Real Groovy and the door.
