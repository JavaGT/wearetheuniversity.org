‘The Fish Rots from the Head’ author to give talk

‘The Fish Rots from the Head’ author to give NZ talk

A pre-eminent British author in governance best practice, Professor Bob Garratt, will give a one-off public address in Auckland early next month on the global drive to reform boards of directors through tougher legislation.

Hosted by AUT University, he will discuss the growing pressure worldwide on directors to be more transparent and accountable.

The author of The Fish Rots from the Head, Bob Garratt is the chairman of Organisation Development Limited in Hong Kong and Media Projects International in London. He is an international strategy consultant who specialises in the development of directors and board structure, the strategic positioning of businesses and cross-cultural issues.

AUT University Associate Professor of Management, Coral Ingley, says his talk will be relevant to anyone interested in avoiding the catastrophic failures of major organisations witnessed in other countries.

“Bob’s talk is very relevant to New Zealand. Some of our top companies are listed on the US stock exchange and are directly affected by recent legislation and reform efforts, such as the controversial Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

“Companies and directors here are keen to lift their standards of governance and know benchmark standards being applied elsewhere. Good governance is especially important when seeking capital in global equity markets.”

Dr Ingley says Bob Garratt is an ardent advocate of professionalising the role of directors.

“Bob will discuss major developments and leading thinking around the world. His focus is on how to make boards more effective. His talk highlights governance principles and best practices being applied not only to business but also to all types of organisations.

“He will consider, against a background of increasing demands on boards and directors with tighter legislation, where the development of corporate governance is heading. He’ll ask whether tougher laws are enough to improve board and corporate performance.”

Dr Ingley says business students, academics and business professionals from all organisations, including from the health sector, charitable organisations, private sector and sporting groups, are welcome to attend.
