World's top young chefs do battle at AUT

AUT University's School of Hospitality and Tourism is hosting the quest to find the world's top junior chef in Auckland today (Wednesday March 15).

Contestants from 17 countries will compete in the Hans Bueschken's World Junior Chefs' Challenge as part of the World Association of Cooks' Societies (WACS) Congress 2006 in Auckland this week.

They are given a mystery box of food and wine and beer to create a three-course meal in a "hot kitchen" contest. Judges include international celebrity chef Martin Yan.

The contestants must be 23 or younger and member countries can send only one representative to compete in the challenge. The 17 countries represented are: Australia, Canada, China, Cyprus, England, Fiji, Iceland, Italy, Malta, New Zealand, Portugal, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, United Arab Emirates (UAE), the US and Wales. New Zealand is represented by Daniel Brooker.

  
The director of the World Junior Chefs' Forum, AUT programme leader (culinary operations) Renny Aprea says hosting such a prestigious event is a great experience for the university.

"The WACS Congress is a premier world event and the focus is on educating delegates about the foods and wines of the region," he says. "It's a great chance to showcase what Auckland can offer."

AUT is also hosting a three-day educational forum for the junior delegates which includes culinary and patisserie workshops and lunch provided by AUT student chefs.

The three top placegetters of the Hans Bueschken's World Junior Chefs' Challenge will be announced at the Pohutukawa Gala Dinner and Awards evening on Thursday March 16 at the SKYCITY Convention Centre.

About 500 chefs and food industry professionals from more than 50 countries are attending the WACS Congress.
