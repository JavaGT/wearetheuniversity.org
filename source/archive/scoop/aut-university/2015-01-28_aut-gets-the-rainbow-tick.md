AUT gets the Rainbow Tick
=========================

AUT is the first New Zealand tertiary provider to get the Rainbow Tick

  
AUT University has become the first tertiary provider in New Zealand to be awarded a Rainbow Tick for the level of engagement and support shown to the Rainbow community both internally and externally.

The Rainbow Tick programme is a continual quality improvement programme designed to help an organisation ensure it is a safe and welcoming workplace for employees. While most diversity and inclusion programmes address the areas of gender balance, ethnicity and ability, the Rainbow Tick addresses that of sexual and gender diversity.

The certification report prepared for AUT was complimentary about AUT’s strategic approach to its Rainbow community saying, “We would particularly like to mention that AUT is the only organisation we have dealt with that places Rainbow community diversity and inclusion in its strategic plan: this is commendable and sets an example for others to follow”.

Tim Davison, a member of Out@AUT, an active network of self-identified LGBT staff members at AUT, says “being awarded the Rainbow Tick sends a strong message that AUT welcomes and values the LGBT community, particularly its staff and students, and the diverse roles they fulfil in the University’s life”.

The announcement that AUT had received the Rainbow Tick was made by AUT’s Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack at the Gay Auckland Business Association (GABA) Christmas mixer event and was met with a burst of applause and cheering.

“AUT is proud to be the first tertiary provider in New Zealand to be accredited with the Rainbow Tick. This certification is reflective of AUT being an inclusive place for our staff to work and our students to study”, says Derek McCormack.

AUT will continue its focus on the Rainbow Community and will be offering staff diversity and inclusion training, as well as sponsoring, supporting and participating in a number of upcoming pride festival events including hosting the Queers in Tertiary conference.
