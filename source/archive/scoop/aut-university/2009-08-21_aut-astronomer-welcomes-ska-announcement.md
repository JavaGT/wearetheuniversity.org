AUT Astronomer Welcomes SKA Announcement

Professor Sergei Gulyaev, Director of AUT University’s Institute for Radio Astronomy and Space Research, has welcomed today’s breakthrough announcement about the international Square Kilometre Array (SKA) project.

The New Zealand and Australian governments will make a joint bid for the $3.1 billion project, and Gulyaev, who has led New Zealand’s efforts to be part of SKA for the past five years couldn’t be happier.

“Today’s announcement is the fruition of five years’ work by many people, under the umbrella of SKA New Zealand. SKA represents an enormous opportunity for New Zealand, with the potential for massive scientific breakthroughs, job creation and economic spinoffs.”

AUT University has already begun to build the capabilities that will be needed if SKA goes ahead, including a prototype of the 12 metre diameter radio telescope, in Warkworth.

Around 5,000 of those telescopes would be needed if SKA happens in New Zealand. “SKA will allow us to answer questions that have stumped astronomers for years: What came first, stars or galaxies? How are galaxies born? Where has magnetism come from? Does extra terrestrial life exist? Can we predict what will happen to the Universe?”

“As an astronomer I am passionate about the significance of SKA. I am thrilled that the New Zealand Government has been so supportive. It is that belief and commitment that has seen us reach this milestone today.”
