Dr Coral Ingley has been appointed AUT’s new Associate Professor in Management in the Business Faculty.

Dr Ingley joins AUT from Massey University where she has lectured in corporate governance, strategic management and international business since 1994.

During her 15-year academic career Dr Ingley has conducted extensive research in corporate governance in New Zealand. Her primary focus has been the strategic leadership role of boards of directors and their effectiveness in corporate performance.

Dr Ingley has undertaken two major nationwide surveys of boards, conducted with support from Sheffield Consulting Group, the Institute of Directors and Oracle New Zealand. Her research has been published widely over the past five years in key international corporate governance journals.

She is also a director of companies in New Zealand, a mentor to CEOs and has consulted to local and international companies and professional bodies, including the New Zealand Defence Force and the Auckland District Law Society.

Dr Ingley is looking forward to developing new teaching and research at AUT, with a particular interest in corporate governance.

"I am very excited about the opportunity to join the team of excellent researchers in the Business Faculty. I am very enthusiastic about the energy and vision I see at AUT and I look forward to being a part of this dynamic learning environment," she says.

Dr Ingley has guest lectured at overseas universities, including the University of Naples, Italy and the Graduate Management School in Troyes, France.
