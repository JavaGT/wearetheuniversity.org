AUT set to deliver millennial workforce through on-campus recruitment service

AUT has opened a full-service, on-campus recruitment agency today, to help New Zealand employers engage work-ready students and graduates.

Based at the university’s City Campus, it is the first service of its type at a New Zealand university and will provide employers with personalised support to find exactly the right student or graduate for their business.

The service – called AUT Internz - is a scaled up version of a programme that has been connecting international employers with AUT students and graduates since 2014. Internz has placed trainees and interns with global giants like Facebook and the Smithsonian Institution and next year, the 100th AUT graduate will embark on an international placement through Internz.

Director of Development at AUT Ella Monahan says the years of servicing global industry leaders has provided insight into what’s required to meet the expectations of successful employers, and helped AUT develop a support system for students in their final stages of study.

“It’s led to some extremely practical insights into supporting successful relationships between employers and graduates – that means putting the right students or graduates in front of employers at the right time, and providing our students with guidance to become work-ready and professionally presented.“

Director, Student Employability Anna Williams says AUT graduates are popular with employers thanks to their mix of technical and work-ready skills, and she is pleased AUT can now scale up its recruitment service offering.

“Grades are important – but we also make sure our students develop the ‘C’ skills while they study at AUT: communicaiton, creativity, collaboration, curiosity and cooperation – skills that are critial for employers.

“We’ve got a steady stream of graduating students ready to be employed who can demonstrate these skills thanks to a number of programmes we deliver to complement their academic study.”

AUT Internz has a dedicated relationship manager to service each client group: one for candidates and one for employers. It also includes back end technology that will allow the recruiters to target student and graduates, along with a candidate management system, along with a new website.

And while AUT Internz will continue helping top companies overseas recruit AUT students for a select number of short-term international internships, the focus for AUT Internz is now firmly set on supplying New Zealand employers with great graduates.
