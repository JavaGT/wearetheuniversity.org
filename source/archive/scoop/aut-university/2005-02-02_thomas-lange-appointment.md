Thomas Lange appointment

Professor Thomas Lange has been appointed AUT’s new Professor of Economics and Associate Dean (Research) in the Business Faculty.

Professor Lange is an internationally respected scholar and policy commentator and has worked on a variety of economic and public policy issues. He is the author of more than 150 papers in labour economics and industrial relations. He has also authored ten books and special journal issues and has presented more than 50 policy and strategy papers to academic, policy and business audiences in 12 countries worldwide.

He has held appointments as professor and chair, head of department and dean of faculty at universities in Scotland and Wales. In addition to his academic positions in the UK, Professor Lange has also served as a director of the Learning and Skills Council in Staffordshire, England and as a visiting fellow and professor in Germany, Denmark, Romania and Sweden. He has also served as a senior employment policy advisor to Scotland’s Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. In Wales, he assumed corporate responsibilities in the area of international partnership building, research policy and risk management.

Professor Lange’s work was covered widely in Britain’s press and his policy proposals were debated publicly during Scotland’s parliamentary sessions.

Professor Lange’s research duties at AUT in economics and management disciplines will be complemented by strategic management responsibilities for research development across the business faculty.

“The Government’s direction is clear: university status requires demonstrable evidence of research activism and contributions to knowledge. As such, the business faculty’s research profile deserves a prominent place among its strategic management developments,” he says.

Professor Lange’s areas of expertise include labour markets – skills and policy, economics, employment policies, skill shortages, and unemployment versus immigrant issues.
