**AUT tracks re-entry and splashdown of first private space mission**

  
AUT University’s Institute of Radio Astronomy and Space Research (IRASR) will track re-entry of the first private space flight to the International Space Station (ISS).

Re-entry is scheduled to take place tomorrow (Thursday 31st May) with broadcast of the departure from the ISS commencing at 7.30pm New Zealand time (3.30am EDT).

AUT’s radio astronomers will be tracking the Dragon space craft as it re-enters orbit and splashes down into the Pacific Ocean hundreds of miles off the west coast of California.

California-based SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies) launched its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon space craft from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday 22nd May. The Dragon space craft successfully berthed at the ISS on Friday 25th May.
