**Foreshore and Seabed solution “best compromise” says academic**

  
AUT University Professor of History, Dr. Paul Moon, has responded to the Government’s proposed alternative to the Foreshore and Seabed Act by describing it as the “best compromise” available.

He says that the Government has gone for an approach that will not satisfy anyone completely, but that aimed for a balance between various interest groups.

“The proposed changes will, at the very least, replace the Labour’s Stalinist 2004 legislation, which denied the right to have the nature of Maori title to the foreshore and seabed determined by the courts, and which effectively nationalised the asset at the stroke of a pen”, says Dr. Moon.

Dr. Moon says that key element in National’s proposal that may put it on a collision course with some Maori Party politicians is the provision that customary title cannot be transferred to freehold title.

“However, there is a barb for the proposal’s detractors” warns Dr. Moon. “If National cannot get support from the Maori Party for this policy, then the status quo might apply – something that will be much more unpalatable for the Maori Party and its supporters”.
