**Ākina Foundation recognised at 2017 AUT Business School Excellence in Business Support Awards**  
  

  
Hot on the heels from hosting the hugely successful Social Enterprise World Forum in Christchurch, **The Ākina Foundation** won the **Non for Profit award** at the 2017 AUT Business School Excellence in Business Support Awards.

A 600-strong audience from the New Zealand government and business sector joined the staff, students and academics from AUT in honouring the AUT Business School Excellence in Business Support Award winners at a gala dinner at the Langham Hotel, Auckland on 4 October.

Now in its 12th year, the Excellence in Business Support Awards is the only national performance measure for business support organisations.

It recognises and celebrates organisations and individuals that deliver quality products and services to help small, medium and large businesses maximise their endeavours.

**The Ākina Foundation** was one of 11 category winners, with the Supreme Award going to KiwiRail. A full list of 2017 winners is below.

Louise Aitken, Ākina GM, proudly accepted the award on behalf of the entire Ākina team, and took the opportunity to not only thank AUT, but also challenge the 600-strong audience from the New Zealand government and business sector to continue to contribute to the growth of the social enterprise sector. Louise pointed out that “New Zealand businesses spent $535 billion in expenditure during FY 15/16 and that if even a portion of this went to social enterprises, we would go a long way to address some of the social and environmental issues in our communities.

Louise also took the opportunity to recognise David Walsh and the NZ Post team, a fellow finalist, who announced NZ Post’s commitment to supporting social enterprise through social procurement. “As a partner to the Social Enterprise World Forum, it is fantastic to see NZ Post take a leadership role in enabling social and environmental impact through money that is being spent anyway” Louise shared with the audience.

Professor Kate Kearins, Dean of AUT Faculty of Business, Economics and Law, says the organisations that support successful businesses are the unsung heroes of New Zealand’s business community, often going unrecognised by end-consumers.

“We would like to congratulate all the finalists and winners across the AUT Business School Excellence in Business Support awards. Without your innovation, enthusiasm, judgement and backing New Zealand businesses, big and small, would fail to reach their full potential,” says Kearins.  
The 2017 awards were sponsored by ICG, Fuji Xerox, Idealog, CPA Australia, Colab, New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation, and Advanced Security Group.
