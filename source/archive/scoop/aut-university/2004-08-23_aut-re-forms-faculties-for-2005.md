For Immediate Use  
AUT Re-forms Faculties For 2005

AUT is to regroup schools into new faculty clusters for the 2005 academic year.

AUT Vice Chancellor, Derek McCormack said the strategic aim of the regrouping was to stimulate and support growth and innovation with fresh associations amongst the University’s disciplines.

“The new structure will project our distinctiveness, reflecting blends of academic disciplines and programmes and will keep us ahead.

“Under the transformation, schools remain intact with the exception of the creation of a new school of Hospitality and Tourism. This combination of capabilities has the potential to produce the leading school of its type in Australasia,” Mr McCormack said.

The new faculty groupings are:

Design and Creative Technologies bringing together engineering, applied mathematics, computer and information sciences, art and design and communications. The grouping better positions the University to support the creative industries wave and mirrors convergences in the economy. It also brings together the full spectrum of design, analysis, presentation and production.

Health and Environmental Sciences which groups applied sciences, sport and recreation, rehabilitation and occupation studies, public health and psychosocial studies and health care practice. This grouping will generate synergies between emerging areas at the University such as environmental sciences and public health, while strengthening the community of biochemical, biomechanical and physiological science which is presently dispersed across two faculties. Health Sciences will continue to be a major strength of the University.

Business incorporating the School of Business, the Graduate School of Business and the Executive Development Programme. The re-forming focuses the faculty at the forefront business education and provides a comprehensive range of pre-degree, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.

Humanities bringing together languages, social sciences, education and the new school of hospitality and tourism. This new clustering provides a framework for the further development and growth of the humanities and human services sector, and a more manageable and flexible structure.

Te Ara Poutama (Maori Advancement) remains as currently constituted. The University has a strong commitment to ensuring the advancement of Maori and this faculty will deliver Maori development throughout the University in any area to which Maori aspire.

“The changes build upon a number of initiatives already underway, and reflect the substance of discussions between academic leaders over recent months. They will allow the University to advance its economic and social contribution and it will further the University’s distinctive positioning,” Mr McCormack said.

“This significant realignment will bring considerable benefit to the University and its students,” Mr McCormack said.

No jobs will be lost in the re-formation and all staff will retain their positions, salary and tenure. The only likely change for staff is changed reporting lines and in time, possible physical relocation. This is a cost-neutral change.
