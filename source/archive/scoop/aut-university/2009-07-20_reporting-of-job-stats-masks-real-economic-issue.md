Reporting of job stats masks real economic issue
================================================

An employment relations Professor says the daily reporting of employment statistics masks the real economic issue facing New Zealand.

Professor Erling Rasmussen, author of a new book ‘Employment Relations in New Zealand’ being launched tomorrow at AUT, says New Zealand’s low productivity goes back several decades and there are very real barriers to the country lifting its performance.

The AUT University Professor of Work and Employment says New Zealand is a small market trying to build a service and knowledge economy and this brings enormous and sustained challenges.

“Many service industry jobs, for example, are largely lowly paid, don’t establish long-term careers and are not known for good employment conditions,” he says. “And across many industries, employees experience relatively low pay levels.

“This means that in a strong global economy, consumerism floats into our labour market and our best and brightest head overseas. Meanwhile, we suck in a lot of extra people to keep the economy going.

“This low-wage route mentality doesn’t bode well for New Zealand’s overall productivity,” says Professor Rasmussen. “The end result, no matter whether we’re in an economic boom or bust, is an unstable economy.”

The flow-on effect for New Zealand becomes problematic in terms of career longevity, productivity and skills training, he says. Adding while offshore Kiwis maybe returning home currently, it doesn’t solve the country’s underlying issues.

‘Employment Relations in New Zealand’ is the extensively revised and updated edition of the 2002 text of the same name by Deeks and Rasmussen. It includes chapters on changes in occupational health and safety, vocational training and equal employment opportunities, and negotiation and conflict resolution.

Professor Rasmussen says that New Zealand’s disproportionately high number of SMEs adds to the country’s underlying productivity issue.

“Up-skilling staff through training and development is one of the few issues on which employers and unions agree but putting it into practice in an SME environment is not always realistic,” he says.

“SME employers operate from a necessarily survivalist approach. Their focus is on tax, revenue, getting products to market, intellectual property and so on. The bigger issues of productivity and skills shortages are in fact often counter-productive to employers achieving their immediate and short-term business objectives.

“So for New Zealand, a coherent, strong lift in the country’s productivity becomes problematic,” he says. “There’s no magic wand, but discussions on how we address the issues needs to be brought more into public debate.”

Professor Rasmussen says in the past 10 years the government tried to rapidly increase vocational training and generally improved the quality of education but it has not yet spilled into overall productivity.

He adds that while the New Zealand labour market is stuttering it is not experiencing the massive fallout of the UK, US and Ireland – or even New Zealand in the 1990s when unemployment figures fluctuated between 11 per cent and 6 per cent.

“The real concern is when people become unemployed for longer periods of time, they lose skills and confidence and restarting is difficult. This, alongside the productivity issue, is where the country’s leadership need to focus its energies.”
