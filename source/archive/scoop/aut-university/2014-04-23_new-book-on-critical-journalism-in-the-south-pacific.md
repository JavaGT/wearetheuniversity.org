New book on critical journalism in the South Pacific
====================================================

**Press Release: [AUT University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University)**

**New book on critical journalism in the South Pacific gives sweeping overview of region’s recent history and challenges**

A new book which examines contemporary media concepts such as critical development journalism, conflict-sensitive journalism and deliberative journalism in the context of the South Pacific region will be launched at AUT University tomorrow.

In **_Don’t Spoil My Beautiful Face: Media, Mayhem and Human Rights in the Pacific,_** independent journalist and media educator Dr David Robie introduces reportage of major Asia-Pacific social-political and environmental issues over three decades.

He argues for a more comprehensive, reflective and in-depth media response to the region’s challenges from Tahiti Nui and Polynesian nations in the east to Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Timor-Leste and West Papua in the west.

Dr Robie has reported on the conflict between France and Kanak activists in New Caledonia that almost ended in civil war. He was harassed by French secret service agents and arrested at gunpoint. He was on board the original Rainbow Warrior on her last voyage that ended with the bombing by state terrorists in 1985. He has reported on coups in Fiji and the Philippines, and was a media educator in Suva in 2000 when his students provided award-winning coverage of an attempted coup.

Dr Robie is now director of AUT University’s Pacific Media Centre and professor of journalism in AUT University’s School of Communication Studies. He is the author of _Eyes of Fire: The Last Voyage of the Rainbow Warrior_ and _Mekim Nuis: South Pacific Media, Politics and Education_. He is also founding editor of the _Pacific Journalism Review_, convenor of Pacific Media Watch and publishes the media blog _Café Pacific_ www.cafepacific.blogspot.com
