**AUT’s First Chancellor Recognised In New Year’s Honours**  
  
AUT University congratulates Dr Tony Lanigan for being appointed by the Queen as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to tertiary education and the community.

In 1996 Dr Lanigan was appointed to the Council of the then Auckland Institute of Technology and became Chair in 1999, where he was instrumental in helping AUT to gain university status in 2000. He then became the first Chancellor of the new Auckland University of Technology, a position he held from 2000 to 2001.

Dr Lanigan continued his support of AUT University and the tertiary sector through his appointment in 2009 as the University’s Group Director of Estates, which is integral to our staff and students’ enjoyment of the campus. In this role he has been centrally involved in the development of AUT’s new Manukau campus and the new state-of-the-art Sir Paul Reeve’s building to be opened in March 2013. Dr Lanigan was also the Establishment Director for the industry-supported Master of Construction Management degrees and contributes to the mentorship of students in his role as Senior Research Fellow in the School of Engineering.

Dr Lanigan was also recognised for his work in the community, which includes his involvement in establishing the emergency housing facility De Paul House in Northcote, Auckland, co-founding Habitat for Humanity in New Zealand and his roles as Vice Chair of Habitat International, and start-up Director and current Chair of the New Zealand Housing Foundation.
