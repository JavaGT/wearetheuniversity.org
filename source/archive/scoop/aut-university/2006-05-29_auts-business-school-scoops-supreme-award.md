AUT's Business School scoops Supreme Award

AUT University's Business School building has scooped the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) 2006 Resene Supreme Award for Architecture.

Architects JASMAX created the award-winning building to fit the specific, dual-purpose design challenge of academic capability and its central city location.

AUT University Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack is delighted the Business School building has been nationally recognised for its design excellence.

"AUT University is a dynamic university that strives for distinction in learning, teaching, research and scholarship. An important part of achieving these goals involves providing well-designed, pleasant facilities that meet student and staff needs, now and in the future.

"We are proud of the work JASMAX architects and the design team have done," he says.

The Business School building was one of four designs honoured with the Supreme Award.

It houses around 6,000 students in 37 classrooms, two case rooms and seven seminar rooms with over 10,000m² of purpose-built space.

Each teaching floor has wireless online access and classrooms are equipped with data shows, document cameras, DVD and VCR players, surround sound, guest laptop capabilities and individual laptops for the students. The fully integrated system is operated from a touch pad control panel fitted to the lecturer's desk.

AUT's use of cutting edge technology and classroom teaching supports the university's commitment to innovative learning, says Dean of Business, Professor Des Graydon.

"We're providing undergraduates with what the top international schools provide their postgraduates," he says.

"Meeting room-style round tables in every classroom shift focus away from the lecturer on to other students and opens the gateway to discussion and debate. Our classrooms have been designed to deliver AUT's student-centred learning and teaching philosophy."

Professor Graydon says students sitting facing each other, rather than in lecture theatre rows with 400 other people which mirrors the real world of business.

The university's North Shore Akoranga campus library, also designed by JASMAX, won a NZIA 2006 Resene New Zealand Award in the education category at the same ceremony.

JASMAX is one of New Zealand's leading architectural practices and has worked with clients throughout New Zealand for more than 40 years. Its multidisciplinary practice specialises in interior design, landscape, transport, health and education.
