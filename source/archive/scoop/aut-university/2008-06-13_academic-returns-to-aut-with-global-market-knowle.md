Academic returns to AUT with global market knowledge

AUT University academic Dr Bart Frijns is bringing knowledge gained from overseas markets back to New Zealand. The finance senior lecturer has returned to AUT following two years as Assistant Professor at the Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands.

Previously, Dr Frijns held a position at AUT for two years. While in Europe, he maintained close research ties with AUT as an Adjunct Research Fellow.

Dr Frijns gained his PhD in Finance from Maastricht University in the Netherlands with his thesis entitled "Stock Price Dynamics and Volatility: A High Frequency Data Perspective". It centred on market microstructure, trading mechanisms and the transformation of information into prices, and the added value intraday data provides to understanding the formation of prices.

Other research interests include corporate governance, volatility dynamics, market integration and the impact of bounded rational agents on financial markets.

Dr Frijns has published in the Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organization, the Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, the Journal of Financial Research, and Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, and has presented his work at international conferences.

Additionally, Dr Frijns has conducted research for the Dutch Ministry of Finance in 2007, focussing on the financial literacy of Dutch households.

His teaching experiences also include teaching for the executive programme at the Amsterdam School of Real Estate and being a Visiting Lecturer at the Copenhagen Business School.

At AUT, Dr Frijns will teach the Investments and Portfolio Analysis paper. He is thrilled to be back and adds that AUT provides a great research environment.

"There are many research activities within Finance and the team is very ambitious," he says. "Working in such an environment is contagious and highly motivating, and I look forward to all the challenges that lie ahead."
