Hone Heke’s return to draw thousands

Up to three thousand people, are expected to converge at Treaty House at Waitangi on Wednesday 5 April for one of the most significant events relating to Maori taonga (treasures) since the Te Maori Exhibition of 1985.

The return of dozens of artefacts belonging to the famous Nga Puhi warrior chief Hone Heke (1810-1840) are arriving back in New Zealand after being in international exhibitions for the last three years.

Event organiser, David Rankin, says that the event is stirring up a lot of emotions: ‘When people see these items, it’s like a whole new world is opening up for them’.

Attending the event on 5 April will be the Governor-General – Dame Silvia Cartwright – who will be performing one of her last functions for Maori before relinquishing her role – a fact that gives added significance to this event.
