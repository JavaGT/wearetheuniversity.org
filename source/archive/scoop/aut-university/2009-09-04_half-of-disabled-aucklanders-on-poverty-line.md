Half of disabled Aucklanders on poverty line

Half of disabled Aucklanders living on the poverty line

There are 77,000 disabled people living in New Zealand’s largest city - Auckland - the majority of whom earn far less than their non-disabled counterparts, even when they have a tertiary qualification.

This is one of the key findings from a new report titled, Step Up: Decision-makers getting it right for disabled Aucklanders, which provides evidence about the issues, needs and aspirations of disabled Aucklanders.

It shows poverty is a daily reality for many disabled Aucklanders and their families, and from available figures estimates that about half of disabled Auckland adults have personal incomes of less than $20,000, predominantly sourced from benefits, casual, part-time, and/or low-paying work.

The Hon Tariana Turia, Minister for Disability Issues, officially received the report and spoke at the launch of the report yesterday.

“I greatly welcome the initiative taken by the Auckland City Council, Auckland District Health Board, Waitakere City Council and AUT University Local Government Centre, in providing a snapshot of life for disabled Aucklanders. It is absolutely perfect timing for the report to be out there – given the pending legislation to establish the Supercity Council,” she said.

“By far the greatest worry for me in reading this report was to read that many disabled Aucklanders indicate they feel afraid or powerless to address their concerns with the service provider. Barriers of fear and prejudice are the remnants of a disabling society which I would have hoped had long disappeared.

Although the Minister has only had responsibility for the disability issues portfolio for just over two months now, she said it has been increasingly evident, that there are a number of things that could be done to ensure Government services are accessible to all, and that the targeted disability supports work well, are fair, and give value for money.

“More than anything I want to see that everything I do in the disability portfolio improves the opportunities, choices and responsibilities for disabled persons to fully participate in their community,” the Minister said.

The Step Up: Decision-makers getting it right for disabled Aucklanders report has been brought together by representatives of the Auckland City Council, Auckland District Health Board, Waitakere City Council and AUT University.

Other findings from the report include:

• Local employers need to understand that hiring disabled people will in fact attract high-calibre, loyal employees.  
• Getting around the city is still problematic for disabled Aucklanders because of barriers in transport, the built environment and public spaces.  
• Support services play a critical and fundamental role in many disabled people’s lives and the quality of those disability support services remains a significant concern.

The quality and reliability of personal support services can ‘make or break’ securing a job, undertaking study opportunities or other necessary economic and social commitments
