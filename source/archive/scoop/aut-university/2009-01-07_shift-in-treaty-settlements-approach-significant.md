Shift in Treaty settlements approach \"most significant in a decade"

Prime Minister John Key's decision to reinstate a Cabinet committee dedicated to Treaty of Waitangi settlements has been praised by treaty historian Professor Paul Moon.

"The direct involvement of the Prime Minister, Treaty Negotiations Minister Chris Finlayson, Tariana Turia, Pita Sharples, Georgina te Heuheu, and other senior ministers shows the Government has a firm commitment to achieving lasting Treaty settlements", says Professor Moon of AUT University. "Under Labour's final term in particular, several major settlements were either stalled or rushed through, partly because too little attention was given to the different nuances of the various claims. Instead, the previous Government adopted a one-size-fits-all approach to Treaty settlements, and reduced consultation with claimants to the bare minimum".

Professor Moon expects that most of the Treaty claimants will welcome National's reinstatement of this Cabinet committee. "For many claimants, years, or even decades have been invested in their claims, and I suspect they will appreciate the fact that the Government is including the Maori Party in the process - which Labour refused to do - and that there is now a clear commitment at the highest level of Government to see that the settlements reached are satisfactory to all affected parties".
