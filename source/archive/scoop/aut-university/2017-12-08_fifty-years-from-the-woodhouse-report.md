Fifty Years From the Woodhouse Report: A Celebration and Assessment of ACC

In December 1967 the Woodhouse Report was released, recommending a no-fault accident compensation scheme for New Zealand. 50 years later, ACC remains operates largely intact, an uncommon feat amongst New Zealand public policy initiatives.

Join AUT’s Policy Observatory for a symposium of ACC research and reflections on how the system has endured, and remaining challenges:

Monday 11th December, 2017

10:00am - 3:00pm

Nicola Kayes, AUT

What has ACC made possible for rehabilitation in NZ, and what are some of the possible unintended consequences?

_ACC is a unique, world class system which is looked upon with interest by the global health and rehabilitation community. In this presentation, I will reflect briefly on some of what ACC has contributed to the rehabilitation sector in NZ, as well as some of the challenges we face in managing the tensions between the legislative context, fiscal responsibility, and delivering outcomes that matter to people living with the consequences of injury and illness in NZ._

Nadine McDonnell, AUT Centre for Occupational Health and Safety Research

A tale of two commissions: The Woodhouse Report and the Pike River attempt.

_Nadine is a fan of administrative compensation systems, despite working in the system and seeing the problems. She will highlight the differences between the two reports (Woodhouse and Pike)._
