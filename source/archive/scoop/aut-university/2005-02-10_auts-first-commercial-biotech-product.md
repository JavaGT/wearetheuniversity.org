AUT's first commercial biotech product
======================================

AUT research partner releases first commercial biotech product

Kiwi Ingenuity Limited (KIWI) announces that the first product utilising KODE™ CAE technology will be launched on to the Australian market during the week of the 10th of February by the Australasian licensee, CSL Limited.

The product launched is CSL Securacell® and represents the world's first multi purpose Quality Control System for immunohaematology laboratories. It comes as a kit that is designed to control, standardise and validate all routine immunohaematology tests.

The ABO blood group Analytical Sensitivity Control component of this kit incorporates KODE™ CAE technology developed by Kiwi Ingenuity Limited and the Biotechnology Research Institute at the Auckland University of Technology (AUT).

The performance of CSL Securacell® was validated in extensive field trials where it was found that despite the high level of performance and safety of most transfusion laboratories, the control system was able to identify and correct deficiencies in testing systems and technologies.

The use of the Securacell® control system will enhance the safety of the blood supply and blood transfusion. Securacell® will initially only be available to the Australian market although it is hoped that it will soon become available in New Zealand and then globally.

KODE™ technology is the platform technology of KIWI. Over the last eight years, in collaboration with AUT's Biotechnology Research Institute, this technology has been actively researched, in particular with applications in modifying red cells and embryos. This first product has been the outcome of AUT PhD student Lissa Gilliver's research under the supervision of Professor Steve Henry. Her PhD thesis on the underlying research and technology will be submitted early this year.

KIWI has secured a strong intellectual property position on the technology and is presently negotiating the remaining global licenses.
