AUT University is going global
==============================

AUT University is going global with its first international MBA programme to start in India this August.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed with the Centre for Developmental Education (CDE), an Indian non-profit educational society, in Bangalore last month.

AUT University's Business School will provide an 18-month fulltime and flexible MBA programme for working executives.

Faculty staff from AUT will teach the course in association with the Institute of Finance and International Management (IFIM), a Bangalore-based business school operated by CDE.

Minister of Trade and Foreign Affairs Trevor Mallard travelled to India with a New Zealand delegation to witness the MoU signing. This was the government's second mission to India to promote New Zealand international education and research.

AUT's Deputy Vice-Chancellor Philip Sallis and Dean of Business Professor Des Graydon signed the agreement with CDE.

Professor Graydon says India's growth in the education sector has been tremendous, but there are not enough institutes providing executive courses.

"We have identified this gap and in collaboration with CDE will strive towards providing an excellent opportunity for pursuing a global MBA programme in India," he says.
