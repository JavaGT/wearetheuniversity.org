AUT leads growth in New Zealand university enrolments

Analysis of the latest data from the Ministry of Education’s Tertiary Data Warehouse shows AUT University has delivered the greatest growth in equivalent full time students (EFTS) in both bachelors and postgraduate degrees from 2003 to 2011 in New Zealand. During this time bachelor degree EFTS in the university sector increased by 5325 overall. AUT’s contribution during this time was 6317 additional bachelor EFTS or 119% of the total university sector growth which compensated for a decline at several other universities.

AUT has also increased its international degree and postgraduate EFTS numbers over the last decade, while all other universities (apart from Otago) have dropped over the period since 2003; AUT now has the second largest international enrolment.

The newest of New Zealand’s eight universities, AUT has 8000 more EFTS in higher education (degree- and postgraduate-level study) in 2011 than it did in 2003 – an average increase of around 900 a year – bringing its total EFTS in degree and postgraduate courses to 16,500 this year. The University of Auckland delivered the next highest increase with 4900 more EFTS than in 2003, and it was far ahead of the other universities.

Whether considering total students, bachelors degree students or postgraduate degree students, AUT led the growth for university enrolments in New Zealand.

In stark contrast to recent media opinion on the value of university education, all recent reports including the OECD’s Education at a Glance 2012 indicate that having a degree in New Zealand leads to better employment prospects with a significant average annual earnings premium.
