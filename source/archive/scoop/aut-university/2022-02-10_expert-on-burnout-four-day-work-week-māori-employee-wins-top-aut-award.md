Expert On Burnout, Four-day Work Week, Māori Employee Wins Top AUT Award
========================================================================

**Press Release: [Auckland University of Technology](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology)**

The Auckland University of Technology (AUT) has awarded its preeminent academic award, the AUT University Medal, to the Business School’s Professor Jarrod Haar (Ngāti Maniapoto, Ngāti Mahuta) at this evening’s Excellence Awards event. 

A Professor of Human Resource Management in the Department of Management and the Deputy Director of the New Zealand Work Research Institute, Professor Haar shot to international prominence in 2018 for his research into the benefits of the four-day work week. 

Professor Haar is renowned as a media-friendly scholar who can translate his research into ideas and actions that the public can understand, relate to, and learn from.  

His research includes studies into employee burnout, wellbeing at work, good leadership, and the experiences of Māori in the workforce.  

Perhaps not surprisingly, in these pandemic times, the demand for Professor Haar’s research has been higher than ever.  

Throughout COVID, for example, he has been crunching data from his Wellbeing@Work study.   

The iterative study has been tracking the New Zealand workforce since February 2020, giving a clear if sobering picture of workers feeling increasingly anxious and burnt out, and employers urgently seeking research-backed tools and strategies to support their teams.

Backed by his belief that “numbers bring out the human experience”, Professor Haar has spent the bulk of his 19-year academic career gathering and crunching data to identify, understand, and explain the challenges, opportunities and unique issues facing the New Zealand workforce.   

AUT Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack says Professor Haar epitomises the best of academia.  

“Jarrod is a sought-after research collaborator, postgraduate supervisor, and examiner; he is a prolific author, media commentator, and an acknowledged expert in his field.  

“Most of all, Jarrod is incredibly generous in his desire and ability to share his research, which has a real-world impact on how we work – as employers and employees. Particularly in these unprecedented times, research like Jarrod’s matters more than ever.”
