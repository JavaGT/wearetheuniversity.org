Maori Party would have “identity crisis” without Harawira

**Maori Party would have “identity crisis” without Harawira**

The Maori Party would struggle **to** be seen as little more than an appendage of National if Hone Harawira was removed from the Party, according to AUT Professor of History, Paul Moon.

Dr. Moon argues that Harawira’s presence in the Party is one of the key reasons for its substantial support, and that if Harawira left, there could be a gradual shift by some Maori voters both to the Greens and to Labour.

“Harawira may not have been universally popular among the Party’s constituency”, says Dr. Moon, “but his contribution to the Party’s profile has been enormous”.

Even more serious, according to Dr. Moon, is that many Maori voters see Harawira as embodying the core values of the Maori Party, particularly on the foreshore and seabed issue. “Without Harawira”, he says, “the Party will have difficulty establishing what its central tenets are, and will find it even more challenging communicating what it stands for to a dissatisfied constituency”.

The Party’s relationship with National has clouded its identity for many of its supporters, and Dr. Moon believes that without someone like Harawira articulating the distinction, the Maori Party will find it harder to sell itself to voters in this year’s General Election.
