AUT wins business case competition

  
The AUT Business School undergraduate team has won the first round of the national league series Deloitte Business Case Competition held at Otago University last week.

They won against teams from the University of Auckland, University of Canterbury and Massey Albany, Waikato and Otago universities.

The competition was judged by panel comprising two Deloitte professionals, a Vero award-winning entrepreneur from Upstart and two academics from the Otago Business School. Their decision was unanimous and judges added that they were highly impressed with the standard of the AUT team's analytical ability, strategic thinking and presentation skills.

The wining team was Pamela Fairburn, Lucy Harris, Dominic Mehling and Teoh Su Lim.

The University of Canterbury will host the next competition round with a national grand final being held in September.
