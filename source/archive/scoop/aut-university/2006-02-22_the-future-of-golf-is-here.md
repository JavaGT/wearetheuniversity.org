The Future of Golf is here

Future Golf has arrived – and can be seen at AUT University’s Golf Swing Clinic’s new website.

The clinic’s website http://www.aut.ac.nz/golfswingclinichas been launched to promote its unique facilities, programmes, assessments and knowledge base.

The Golf Swing Clinic, open since 2003, is part of AUT’s Sport and Fitness Centre based at its Akoranga Campus on Auckland’s North Shore.

AUT’s Sport and Fitness Centre Project Manager John Rice says the clinic’s main point of difference is its sport science focus.

“The clinic not only has a resident PGA coach, Rhys Ogden, it also draws on AUT’s Division of Sport and Recreation’s sports science experts, making it an exceptional golfing facility within New Zealand,” he says.

One of the clinic’s innovations is the Future Golf Workshop, which includes the “Golf Training Goggles System” – a unique innovation developed by AUT researchers. They took an Australian concept designed for rowers, and came up with golf-specific goggles.

“These goggles allow golfers to view their own movements in real time from any angle as they practise their swing,” says John.

The Future Golf package also includes biomechanical analysis, during which a player’s set up, back swing, swing path margin and body kinematics are recorded and studied.

Players also get the benefit of a musculoskeletal screening done by a sports physiotherapist to identify potential problems.

“These can be associated with a player’s posture, strength, flexibility and patterns of movement and may contribute to golfing injuries. By correcting these deficiencies their precision and performance will improve,” says John.

Workshop participants also receive a Pedar Golf assessment to look at pressure distribution during their golf swing.

The workshops are for individuals or groups of 10 or more. The clinic also offers more traditional golf tuition.
