**Press Release: [Auckland University of Technology](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology)**

_Accelerated action, together_ will be the focus of the second New Zealand SDG Summit in Auckland on 2 September 2019 that will address how to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Hosted by the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology, the NZ SDG Summit 2019 will put particular attention on young people. Co-Chair of the event steering group, Lesley Stone, says just hearing young people is not enough.

“Young people have been clear about the need for change and their willingness to make change happen. They have innovative and practical ideas on how to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We need to ensure their voices can become actions and get them into decision making.”

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals provide an agenda for transforming the world to meet the challenges of ending poverty, enhancing social inclusion, environmental sustainability, peace, good governance and economic prosperity for all countries and peoples.

The Summit will engage youth, central and local government agencies, businesses, community groups, Māori, Pasifika, non-governmental organisations, health providers, researchers and educators in working together to accelerate action towards the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.
