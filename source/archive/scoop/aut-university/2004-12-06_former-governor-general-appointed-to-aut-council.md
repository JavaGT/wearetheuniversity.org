Former Governor General appointed to AUT Council

Former Governor General, Sir Paul Reeves, has accepted the Auckland University of Technology’s (AUT) invitation to join the University’s Council from January next year.

Sir Paul is to replace long-serving member, Rod Gates, who is retiring at the end of December.

Sir Paul has been involved with AUT in recent years in a professorial position as advisor to the Vice Chancellor.

“I’m delighted to accept AUT’s invitation to join the governing Council,” said Sir Paul. “I believe the University has a unique and distinct contribution to make to New Zealand and I am excited by the prospect of playing an active role in that.”

The University’s Chancellor Wyn Hoadley welcomed Sir Paul’s acceptance and paid tribute to Rod Gates.

“Sir Paul Reeves will be a tremendous asset to AUT and we are excited to have him join our Council. Rod Gates has been a staunch supporter of the Auckland University of Technology for many years. As Pro Chancellor, Rod has been a tremendous support to me and on behalf of the Council I wish him well.”

The Auckland University of Technology is the country’s fourth largest and most contemporary university. Its unique profile reflects its history and innovative approaches to teaching, learning and research. With a goal of stimulating lifelong learning, AUT offers a wide range of postgraduate and undergraduate degrees, diplomas and certificates via its faculties of Business, Design and Creative Technologies, Health and Environmental Sciences, Humanities, and Te Ara Poutama.
