Stuart Nash appointed to AUT University

The Labour Party’s Epsom candidate Stuart Nash has been appointed Director of Strategic Developments at AUT University.

He will join the Vice Chancellor's Department and initially focus on the proposed new tertiary campus in Manukau City. This is a joint project between AUT, Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT) and Manukau City Council.

“I am delighted that Stuart is joining AUT,” says AUT Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack.

“His powerful communication skills, a concern for social justice and desire to lift New Zealand's economic performance have drawn him to the political spheres where he has been a significant member of the Labour Party.

“The same skills and interests now draw him to the educational sphere and AUT,” says Mr McCormack.

Before coming to AUT, Mr Nash worked in international business strategy and development, including Fletchers and Carter Holt Harvey.

"I am very much looking forward to the challenges associated with growing AUT's reputation as the tertiary institute of choice for New Zealand and international students," he says.

Mr Nash has a Master of Forestry Science degree and a Master of Management.
