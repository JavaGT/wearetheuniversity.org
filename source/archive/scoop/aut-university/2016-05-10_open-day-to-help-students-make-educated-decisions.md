Open Day to help students make educated decisions

Students considering their options for 2017 and beyond will have the chance to find out more about AUT during the Open Day on Saturday 27th August.

The AUT Live event will be a day of seminars, experiences and information aimed at helping students decide where best to complete their tertiary education.

Group Director Brand and Marketing Services, Luke Patterson says the day will allow students and their parents to meet professors and lecturers, to discover the range of options and unique approach to learning offered by AUT.

“The AUT Live open day will give people a taste of what it’s like to study here and the unique approach AUT takes to providing an excellent academic education with life skills and experiences that will give them the edge,” he said.

The one-day format replaces a series of information evenings and is taking place on the same day as the University of Auckland’s open day, providing local and regional students with an opportunity to view the city’s two top universities.

Attendance at the event is free and there will be free transport from several regional hubs around the North Island and between AUT’s three campuses in Auckland City, Manukau and the North Shore.

Registration and more information are at http://www.aut.ac.nz/live
