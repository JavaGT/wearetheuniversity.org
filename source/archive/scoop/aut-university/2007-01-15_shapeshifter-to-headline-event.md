Shapeshifter To Headline Event
==============================

Shapeshifter To Headline Consummate University Event: Orientation 07

The Orientation 07 beer jug has further overflowed with great New Zealand artists, as the Shapeshifter shot glass was added to an already intoxicating line up last night.

Orientation 07 is result of joint co operation between the Students Associations at AUSA (University of Auckland and AuSM (AUT University) as well as the invaluable skills at GeorgeFM and C4. Together they have created a fantastic musical experience for Auckland Tertiary students (and their friends) to compliment their own Annual on campus Orientation Festivals.

As Shapeshifter's sound has evolved in the past few years, so has the relationship between two of New Zealand's leading tertiary institutions. Events Managers Simon Coffey (AuSM) and Dylan Keating (AUSA) are working on starting a tradition of cooperation between their campuses for future large scale events, highlighted by the forth coming ORIENTATION 07 Concert.

Headline artists Shapeshifter head a varied and noteworthy line of New Zealand artists that will perform at the ST James Theatre, in two rooms on Friday 2nd March.

Full Line up;

Shapeshifter | Hollie Smith | Concord Dawn | Opensouls | State of Mind | dDUB | Pacific Bass Culture | Timmy Schumacher | & more to be added

Date & Time ;

Friday 2nd March | St James Complex (St James + Regent) | Doors at 7.30pm

Ticketing (on sale now);

Public tickets from Real Groovy, The ST James box office and www.ticketdirect.co.nz
