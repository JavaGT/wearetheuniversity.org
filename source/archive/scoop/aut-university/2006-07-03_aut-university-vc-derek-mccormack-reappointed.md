AUT University VC Derek McCormack Reappointed

AUT University Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack has been reappointed for another five years.

Sir Paul Reeves, Chancellor of AUT University, says Mr McCormack's term of appointment as Vice-Chancellor has been renewed for five years commencing April 2007.

Sir Paul says AUT's Council congratulates the Vice Chancellor on his able leadership and looks forward to working with him in the challenging future that lies ahead.

Mr McCormack became AUT Vice-Chancellor in April 2004, replacing the long-serving Dr John Hinchcliff.
