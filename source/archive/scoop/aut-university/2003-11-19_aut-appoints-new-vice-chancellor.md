AUT Appoints new Vice-Chancellor

The Council of the Auckland University of Technology is pleased to announce the appointment of Derek McCormack as Vice-Chancellor from 1 April next year.

Derek McCormack will replace the long-serving Dr John Hinchcliff, who led the transition of the organisation from ATI to AUT- the country’s only university of technology.

AUT Chancellor Wyn Hoadley said Derek McCormack, who is currently a Deputy Vice-Chancellor at AUT, had played a central role in managing the major changes in the evolution of AUT and has a detailed knowledge of the University.

“We are pleased that Derek has agreed to accept the Vice-Chancellor’s role. As major businesses, today’s universities require a special combination of leadership skills. Derek has a distinct mix of experience and the right skills to manage both the University’s growth and its unique position in the tertiary education market.”

Mrs Hoadley said Derek McCormack’s experience in a wide range of leadership roles at the University puts him in an ideal position to work collaboratively with a strong team of academic staff to enhance AUT’s academic reputation.

AUT is at a crucial juncture in its position in the tertiary education sector, she said.

“Derek is a tertiary education professional and is committed to AUT’s unique approach which I consider to be the emerging model internationally among progressive universities,” said Mrs Hoadley.

“AUT’s history of vocational education gives it tangible links with business and community partners and provides the student body with invaluable access to real world critical thinking skills and experience. Looking forward, these academic strengths must be reinforced whilst simultaneously laying the business foundations of a strong contemporary university,” said Mrs Hoadley.

Derek McCormack has taken the leadership role in a wide range of the University’s recent developments including its extensive campus redevelopment programme and its transition to university status, development of the AUT strategic plan and review of the council, charter and constitution.

Prior to his role as Deputy Vice-Chancellor Administration, he held positions including General Manager, Corporate Services Director, and Associate Director Academic.

  
Derek McCormack was also national president of the Association of Staff in Tertiary Education and has participated at a national level in many developments in education over the years. He holds a Masters degree in Biochemistry and began his career as a biochemist working at Otago Polytechnic before moving on to work in roles in tertiary education management.
