Family triumph in AUT hospitality & tourism awards

By AUT journalism student Justin Kary

Like father like daughter; or should that be like daughter like father?

Food is a family affair for AUT hospitality students Jean and Danny Wan. Father and daughter are joint winners of the prestigious City & Guilds International Diploma in Culinary Arts Trophy for AUT’s Most Outstanding Student for 2006.

They won the award for their success in the City & Guilds exam which is an option for some AUT cookery students. London-based City & Guilds is an internationally recognised provider of trade qualifications.

The Wans were among several award winners recognised at AUT School of Hospitality and Tourism's annual prize giving in March (full list below).

Danny also won AUT’s Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Certificate in Advanced Professional Cookery for 2006.

“It was a pleasant surprise to discover that we were both top of the class in culinary arts,” says Danny. Jean agrees the honour was “unexpected”.

Exam preparation was part of their training at the school. “The facilities are first class, and the lecturers are very experienced and supportive,” says Danny.

Originally from Malaysia, the family migrated to New Zealand about four years ago and live in Howick.

Jean, 21, has just completed a two-year Diploma in Culinary Arts and has now started the Diploma in Patisserie to enhance her skills. “It’s called being a glutton for punishment,” she says.

As well as studying at AUT, she works as a commis chef at the SkyCity restaurant Rebo. When she finishes her studies she plans to work as a chef and travel the world.

Danny has completed three AUT cookery certificates. Before that, he was in the property business for 20 years to “put bread on the table.”

He also owned a Vietnamese restaurant in Malaysia but his ultimate goal now is to teach cooking \* “ideally at AUT”.

Like his daughter, Danny is working at SkyCity \* as a demi chef in the rotating restaurant Orbit. He also plans to enrol for the Diploma in Patisserie at AUT.

AUT’s Programme Leader for Culinary Arts Glenys Casci says the duo have been great students.
