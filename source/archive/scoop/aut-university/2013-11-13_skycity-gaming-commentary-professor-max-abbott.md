AUT: SkyCity gaming commentary. Professor Max Abbott

Professor Max Abbott, Director of AUT University’s Gambling and Addictions Research Centre (GARC), today called for independent evaluation of economic, social and health impacts of the SkyCity Casino expansion to inform future decision-making.

“Public and political debate leading up to the passage of the New Zealand International Convention Centre Bill has been disadvantaged by exaggerated claims made by protagonists and opponents alike. The saga has played out in stark black and white when in reality it is many shades of grey. Going forward it is time to turn down the heat and ensure that research and monitoring guides future policy and practice in order to maximise benefits and minimise harm.

“A 2009 study that I conducted with colleagues indicated that every additional electronic gaming machine produces nearly one new problem gambler. However, this conclusion was based on a synthesis of information from many studies undertaken during the past 20 years. It is unclear what will happen following the SkyCity expansion. We will only know what the impacts are if we monitor them.”

Professor Abbott said the effectiveness of harm minimisation measures that SkyCity has agreed to introduce will depend on how these measures are developed and monitored over time.

“SkyCity’s harm minimisation measures could be moderately effective; equally they could be largely window-dressing, giving the impression that something positive is being done when in fact it isn’t. No one will know unless there is on-going independent evaluation. This will help reassure the wider community and provide information to help improve prevention and host responsibility services.”

Harm minimisation measures include voluntary pre-commitment (where patrons set time and expenditure limits in advance), electronic tracking of individual gambling participation and expenditure, facial recognition technology, and doubling the size of SkyCity’s host responsibility team.

Professor Abbott said: “GARC’s research has shown that venue- and self-initiated banning helps some problem gamblers overcome their problems. However, many problem gamblers breach their bans and go undetected. Facial recognition could improve detection and enforcement.

“Electronic monitoring has potential to identify both at-risk and problem gamblers. Voluntary pre-commitment could also be positive. However, international research has not established how effective these measures are, and a great deal will depend on how casino staff use the information that is gathered.”
