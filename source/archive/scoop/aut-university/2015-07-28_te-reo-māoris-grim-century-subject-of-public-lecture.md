Te Reo Māori’s “grim century” subject of public lecture

“If you want to reclaim a language, you first have to know how it was lost”

With this phrase in mind, Professor Paul Moon undertook several years of research into the tortuous history of Te Reo Māori in the nineteenth century.

On 11 August, he will be presenting a fascinating and sometimes disturbing account of this history in a one-off lecture at AUT.

This is a unique opportunity to hear one of our most distinguished, versatile and engaging historians talk on the fate of Te Reo in the nineteenth century.

  
Tuesday 11 August 2015, 5:30 pm.
