Sci-Tech: AUT brings science & technology to school students
============================================================

**Press Release: [AUT University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University)**

**Sci-Tech: AUT is bringing science and technology to school students**

Comparative statistics\[1\] on science students show that New Zealand is ranked number one in the OECD for new tertiary entrants in science – something that AUT University is keen to continue through its support of the Science and Technology (Sci-Tech) Experience for Year 11 students.

Sci-Tech offers students interested in learning more about science and technology, a series of hands-on workshops and programmes aimed at introducing them to study and careers in science/technology. AUT is co-hosting Sci-tech with the Manukau Institute of Technology and Unitec over 3-5 July 2012.

A total of 220 students are spending time at AUT’s Applied Sciences School participating in a number of activities covering subjects such as chemistry, food technology, geographical information systems, fish anatomy and physiology, medical lab science and engineering CAD.

Rotary sponsor Sci-Tech and, with contribution from the supporting tertiary institutions, organise and manage a programme aimed at increasing awareness and enthusiasm for sciences and its applications. Fisher & Paykel Healthcare and Tru-Test Group also sponsor the event.

AUT is dedicated to promoting study in science and technology-based courses, which is in line with the government’s recent commitment to science and innovation in the 2012 Budget: “Science and technological innovation are major drivers of growth and international competitiveness” Minister for Science and Innovation, Hon Steven Joyce.
