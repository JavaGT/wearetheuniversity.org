Full credit to Blues rugby graduates

Full credit to Blues rugby graduates

Blues prop John Afoa and back Isa Nacewa are two of the six players who graduated at AUT University this semester.

They joined players Ben Atiga, David Gibson, Jamie Helleur and Derren Witcombe to receive their Certificates in Business today – as they were away during the university’s autumn graduation in March.

AUT tailored the course to suit the demands of the Blues demanding training schedule – including sending lecturers to the team’s training facilities.

As a high school student John Afoa, was awarded the cup for brightest player in his 1st XV at St Kentigerns College, Auckland, but after leaving school and playing professional rugby he dropped his studies.

“AUT gave us this opportunity, so I thought I might as well get back into it,” says the 22-year-old.

Isa Nacewa, 23, had previously attended university but playing commitments made it harder to complete papers each year.

“This course is great because we’re learning together,” he says. “We can really get on each other’s case and support each other. It’s so much better than going it alone.”

Isa says by studying they have something to fall back on when rugby finishes.

“We have a lot of down time so we might as well use it. When we started I never thought we’d get there but we’ve already done it.”

Both John and Isa are continuing on with graduate study. “You could say we’re the foundation students,” says John.

“Now, some of the new guys in the team have started the certificate course. Everyone gets something out of it. When we pass our papers we brag about it. Masters is not out of the question.”
