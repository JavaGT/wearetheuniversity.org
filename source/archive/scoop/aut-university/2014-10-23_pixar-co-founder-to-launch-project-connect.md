Pixar co-founder to launch _Project Connect_

Co-founder of Pixar and Altamira – Dr Alvy Ray Smith is coming to New Zealand to launch _Project Connect_, a new series of quarterly networking events. The computer graphics pioneer and Academy Award Winner will host two events in Auckland on December 3 and Wellington on December 4.

_Project Connect_ will form part of an expanded series of events for _Project ’15¬_, the follow-up to the successful _Project: Digital Disruption_ conference. The evening will incorporate a keynote presentation from Dr Smith followed by Q&A, networking, drinks and canapés.

"We're thrilled to have Alvy join us for the inaugural Project Connect events in Auckland and Wellington", says event executive producer, Martin Bell. “Alvy is a vanguard thinker and pioneering spirit – an inspiring figure who is sure to resonate with the change agents that are putting New Zealand on the map when it comes to the strategic, creative and commercial implementation of digital technologies.”

Tickets to both events will be extremely limited so early booking is advised to guarantee a seat to hear from one of the world’s leading innovators of digital technologies.

The Project Connect series has been possible thanks to the partnership of AUT University, The US Embassy and Social Media New Zealand.
