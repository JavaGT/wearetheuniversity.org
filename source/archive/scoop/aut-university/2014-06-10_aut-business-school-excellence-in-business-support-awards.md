**Finalists named for _2014 AUT Business School Excellence in Business Support Awards_**

  
Finalists for the 2014 AUT Business School Excellence in Business Support Awards have been announced today.

“For any business, the standard of support it gets behind the scenes from business support organisations has a great bearing on whether it succeeds or fails,” says AUT University Dean of Business and Law, Professor Geoff Perry. “By acknowledging excellence in business support we aim to highlight the important role of business support, celebrate excellence, and raise the standard of business support across the board.”

The importance of strong leadership in business support cannot be underestimated and is demonstrated in the quality of the two individual finalists in the Leadership category this year, Stephen Jacobi and Franceska Banga.

Stephen Jacobi provides consultancy services in international trade, government relations and economic development, drawing on a deep knowledge of New Zealand’s trade negotiating effort and an extensive network of contacts within and outside New Zealand. Jacobi’s recent successes have included helping to restore New Zealand’s trade relationship with the United States and preparing and supporting New Zealand FTA negotiations with Japan (through the Trans Pacific Partnership) and Korea.

Chief Executive of the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund Franceska Banga is well known for her leadership of the policy and framework for New Zealand’s venture capital sector since 2000. She is also highly regarded in the international venture capital community. Under Banga’s guidance the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund has invested around $145 million into 167 New Zealand companies since 2002, and to date those companies have earned $1.5 billion in revenues and $1.2 billion in export dollars.

Finalists for each of the 11 categories have until 11 July to submit their final applications, which will then be evaluated by a team of academics from the AUT Business School’s Management Department. Evaluation of applications is overseen by the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation.

In evaluating applications the judges will focus on: leadership and planning, customer and market focus, provision of business support, evaluation and improvement, and results.

Now into their ninth year, the AUT Business School Excellence in Business Support Awards are the only national performance for New Zealand business support organisations.

Winners of the 11 category awards and the Supreme Award will be named at a gala dinner on 2 October.
