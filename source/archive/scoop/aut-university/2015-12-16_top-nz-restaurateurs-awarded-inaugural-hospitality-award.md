Top NZ restaurateurs awarded inaugural hospitality award

Two of New Zealand’s top chefs and restaurateurs have been recognised at Auckland University of Technology’s annual hospitality awards.

Simon Gault and Judith Tabron have been honoured for their “Outstanding contribution to the hospitality and tourism community”.

AUT’s School of Hospitality and Tourism holds an awards event every year to acknowledge its top students but this is the first time it has recognised industry achievements.

“The award recognises outstanding performance over a sustained period,” says AUT Senior Lecturer in Hospitality, Lindsay Neill. “It is recognition of a contribution to raising the standard of hospitality in New Zealand and to increasing awareness of New Zealand as a cuisine destination.”

“Over the years Judith has gone from strength to strength with a string of successful restaurants and a lineage of chefs and front of house staff that have enriched Auckland's - and consequently New Zealand's - hospitality scene. Judith's success has come about because of two key factors - her own huge talent and her determination not to settle for 'near enough' … her innovative cuisine has really set the standard in contemporary New Zealand cuisine,” says Neill.

“Simon Gault has blazed a path through hospitality bringing new and exciting foods to New Zealand palates. For taste, creativity and the layering of flavours, food colours and textures Simon is a master,” says Neill. “Never satisfied, but in the best way possible, Simon is always on the creative look-out, introducing many to molecular gastronomy and its technologies, food and nutrition innovation and now product development – he is one of hospitality’s creative entrepreneurs.”

Both Gault and Tabron are alumni of the School of Hospitality and Tourism.

AUT Head of Department Hospitality David Williamson says the awards are an important recognition of outstanding achievement by the school’s top students and the new industry awards ‘close the circle’.

“Now, by adding the industry awards, the event is celebrating both the excellence of the young graduates, just starting their careers, and the achievements of the 'legends', who have graduated in the past. This way both the future and the legacy of the school is celebrated and recognised.”

Neill says the awards are also a celebration of the “coming of age of hospitality in New Zealand”.

“These successful people exemplify a gateway into an exciting, challenging and rewarding career option and they offer a great example to inspire and motivate young professionals joining our industry. Like the university itself, our award winners have much to teach us all.”

The awards were held at the Sir Paul Reeves Building at the Auckland University of Technology’s City Campus.
