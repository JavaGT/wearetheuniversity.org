The Latest News from American Advertising Comes To NZ

**The Latest News from American Advertising Comes To NZ**

Interested in meeting America’s hottest new advertising agency right here in Auckland?

Meet Made Movement on Friday 18th October.

The free live-stream event in AUT’s Sir Paul Reeves Building will introduce advertising and marcomms professionals to Made Movement, a new US agency that claims to have redefined the ad agency model.

The company is run by ex-Crispin Porter + Bogusky brains Dave Schiff, John Kieselhorst, Scott Prindle and, more recently, Alex Bogusky, and focuses solely on promoting American-made products.

Just some of the questions expected to be answered include, can such an ad agency model exist in New Zealand? Are we seeing a similar consumer shift to locally made, craft focused and sustainably driven products? And how is this affecting where global brands are going?

Made’s creative chief Dave Schiff will answer those questions and more on Friday 18 October, 12.30pm-1.30pm.

“American consumers are so demanding,” he says. “Not only do we demand a great product, but we also demand that the world is a better place because that product exists. That’s a tall order.”

Come and find out if Kiwi consumers are that different from the American version.

The event is sponsored by Made Movement, StopPress, AUTv, Nothing Else and AUT Enterprises Ltd.
