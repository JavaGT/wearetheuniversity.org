AUT University is proud to celebrate Pacific culture

  
AUT University is proud to be a supporter of the 2014 Pasifika Festival to help celebrate the business success of Auckland’s young Pasifika community.  
As a proud supporter of the Young Enterprise Scheme, AUT will be showcasing the work of young people from South Auckland schools who have achieved national success in this prestigious nationwide schools competition.

  
Team members will be on hand to talk about their winning business projects and how they went about beating the best of the best from across New Zealand. Also attending will be national title winner and YES entrepreneur of the year Lar Lila Sua, who will be on hand to answer questions about his experiences in the YES competition.

  
At the festival AUT will also be celebrating the re-launch and rejuvenation of the AUT South Campus. Over the past year the AUT South Campus has grown to be a centre of the South Auckland community with newly upgraded facilities, lush campus grounds and a range of degrees available to completion.

  
Master Tongan lalava artist Sopolemalama Filipe Tohi will be following AUT’s long held Pasifika Festival tradition of creating Pan-Pacific stone carvings at the festival. Alongside the creation of these new pieces, Filipe will be providing instruction to Pasifika Festival visitors on carving techniques, where they can contribute to carving a stone carving that will be permanently displayed in AUT’s South Campus grounds.

  
The AUT stand will be located in the Pan-Pacific area.
