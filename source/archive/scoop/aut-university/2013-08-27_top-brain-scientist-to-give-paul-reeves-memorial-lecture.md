**_Top Brain Scientist to give Bishop Sir Paul Reeves Memorial Lecture_**

New Zealand’s top brain scientist, Professor Richard Faull ONZM, FRSNZ will give the Bishop Sir Paul Reeves Memorial Lecture, at 7:30pm on September 12th, at the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Parnell.

Professor Faull directs the Centre for Brain Research at the University of Auckland, leading a 300-strong team of researchers, and is recognised internationally as a leading expert in neurodegenerative diseases of the human brain, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. He is perhaps best-known for demonstrating that adult brain cells are not, in fact, finite and can be replaced if they die – giving hope to those with neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries.

In his lecture titled, ‘Imagine Tomorrow’s World’ Professor Faull will outline the progress of brain research in this country and the prospects for development of further treatments. He will show what New Zealanders can achieve by working collaboratively.

Radio NZ’s Jim Mora will be the Master of Ceremonies for this outstanding evening and the Centre for Brain Research _CeleBRation Choir_ will perform.

Modelled on the prestigious BBC Reith Lectures, the Bishop Sir Paul Reeves Memorial Lectures, which began in 2012, commemorate Sir Paul Reeves, an outstanding leader and visionary, and are designed to provide commentary on New Zealand’s progress as a nation. They are a draw card for thinking New Zealanders wanting to engage in shaping a positive future.

The memorial lecture is organised by Leadership New Zealand, with sponsorship support from the Auckland University of Technology (AUT). Sir Paul Reeves was Chancellor of AUT from 2005 until his death in 2011.

Tickets cost $30 and are available at www.reeveslecture.eventbrite.co.nz
