AUT recognises excellence in teaching and research

Tonight AUT University held the second annual Vice Chancellor’s Awards for Academic Excellence in Research and Teaching, celebrating staff that have excelled in their contribution to AUT. The inaugural AUT University Medal was presented by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment, the Hon Steven Joyce, to Professor Welby Ings from the School of Art and Design. The University Medal is the pre-eminent academic award at AUT and was presented to Professor Ings in recognition of his sustained and outstanding contribution to AUT.

Professor Ings is one of AUT’s most respected and admired teachers and, as an ‘A’ rated researcher, is recognised nationally and internationally for the quality and relevance of his research. He is widely acknowledged for both his exemplary academic work and his professional generosity to his peers.

Professor Ings states that “A moment that changed me was when my father said, when referring to my thesis, “it must be good, because I can’t understand it”. It was at that point that I decided that education and knowledge must be accessible to all. I have based my teaching around encouraging students to be respectful but disobedient learners. “

AUT’s Vice Chancellor Derek McCormack said, “In essence, a university is its teaching and research. Teaching and research inspire our students, promotes curiosity and new discovery, and ultimately delivers knowledge, expertise, and creativity to the wider communities we serve in business, industry, our society and beyond.”
