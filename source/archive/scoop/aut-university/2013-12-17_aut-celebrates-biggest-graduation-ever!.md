AUT celebrates biggest graduation ever!

AUT University is celebrating its largest ever graduation this week as 4180 students receive their qualifications at one of eight ceremonies over the next three days. At the beginning of each day, AUT graduands will also have the opportunity to parade proudly in their regalia from Albert Park to Aotea Centre, where the ceremonies will be held.

This year will also see a large amount of Doctoral Degrees being awarded with 67 graduands making the transition to ‘Doctor’. This is over double the amount awarded in 2012. With research on a broad range of topics from: Investigating the Attitudes of an Auckland Samoan Population toward the New Zealand Criminal Justice System to Determination of the effect of lyophilised kiwifruit on digestion of protein: in vivo and in vitro, AUT is becoming a destination for Academics to study a broad range of subject areas.

AUT University’s 2012 Graduate Survey confirms that over 70 per-cent of work-ready graduates were in full-time work and 15% were working part time within six months of completing their studies. The AUT Graduate Survey indicates that our students are highly employable.
