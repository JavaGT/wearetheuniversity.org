AUT dance students to benefit from world-first partnership

Britain’s prestigious Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) and AUT form a historic partnership this week, the first of its kind internationally. The RAD operates in nearly 80 countries.

The partnership means AUT Bachelor of Dance students who pass optional RAD-specific papers will graduate with the RAD’s “Registered Teacher Status”, which is recognised internationally.

Senior Dance Lecturer at AUT’s Division of Sport and Recreation, Dr Alice Knappstein says the partnership is significant for New Zealand’s dance movement.

“Graduates who have passed the RAD-specific papers as part of our degree and complete the year-long Graduate Diploma in Secondary Teaching will be qualified as NZ Registered Teachers and RAD Registered Teachers. They will be able to teach in both public sector secondary schools and in private sector dance studios.”

The RAD’s Chief Executive, Luke Rittner, will be in New Zealand to sign the agreement with AUT Pro Vice Chancellor, Professor Max Abbott on Tuesday 16 August, 3pm at AUT’s Akoranga Campus.

“The fact that the Royal Academy has chosen AUT for this world-first partnership shows how highly-regarded our dance programme is and means even more employment opportunities for AUT students,” says Professor Abbott.

The RAD will oversee the RAD-specific papers’ content, delivery and assessment.

Background Information:

AUT’s Bachelor of Dance: This three-year undergraduate degree provides an opportunity to pursue in-depth practical and theoretical understandings of the numerous fields associated with dance teaching and practice. Areas of study include ballet, jazz, modern and contemporary dance techniques. Choreographic theory and practice as well as dance history are highlighted in dance studies papers. Papers in cultural dance and drama provide further depth to dance studies. Students also learn anatomy, human structure and function, nutrition, psychology and dance research skills. In the third year, students have the opportunity to gain work experience in a dance field or organisation of their choice.

Royal Academy of Dance: The Royal Academy of Dance was established in Britain in 1920 to safeguard standards of dance and dance teaching. The first course for RAD dance teachers was established in 1935, the year in which the RAD system of teaching classical ballet was introduced into New Zealand. RAD Registered Teachers currently teach in 84 countries in the world, entering more than 250,000 young people annually for RAD ballet examinations. Each year, 5000 of these are New Zealanders. There are more than 200 RAD Registered Teachers in New Zealand. The partnership with AUT will provide RAD students with access to a high quality dance degree that compliments their RAD knowledge, understanding and skill.
