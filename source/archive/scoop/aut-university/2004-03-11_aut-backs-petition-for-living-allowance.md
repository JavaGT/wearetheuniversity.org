AUT Backs Petition for Living Allowance

Auckland University of Technology’s (AUT) Vice Chancellor and student president will sign a national petition this Thursday March 11 to obtain a living allowance for all students.

Elliot Roberts, president of Auckland Student Movement at AUT (AuSM), salutes the vice chancellor’s support.

“We welcome our Vice Chancellor at AUT supporting a living allowance for all tertiary students. It shows great understanding of the issues facing AUT students,” says Roberts.

The petition is part of a national campaign seeking to gain living allowances for all tertiary students. Only a third of full time students are currently eligible for an allowance, while those remaining are forced to borrow, form the student loan scheme, or work long hours.

“This university believes that our students should be supported while they gain qualifications at AUT, “ says Vice Chancellor Dr John Hinchcliff.

“We know that too many students are forced into working long hours to finance their degrees. A living allowance would permit them to concentrate on their studies.”

Dr Hinchcliff and Mr Roberts and will be signing the petition Thursday March 11, 11.30am in the AUT quad at Wellesley campus, Wellesley Street.
