AUT University congratulates Graduates

AUT University congratulates Graduates**

AUT University is proud to congratulate the 3830 students who will receive their qualifications at one of seven ceremonies over the next three days. At the beginning of each day, AUT graduands have the opportunity to parade proudly in their regalia from Albert Park to Aotea Centre, where the ceremonies will be held.

One of these students, Hiwot Woldeyesus, originally from Ethiopia came to New Zealand as a refugee with her seven year old daughter in 2004. In 2005, she began learning English at the AUT Centre for Refugee Education at the Mangere Refugee Centre. After this she was able to enrol in a Diploma of English, which she graduated from in 2008. She then studied at foundation level which allowed her to enter into a Bachelor of Health Sciences degree, which she is graduating with this week.

When asked of her achievement Hiwot is extremely proud. “I was always attracted to the area of health, and I am grateful for the support and knowledge I received from my tutors that have helped me to achieve my degree. It is thanks to them that I now work at Auckland Hospital.”

Graduation is a time to celebrate success and we wish all our new graduates all the best in their future endeavours.
