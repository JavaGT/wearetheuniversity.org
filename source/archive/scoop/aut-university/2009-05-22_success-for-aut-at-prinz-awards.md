Success For AUT At Prinz Awards

22 May 2009

AUT University students were in several winning teams at the Public Relations Institute of New Zealand’s national awards on 20 May 2009.

AUT students won the Tertiary Student Project Award with their “OneForTheGirls” HPV Immunisation Campaign. Members of the team were: Daniel Waugh, Mary-Louise Dare, Matt Vogts, Emma Voerman, Claire Lancaster and Rebecca Gillespie.

“We are delighted for the students, their work was of a high professional standard,” said curriculum leader, Joseph Peart. “It is one of numerous highly-effective projects completed each year by the students’ pro-bono agency ‘Outside the Square’.”

A key aspect of the student-run campaign was their use of social media, which has become a major initiative in the university’s public relations curriculum and a research emphasis in the field of communication management.

AUT Public Relations alumni were represented in winning teams in eight of the eleven award categories. Megan Hopkins-Stone became the sixth AUT graduate in seven years to win the Sally Logan-Milne Young Practitioner of the Year Award.

The Supreme Award was won by long-time AUT sponsor, Network PR, and in the winning team was Silke Marsh, an AUT alumna.

AUT alumni in winning and highly commended teams were: Kristie Penwarden, Aleisha Coote, Simon Clark, Silke Marsh, and Holly McClune.
