Condemnation of "ruthless censorship" in Fiji
=============================================

Condemnation of "ruthless censorship" in Fiji

AUCKLAND (PMC Online/Pacific Media Watch): The Pacific Media Centre, a  
regional development communication research and publication resource,  
has condemned the Fiji regime's 'ruthless censorship' of news  
organisations and called for an end to intimidation.

The condemnation follows a canned news bulletin by Fiji Television  
tonight and a blank page and story spaces in today's Sunday edition of  
the Fiji Times by news editors in protest over censored content.

Fijilive also reported "withdrawing" some news items as censors  
maintained a presence in the country's newsrooms since the 30-day  
Public Emergency Regulations came into force.

Some journalists reported a "climate of silence" in some newsrooms in  
response to the censorship.

Associate Professor David Robie, director of New Zealand's AUT  
University-based PMC, called on the Fiji regime of Commodore Voreqe  
Bainimarama to "end this Orwellian era of ruthless censorship and  
intimidation".

"The people of Fiji should be allowed free and unfettered media  
coverage, especially at this time of uncertainty and anxiety," he said.

"A gagged and intimidated media will only lead to rumours,  
disinformation and more instability."

The regime earlier called on the nation's media to refrain from  
publishing "negative" stories about the actions of the President Ratu  
Josefa Iloilo over the past few days.

On Good Friday, the president abrogated the 1997 Constitution, sacked  
the nation's judges and declared himself Head of State.

This followed a Court of Appeal judgment on Thursday which ruled that  
the interim government of Prime Minister Bainimarama was illegal.

The president reappointed Bainimarama as prime minister and Fiji is now  
being ruled by decree, including one that has imposed newsroom  
censorship by Ministry of Information officials and police.

Editors were told not to publish or broadcast items that may involve  
"incitement" and undermine law and order.

Major Neumi Leweni, who is also Permanent Secretary of Information,  
asked all news media to “immediately refrain from publishing and  
broadcasting any news item that is negative in nature, relating to the  
assumption of executive authority on 10 April by his Excellency the  
President, and the subsequent appointments of the Prime Minister and  
Cabinet Ministers”.

Section 3 of the regulations state that anybody or organisation that   
“fails in any way whatsoever" to comply with the state provisions may  
be ordered to "cease all activities and operations".

In today's Sunday Times, page 2 was left blank apart from a downpage  
box that declared: "The stories on this page could not be published due  
to government restrictions."

Five dummied up story spaces were left blank on page 3 and a political  
cartoon space on the page 6 opinion section was also blank.

The ministry has reportedly warned the Fiji Times to stop leaving blank  
spaces or face closure under the decree.

After leaving out an item in last night's 6pm bulletin news due to  
censorship, Fiji Television pulled its main bulletin tonight.
