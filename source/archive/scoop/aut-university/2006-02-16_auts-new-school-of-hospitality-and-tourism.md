Ideal blend for AUT's new School of Hospitality and Tourism

AUT University's new School of Hospitality and Tourism will be officially launched by Tourism Minister Damien O'Connor today (Thursday, February 16). Guests, including celebrity chefs and industry representatives, not only get the chance to sample AUT's innovative hospitality at an evening cocktail function, they also get a glimpse behind the scenes \* a tour of the kitchens to see the chefs in action.

The School of Hospitality and Tourism is the largest of its kind in New Zealand, with some 1100 EFTS and a staff of 60. It merges the former School of Hospitality and the Business Faculty's Tourism Academic Group. Courses range from certificate to PhD level, with flexible options such as an online masters programme.

The Pro-Vice Chancellor and Dean of the Faculty of Applied Humanities, Professor Rob Allen, says AUT has a strong tradition of supporting both the hospitality and tourism industries. "Bringing them together under the new School of Hospitality and Tourism, linked to the internationally respected New Zealand Tourism Research Institute, provides a great opportunity to better serve the educational and research needs of one of New Zealand's most important business sectors."

The school's Associate Head (Academic), Dr Elizabeth Roberts, says it is a "one-stop shop" supplying the sector's employment needs. "Tourism and hospitality is a leading industry for New Zealand and there is unprecedented demand for skilled staff, both here and overseas.

We are constantly working with industry to help meet those needs by delivering the appropriate skills, qualifications and research." AUT's Hospitality building on the corner of Mayoral Drive and Wellesley St has been refurbished to suit the new school's teaching and staff requirements.
