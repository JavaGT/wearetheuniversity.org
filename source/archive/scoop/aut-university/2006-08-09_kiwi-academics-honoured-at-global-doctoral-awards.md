Kiwi academics honoured at global doctoral awards

Two AUT University academics have gained top honours at the global 2006 Emerald/European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) Awards.

Dr Mark Glynn and Associate Professor Dr Coral Ingley won awards for their Outstanding Doctoral Research.

A senior lecturer in marketing and advertising Dr Glynn won the top Marketing Strategy award for his research "The Role of Brands in Manufacturer-Reseller Relationships".

His prize includes a research fund of more than $3000 and publication in the European Journal of Marketing. The category was judged by editors of the European Journal of Marketing and a panel of peers.

Dr Coral Ingley, Associate Professor in Management, received the Highly Commended Award in the Management and Governance category for her research "From Conformance to Performance: The Strategic Role of the Board and Its Involvement in Corporate Leadership".

The category was judged by the editor of Management Decision and peers.

Emerald Group Publishing publishes the world's largest collection of international business and management journals. The EFMD boasts a global membership of more than 500 institutional members from academia, business and public services. The awards are the group's most prestigious accolades.

Emerald chief executive officer John Peters says the awards seek to encourage, celebrate and reward excellence in international management research.

"We are proud to help reward and promote such high-quality research. The submissions from Dr Glynn and Associate Professor Coral Ingley are both outstanding pieces of research work and show great promise for future academic work.

"Coral Ingley's research was regarded by the judging panel as being of exceptionally high quality and worthy of the Highly Commended Award."

All 2006 Emerald/EFMD Outstanding Doctoral Research Award winners are listed on the Emerald and EFMD websites: www.emeraldinsight.com/awards and www.efmd.org.
