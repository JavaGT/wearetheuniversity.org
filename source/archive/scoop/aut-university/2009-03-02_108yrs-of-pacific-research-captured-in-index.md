108yrs of Pacific research captured in index
============================================

Pacific research captured in national index spanning 100 years Access to Pacific research is set to receive a major boost with the launch of an index that captures all theses containing research on the Pacific produced from 1900 — 2008.

Co-ordinated by AUT University’s Office of Pasifika Advancement and funded by the Building Research Capability in the Social Sciences (BRCCS) Network, the project involved compiling an index for every Masters or Doctoral theses submitted and completed in a New Zealand university in the 108-year time period.

Professor Marilyn Waring, of the Institute of Public Policy, came up with the concept for the index, which has captured more than 1200 theses, as a way to both improve the accessibility and visibility of Pacific research.

“What we have uncovered is an amazing depth and breadth of incredible Pacific research. Before there was only some idea of what might be out there and now it is available for people to touch, to read and to use. The idea of the index was welcomed from the outset and has the endorsement of an academic network of Pacific scholars from across the universities.”

Victoria University’s Associate Professor Peggy Fairburn-Dunlop says the publication is the first of its kind and its values is in bringing all of this data together in one easily accessible place.

“This has been a very exciting project. When we started we didn’t realise the sheer amount of fine Pacific research which had been carried out in New Zealand universities or the cross cutting nature of this research, due to inaccurate record keeping.”

Director of Va’aomanu Pasifika and a member of the BRCCS management team, Associate Professor Fairburn-Dunlop says the index of Pacific theses is another significant BRCCS output and stands alongside the BRCCS Pacific Post Graduate Talanoa Series, delivered by access grid, which is now in its third year.

“Over 60 Pacific postgraduate students and researchers from throughout New Zealand participate in these bi-monthly presentations. For young researchers especially the index provides a vital reference point and foundation for further research,” she says.

Director of the BRCCS Network, Professor Richard Bedford says the index was an ambitious project that will now stand as a significant resource for researchers.

“Pacific postgraduate researchers as well as established Pacific researchers will find the three volumes a particularly useful resource given there is no comparable listing of theses by Pacific Islanders and others on topics related to the region.”

Office of Pasifika Advancement director Pauline Winter who co-ordinated the project says the index is a strong platform for understanding of the Pacific region and for further research. “It will be key to promoting and advancing further scholarship and understanding of the Pacific region, its people, societies and cultures; histories; arts; politics’ environment and resources; developments and the future.”

Professor Waring describes the index as “a treasure store”, which honours the authors of the theses and their families, communities, participants, colleagues and friends, who made their research possible.

“The rich taonga here will sustain many people, in different ways, for many years.” The research theses listed in the index will continue to be accessed through the traditional channels for each of the university libraries, either online, at the library that holds the thesis or via an interloan. The bibliographic index is arranged in three volumes, based on which university holds the theses, and is available in hard copy format or electronic form, as an Endnote library on CD-ROM.

Notes for editors: For the purposes of the index, the term “Pacific” is given to those countries in the Pacific Ocean or Region, commonly referred to as the “Pacific Islands”. In some instances, the Pacific region is associated with the terms “Oceania” and “Asia-Pacific”. Additionalthe Pacific is commonly understood to include three island groups: Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. For the context of this project, research conducted exclusively on New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii, Asia and Maori, were not included, especially where no reference was made specifically or significantly to the Pacific. In some cases however, they have been included for the benefit of the doubt.

Criteria for inclusion in the index: 1) Research is on the Pacific 2) Research identified in some way as a thesis, at Masters or Doctoral level 3) Submitted and completed in a New Zealand university from 1900 - 2008 4) Deposited in the respective New Zealand university library and found in the library catalogue
