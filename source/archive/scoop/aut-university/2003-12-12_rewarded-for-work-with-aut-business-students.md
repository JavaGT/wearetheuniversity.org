Rewarded For Work With AUT Business Students
============================================

Businesses get rewarded for work with AUT business students.

An accountancy firm and a New Zealand Army representative took out the top awards at the AUT business faculty Co-op awards ceremony held recently. The annual AUT Business Co-op Education Dinner is held to recognise businesses and organisations that have shown strong support of the programme.

The Co-op programme was designed to give graduating Bachelor of Business students some practical work experience, while also carrying out short-term projects to benefit their employers. Awards were presented in recognition of this support and guests also enjoyed accounts from Co-op employers.

Steve Tsang, from Withers Tsang & Co Ltd won the award for an organisation demonstrating outstanding support for Co-op. Steve's support of the programme comes from his proven success at placing Co-op students into full-time employment in his company.

"It gave us a 'try before you buy' situation," Mr Tsang said. "Students get to know us and we get to know them. It also saves us time and money on recruitment, while making the full-time transition of students into our workplace much easier," he said.

The award for an individual demonstrating outstanding support for Co-operative Education was presented to Captain Esther Harrop from the New Zealand Army. "Captain Harrop has shown a personal commitment to Co-op that goes beyond the expectation of her role as a workplace supervisor, she was an obvious choice for this award," said Business Faculty Dean, Des Graydon.

As a part of a Government sector, Captain Harrop felt the programme offered significant benefit to the New Zealand Army.

"It's been excellent for us to analyse our branding and it allows us insight into ways we can improve our perception in the employment sector. I think its just great, I'd recommend it to any business or organisation. It's also a great way for the students to gain some valuable experience outside of the traditional profit making organisations," says Captain Harrop.

Another advocate of the programme is Farmers Trading Co IT Manager, Peter Burggraaff. Peter gave an account of his experiences taking on Co-op students to redevelop the Farmers website. "We were simply amazed with the energy of the guy who came on board, he was shy to start with but in the end he was able to brief our marketing agency with confidence. From a business point of view it's a low cost, high value option " says Burggraaff.

Guests also enjoyed presentations from recent Co-op students Anna Koopberg, now employed by Xtra; Sharni Satyapal, now working for Ford Motors; Amanda Ward, now working for the IRD: and Angeline Karan, now working for the Australian Trade Commission.
