**AUT ROOKIE: A show not to miss**

In its eighth year now, AUT University’s Rookie Show will be bigger and better than ever.

The end-of-year graduate fashion show date and venue have been confirmed- November 14, Shed 10 Queens Wharf, Auckland.

This year AUT Rookie will be an experimental audio visual feast; a fusion of live models, film, video projections and a music score commissioned especially for the show.

It will redefine the idea of how we view fashion and how it is presented in New Zealand.

Andreas Mikellis, the Head of the Fashion and Textiles Department at AUT, says “this year we aren’t just putting on a fashion show, this is an event. We gave a hint of this concept in 2012 with a live band, but we have taken the ‘show’ aspect to a whole new level for 2013”.

“Our students have embraced this idea wholeheartedly, and are producing work that is sure to surprise and inspire. They are exploring new innovative formats for the presentation of fashion collections and the show will serve as an experimental testing ground for this talented group of designers.”

Only 24 students will be chosen to show at Rookie, and selection takes place on October 17.

By October 21 we will have the list of who will show on the runway, and some of these students will be available for interview.  

Tickets are available for $35 here http://www.eventfinder.co.nz/2013/aut-rookie-fashion-show/auckland
