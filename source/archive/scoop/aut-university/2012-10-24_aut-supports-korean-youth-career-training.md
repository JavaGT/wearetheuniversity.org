AUT supports Korean youth career training

**AUT supports Korean youth career training**  

  
AUT University worked in partnership with the Office of Ethnic Affairs (OEA) to develop the Korean Youth Career Training Programme. The OEA provides advice and support to government, businesses and ethnic communities about ethnic diversity issues. AUT has over 580 students who identify themselves as being of Korean descent, which makes up 2.4% of the domestic and 1.6% of the international enrolment.

The programme was developed in response to concerns expressed by Korean community leaders regarding employment opportunities for Korean university graduates in New Zealand. One of their major concerns is young Koreans leaving New Zealand after graduating from New Zealand universities to pursue work in Korea, often without seeking employment in New Zealand first.

These concerns are underscored by research1-2 showing growth in youth unemployment globally. OECD research3 shows that New Zealand's youth unemployment rate is growing faster than the OECD average and that migrant youth are particularly at risk in terms of employment outcomes.

An early-intervention programme for Korean high school age students was created to provide information about employment opportunities in New Zealand and equip the students with tools for decision-making and career planning.

The first two forums were very well received. The first held at AUT’s Akoranga Campus on the North Shore and the second at the Manukau Campus in collaboration with the Asian Safety Education Promotion Charitable Trust. Both forums delivered a full day of sessions on career decision-making, rights and accessing justice, talking to parents, friends and relationships, and building an effective CV. Young Koreans who have built careers and lives for themselves in New Zealand shared their personal stories with the groups.

The Korean Youth Career Training Programme has been so successful that OEA and AUT are hoping to roll it out to other ethnic groups with similar issues around youth transition.
