Mark Street, Strahan Wallis and Nikki Wright.

They were honoured by the Public Relations Institute of New Zealand at its 2003 Awards Dinner in June.

On another current award platform, Sheryl Jacobi, (GradDip Communication/PR from AUT) won one of the seven global awards for Tourism NZ staff. Sheryl¹s award was presented at the annual conference for Tourism NZ representative from all over the world. The citation recognised her ³100% Pure NZ² campaign efforts over the America¹s Cup period.

Programme and curriculum leader, Joseph Peart, said: ³I got a great kick out of phoning each of them (the AUT alumni) and reminding them that I had told them as students they were the Œcrème de la crème¹. They have lived up to our expectations and demonstrated their ability in the best practice of their profession.²
