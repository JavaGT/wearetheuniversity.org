Open for Business
=================

**Thursday, 21 July 2005, 7:44 pm**  
**Press Release: [Auckland University of Technology](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_of_Technology)**

Open for Business

On Monday, 2,000 AUT students will walk through the doors of a new state-of-the-art Business Faculty.

The building will house 6,000 students in 39 classrooms, two case rooms and seven seminar rooms over 10,000m2 of purpose-built space.

Boardroom-style round tables in every classroom shift focus away from the lecturer onto other students. This will open the gateway to debate and challenge and so deliver AUT’s dynamic student-centred, active learning teaching philosophy.

All classrooms are equipped with wireless online access, data show capabilities, DVD and VCR players and a document camera operated from a touch pad control panel fitted to the lecturer desk.
