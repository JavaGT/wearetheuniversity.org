Forum to discuss merits of faith-based prisons

A forum on the place of faith-based prisons and the role of spirituality in rehabilitation and personal change will be held at Auckland University of Technology later this week.

Warwick Pudney, senior lecturer in Violence and Trauma studies at AUT’s School of Psychotherapy, will facilitate the forum.

“The sorts of questions we will be asking are: how successful are these programmes, what is the place of spirituality in personal life change, and how could I include spirituality in my work?” says Warwick Pudney.

One of the panel members is Kim Workman who has worked as a Police Senior Sergeant, Youth Aid Officer, Assistant Secretary (Penal Institutions) Department of Justice, Deputy Director General (Maori Health) with the Ministry of Health and as a public policy consultant. In 2000 Kim was appointed to the position of Executive Director, Prison Fellowship at the faith-based unit, Rimutaka Prison in after care prison services.

Another of the speakers is Rob Burt who has been an assistant teacher of vipassana meditation and has been involved with Ihi Tu, a prison programme for male prisoners in New Plymouth.

AUT lecturer and church leader Russell Waetford is also on the panel and will share his expertise gained as a member of the NZ Domestic Violence Programmes Approval Panel and contractor for prison programmes in two Auckland prisons.
