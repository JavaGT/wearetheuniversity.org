Tuapapa Putaiao Fellow plans study to benefit Northland ecosystems

Auckland University of Technology masters student Steve Pohe has been awarded a Tuapapa Putaiao Maori Fellowship to advance his research into the conservation of marine and freshwater ecosystems in Northland.

Steve Pohe is a Master of Applied Science student at the University’s Earth and Oceanic Sciences research institute (EOS) and will use the $40,000 awarded by the Foundation for Research, Science & Technology (FRST) to complete his MAppSc.

He grew up in Tai Tokerau, spending many of his childhood summers on the Hokianga Harbour, and later years in and around Whangarei’s Tutukaka coast.

“I am proud to be of Ngatihine descent and intend my academic efforts to directly benefit the conservation of the environment of Tai Tokerau and Aotearoa,” says Steve Pohe.

His interests include protection and restoration of freshwater ecosystems, ecological processes of aquatic macro-invertebrates, native freshwater fish, and marine ecology.

“As a true kiwi, I enjoy all outdoor recreational activities and sports ¯ in particular tramping, boating, fishing, league and touch rugby.”

Steve recently completed a Bachelor of Applied Science at AUT. The research he intends to carry out will be conservation driven and investigate aquatic macro-invertebrate genetic variability, native biota habitat requirements, and historic land use (using geographical information systems), of the two catchments of Matapouri in Northland.

“These studies are being carried out in conjunction with the local community and it is intended that the investigations will lead to the establishment of community driven monitoring programmes,” he says.
