AUT: Symposium in honour of eminent philosopher Gernot Böhme
============================================================

**Monday, 11 November 2013, 2:50 pm**  
**Press Release: [AUT University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University)**

**AUT University and the University of Auckland host symposium in honour of eminent philosopher Gernot Böhme**

The forthcoming _Interstices – Under Construction Symposium_ opens Friday, 22 November, at the University of Auckland and continues Saturday and Sunday at AUT University.

At 4pm on Friday, a panel of Auckland architects will discuss “Feeling good: the architecture of ambience”.

At 6pm, Professor Gernot Böhme, one of the world's foremost authorities on atmospheres in architecture, will deliver a key note address, “The Aesthetics of Atmospheres - Theory and Applications”. For Böhme, atmospheres are the primary reality aesthetics has to deal with. Atmosphere demands a co-presence of perceiver and perceived that engulfs the terms of any subject/object division as well as the longstanding bifurcation of physis and techné, nature and technology.

Böhme is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Darmstadt Technical University, Germany. He has been guest Professor at universities in Austria, Sweden, USA, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and Australia. He rose to prominence through his work in aesthetics, the philosophy of embodiment and technology, and practical philosophy.

The two day conference over the weekend, “Moved: Of Atmospheres and Affects”, will address questions such as, what are the roles of emotion and imagination and the immersion in affective states? What is the role, politically, culturally, creatively, of felt or non-conscious states and excesses of affect in our cities? What does _being moved_ mean, historically and today, for the thinking of design practices spanning cities, architecture, techno-systems, health, scenography, interiors, objects?
