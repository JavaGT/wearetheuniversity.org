Academic Audit report \* AUT University

AUT University is pleased with the report, released today, of the recent Academic Audit, undertaken by the NZ Universities Academic Audit Unit.

The Audit, in which all New Zealand universities participate, focused on teaching quality, programme delivery and the achievement of learning outcomes.

“The Audit confirms that AUT graduates are well prepared for their careers,” said Vice-Chancellor, Derek McCormack.

The Audit Unit commended AUT in a number of areas, including the assurance and enhancement of quality of it academic programmes and the extent and effectiveness of stakeholder involvement in the design and development of curricula. It also commended AUT for the effectiveness of its staircasing of students from pre-degree to degree programmes and for relevance of, and staff satisfaction with, staff development programmes.

The report commends good practice and makes recommendations intended to assist the university in its own programmes of continuous improvement.
