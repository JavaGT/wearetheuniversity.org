AUT to raise fees next year by 4.96 percent
===========================================

Auckland University of Technology is to raise its fees next year by 4.96 percent across the board.

The fee increase equates to a rise of $170 in 2004 for a year’s tuition on a degree programme.

AUT sets a standard flat fee for all its programmes. The 2004 fee will be $3627 inclusive of GST.

Acting Vice-chancellor, Derek McCormack, says the cost of the University’s most popular degree programmes will still be lower than most other universities.

He says the fee increase is necessary to ensure AUT can cover the increasing costs of providing tertiary education and to continue to upgrade and develop its facilities for a rapidly increasing student population.

“In the 1990s we began a development programme to upgrade facilities and services to improve students’ experiences and outcomes, and over the next two years will invest a further $100 million on developing the campus,” he says.

Derek McCormack says AUT recognises that students concerned about debt and rising living costs will find the fee increase challenging.
