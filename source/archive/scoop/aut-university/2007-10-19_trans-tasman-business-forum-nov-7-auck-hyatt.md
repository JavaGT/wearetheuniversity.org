Media advisory: The Trans-Tasman Business Forum – Nov 7, Auckland’s Hyatt

On the eve of the Australian election only one thing is certain in doing business across the ditch, that it’s on the up. What’s not certain is how to get traction in likely post-election instability – and how to get the bucks back in the hands of Kiwis.

The AUT University hosted Trans-Tasman Business Forum being held on November 7 at Auckland’s Hyatt brings together some of New Zealand’s most successful Australian operators including Fletcher Building Datacom, A2 Corporation and Kim Crawford Wines. The Forum, chaired by former World Trade Organisation Director-General Mike Moore, provides a blueprint for successfully growing Kiwi business interests with Australia.

Hon. Bob Carr, Premier, New South Wales (1995-2005)  
Dr Alan Bollard, Governor, Reserve Bank of New Zealand  
Jonathan Ling, Managing Director and Chief Executive, Fletcher Building  
Erica Crawford, Founder, Kim Crawford Wines  
Dr Allan Freeth, Chief Executive, TelstraClear  
Rhoda Holmes, General Manager, gen-i Australasia  
Anthony Lawler, Chief Executive, A2 Corporation  
Michael Browne, Chief Executive, Datacom Australia & Asia
