**Manukau Harbour researchers keen to hear from locals**

Tourism researchers exploring the recreation and tourism potential of the Manukau Harbour want to hear from as many locals and visitors as possible about the way they use the harbour.

They are encouraging locals and people who have recently visited the area to complete an online survey about what the harbour means to them, at www.manukauharboursurvey.co.nz

Researchers are also inviting local residents and business owners to learn about the research study at a series of public research presentations in March.

The Manukau Harbour Restoration Society (MHRS) has commissioned AUT University’s New Zealand Tourism Research Institute (NZTRI) to conduct the research, with support from the Manukau Harbour Forum and funding from the nine local boards linked to the harbour.

“We are aiming to increase collaboration between organisations and businesses and engage locals in developing the potential of the harbour as a destination,” says Jim Jackson, Chairman of the MHRS.

Results of the first phase of the research, a review of the online presence of tourism and recreational activities on the harbour, will be shared at public presentations in New Lynn, Waiuku and Onehunga.

“To complete the review we put ourselves in the shoes of someone who knows nothing about the Manukau Harbour and wants to find a way to experience it by searching online. It was sometimes hard to find information, and some of what we did find could be easily enhanced. At the presentations we will offer useful tips on how businesses and communities can boost their online visibility and make themselves easier to find,” says NZTRI Associate Director Dr Carolyn Deuchar.

At the presentations, locals and business owners will also have the opportunity to share their experiences of recreation and tourism on the harbour.

“The online survey is underway and we want to encourage as many visitors and locals as possible to complete it. The more people we hear from, the better picture we have of the current experience and the potential that is there,” says Deuchar.

**Research Presentations**  
New Lynn, Monday 24 March, 4pm – 5pm, Whau Local Board Office, 31 Totara Avenue, New Lynn  
Waiuku, Thursday 27 March, 5 – 6pm, Waiuku Civic Centre, King St, Waiuku
