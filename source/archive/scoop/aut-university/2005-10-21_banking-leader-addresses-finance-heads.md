Banking leader addresses finance heads

New Zealand’s experience in bank regulation and supervision came under the spotlight when Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Adrian Orr addressed finance heads at AUT University today.

The Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP) invited the banking leader to address the inaugural meeting of its New Zealand chapter.

GARP is the world’s leading independent association for risk managers. Its 46,000-strong membership includes professionals and academics from banks, investment firms, government, corporations and tertiary institutions.

Professor Alireza Tourani-Rad and Associate Professor Ming-Hua Liu from AUT University have been appointed as regional co-directors of GARP.

The co-directors said bank regulation is an important issue for the finance industry and it was significant to have a leading New Zealand banker address the group.

“The aim of this forum is to understand key issues in risk management and share latest developments, both here and abroad. It was a great honour to have Mr Adrian Orr as our first speaker,” they said.

GARP New Zealand will hold five meetings a year to provide members opportunity to exchange best practices. Leading financial experts from New Zealand and overseas will be guest speakers.

GARP is dedicated to the advancement of the risk profession through education, training and the promotion of best practices globally. Its mission is to be the leading professional association for risk managers.
