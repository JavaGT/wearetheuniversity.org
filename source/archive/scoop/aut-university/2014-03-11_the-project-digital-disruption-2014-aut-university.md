The Project: Digital Disruption 2014: AUT University
====================================================

**Press Release: [AUT University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/AUT_University)**

**_The Project_ back for 2014**

_30+ speakers, 400+ attendees, 2 days not to miss_

Think about the way you live now. How you connect with friends, how you get news and entertainment, how you manage your money, play, work, and relax… Digital technology is changing the future of everything.

On April 30 and May 1, AUT University, the US Embassy of New Zealand and Social Media New Zealand are partnering on _The Project: Digital Disruption_.

Bringing together innovators and world-class minds from the Pacific Rim and further afield, _The Project_ will examine how digital disruption is changing the way we live and work and how organisations are leveraging the opportunities created by digital disruption to transform their businesses.

In an action-packed two-day event, attendees will hear from more than 30 international and local speakers — some blazing with huge ideas and others who have already made their ideas real.

Organiser Martin Bell says, “everyone participates in the digital world one way or another and the opportunities offered by a digitally facilitated future are endless. But how are those opportunities going to be turned into reality? How will connections be made and ideas spread and implemented? How are we going to solve the pressing problems that confront us?”

The unique structure of _The Project_ allows for exploration of these topics on a conceptual, inspirational and practical level.

“Whatever your industry or interest, _The Project_ offers a rare chance to learn from our speaker’s successes – and failures – and together try to make sense of the ever-shifting and constantly-evolving digital world,” says Bell.

The first line-up of speakers has been released and it includes The Honourable Amy Adams, Minister for Communications and IT, Dr Jeff Cole (US), Director of the Center for the Digital Future and founder of the World Internet Project, Andrea Zurek (US), Founding Partner of XG Ventures, Anna Rooke (Australia), CEO of QUT Creative Enterprise Australia and Jane Wrightson (NZ), Chief Executive, NZ on Air.

In a first for the event, Macon Phillips, Coordinator, Bureau of International Information Programs at the U.S. Department of State and former Special Assistant to President Obama as Director of Digital Strategy, will be doing a live stream presentation from Washington, DC.

Phillips ran the new media program for the Presidential Transition Team, served as the deputy director of the Obama campaign’s new media department and led Blue State Digital’s strategy practice, working with clients like the Democratic National Committee and Senator Ted Kennedy.

This is the first of two speaker announcements in the lead up to the April event.

_The Project: Digital Disruption_ will be held on April 30 and May 1, at AUT University’s Sir Paul Reeves building on the City Campus.

This event is supported by AUT University, the US Embassy and Social Media New Zealand (SMNZ).
