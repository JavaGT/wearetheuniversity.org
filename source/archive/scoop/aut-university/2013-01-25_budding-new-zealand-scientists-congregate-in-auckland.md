**Budding New Zealand scientists congregate in Auckland**  
The next generation of New Zealand scientists congregated in Auckland this month for a two-week camp.

The 24th National Rotary Science and Technology Forum 2013 is co-hosted by AUT, Auckland and Massey Universities, and aims to turn teenagers on to science.

The residential programme from 12-26 January is for year 12 students who are outstanding in science, mathematics and technology. One hundred and sixty plus students planning to enter tertiary programmes in science or technology from all over New Zealand attended the camp. The Forum provides a mixture of university lectures, sports, arts and music activities for the fledgling scientists.

Milford Rotary Director Peter Best said that by the end of the Forum students have a better understanding of the tertiary courses they wish to follow and a fuller appreciation of the place of science and technology in the wider community.

“The camps are all about building on students’ enthusiasm for science in a fun and interactive way to encourage them to pursue tertiary education and a career in the field.”

The Forum also provides an opportunity for high-achieving students to spend time with similar minded people. The experiences gained invariably result in overall personal growth and a renewed motivation to succeed.

Comparative statistics1 on science students show that New Zealand is ranked number one in the OECD for new tertiary entrants in science – something that AUT, Auckland and Massey Universities are keen to continue through their support of the Forum. Developing and supporting our upcoming science students is also in line with the Government’s commitment to science and innovation in the 2012 Budget and through other initiatives such as the ‘_The Great NZ Science Project’_: “Science and technological innovation are major drivers of growth and international competitiveness” Minister for Science and Innovation, Steven Joyce.
