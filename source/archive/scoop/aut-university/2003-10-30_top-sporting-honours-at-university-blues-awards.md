Top sporting honours to be presented at University Blues awards

Students’ sporting prowess across a number of fields will be recognised at the Auckland University of Technology University Blues awards tomorrow night.

A highlight of the ceremony held at the AUT conference centre will be the address of guest speaker Beatrice Faumuina, the first New Zealander to win a gold medal at the athletics world championships.

MC Suzie Aitken will present 22 students with Blues awards, two students with the Sport Administration Blues award, as well as Sportswoman and Sportsman of the Year awards.

Nominees for Sportswoman of the Year are Casey Redman (In-line Hockey and Ice Hockey, Vaniya Lavea (Rugby), Simone Turner (Volleyball)

Nominees for Sportsman of the Year are Dion Jelley (Duathlon), Donovan Rihari (Touch Rugby), Terenzo Bozzone (Triathlon)

A University Blue is the highest sporting accolade that can be attained at university level. The Blues are part of a tradition dating back to 1922 in New Zealand and earlier in England, where the colours of Oxford and Cambridge Universities came to symbolise excellence in sport.

AUT Sport and Recreation Coordinator Bruce Meyer says a large number of successful New Zealanders have received this award.

“From Black Ferns captain Farah Palmer to All Black captain Anton Oliver, and Dean Kent to Lesley Nicol, the Blues network covers all walks of life.”

This is the second year AUT is holding the awards, but students from the University are already excelling at the National Blues.

Five AUT students received prestigious New Zealand University Blues awards at a function held at Wellington’s Parliament buildings in June.

Among the winners was George Tamaru, also AUT’s Sportsman of the Year for 2002, who won gold at last year’s Disabled World Bench Press Championship and aims to go one better when he defends his title in Christchurch this week.

The AUT Blues Awards will be held tomorrow October 31 at the AUT Conference Centre, Wellesley Street Campus, 6pm.
