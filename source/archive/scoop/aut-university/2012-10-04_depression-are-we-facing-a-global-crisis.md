Depression – are we facing a global crisis?

It’s World Mental Health Day next Wednesday, 10th October. This year the focus is on depression - a critical health issue for New Zealanders. One in six experience serious depression and one in seven young people will experience depression before age 24.

AUT University are hosting a special event on World Mental Health Day. Guest speakers include Sir John Kirwan, Mental Health Ambassador and Dr John Crawshaw, Director of Mental Health from the Ministry of Health.

AUT’s Professor of Psychology and Public Health, Max Abbott, says World Mental Health Day was adopted internationally by the World Federation for Mental Health (WFMH) as a means of promoting mental health. Professor Abbott was the President of the WFMH when World Mental Health Day was first established in 1992.

“Globally, depression affects around 350 million people. The World Health Organisation estimate depression will be the second highest cause of ill health and premature death globally by 2020.”

To date, New Zealand has achieved innovative work in the area of depression, particularly breaking down stigma and providing a wider range of interventions in primary care settings, says Professor Abbott.

“On 10th October I am fortunate to be joined by key contributors to advances in mental health, including Sir John Kirwan, Dr John Crawshaw, Director of Mental Health from the Ministry of Health, and Helen Wood, General Manager of Mental Health Services at Waitemata and Auckland District Health Boards. This year we focus on depression being a treatable illness.”

AUT University hosts ‘Depression – A global crisis?’ on 10th October as part of World Mental Health Day and Mental Health Awareness Week.
