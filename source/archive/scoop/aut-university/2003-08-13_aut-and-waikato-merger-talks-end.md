AUT and Waikato Merger Talks End

AUT's governing Council last night decided not to proceed at this stage with merger discussions with Waikato University, and intends to proceed with the process of appointing a new Vice-Chancellor prior to Christmas.

Both institutions have spent the past six weeks considering the academic and business cases for a merger.

AUT Chancellor Wyn Hoadley said today that AUT had determined through this process that the most pressing business issue for the University right now is the appointment of a new Vice-Chancellor.

"Our investigations have discovered that the case for a merger with Waikato is not compelling enough to come ahead of the appointment of a new Vice-Chancellor.

"However, we have welcomed discussions about co-operative possibilities with Waikato and are encouraged by the co-operative engagements already in place. AUT remains open to continuing to explore other ways to work together in the future.

"We know from the investigative process we have worked through that to remain on our own path of consolidation and individual development is a strong and viable one. We have confidence in our own capacity to grow and succeed into the future," Mrs Hoadley said.
