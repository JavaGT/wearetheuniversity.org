**AUT Future of Work Conference 9 February 2015**

Future of work experts and practitioners will share their diverse knowledge at an AUT University conference on 9 February.

More than 20 speakers, including researchers from AUT and beyond, policy makers and employers, will present on a wide range of topics, providing attendees (including HR practitioners and employers) with a ‘big picture’ understanding of the future of work.

Labour Party MP Grant Robertson will open the conference with an introduction to the Labour Party’s recently announced Future of Work Commission.

Topics covered will include the mental and physical health of workers, precarious employment, teleworking, Maori leadership, diversity and the ageing workforce.

For a full list of presenters and topics, see the conference schedule

“Rapid workplace change is being driven by new digital technologies, globalisation, environmental pressures, changing workforce demographics and new forms of social interaction,” says conference organiser and co-director of AUT’s New Zealand Work Research Institute Professor Tim Bentley. “The changing nature of work has big implications for the New Zealand economy and for employers, educators and workers.”

Journalists are welcome to attend the conference. For more information or to register, contact: Aimee Wilkins, Communications Manager, AUT University aimee.wilkins@aut.ac.nz
