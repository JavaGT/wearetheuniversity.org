Top night for winners at

AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards

Thirteen of New Zealand’s most significant business support organisations stole the limelight at the Langham Hotel last night as winners of the 2012 AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards.

Over 700 business leaders gathered at the gala dinner, hosted by AUT Business School, to hear which of this year’s 47 finalists had secured the winning trophies across 12 different categories.

The most anticipated award of the night, presented to the Supreme Winner, went to Michael Barnett, CEO of Auckland Chamber of Commerce, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to business and the community over the past 21 years. Michael also won the award for the Individual Category.

In addition to the 13 winners, Chris Quin – CEO of Gen-I Australasia, Rotorua Chamber of Commerce, Kordia Networks, and Onehunga High Business School were also Highly Commended for their dedication to business excellence.

Dean of AUT Business School Dr Geoff Perry says the quality of service offered by all of this year’s finalists is highly encouraging for the future growth of business in New Zealand.

“Every individual and organisation has had to demonstrate their successful leadership and planning, customer and market focus, provision of business support, evaluation, improvement and business results.

“All entries go through a vigorous evaluation process that is overseen by the New Zealand Business Excellence Foundation, including evaluators from our own Management Department at AUT Business School. Excellence is then assessed using the international Baldrige criteria. With this in mind, the winners really have demonstrated they are top of their game.

“I wish to congratulate them all for their outstanding success and support of New Zealand business.”

AUT Business School took ownership of the prestigious Excellence in Business Support Awards earlier this year, receiving the highest ever number of entries and finalists in the awards seven year history. Dr Perry says as a Business School, it’s important for AUT to celebrate the businesses and communities that contribute to New Zealand’s economic development, so that together, they can continue to add value to the changing world of business.

The AUT Excellence in Business Support Awards gala dinner was also the first ever Be. Accessible accredited event in New Zealand. Be. Accessible provides businesses with programmes that enable them to become more accessible to all audiences. In order to become a bronze accredited event, AUT Business School met a number of requirements including the provision of NZ Sign Language interpreters, and the placement of Braillised messaging on all tickets and programmes.

Sarah Trotman, Founder of the Excellence in Business Support Awards and Director of Business Relations at AUT Business School says, “It was important that this event Be. Accessible, simply because the Business School is totally committed to educating future business leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs who understand the social and economic value of accessibility.”
