**Talent at the AUT Rookie Fashion Show**

It was all about showcasing a broad range of talent at the AUT Rookie fashion show in Auckland late last week.

The AUT Rookie fashion show, held at Shed 10, was a fusion of live models, a DJ and a film that showcased the final year fashion student’s collections.

AUT’s Head of the Fashion and Textiles Department Andreas Mikellis was incredibly pleased, not only with the work produced by the students, but the show as well.

“The standard and quality of the work this year was exceptional. We had a really wonderful diversity of design work which helps make the cohort of designers much more interesting,” says Mikellis.

Twenty four collections were shown, including four collaborations between fashion and textile students.

Guests were treated to collections with volume, experimental proportions, laser cut and moulded leather, colour palettes that went from monochromatic to strong, bright and dynamic, and fabrics that are pushing new boundaries.

The film, playing throughout the show, used the students and their collections to give a contemporary idea of Auckland from the perspective of young graduates.

“Every year we try and do something different and this show was no exception. The students really embraced the idea of the film and worked with the crew so well. To have that playing while the models were walking gave guests a really dynamic experience and integrated the designers into the show even more,” he says.

AUT Rookie is AUT University’s end-of-year showcase for our third year Bachelor of Design- Fashion Design students. A select number of students are chosen to show. Other students have their work displayed at the AUT Fashion Showroom as part of the AD13 Festival.
