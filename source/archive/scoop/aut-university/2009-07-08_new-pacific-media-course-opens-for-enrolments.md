AUCKLAND (_AUT Online/Pacific Media Watch_): A new regional one-year Pacific media course has opened for enrolments for the inaugural March 2010 intake at AUT University, which offers New Zealand’s largest and most diverse communication studies programme.

The one-year Graduate Diploma in Pacific Journalism is grounded in AUT’s core media programmes, but is especially designed for mature age people seeking a media career and regional journalists with some experience seeking a higher qualification.

An emphasis will be on digital storytelling.

“I’m, really excited that AUT is offering a Graduate Diploma in Pacific Journalism,” says Pacific Media Centre chairman John Utanga, who is also a senior journalist on TVNZ”s _Tagata Pasifika_ weekly current affairs programme.

“It has the potential to significantly boost the number of trained Pasifika journalists and serve as a pathway to a significant career in the media.

“Also, many Pacific people already working in ethnic media have had little or no media training; this course is one way in which they can get further understanding of their roles and responsibilities as journalists while gaining a valuable qualification.”

In addition to core papers such as News Reporting and Media Law and Ethics, the course students will be doing papers such as Maori and Pasifika Media Industry, Reporting the Pacific Region and Pasifika media internships.

Credits will also be available for Pacific language skills.

AUT’ School of Communication Studies has its own award-winning newspaper, _Te Waha Nui_; several online publications; a radio station, Radio Static; and television outlets.
