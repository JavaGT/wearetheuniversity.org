New speakers announced for ‘Project 15’ - this year’s most innovative conference  

  
Project 15 – a conference focused on ‘taking New Zealand Innovation Global’ has announced four new world-leading speakers to the already impressive line-up of local and international experts, which include: -

· Steve Sammartino (Australia), start up wizard;

· Melissa Clark-Reynolds (New Zealand), serial entrepreneur;

· Josh Daniell (New Zealand), crowdfunding innovator; and

· William Palmer (New Zealand), movie-loving CEO.

  
They will join previously announced international speakers: -  

· James Whitaker (USA), Microsoft’s chief tech evangelist;

· David Smith (USA), celebrated author and educator; and

· Dave Schiff (USA), creative heavyweight from one of the America’s leading ad agencies.

  
The conference will take place on 16-17 April 2015 at AUT University, Auckland and will also host a variety of local speakers including Vaughan Rowsell, Mark Thomas, Malcolm Rands, Dr. Claire McGowan, Dr. Jane Cherrington and Dan Kahn. The full list of Project 15 speakers will be announced in early March.

"We're really excited to bring such an engaging line up of speakers together for Project 15", says event executive producer, Martin Bell. “New Zealand is seen as a leader in innovation but the next step for local entrepreneurs and exporters is taking our expertise to the world. Project 15 is future focused and will challenge the way we react to the challenges of new technologies, new business models and the emergence of new market strategies. The conference is for anyone interested in making a difference for their business and career.”

The format for Project15 will include a full day of speaker sessions followed by a half day of tailored workshops. The conference will also form part of an extended series of activities during 2015 which includes regular Project Connect networking events.

Following the 2014 conference Chris Lowther, CEO of Jericho, Smart Digital Marketing said he would be first in line for Project 15.

“Our staff that attended The Project in 2014 commented on the quality and execution of the event. They also spoke of the infectious energy in the room. Their feedback made me envious that I couldn’t attend”, said Lowther.  
Project 15 is a collaboration between founding partners AUT University, The US Embassy and Social Media New Zealand.
