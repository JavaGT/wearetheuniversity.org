**Negative responses to pop-up messages could signal harmful gambling habits**

New research could help identify concerning gambling habits, according to investigations by AUT University’s Gambling and Addictions Research Centre.

A recent study of gambling behaviours, conducted by AUT University in conjunction with the Ministry of Health, has revealed important insights into the role of pop-up messages and player information display systems (PIDs) in mitigating gambling harm sustained through Electronic Gaming Machines (EGMs). Pop-up messages and PIDs show the time and money a gambler has spent during a live session, and are among a raft of initiatives aimed at reducing the negative impacts of high-risk EGM gambling.

The research found little evidence that the compulsory pop-up messages or the voluntary PIDs impacted on participants’ enjoyment of gambling, a key point of opposition when they were introduced. However the findings revealed that negative responses from gamblers could be a tell-tale sign of gambling problems.

AUT University’s Dr Jason Landon says, “Gamblers who show signs of annoyance or distress in response to pop-up messages are not the norm. Family, friends and venue staff should be aware that this behaviour is a likely indicator of harmful gambling.” Gamblers questioning the accuracy of the pop-up and PID messages could also be indicative of problematic gambling behaviour.

Also notable was the fact that pop-up messages were shown to be useful in helping some gamblers to maintain control over their gambling. Approximately one quarter of gamblers who were aware of pop-up messages during their gambling reported that the pop-ups assisted them in regulating the time and money they spent on gambling.

According to Dr Landon, the positive impact of the pop-up messages also extended to gambling behaviour. “Those who reported that they thought about their gambling during a pop-up message tended to spend less money gambling overall,” says Dr Landon. Pop-ups were not linked to a reduction in time spent gambling however.

New Zealand is the first country in the world to introduce mandatory pop-up messages in EGMs. This study provides sought-after evidence of their harm minimisation capacity, which is of international interest.

“Pop-up messages can heighten some people’s awareness of their gambling, enabling them to consciously consider their participation and help avoid gambling-related harm,” says Dr Landon, who adds that the impact of message content on the effectiveness is this intervention is of particular interest. “These research findings will inform gambling policy decisions, and we hope will continue progress towards achieving safer gambling environments.”

The study involved surveys of 521 gamblers recruited from gambling venues (who were resurveyed three and six months later), an observational study of gambling behaviour, focus groups with gamblers and stakeholders, and a literature review.
