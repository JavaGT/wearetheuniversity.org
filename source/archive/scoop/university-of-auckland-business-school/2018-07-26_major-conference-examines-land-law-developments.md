Major conference examines land law developments
===============================================

**Press Release: [University of Auckland Business School](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Auckland_Business_School)**

**Major conference examines land law developments**

**Significant changes to the country’s land law, including security of title, will be the focus of an upcoming conference at the University of Auckland next month.**

Hosted by the Auckland Law School, _New Horizon for Torrens: Current Reforms, Emerging Issues_ will feature presentations by leading local and international experts on the current issues and emerging developments in land law, including in-depth analysis of the new Land Transfer Act 2017, which comes into force later this year.

The new Act includes a number of substantial reforms and changes to our Land Transfer system, including giving the court a discretion to intervene to override the previous iron-clad Government guarantee of registered title where it is found that a prior owner has been unjustly deprived of their land. Other changes include greater flexibility in the compensation regime for deprivation of an interest in land, and a number of refinements to the automated system of registration of land dealings.

The two-day conference features keynote presentations by judges, academics, practitioners and other legal experts from New Zealand, and comparable jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada, the UK, and Europe, who will provide authoritative analysis of land issues and the reforms that have been implemented or contemplated in their jurisdictions. This includes discussion of the issues arising from possible privatisation of public land registries.
