The University of Auckland Presents

The Three Minute Thesis Competition

Grand Final: 3 September, 4pm.

The University of Auckland Business School, 12 Grafton Road, Auckland.

  
The Three Minute Thesis Competition — also known as ‘Thesis Idol’ — is run in universities worldwide. Students are given just three minutes in which to explain the gist of their thesis. One single powerpoint slide is permitted as a visual aid.  
   
The University of Auckland competition is structured in heats with a University final. The presentations are judged by a three person panel. The entrants are judged on communication style, comprehension and engagement.

The winner, first runner-up and second runner-up will each receive a watch from Citizen Watches. The winner will also receive $1000 and a trip to Queensland to compete in the Trans-Tasman final.

The heats will be held on September 1 and 2, and the finals will be held at OGGB from 4pm on Friday September 3, and will be followed by a prize giving, pizza and drinks. The finals are free and open to everyone to attend. They promise to deliver a fun afternoon of humour, competition, celebrity judges, networking and spectacle!
