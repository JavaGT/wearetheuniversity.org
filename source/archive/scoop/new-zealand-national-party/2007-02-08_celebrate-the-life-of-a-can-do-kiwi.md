Celebrate the life of a can-do Kiwi

National Party Leader John Key says all New Zealanders should celebrate the life of Professor Alan MacDiarmid, who he describes as a ‘can-do Kiwi’.

“His contribution to the world of science and his contribution to New Zealand’s academic reputation is without question.

“Even though Professor MacDiarmid spent most of his time in the US since 1950, he maintained close links with this country, like so many other Kiwis who have reached beyond our shores to pursue their chosen path.

“Professor MacDiarmid was what I would describe as a can-do Kiwi, whose aspiration and focus should be admired by us all.”
