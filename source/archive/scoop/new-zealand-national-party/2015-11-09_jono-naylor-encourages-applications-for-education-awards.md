MP Jono Naylor encourages applications for the 2016 PM’s Education Excellence Awards

“Our education professionals work hard every day for our children, and they deserve to be publicly recognised and encouraged for their contribution,” Jono Naylor said.

“I want to see our local educators apply for the 2016 Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards, which are now open. We have so many talented teachers in Palmerston North who I have met during visits to our local schools and early childhood centres.

“The awards recognise and celebrate these people in our communities who are delivering the best teaching to children, those who raise the bar that bit higher.”

The awards cover early childhood education, primary, through to secondary schooling.

The four main categories are excellence in governing, excellence in leading, excellence in teaching and learning, and excellence in engaging.

The category winners will receive $20,000. The winner of the Prime Minister’s Supreme Award for the partnership or group that has had the most impact on raising student achievement will receive an additional $30,000.

“Last year Palmerston North had a finalist in the awards. I believe that there are some amazing educators in our city who are also worthy of recognition.

“High-quality education provides the opportunity for any child from any background to get ahead and make the most of their life, and the teachers who contribute to this should be celebrated,” Naylor said.
