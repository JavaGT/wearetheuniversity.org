TEC turnover tops 25% on the brink of change

Revelations today that the turnover at the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) was a massive 25.5% in the 2006/07 year does not auger well for the implementation of Labour's tertiary reforms, says National's Tertiary Education spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.

"At the parliamentary select committee today, TEC admitted that 2006/07 was the most disruptive year in its history.

"Not only did the TEC shed one quarter of its total staff, but they also changed the chairman, the CEO is about to leave, and there is a new Minister.

"This leaves very few of those responsible around to be held accountable for the reforms.

"The 2007 OECD report on tertiary education says changes have occurred every two years and the system is complex.

"National estimates that over $419 million has been spent by Labour on changes that have not worked. It is irresponsible that this time the Government is so poorly organised.

"Labour has demonstrated poor planning and a lack of good governance in this crucial sector at a time when it is needed most."
