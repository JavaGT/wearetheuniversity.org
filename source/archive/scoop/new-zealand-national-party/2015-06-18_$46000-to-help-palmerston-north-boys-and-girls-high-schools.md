**$46,000 to help Palmerston North Boys and Girls High Schools grow their export education**

Palmerston North Boys and Girls High Schools will receive $46,000 in match funding from Education New Zealand for their international education project.

“I’m thrilled to see schools in Palmerston North will have Government financial support to help them develop a pathway education option for international students from China,” said Jono Naylor.

Boys and Girls High’s project is one of 10 new growth initiatives receiving funding from the International Education Growth Fund (IEGF). In total, $376,325 is being allocated across the 10 providers.

Boys and Girls High Schools will work with Palmerston North Intermediate Normal and College Street Normal Schools to develop the pathway from Primary to Secondary school. This project is known as the Manawatu Pathway for China.

“The co-funding supports the development of new products and programmes designed to boost our international education industry.

“It’s a good way to try out new ideas and then share the ones that work for the benefit of all our educators.

“As I said recently we need to continue to promote ourselves as a great place to come and study.

“This funding will help ensure Palmerston North continues to be a world class education city.

“International education helps grow our economy by boosting our presence on the global stage. It gives us people-to-people links with other countries, which goes a long way in supporting our importers and exporters to succeed. It also injects a significant amount into the local economy and creates local jobs.”
