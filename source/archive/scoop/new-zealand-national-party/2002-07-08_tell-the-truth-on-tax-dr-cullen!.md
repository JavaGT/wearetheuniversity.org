Tell The Truth On Tax Dr Cullen!
================================

**Monday, 8 July 2002, 4:03 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

8 July 2002

"Michael Cullen is still failing to come clean with voters on all of Labour's plans for tax if re-elected," says National Party Leader Bill English.

"I note that at today's announcement of Labour's economic policy Dr Cullen failed to give a categorical assurance that there will be no new taxes if it's given a second term."

Mr English says Labour's track record on tax shows it just can't be trusted on the subject.

"At the last election, Dr Cullen and Helen Clark promised no new taxes for the thousands of low and middle income earners and then went ahead and increased excise and petrol taxes.

"New Zealanders have every right to question Labour's credibility and sincerity about taxes."

Meanwhile, Mr English also questions the real motivation behind Labour's investigation of 'a dedicated health tax to replace an equivalent amount of income tax'

"Why would you bother ring-fencing a tax if you don't plan increasing it in the future? Labour is trying to create another petrol tax - where once it is established it can be increased at will.

"The drift of Labour's policy is towards more tax and spend and has nothing to boost the competitiveness of a business sector faced with a tightening economy," Mr English says.
