$1.6 million pillaged from Correspondence School

Labour has slyly shifted a further $1.6 million of funding from the Correspondence School, hoping no one would notice, says National Party Associate Education spokesman Colin King.

The education estimates budget tabled in Parliament yesterday, reveal a $1.6 million decrease in funding for New Zealand’s largest school – further degrading what was once an iconic institution.

“This school is the only option for many rurally isolated students and it is outrageous that Labour continues to ruthlessly dismember the supports previously available to it.

“Not only is the school facing less financial support, but Labour has totally removed parents from its governance structure, in favour of central control. This has seriously eroded parents’ confidence that their children’s best education interests are being served.

“The Correspondence School is the only option for thousands of children because they are geographically isolated, or they are not welcome at, or do not choose to attend, mainstream schools.

“The latest ERO report documents the school’s downward spiral.

“Parents used to be the dedicated core of the Correspondence School, and until they are restored to a governance role, there is unlikely to be an improvement.

“National recognises the enormous contribution parents make towards the education of their children and, once in government, will ensure they once again play a vital role.”
