Tsunami tragedy will touch New Zealand

"It is inevitable that a large number of New Zealanders will be affected by the tsunami disaster that is estimated to have killed many thousands of people across Asia," says National Party Leader Don Brash.

"Of course we have strong and vibrant Asian communities here in New Zealand, including large Sri Lankan and Indian populations. Many Kiwis, either directly or indirectly, will be touched by this - such is the sheer scale of the disaster.

"I'm sure all New Zealanders will be horrified by the loss of life and devastation at a time of year when most of us are thinking about loved ones, and looking forward to spending time with family and friends.

"On behalf of the National Party, I wish to extend our deepest and most sincere condolences to all those affected by this tragedy," says Dr Brash.
