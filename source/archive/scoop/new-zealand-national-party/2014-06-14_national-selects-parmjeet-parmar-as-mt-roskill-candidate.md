National selects Parmjeet Parmar as Mt Roskill candidate  

  
The National Party has announced that Dr Parmjeet Parmar will be its candidate for the Mt Roskill electorate at the 2014 General Election.

Dr Parmar was selected by a meeting of local party members tonight.

“Parmjeet is an exceptional candidate. She has a genuine connection to the community and truly represents the people of Mt Roskill. I know she will apply her skills to work tirelessly for them in a National-led Government,” said Northern Regional Chair Andrew Hunt.

Dr Parmar said she felt privileged to be chosen to contest the seat.

“It’s a great honour to be selected as National’s candidate for Mt Roskill,” said Dr Parmar.

“Mt Roskill communities are making real strides under John Key’s National-led Government. We’re seeing a stronger economy with more jobs, better public services in health and education, and safer communities with crime at a 35-year low.

“I’m looking forward to getting out and about to engage with voters because Mt Roskill deserves a strong voice in Parliament and another strong, stable National Government.”
