**Local MP encourages you to get behind Plunket**

Plunket is challenging Kiwis to dress as superheroes to raise money in its annual appeal this week.

_Be a SuperHero for Under-fives_ is theme for the Plunket Appeal week, which runs from March 22 to March 28.

“I support this very worthy cause and encourage you to do the same,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, MP for Maungakiekie says.

“Keep an eye out for street appeal collectors in Maungakiekie on Friday 26 March.

“You could also take up the workplace challenge by dressing as super hero and see who can raise the most money for Plunket, while having a whole lot of fun!”

Plunket is the largest provider of support services for the development, health and wellbeing of children. These services are available free to New Zealand families with children from birth to 5 year years old.

Each year, tens of thousands of New Zealand parents and whänau use Plunket services.

Plunket nurses provide support through home and clinic visits, mobile clinics and PlunketLine, a free 24/7 advice services for parents (0800 933 922).

Funds raised during the Annual Appeal go towards supporting Kiwi kids and families from all walks of like.
