Kapa Haka recognition political correctness gone mad

Dr Nick Smith - National Education Spokesperson

Recognising Kapa Haka in the NCEA is further evidence that the Government’s new school qualification is becoming a joke, says National’s Education spokesperson Dr Nick Smith.

“That a student can get over 24 out of 80 points for level one NCEA from participating in a school’s Kapa Haka group is political correctness gone mad. This is a cynical exercise in getting more students a qualification at school not by improving their education but by lowering students.

“Kapa Haka is like school choirs, sports teams and school productions. These activities have long been acknowledged at school in reports and references but it is a nonsense to include them as part of a formal qualification.

“This nonsense of creating qualifications for Kapa Haka, travel, outdoor pursuits and Maori song is dumbing down academic achievement in our schools.

“Academic excellence and not political correctness must be the driver for our system of school qualifications,” said Dr Smith.
