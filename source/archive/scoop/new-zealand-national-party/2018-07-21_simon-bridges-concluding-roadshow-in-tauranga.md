Simon Bridges concluding roadshow in Tauranga

National Party Leader Simon Bridges has today concluded a three-month tour of New Zealand, rounding off almost 70 public meetings attended by around 10,000 Kiwis who turned out to share their views about what matters to them.

“I have the honour of being leader of New Zealand’s largest political party which represents the views and aspirations of hundreds of thousands of Kiwis,” Mr Bridges says.

“This roadshow has been about listening to them about the issues they care about and to hear from them what they want to see the National Party focused on as we work towards 2020.

“Over the last three months, I’ve travelled from the top of the North Island to the bottom of the South Island and heard a range of views about hundreds of different issues.

“Crime, roading, housing, the environment, education, health and of course the economy were discussed at almost every meeting. New Zealanders are focused on jobs and opportunities for their families, protecting our environment for future generations and building on the progress we have made in recent years.

“And people are worried about the direction of this Government. They’re worried about the uncertainty and lack of leadership, the rising cost of living and the slowing economy and the Government’s soft on crime approach.

“It’s clear to them these are all being driven by decisions made by the Government – decisions that often look ill-thought-out, chaotic and destructive.

“National knows, and New Zealanders know, that we won’t get ahead with more taxes and low-growth policies that slow our economy down.

“And we know that New Zealanders want more than just a good vibe – they want real plans and policies that will make a difference and create opportunities for them and their family.

“I’m encouraged by the response I’ve had throughout the roadshow and it’s reinforced to me that National is in sync with New Zealanders and focused on the issues that matter to them.

“I look forward to using what I’ve learned from listening to New Zealanders to develop ambitious new policies for our country’s future as we look to earn the right to govern again in 2020.”
