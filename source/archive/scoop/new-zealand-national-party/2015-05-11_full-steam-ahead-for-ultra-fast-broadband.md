Full steam ahead for Ultra-Fast Broadband in Manawatu and Wanganui

More and more Kiwis are connecting to the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband network – and the local numbers are up.

The results for Manawatu and Wanganui, released as part of the Government’s quarterly announcement on UFB and Rural Broadband, show a positive 32 per cent increase in connections to the network.

37,117 end users from Palmerston North, Feilding, Levin, and Wanganui can now connect. The Government has a target of 68,400 end users being able to connect by June 2019.

“The good news is we’re well ahead of schedule on getting this done,” says Mr Naylor.

“Before we were re-elected, we said we were going to commit to building a world-class broadband network right here in New Zealand – and that’s happening right now.”

“We are getting the benefit of this build right now. We have thousands of households already connected,” Mr Naylor says.  
“This quick, reliable internet connection makes life easier for businesses, connecting easier and more enjoyable for homes, and learning in schools a far better and productive experience.

“It’s good for us here, and it’s good for all of New Zealand. I’m sure the people here of Palmerston North and surrounds are also looking forward to more of the network coming to town,” Mr Naylor says.
