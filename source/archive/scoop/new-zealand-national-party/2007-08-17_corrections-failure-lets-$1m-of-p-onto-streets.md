Corrections failure lets $1m of 'P' onto streets

The Government’s failure to get on top of the prison contraband problem is directly responsible for $1 million of methamphetamine getting onto the streets of Auckland, Wanganui, and Wellington, says National’s Justice & Corrections spokesman, Simon Power.

He is commenting after a court was told the methamphetamine was imported from Thailand by a prisoner using an unauthorised cellphone from inside Rimutaka.

“The Labour Government’s failure to heed warnings about the extent of the contraband problem is directly to blame for this drug deal happening.

“If this prisoner didn’t have a cellphone, it wouldn’t have happened.

“Not only does it seem a deal was conducted from inside one of our toughest prisons, but it was done right under the nose of a special corruption inquiry there – which has been going on for 10 months.

“The Government should give an assurance that this latest incident will be covered by the inquiry to ensure the cellphone wasn’t smuggled in by staff.

“This must be an acute embarrassment for Minister Damien O’Connor and CEO Barrie Matthews, who have tried to talk tough in recent months on contraband.

“But they were too slow to act. For far too long they did little to stop the flow of contraband into our prisons, even denying there was a big problem.

“Then finally, in June, they contradicted those denials by saying they would establish an anti-corruption unit.

“They also promised new technology to disable mobile phones. That was way back in May, so where is it? They don’t have to invent it, just buy it.

“Money shouldn’t be a problem in a department rife with overspending: tens of thousands of dollars on flat-screen TVs and Playstations, $1 million a month on consultants, a $1 million annual bill for intention damage – and $1.7 million in staff bonuses.

“It wouldn’t be hard to find savings there.

“Under the Labour Government, Rimutaka has become a haven for criminals to continue their illegal activities unhindered.

“It’s time for a full parliamentary inquiry into this department.”
