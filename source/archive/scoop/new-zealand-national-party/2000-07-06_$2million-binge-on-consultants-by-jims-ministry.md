$2million binge on consultants by Jim's Ministry
================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Jim Anderton's new Ministry has spent-up on consultants to the tune of $2million in just four months, Opposition Industry and Regional Development spokesperson John Luxton said today.

"Jim Anderton has been preaching to New Zealanders that "consultants would be eliminated from the public services, and that the money would instead go on "nurses, fire fighters and teachers". (Waikato Times 20.10.99)

"But what have we got today? The Deputy Prime Minister defending his Ministry of Economic Development for spending $2 million on 116 consultancies for the following things:

\* $90,949 to design and apply a new logo \* $18,000 to layout two Government reports and a new corporate folder \* $12,000 for new office floor plans \* $127,000 to give the Deputy Prime Minister immediate support \* $49,000 to organise a conference \* $20,000 to promote BIZ programme \* $125/an hour for someone to attend a meeting in Paris

"Then there's the almost half million dollar consultants fees for the Electricity Inquiry and the $170,000 so far for the Telecommunications Inquiry

"Jim Anderton wrote to Government Departments earlier this year saying the "employment of consultants was contrary to the Government's overall aims of developing public sector capabilities. He also said the is determined to reduce the use of consultants and see their use ultimately eliminated.

"His Department has $2million of consultants' bills already. This is a clear case of Mr Anderton saying one thing in Opposition, and doing the opposite in power."
