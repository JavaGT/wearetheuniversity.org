Typically bureaucratic answer to obesity

Katherine Rich MP  
National Party Education Spokeswoman

Typically bureaucratic answer to obesity

"Labour's move to ban certain foods from school canteens and tuck shops is a typically bureaucratic answer to childhood obesity," says National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.

"Tomorrow's Schools are fast becoming Yesterday's Schools with the amount of meddling the Labour Government is doing in local school management.

"Labour keeps saying it wants to reduce bureaucracy, and then with every announcement it ups the red-tape and reporting requirements."

Mrs Rich says many schools are already working towards providing healthy eating choices, and students will quickly find ways around a blanket prohibition for certain foods.

"What next, lunch-box police?"

"No one denies that we need to tackle childhood obesity, but many schools already have policies in place so they can provide healthy eating options.

"But getting kids to choose mung beans over meat pies is another issue."
