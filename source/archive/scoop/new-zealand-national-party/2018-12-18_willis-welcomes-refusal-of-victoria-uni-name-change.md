Nicola Willis - National List MP

18 December 2018

National list MP based in Wellington Nicola Willis welcomes the decision to decline Victoria University of Wellington’s application for a name change following significant opposition.

“This is a fantastic outcome for the thousands of students, alumni and staff who opposed the change.

“The success of the campaign against the name change is a testament to the strength of the university community. Our voices have been heard.

“I congratulate the Minister of Education Chris Hipkins for his decision to decline the application for a name change.

“Victoria University of Wellington must now put the name change proposal behind it. It’s time to move forward and focus on the opportunities and challenges that are before it. Students, Wellingtonians and taxpayers would not want to see further money spent in court on this issue.

“This process has shown the strength of connection that many people have to the University, we can build on this to support its future success.”
