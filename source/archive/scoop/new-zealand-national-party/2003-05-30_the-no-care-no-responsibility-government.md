The no care, no responsibility Government

The no care, no responsibility Government

Revelations of financial impropriety at Te Mangai Paho once again show the cavalier and cynical attitude of this no care, no responsibility Government, says National Party Maori Affairs spokesperson Georgina te Heuheu.

"Labour takes our hard earned taxes, hands out cash to organisations, and then not only doesn't give a toss about how it's spent but also sheds itself of all responsibility.

"The Treasury report on Te Mangai Paho is another damning indictment on this Government's shambolic record of allowing taxpayer funds to be burnt on a bon fire of financial excesses, while all the time demonstrating a disdain for any accountability," she says.

"The scandals have included the 'Ross Armstrong/Post Bank' saga, the excessive and extravagant spending both in New Zealand and internationally of Transend executives, the 'Bathgate double dipping' incident and the thousands of dollars wasted on the appointment of convicted fraudster, John Davey to the Maori Television service.

"They all symbolise a culture of hands off, 'no care, no responsibility' which has become the hallmark of the current Government."

"While heads must roll in Te Mangai Paho, the ultimate blame must be laid at the feet of the Minister of Maori Affairs," Mrs te Heuheu says.

"He and his Government have shown a complete contempt for all New Zealanders and they've failed miserably in their duty to protect public money.

"The Prime Minister must act immediately to reign in her on holiday and out of control Ministers," Mrs te Heuheu says
