Desperate Labour re-announces cancer funding

Desperate Labour re-announces cancer funding

National Party Health spokesman Paul Hutchison says Labour's desperate attempt to woo voters by re-announcing cancer funding regionally will not work.

Labour announced its Cancer Control Action Plan in March, saying 'the plan includes nearly $6 million to top up existing palliative care, support and rehabilitation, and $4 million more for cancer treatment drugs'.

A media release from Helen Clark today said: "The money is Canterbury DHB's share of nearly $6 million extra for hospices and $4 million for extra drugs".

"Clearly, Labour is running desperately low on ideas, and is planning to re-launch most of its Budget announcements regionally," says Dr Hutchison.

"Labour made the announcement in March. Three months down the track a few bad opinion polls come along and, in desperation, Labour has resorted to regurgitating its own funding announcements.

"It doesn't matter how many times the same money is announced, Labour's massively bureaucratic, inefficient wasteful health system will not look any better," says Dr Hutchison.
