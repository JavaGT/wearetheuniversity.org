Barker’s excuses fool no one

National’s Law & Order spokesman, Simon Power, says the Labour Government must take full blame for the increasing amount of reparation currently owed to victims of crime.

“Courts Minister Rick Barker can make all the excuses under the sun, but it won’t change the fact that under his Government the situation has got worse, not better.

“The real point is that in the latest financial year, 97%, or $57 million, of reparation not yet paid is either overdue or being drip-fed to victims, and this has barely changed, despite Mr Barker’s claims to the contrary.”

In 2003/04, 97% ($51m) was unpaid, in 2002/03 it was 98% ($47m), and in 2001/02 it was 98% ($43m).

“These are his department’s own figures and they show he is making no progress. Mr Barker isn’t fooling anyone.

“Many thousands of victims of crime who are owed reparation are facing another Christmas waiting to be paid because of Labour’s softly-softly approach,” says Mr Power
