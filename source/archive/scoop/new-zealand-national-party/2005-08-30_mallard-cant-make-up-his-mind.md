Mallard can’t make up his mind

Hon Bill English  
National Party Education Spokesman

Mallard can’t make up his mind

National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Education Minister Trevor Mallard’s statements on bulk funding exceed even his worst standards of dishonesty and scaremongering.

“Last week, Labour claimed National would cut spending on education. This week, Mallard is claiming we will spend too much. Which is it, Trevor?

“National plans to spend more than $350 million extra on schools next year.

“We have told schools there will be no losers in a move to bulk funding. Trevor Mallard has just made up his numbers.

“National will be redirecting funds from a bureaucracy that has exploded under Labour to schools where professional principals and teachers can make better decisions about how to use the funds to improve learning for individual students,” says Mr English.
