Stephen Jack Selected As National’s Candidate In Taieri
=======================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Balclutha-based farmer Stephen Jack has been selected by local party members as National’s candidate in Taieri for the 2023 General Election.

“Taieri is my home and I’m incredibly excited to have the opportunity to campaign for a National Government that will deliver for Taieri and New Zealand,” says Mr Jack.

“This electorate is full of hardworking Kiwis, doing their best to get ahead and provide for their families but under Labour’s cost-of-living crisis, that’s getting harder to do. Labour is spending $1 billion more every week than in 2017 and people in Taieri have nothing to show for it but higher costs.

“Interest rates are being hiked in an attempt to put the lid on Labour’s runaway inflation and families in Taieri are dealing with the consequences by being forced to find hundreds of dollars more every week to cover the mortgage.

“National is the only party with a plan to strengthen our economy and reduce the cost of living, and the only party with the ability to deliver. To start with, we’ll stop Labour’s wasteful spending, and we’ll stop saddling businesses, including our farmers, with more red tape and higher costs at a time we need to back them to drive our economic growth.

“As a farmer myself, I understand that communities across Taieri rely on the contribution our farmers make and National understands this contribution stretches to our entire economy. If I earn the right to represent Taieri as part of Chris Luxon’s National team, I’ll advocate for farmers to be able to get on with doing what they do best – leading the world in innovative farming practices that help take our country forward, without overbearing regulations and red tape.

“Our rural communities, like Balclutha, Milton, Mosgiel, Lawrence and Middlemarch understand this contribution. We must support our exporters and rebuilt their confidence to a level where they can take on the world.

“Investing in our young people here in Taieri will be another priority for National and me, and I can’t wait to campaign on our plans to back kids to succeed. This includes our FamilyBoost policy, which will provide up to $75 per week in tax rebates to help families cover the cost of childcare and our Teaching the Basics Brilliantly policy, which will require all primary and intermediate schools to spend an average of an hour each day on reading, an hour a day on writing, and an hour a day on maths.

“I have a history of getting difficult jobs done and delivering for people, it’s what farmers do. We can only deliver these strong plans under a National Government and that’s what I’ll be campaigning relentlessly for here in Taieri.”
