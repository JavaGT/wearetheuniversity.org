Health officials selected Police Commissioner

National's Law & Order spokesman, Simon Power, says he would like to know why there was no one with police experience on the interview panel to select the new Police Commissioner.

He is releasing an answer to a parliamentary question that shows that besides State Services Commissioner Mark Prebble, the interviewing panel consisted of three people with extensive experience in health but no one with any remote connection to the police.

The selection panel consisted of:

\* Mark Prebble, State Services Commissioner and former head of Helen Clark's Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. \* Stan Rodger, chair of the Health Workforce Advisory Committee, and former Labour Cabinet Minister. \* Lynette Stewart, chair of Northland DHB. \* Syd Bradley, chair of Canterbury DHB and former deputy chair of NZ Post.

"I would like Police Minister Annette King to explain how this has come about," says Mr Power.

"You are selecting a new police commissioner, after quite obvious issues surrounding the previous two, and instead of getting a retired top officer or even a Police Commissioner from Australia you ask three health officials to do the job.

"I am astounded, and I am sure frontline police will be also scratching their heads as to how our Police Commissioner could come to be selected without any police input whatsoever on the selection panel.

"I wonder if we would be happy with police officers choosing the chief executive of a DHB?"
