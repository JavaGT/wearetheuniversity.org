Youth Guarantee delivers for Auckland students

More than 800 places have been created at local tertiary and training institutes to help 16-and 17-year-olds stay engaged in learning, says Sam Lotu-Iiga.

A total of 2000 places have been created across the country for youth at private training establishments, institutes of technology and polytechnics as part of our jump-start to the Youth Guarantee programme.

“The Academy Group, Apostolic Training Centre, Best Pacific Institute of Education, Manukau Institute of Technology, NZ Institute of Sport, NZ Management Academies, The Cut Above Academy and Unitec New Zealand will provide young people with the opportunity to take part, free of charge, in courses like in tourism and travel, agriculture, building, plumbing, hospitality and catering next year,” says Sam Lotu-Iiga.

“Our Youth Guarantee scheme gives students who are more motivated in non-school settings an opportunity to re-engage with learning, and gain skills for future employment.

“The National-led Government is putting $52.7 million of funding into the programme over the next two years.

“We’re delivering on our promise to give young people the opportunities they need to succeed. It’s important that Auckland youth are given every chance to succeed.”
