Nat MP supports action on teen pregnancy

National MP Paula Bennett has thrown her support behind the Family Planning Association as it lobbies the Government for a teen pregnancy strategy.

Ms Bennett, a former teen mother herself, says it's tough enough being a teenager without throwing a baby into the mix.

\"Our young people should be thinking about OEs and career paths, not nappies and teething problems."

Ms Bennett has been travelling throughout the country talking to students and young people about making positive choices and taking responsibility for their actions.

"I say to young people, set yourself some goals, live a little - there is plenty of time for raising a family.

"I applaud the work that Family Planning is doing in this area. It's time the Government showed that it takes this issue seriously by putting the necessary resources in place and sending a strong message to our teenagers that teen parenthood is not a good option," says Ms Bennett.
