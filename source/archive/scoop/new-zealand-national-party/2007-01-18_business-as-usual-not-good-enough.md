Business as usual not good enough

Business as usual not good enough

NZQA needs to offer a better explanation to the students of Logan Park High School who are still waiting on results from NCEA exams, says National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

Logan Park Principal Jane Johnson says one third of the school's NCEA papers had recorded 'result not available' when students checked on the Internet yesterday afternoon.

"Today, NZQA tells us the results process is progressing 'business as usual' and less than 1% of the 1.9 million results have been recorded as 'result not available'.

"Either Logan Park is incredibly unlucky to, according to reports, have one third of exam papers in that 1% or NZQA is trying to minimise this problem.

"It is hard to reconcile Logan Park's experience with the impression created by NZQA yesterday that marking had gone smoothly and students could expect 'robust and reliable' results.

"This problem has created unnecessary stress for teachers, students and parents who are still waiting on results."
