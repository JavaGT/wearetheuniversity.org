Minister Sending Patients To Prison Barbaric
============================================

Canterbury District Health Board's plans to move high-risk patients from Hillmorton Hospital to prison is barbaric and requires Ministerial intervention, National MP Murray McCully said today.

"If the current crisis in Canterbury isn't enough to get the Minister involved then what would it take?

"The threat to the safety of the public and patients is so high no self-respecting Health Minister can just continue to stand by and watch as patients are dispersed around the country's prisons. This is the Minister who said the buck would stop with her, but she has simply been wallpaper at the mediation in Christchurch.

"Families of patients are telling us they are being kept in the dark on where patients will go. The National Mental Health Sector Standards require patients being discharged from the health service to be assessed. In light of the risks raised by clinical directors I seek a reassurance from the Minister that these standards will be followed," Mr McCully said.
