Maharey reheats another announcement

Maharey reheats another announcement

Education Minister Steve Maharey should stick to the facts and quit reheating old funding announcements in a vain attempt to get positive media coverage, says National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.

Labour today re-launched a $7.59 million careers education programme already announced in last year’s Budget.

“Steve Maharey has been caught red-handed rehashing an announcement and worse, changing the facts to suit.

“His photo opportunity today is about as honest as reheating last night’s dinner and calling it a banquet.

“This is the same initiative he announced in last year’s budget but this time around he has changed the name from 'Quality Careers Advice for Students' to ‘CPaBL: Creating Pathways and Building Lives’.

“Steve Maharey tried the same reheat and rehash trick with a $32 million schools funding announcement on February 2.

“He is arrogant enough to think the education sector won’t notice his publicity stunts.

“What’s more, he has misled New Zealanders by saying today’s initiative is getting $7.59 million over two years - budget documents clearly say the money is over three years.

“As for CPaBL, who thinks of these bizarre names?

“The original name 'Quality Careers Advice for Students' at least gave an indication of what the initiative tried to achieve.

“The name ‘CPaBL’ will make most educators sigh and roll their eyes. It is unintelligable, meaningless and just plain silly. “
