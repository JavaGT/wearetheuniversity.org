Govt In The Dark - Again - On ERB
=================================

Another Government Minister has revealed he's in the dark over the impact of the Employment Relations Bill, Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.

"The Minister of State Services showed in Parliament he doesn't know that thousands of public servants and teachers could have their existing right to be part of a collective agreement without being a union member ripped away from them.

"The PSA has always been a purely voluntary union. So has the NZEI for the last 140 years. Yet on August 1 public servants will lose the rights they currently have.

"This Government simply has no understanding of the practical implications of the Employment Relations Bill.

"Trevor Mallard joins his colleague Labour Minister Margaret Wilson in failing to realise how far reaching the Bill is.

"Instead of giving public servants and teachers a choice this Government is forcing them all to become members of a union, if they want to experience their present right to be part of a collective contract."
