Te Kotahitanga results encouraging

The report released today into the Te Kotahitanga programme shows encouraging signs that the Government is working to address the gap in achievement for Maori students, says National's Maori Affairs spokesman, Tau Henare.

The report shows students in the Te Kotahitanga programme had improved literacy and numeracy rates and improved teacher relationships.

"This is a good programme and it is focused on raising teacher expectations of Maori achievement.

"Anything that can help teachers and students overcome the barriers to learning and build self-belief for young Maori is a good thing.

"This is a programme that creates an atmosphere of goal setting, expectation and a positive teacher-student relationship.

"It's not about philosophies any more, it's actually about getting results, and this looks as though it's getting results and that's something we should support.

"Looking forward, there is no reason why all students couldn't benefit from a programme that encourages teachers to lift their game, and raises teacher expectations of their students."
