Hodgson hypocritical on obesity

Pete Hodgson has been shown up as having double standards in the obesity campaign, says National's Associate Health spokeswoman Dr Jackie Blue.

She is commenting following the announcement of Mission-On, a healthy lifestyles package that will effectively ban from schools foods and drinks high in sugar, fat and salt.

"The irony is that our hospitals are littered with vending machines selling exactly these sorts of drinks and foods.”

Dr Blue recently surveyed the 21 DHBs about their vending machines.

"To date, two-thirds of the DHBs have replied. They all have snack and/or drink vending machines on their sites.

“Auckland DHB has a whopping 50 snack and drink vending machines, and makes $144,000 profit each year from them. Counties Manukau DHB has 36 machines, and Waikato has 32.

“Waitemata DHB has 25 vending machines but has removed all unhealthy drink options. The contractor who provides the machines gives half the profits to a trust.

“Other DHBs have a varying number of vending machines but receive little or no profit.

“As well as being a hypocrite, Pete Hodgson is missing the point – any initiative will only be successful if there is support and buy-in from the community and, more importantly, from families,” says Dr Blue.
