**Partnership schools one step closer**

Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, MP for Maungakiekie, welcomes the passing of the second reading of the Education Amendment Bill, which will establish the new framework for partnership schools or kura hourua.

“Our country has a world class education system and delivers well for a majority of students, but we can do better for some of our more vulnerable learners.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Partnership Schools is about offering another option to those parents of students that continue to be disengaged with our education system and do not achieve to the best of their potential.”

“This is particularly important for our Māori and Pacific youth and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, who despite recent positive gains over the last few years in achievement, continue to struggle in our schools.”

“We want all students to be able to contribute and participate in the 21st century economy and for some learners that means doing things a little differently.”

The flexibility in the bill will allow the schools to use new and diverse approaches to teaching and learning, and property and school organisation.

“They can focus on specialist areas of learning such as art, music or sport and they can answer the particular needs of their communities, such as faith based schooling or holistic development.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

This flexibility in curriculum is offered as long as it can be mapped against the New Zealand Curriculum and its principles and qualifications framework.

They must also employ teachers who are trained and qualified in their fields, but they may in certain circumstances, be teachers who are not registered with the teachers council.

“I was pleased to hear that 35 applications have already been received from potential sponsors for Partnership Schools. This is a great indication of the interest from our education, community and business sectors and further emphasises the appetite for this kind of approach to education in New Zealand.” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

**Partnership schools**

• The Bill creates the legal framework for a third type of school within the schooling network: partnership schools/kura hourua. The other two types of schools are State schools (including State integrated schools) and private schools.

• Partnership schools/kura hourua are one of a number of new initiatives targeted towards addressing educational underachievement. The Bill provides parents and students with another option to choose from, when considering the type of education that works for them.

• Under the Bill, partnership schools/kura hourua will have more flexibility to make decisions about how they operate and use funding to deliver specific school level targets.

• Partnership schools/kura hourua will have a sponsor that the Minister of Education will approve to operate the school. The sponsor will sign a contract with the Crown that sets out the responsibilities and obligations of both parties.
