Maharey plays on as ship goes down

National's Education spokesman, Bill English, says Steve Maharey should face the music and realise that his tertiary strategy has been a $1.54 billion failure.

\"The Government's 'Retention, Completion and Progression in Tertiary Education' report tells a sorry story about the state of certificate and diploma courses."

The report finds that of the students commencing study in 2000, after three years: o 70% of students studying towards a diploma had not completed study. o 72% of students studying towards a certificate had not completed study.

Over the past four years the Government has spent over $2.2 billion on these courses.

Mr English says the 70% non-completion rate effectively means $1.54 billion has been wasted.

"The Minister's attempts to rebut fundamental facts show that once again he is unwilling to clean up his own mess.

"Schools are crying out for more money at a time when the Minister is wasting hundreds of millions of dollars," says Mr English.
