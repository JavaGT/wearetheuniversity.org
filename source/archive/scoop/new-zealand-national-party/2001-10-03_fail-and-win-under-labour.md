Fail and win under Labour

Government plans to reward student failure through higher levels of tuition subsidy have been criticised by National's Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson today.

In a leaked recommendation from the fourth TEAC report, the Commission recommend that '...certain categories of learners should receive a higher level of government subsidy, including those who had not previously achieved in school or 'basic education' '.\*

"In other words, this Government is planning to reward students who fail at school. There is no incentive for students to study hard and get good grades.

"Is this what Mr Maharey meant when he promised to reduce tertiary fees for students? Bright students may as well not bother.

"When questioned about the recommendation, Steve Maharey's response was that he doesn't comment on drafts. But this recommendation is taken directly from a late draft when the TEAC report was close to being finalised.

"Mr Maharey spent nine years in opposition, one would have thought he would have his thinking sorted in that time. He's now been in office for 21 months and the sector is still none the wiser about the shape of the tertiary education system.

"People thought the Government dithered over Air NZ but Mr Maharey has set a new record in dithering with his plans for tertiary education," Mr Williamson said.
