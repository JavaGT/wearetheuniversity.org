Business initiatives re-wrap National's package

Since it has broken its own promises to business, the Budget's business initiative will be a creative repackaging of part of National's Bright Future package, National's Bill English and Max Bradford said today.

"Labour has dumped its own ideas to help business and to expand the knowledge economy.

"Business expected tax breaks for research and development and the export guarantee scheme in the Budget. But they're not getting them.

"They've had to contend with higher taxes, new fringe benefit taxes, the ACC and Employment Relations Bill and plummeting business confidence.

"The Government faces a test of credibility towards business and the knowledge economy. So far the so-called bridge to business is built on broken promises.

"Initiatives for business in the Budget should be measured against the National Government's commitment in the Bright Future package which helped business be innovative and expanded the skills of New Zealanders.

"National committed more than $220million over four years - including $47 million new funding for new programmes that drew on extensive consultation with individuals and businesses.

"This Budget must deliver an integrated package for business that builds on the Bright Future ideas and investment, and not just fork out cash to pressure groups."
