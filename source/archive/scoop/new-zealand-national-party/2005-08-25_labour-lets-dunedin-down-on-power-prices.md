Labour lets Dunedin down on power prices

National Party Leader Don Brash says Labour's rush to impose a new carbon charge on householders will hit places like Dunedin particularly hard.

He made the comments during a visit to Dunedin today.

"In the past three years, the average annual power bill paid by Dunedin residents has climbed by more than $300.

"Before he revealed his billion-dollar Kyoto miscalculation, Pete Hodgson optimistically said the carbon charge would cost each household about $4 per week.

"Those on fixed incomes, including students and superannuitants, will face this new cost. Under National they won't.

"Of course the carbon charge will also force fuel prices higher, which will hit businesses particularly hard.

"And when transport costs keep going up as they have, the prices paid by consumers will inevitably rise.

"For Dunedin, this means people, it means profits and it means wages and salaries.

"And for householders it also means paying more for their own power and petrol.

"The voters of Dunedin must hold Pete Hodgson to account. He was warned that Labour's rush to ratify Kyoto would end up costing New Zealanders their jobs, and would put us at a competitive disadvantage with many of our trading partners.

"And it could get even worse. Labour's preferred coalition partner wants to add more tax to diesel and it wants to increase the carbon charge.

"Householders concerned about rising power prices have only one choice this election. Give your vote to National and stop the carbon tax," says Dr Brash.
