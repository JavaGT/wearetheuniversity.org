Bishop backs fairer fares for tertiary students

National List MP based in Hutt South Chris Bishop has launched a petition calling on Greater Wellington Regional Council to support fairer fares for tertiary students.

“I’m backing the campaign for fairer fares because it will really help Hutt Valley tertiary students,” says Mr Bishop.

“Last month I presented the case for fairer fares to the Greater Wellington Regional Council along with a group of Victoria University students.

“As I told the councillors, a student travelling from Wainuiomata to the Kelburn campus can pay nearly $20 per day in public transport costs, and that’s after Snapper card discounts.

“The cost of travel is a big barrier between students and further education. We can do better,” says Mr Bishop.

At present Wellington is an outlier within New Zealand and internationally, with most comparable cities providing very cheap or heavily discounted public transport fares to tertiary students. Tertiary discounts in Auckland are around 38-40%, Dunedin’s discount is 25%, and Christchurch has a very low flat fare structure that makes it affordable for students.

“This is the right thing to do for our students, who, after all, contribute around $2bn to the regional economy,” says Mr Bishop.

People backing the campaign can sign up at www.fairerfares.co.nz. It will be passed on to the Greater Wellington Regional Council which is currently consulting on its annual plan and considering the issue of tertiary student fares.
