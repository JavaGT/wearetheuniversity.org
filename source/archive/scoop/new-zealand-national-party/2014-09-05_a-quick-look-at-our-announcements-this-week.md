A quick look at our announcements this week
===========================================

**Friday, 5 September 2014, 3:37 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

A quick look at our announcements this week

  
Only National is focused on the issues that matter this election.

Our clear plan for a stronger economy means we can support a cleaner environment, continue our commitment to rebuilding Canterbury, and invest more in major infrastructure for regional New Zealand while still balancing the budget and paying down debt.

**If you haven’t seen them yet, here’s just some of the policies we announced this week:**

• **Working hard to rebuild Canterbury** – We have announced new arrangements to maintain the earthquake rebuild’s momentum by making CERA a departmental agency within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and reviewing the special earthquake powers.  
•  
• **Improving water quality** – Investing $100 million over 10 years to buy and retire selected areas of farmland next to important waterways, while introducing a mandatory requirement to exclude dairy cattle from waterways by July 2017.  
•  
• **Ultra-Fast Broadband to 80% of New Zealanders** – Meaning a further 200,000 New Zealanders will have access to fast, more reliable broadband.  
•  
• **Support children with special needs** – Providing up to 800,000 more teacher aide hours.  
•  
This election is a clear choice between keeping our economy moving in the right direction with stable leadership, or a recipe of five new taxes and big increases in spending with a disorganised Labour-Greens-Dotcom coalition that would stall our economy.

Only a **party vote for National** can provide strong, stable government and keep New Zealand moving in the right direction.
