1000 Jobs And $100million Parental Leave Price Tag - Advisors Tell Govt

The Government must come clean on its plan for paid parental leave in the wake of official advice revealing massive job losses and huge costs if it goes ahead, Opposition Employment spokesperson Bob Simcock said today.

"Papers obtained under the Official Information Act reveal the Department of Labour has told the Government almost one thousand New Zealanders would lose their jobs under paid parental leave proposals.

"Officials have also told Ministers paid parental leave would cost $98 million.

"Laila Harre continues to go around the country publicising her plans for 12 weeks paid parental leave with a levy on payroll. She also says she hopes to have legislation introduced by the end of the year.

"Her plan has a big price tag - tens of millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs. The Government needs to give some certainty about whether we will pay this price for paid parental leave.

"The Department of Labour has also advised Ministers that one minor part of the Employment Relations Bill - employment related education leave - alone would cost $10million and about 70 jobs.

"Employers and small business face huge uncertainty and increased costs from changes this Government is bringing in.

"Labour Minister Margaret Wilson and Associate Minister Laila Harre must immediately give a clear and unequivocal answer on paid parental leave in the wake of advice from officials predicting job losses and increased costs. "
