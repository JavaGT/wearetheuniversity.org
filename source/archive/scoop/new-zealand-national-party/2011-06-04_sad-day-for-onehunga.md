**Sad day for Onehunga**

Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, MP for Maungakiekie is at the scene of the Onehunga explosion that occurred around 8am this morning at the intersection of Victoria St and Mount Smart Road.

Police have confirmed one fatality among the workers and six others have been transported to hospital with a variety of injuries. One of which is critical and one that are serious.

“My thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of the worker who was tragically killed and for all those who are injured” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Emergency services remain at the scene, which has been made as safe as possible and work is already underway to ascertain the cause of the explosion. I am working with these services and receiving regular briefings on the situation

I am coordinating with local churches and volunteers to assist emergency services wherever needed.

“We have set up a base of operations at Grace Baptist Church, 206 Captain Springs Road, for all first respondents, volunteers and anyone else that wishes to help” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I want to commend the Fire Service, Ambulance, Police and Civil Defence personnel for their quick response to the situation” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

Nearby roads have been cordoned off and all local residents have been accounted for.
