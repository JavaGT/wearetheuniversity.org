National Selects Jonathan Fletcher as Rimutaka Candidate

21 February 2011

National Party Rimutaka Electorate Chair Andrew Weaver is pleased to announce Jonathan Fletcher will be the Party's Rimutaka candidate for the general election on November 26.

\"We had very high quality candidates putting their names forward and I am delighted that Jonathan will be our candidate. The calibre of candidates underscores the enthusiasm in the Party as we move into the election year contest. I want to thank everyone who has taken part in the process."

Newly selected Rimutaka candidate Jonathan Fletcher says he is humbled by the selection and looks forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege to represent the people of Rimutaka in John Key's Government.

"For our community this election is about giving Rimutaka a strong voice in Government. The sense I get from our community is that it welcomes the comprehensive plan to grow the economy, to start living within our means, deliver enduring jobs, and build the critical infrastructure to future proof New Zealand and our region. I'm also a strong supporter of the Government's continued focus on law and order - so we can feel safe in our communities and our homes.

"I enter this election contest taking nothing for granted and knowing that I have to earn the respect and trust of an electorate that deserves a strong voice within the National caucus."

Jonathan was raised in Te Atatu, West Auckland and moved with his wife Kylie and their three children to the Wellington region over six years ago. They currently live in Te Marua, Upper Hutt.

Jonathan's career to date has been in many different fields within the finance sector over the last 11 years and has given him experience in both small business and corporate management.

For the last four years Jonathan has been the Business Development Manager for GE Capital in the Wellington region.
