Union power leaves thousands stranded

National's Industrial Relations spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says thousands of travellers are this week paying the price for Labour giving unwarranted power to unions.

Industrial action has resulted in the cancellation of many international Air New Zealand flights, including those to Melbourne, Sydney, Singapore and Osaka.

"Around 15,000 travellers have already had their plans disrupted because of a 0.5% difference in what the union has asked for, and what Air New Zealand has offered," says Dr Mapp.

"The huge wave of industrial action we've seen this year is exactly what National warned would happen as a result of Labour's employment legislation.

"If the unions were serious about boosting wage rates they would have lobbied their mates in the Labour Party to bring down taxes and boost productivity in the work place.

"The cancellation of these flights, coupled with the impact of the Holidays Act, which saw a third of bars and eateries close over the Christmas - New Year period, will leave potential visitors asking themselves if they should be heading elsewhere," says Dr Mapp.
