Vaccination requirement hugely beneficial

Requiring people on the DPB to present their pre-school children for vaccinations unless they have a conscientious objection would be hugely beneficial for many children, says National's Associate Health and Welfare spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.

"The solutions offered by Dr Brash's Orewa speech are of tremendous importance to give children a fair chance," says Dr Hutchison, a former obstetrician.

"Kiwi children are thought to have one of the worst rates of immunization completion in the South Pacific.

"It is a disgrace that even the Minister of Health, Annette King, cannot answer the question of how many Kiwi children are being fully immunized. The same goes for WellChild checks," says Dr Hutchison.

The next National Government will require those receiving the DPB, Unemployment, Sickness and Invalids' Benefits to present their pre-school children for all appropriate vaccinations and health and dental checks and require their school-age children to attend school regularly.

"After five years of Labour doing nothing, they are starting on a long-awaited immunization register, but in the meantime many thousands of children sustain horrific yet preventable diseases."

"It is not the children's fault that they miss out on immunization and health checks," says Dr Hutchison.

"Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that parents on benefits, and all parents, are held responsible."
