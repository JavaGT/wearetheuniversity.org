Govt must tackle overbridge danger

The Government must act now to stop more deaths occurring as a result of objects being thrown off motorway overbridges on State Highway One, says the National MP for Port Waikato, Paul Hutchison.

"On Sunday night, my neighbour was driving along the motorway when his vehicle was struck by a heavy object which shattered the windscreen," says Dr Hutchison.

"The object was so large it could easily have caused his death. He was incredibly lucky to escape uninjured.

"When he phoned the police they said a similar incident had been reported earlier that evening.

"Last year, a man died due to the utter irresponsibility of a child on an overbridge hurling missiles onto the traffic below.

"The Government must act immediately to better protect the public. While they continue to do nothing, people will be put in danger," says Dr Hutchison.
