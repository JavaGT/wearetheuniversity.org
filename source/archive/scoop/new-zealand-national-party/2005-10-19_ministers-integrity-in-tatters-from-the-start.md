John Key MP National Party Finance Spokesman

Finance Minister's integrity in tatters from the start

"Finance Minister Michael Cullen returns to Cabinet with his integrity and his reputation already in tatters," says National Party Finance spokesman John Key.

"It's difficult to take Dr Cullen seriously any more.

"Fresh from a campaign where he tried to claim poverty and misled the public about the true cost of the student loan bribe - Dr Cullen has now completed a total about face on state sector spending.

"For the past few months Dr Cullen has staunchly defended Labour's spending priorities, claiming there was absolutely no waste in the system and no fat to cut.

"Today, as Dr Cullen sought to defend the massive cost of the Coalition deal struck with United Future and New Zealand First, Dr Cullen said the extra spending would be covered through savings in the state sector," says Mr Key.

"So which is correct Dr Cullen? What you said during the election campaign or what you're saying now?"
