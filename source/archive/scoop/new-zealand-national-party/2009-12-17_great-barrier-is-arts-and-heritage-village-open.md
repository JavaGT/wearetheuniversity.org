Great Barrier Island Arts and Heritage Village open for business

Yesterday's opening of the Great Barrier Island Arts and Heritage Village represents a great example of the community working together to make this project a reality.

I am delighted to see yet another example of the cultural richness of the Hauraki Gulf becoming available to both the wider community and visitors to Great Barrier.

In particular the Great Barrier Community Board and Auckland City Council should be acknowledged for delivering this project.

Over the last 5 weeks, many islanders have volunteered and worked hard at lightning speed to get it up and running.

Representatives at the opening included Councillor’s Toni Millar and Denise Roche, the community board, Ngati Rehua and over 100 people from the island.

The village will provide a hub for over 90 artists on the island to boost their income and deliver a much needed community facility.

Over the summer months, thousands of Aucklanders travel to Great Barrier and will be able to enjoy the beautiful artwork produced by local islanders.

I look forward to working closely with the community to continue to enhance the new village.

ENDS
