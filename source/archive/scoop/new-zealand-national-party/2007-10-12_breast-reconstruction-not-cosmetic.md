Breast reconstruction not cosmetic

Breast reconstruction not cosmetic

National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Jackie Blue says Pete Hodgson needs to front up and say why his Government gives breast reconstruction after cancer surgery such a low priority.

“Breast reconstruction is not cosmetic.

“Breast cancer reconstruction following mastectomy is a crucial step in women’s wellbeing and recovery,” says Dr Blue, a former breast physician.

She is commenting on revelations that Wellington woman Shirl Strom was promised on three occasions that she would get reconstruction surgery but she is still waiting.

“I think its appalling that Pete Hodgson can sit idly by and do nothing when women are saying they would have opted for a lumpectomy had they known the promises that were made to them would be broken.

“Most tragically, Shirl is not alone. There are hundreds of women like her.  The classification of breast reconstruction as such a low priority is insulting and patronising.”

Dr Blue says Labour’s unprecedented waiting list culls in 2006 saw tens of thousands of patients removed from elective surgery lists, including many women waiting for breast reconstruction.

“Admittedly, some centres are beginning to offer breast reconstruction but it is slow and patchy.  The fact that the Director General of Health can’t say how many women are waiting for this surgery is an indictment in itself.”

In its recently released health discussion document National canvases a range of areas which would allow for better treatment, sooner.

“Some of the fixes that could be applied in this case are more collaboration between District Health Boards and better utilisation of the spare capacity in the private sector.

“I don’t think Shirl would care if her operation was done in a public hospital or a private hospital, just so long as it gets done.”
