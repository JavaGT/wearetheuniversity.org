Paul Foster-Bell, National Candidate for Wellington Central, welcomes news that 8,217 homes in Wellington have been retrofitted with good quality insulation and clean heating in the year ended June.

“In June this year alone, more than 2,250 homes were retrofitted here in Wellington,” he says.

“At this time of year, especially in our beautiful but often windy Capital, it’s particularly important that our homes are warm, dry, and healthy.

“During these cold months, many of us suffer from colds, flu and asthma that proper insulation and heating can help prevent. Thanks to new under-floor insulation, ceiling insulation, and clean heating such as heat pumps, more than 15,000 Wellington families now have warmer, healthier homes.

“So far more than 114,000 homes around New Zealand are warmer, drier, and healthier thanks to the Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart scheme. That’s more than 300,000 people enjoying better living conditions.

“Many providers registered under the scheme have hired new staff to cope with the demand, while insulation manufacturers have increased production.

“This is a win-win situation for Wellington. If you haven’t yet had your home retrofitted, you can call EECA on 0800 749 782 to find out if you’re eligible.”

Anyone who has a home built before 2000 is eligible for 33 per cent off the cost of installing ceiling and under-floor insulation up to a maximum of $1300. Community Service Card holders can get 60 per cent off the cost of installing insulation.

The National-led Government is spending $347 million over four years to retrofit at least 188,000 homes. Since July 2009, more than 114,000 homes around New Zealand have been retrofitted through the scheme.
