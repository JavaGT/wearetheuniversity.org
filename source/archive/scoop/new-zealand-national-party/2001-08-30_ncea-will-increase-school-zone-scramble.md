NCEA Will Increase School-Zone Scramble
=======================================

National's Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee says the school-zone scramble will only get worse when the National Certificate of Educational Achievement is introduced next year.

Today's Christchurch Press reported a noticeable upsurge in buyers asking for in-zone homes. This mirrors trends in other areas of New Zealand.

"Parents want what's best for their children. The number of parents moving house so their children can be in-zone for the school perceived to be the best in town will only increase once they become wise to the failings of the NCEA.

"A excellent or merit grade in the NCEA will be worth more at one school than another. Universities will know it. Employers will know it. Parents will know and won't want their children to receive substandard qualifications.

"Teachers and Principals have big concerns about the moderation system for the NCEA. Training days are already revealing stark differences between marks given by teachers to the same student's work," Mr Brownlee said.
