Honouring the Fallen

On Wednesday 11 November I attended Armistice Day commemorations at the World War 1 Sanctuary at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. I had the honour of laying a wreath on behalf of the Government and people of New Zealand. Some 350 people attended the service, including the Mayors of Auckland, North Shore, Waitakere and Rodney. The Auckland Girls' Choir performance was especially moving.

Last Sunday I attended the Remembrance Day service at the Cathedral of St Paul in Wellington. On Remembrance Day we honour all those who have died in war.

Traditionally Armistice Day was commemorated on 11 November at 11am, because World War 1 ended when Germany signed the Armistice on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. On Armistice Day we remember those who died in World War 1.

Anzac Day is unique to New Zealand and Australia. Remembrance Day and Armistice Day are commemorated throughout the Commonwealth.

College Prizegivings

Last week I attended prizegiving at Rangitoto College and the senior prizegiving at Takapuna Grammar School.

North Shore students continue to achieve at the top level. Many of the students that received prizes last week will be planning tertiary study. The students of today are the leaders of tomorrow.

The success of our students is a result of the hard work of each individual. Their successes also reflect the efforts of dedicated teachers, boards of trustees and supportive parents.

To all those students who are reaching the end of the school year and approaching the final exams, I wish you the best of luck. The next few weeks will be hard work, but this will be followed by a well-earned rest.

Rutherford Medal

On Wednesday night I presented the Royal Society of New Zealand's prestigious Rutherford Medal to Professor Peter Hunter of Auckland University. The Medal, awarded annually, honours those who have made an exceptional contribution across a lifetime of research to science and technology in New Zealand.

Professor Hunter is head of the Bioengineering Institute at the University of Auckland. He is a world leader in the field of computer modelling of the way the human body works.

This year, following the establishment of the Prime Minister's Science Prizes, the Government has instituted an award of $100,000 in prize money to the Medal recipient. The Government is committed to celebrating the achievements and success of our scientists.

Professor Hunter has a stellar research record. Apart from his own work, through his commitment to supporting young researchers he has made a huge contribution to this country.

Visit to Canada

Starting today I am on an official visit to Canada. I will be making both a formal bilateral Defence visit and a Research, Science and Technology visit. I will also be attending an international security forum in Halifax this weekend. Canada is a good friend on the international scene and I look forward to furthering our relationship in both portfolios.
