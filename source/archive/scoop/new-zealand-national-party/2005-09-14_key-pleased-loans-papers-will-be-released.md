Key pleased loans papers will be released

National Party Finance spokesman John Key says he is looking forward to analysing the student loans papers which Labour was trying to bury until after the election.

The Chief Ombudsman has today issued a ruling, which requires Michael Cullen's office to release the papers 'as soon as possible and no later than 5pm today'.

"The Ombudsman rightly observes that Dr Cullen has a public duty to release the material.

"This is an unusual step by the Ombudsman, but I believe it is clearly in the best interests of New Zealanders to know all the risks relating to Labour's last minute loans policy," says Mr Key.
