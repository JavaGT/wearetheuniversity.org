New funding to speed up development of the Palmerston North Urban Cycleway

National List MP Jono Naylor is delighted locals will enjoy the Palmerston North cycleway sooner than previously planned thanks to $3.2million of funding from the $333 million Urban Cycleway Programme.

“The Palmerston North Urban Cycleway is an important initiative that will improve the health of our community.

“This new funding will accelerate the build, meaning we’ll all be able to take advantage of the cycleway earlier,” said Jono Naylor

The cycleway will connect the Manawatu River with Linton Military Camp, Massey University and the CBD.

“I am delighted to see a project that started in my time as mayor come to fruition.

“This cycleway will complement other transport options we have here and the option to cycle safely will be a drawcard for the area.”

“It’s pleasing to see central and local government working together on our cycleway, with $3million contributed from the Urban Cycleway Fund, $3.2millio from the National Land Transport Fund, and $3.4millio from the Palmerston North City Council.

This cycleway is one of 41 similar projects around the country designed to encourage cycling by making it safer and more attractive.

National’s commitment to providing safe and accessible urban cycleway is changing the face of cycling in New Zealand.
