Students should be heard

Students should be heard

The Government has copped out in their effort to give students a voice in higher learning, says Simon Power, National’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson.

“The Government has placed a student representative on the Tertiary Education Commission as little more than an observer. They will have no voting rights and will simply, in the words of the Minister, “attend the meetings”. They will clearly not have a role as a part of the Commission,” said Mr Power.

“National put forward an amendment which placed a student representative as a full member of the Tertiary Education Commission on October 16. This amendment was supported by a New Zealand University Student Association press release on 17 October.

“Nandor Tanczos should be ashamed he is supporting and claiming credit for this sham representation. This is not student representation.

“Students are arguably the ones with the most interest in tertiary education. It is vitally important they have strong input into what happens in the sector. To this Government they seem to be merely an afterthought,” says Simon Power.
