Women let down by under-resourced DHB

  
Revelations that a 39-year-old Waikato woman with a breast lump was told she could not see a specialist for nine months is more evidence that there is a growing health workforce crisis, say National MPs Tony Ryall and Jackie Blue.

"Waikato breast surgeon Dr Ian Campbell said the DHB was funded to see only 1,000 new breast cancer referrals and that was well off meeting the demand,”says Dr Blue.

"This woman was fortunate that she had the means to be seen privately.

"What do other women do?”

Mr Ryall says there are major pressure points in the health sector but workforce issues are top of the list.

“Without the trained workforce, there won’t be a public health service.

“This is a problem that won’t go away, and this woman’s experience should ring alarm bells with the Minister."
