Collins Comments 10 June 2005

_In the NZ Herald on Friday 3 June 2005 an article headed "Poll finds majority opposed to pylons" contained comments attributed to the National Party._

_Please see below the Letter to the Editor that was sent to the NZ Herald, but which the Herald has chosen not to publish._

_Sir,_

_We wish to make clear our stance on the Waikato-Auckland pylon row._

_We accept that Auckland needs certainty of electricity supply but we are anxious to ensure that all options have been fully explored and that there is transparency in the process._

_For example, it is our understanding that the direct current (DC) option, which can transport power on existing lines or underground, as happens overseas, has not been properly examined._

_The people of Waikato and South Auckland must be given an absolute assurance by the Electricity Commission and Transpower that they are conducting a full cost-benefit analysis of the DC and other options, including local generation in or closer to Auckland._

_They must also ensure there is full consultation throughout, and that, whichever option is finally chosen, there is full and generous compensation for any landowners affected._

_Judith Collins, MP for Clevedon  
Lindsay Tisch, MP for Piako  
Paul Hutchison, MP for Port Waikato_

_I trust this clarifies our stance._

_ENDS_
