**Hutt students awarded Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia**

  
Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, has congratulated two students from the Hutt Valley on being awarded Prime Minister’s Scholarships for Asia which will allow them to undertake further tertiary education study in Asia.

Daniel Baider from Lower Hutt, currently studying at Victoria University of Wellington, has received a scholarship to undertake an exchange programme to Japan.

Michelle McCarthy from Lower Hutt, currently studying at the University of Waikato, has received a scholarship to undertake an Intensive Chinese Language Programme in Taiwan.

140 students from around New Zealand received scholarships in the latest round of funding. The Prime Minister’s Scholarships were established in Budget 2013 as part of the Government’s Internationally Focused Growth Package.

“As a small, isolated nation reliant on international trade for our prosperity, we need to be as connected as possible to the rest of the world”, says Mr Bishop.

“The Prime Minister’s Scholarships programme helps create vital people to people linkages that will create enduring value for the students and for New Zealand. Students will learn more about languages, cultures and societies important to New Zealand’s future, and students in the host countries will learn about New Zealand as well.

“In a rapidly globalising world, our next generation of students need to be able to work in different cultural environments and communicate in different languages – particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.

“New Zealand students studying offshore are our entrepreneurs, diplomats, businesspeople, traders, philanthropists, and leaders of tomorrow,” says Mr Bishop.

Applications are now open for the next round of scholarships and close on 30 September 2015. Applications can be made by individuals or groups to Education New Zealand.
