**Redcliffs School announcement good news for community**

Nuk Korako, National List MP based in the Port Hills, welcomes Hon Hekia Parata’s announcement that she is not confirming her interim decision that Redcliffs School should close.

Discussion has been initiated on relocating the school to an alternative site in Redcliffs. While that discussion is taking place further specialist advice will be sought about the possibility of negative psychosocial effects for children attending school on the original Main Road site.

“This is great news for a community which feels very strongly about its school and is a tribute to the hard work of the board. I have worked closely behind the scenes throughout the entire process to ensure the views of the community were heard by the Minister and I am delighted they have been,” says Mr Korako.

“The announcement today reflects this engagement. It acknowledges the importance of Redcliffs School to the community and the importance of safeguarding the well-being of our children and their education both now and in the future.”

“I will be available in Redcliffs on Saturday afternoon for those wishing to discuss today’s announcement further with me. I look forward to continuing my engagement with the Redcliffs community in the lead-up to a final decision.”

A decision on whether the school can return to its site, or whether relocation is feasible, is expected by mid-October. In the meantime Redcliffs students will continue to share the site of the Van Asch Deaf Education Centre in Sumner as they have done since 2011.
