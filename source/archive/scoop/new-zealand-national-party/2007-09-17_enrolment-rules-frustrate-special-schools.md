Enrolment rules frustrate special schools

Enrolment rules frustrate special schools

Barring special schools from entering their own school enrolment information discriminates against them and leads to frustrating delays and entry errors, says National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

All schools, except special schools, are allowed to enter students' details in the new online enrolment data system ENROL, which is being rolled out around the country.

"If the slight wasn't annoying enough, the first special schools knew that they didn't have the same access was during training for the system.

"The Ministry's reasons for withholding access don't stack up and no one in the sector agrees.

"Requiring schools to send all their information to Wellington to be entered on computer has already caused frustrating delays and entry errors.

"I can understand why schools get annoyed to find that names have been misspelled, entered twice, or worse, not at all. The Ministry typist just doesn't know the students as well as the school.

"Special schools should have the same right as any other school to enter and control their own information.

The Ministry should stop citing Section 9 and just unlock the schools' access to allow them to enter the data for their own students."
