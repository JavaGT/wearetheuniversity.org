Taxpayer forks out for Minister’s shenanigans

Taxpayer forks out for Minister’s shenanigans

Chris Carter owes New Zealand taxpayers an apology for his illegal shenanigans over the Whangamata Marina that have already cost them $98,000, says National Party Environment spokesman Nick Smith.

“These legal costs would never have come about if Mr Carter had not played politics over this resource consent and overruled the Environment Court.

“The $98,000 relates just to the legal costs of the Minister.

“The Whangamata Marina Society is claiming costs from the Minister for a further $250,000 which the taxpayer is also likely to have to pay.

“This appalling abuse of ministerial power has resulted in a huge waste of public money, which could have bought nine hip operations or helped 30 special needs students.

“Mr Carter should do the honorable thing and apologise for wasting public money,” says Dr Smith.
