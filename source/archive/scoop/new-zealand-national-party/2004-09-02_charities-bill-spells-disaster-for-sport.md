Charities Bill spells disaster for sport

Charities Bill spells disaster for sport

The draconian Charities Bill spells disaster for sport, says National MP Lindsay Tisch.

Sporting groups have become dependent on grants from charitable trusts, but it is evident that funding will be cut, because amateur sport is not included in the Charities Bill's definition of 'charitable purposes'.

Mr Tisch says it is outrageous that the Charities Bill will affect children playing Saturday morning sport.

\"Charity begins at home, but the Government's narrow focus on charity shows that they don't care about families or children."

"Thousands of organisations will miss out on funding. Many will be unable to pay the hefty registration and meet the compliance requirements of the Charities Commission.

Mr Tisch says National supports sporting organisations and the valuable work they do. They should not be subjected to excessive fees or excluded from access to gaming funds.
