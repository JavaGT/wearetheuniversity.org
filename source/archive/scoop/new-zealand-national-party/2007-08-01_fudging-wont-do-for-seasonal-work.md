Fudging won't do for seasonal work

Fudging won't do for seasonal work

"The Government should simply continue the Seasonal Work Permit beyond 30 September this year instead of trying to haphazardly plug the gaps in its flagship Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme," says National's Immigration Spokesman Lockwood Smith.

He said the Seasonal Work Permit scheme was a proven policy that enabled a range of people to assist with the peak demand for many thousands of workers needed by our horticultural industry at certain times of the year.

"National has been calling for an extension to the Seasonal Work Permit scheme which the Government has said it will abolish from 30 September. Today, Horticulture New Zealand also called on the Government to extend the Seasonal Work Permit. Labour should listen. "David Cunliffe's comments today show he now sees his Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme is not going to meet the requirements for seasonal workers this year. That's a step forward.

"But instead of providing certainty by extending the proven Seasonal Work Permit scheme, the Minister has added to confusion.

"The seasonal work requirements of our horticultural industry are too important for the Government to fudge. I repeat my call for the Minister to extend the Seasonal Work Permit."

Dr Smith said the Minister's announcement that the 'Department of Labour and Ministry of Social Development officials are developing options for assisting employers to make the move to RSE', shows that Labour has still not learnt that "Government knows best" policies don't work.

"It's time for Labour to listen to the horticulture industry that is just so important to New Zealand, rather than having Government officials impose more half baked schemes on them," says Dr Smith.
