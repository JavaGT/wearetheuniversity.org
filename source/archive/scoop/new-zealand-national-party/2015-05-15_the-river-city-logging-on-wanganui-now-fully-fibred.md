The River City logging on – Wanganui now fully-fibred

  
The local build of the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband network is now complete in Wanganui. Local MP Hon Chester Borrows was with Communications Minister Hon Amy Adams for the announcement at the Beyond Broadband Expo.

“Wanganui is now fully-fibred. Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) is now available to over 17,000 homes, schools, businesses and health facilities here in our city,” Mr Borrows said.

“The local council’s been very supportive in promoting the installation and uptake of the network here in Wanganui, and I’d like to thank them for that.”  
“UFB will help promote innovation, create jobs, and grow our local economy – who wouldn’t want that?

“Before National was re-elected, we told the country we were going to build a world-class broadband network. Wanganui’s is now up and running, and I’m look forward to seeing the benefits this quick, reliable internet brings to our communities,” Mr Borrows said.

The Wanganui network build, completed by local network company Ultra-Fast Fibre, is the result of a $23 million investment by the Government, in partnership with Waikato Networks Limited.

For the past three years, Wanganui’s been named as one of the world’s “Smart 21” cities by the Intelligent Communities Forum – a global organisation which recognises potential for communities to prosper in the broadband economy.
