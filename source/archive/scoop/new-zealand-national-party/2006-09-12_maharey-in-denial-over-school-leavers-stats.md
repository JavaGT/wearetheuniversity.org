Maharey in denial over school leavers' stats

Education Minister Steve Maharey is in denial of the facts surrounding NCEA failure rates as presented by his own ministry, says National's Education spokesman, Bill English.

"Mr Maharey's claim that just 13% of students leave school without a qualification is nonsense. "All the facts I have used to dispute his claim come straight from the Ministry of Education's own website.

"The facts are clear:

o 27% of students leaving school in 2005 had not achieved NCEA level 1

o This is up from 20% in 2004.

o 44% of students leaving low-decile (1-3) schools do not have NCEA level 1

o 16% of students leaving high-decile (8-10) schools do not have NCEA level 1 "Mr Maharey has walked away from thousands of young people who were promised a better future under NCEA but have now ended up failing," says Mr English.
