Govt must act following another death on SH2
============================================

Paul Hutchison - National Party MP for Port Waikato

15 February 2005

Govt must act following another death on SH2

Today's tragic news of yet another death on State Highway 2 is further evidence that Labour must commit to completing a four-lane expressway between Pokeno and Mangatarata, says Port Waikato MP Paul Hutchison.

"This killer road has a 40% higher fatality rate than any other rural state highway," says Dr Hutchison.

"On public holidays and weekends more than 30,000 cars use the road each day, as many as State Highway 1, yet Labour's only commitment so far has been to put in a two-lane deviation at Maramarua, which is just a small part of what is actually needed.

"I challenge Labour to revise its dangerous patch-up plans for this highway, and instead commit to the responsible completion of a four-lane expressway, otherwise we will continue to witness preventable deaths."
