Schools in Maungakiekie Future-Proofed with Faster Broadband

**Schools in Maungakiekie Future-Proofed with Faster Broadband**

**Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga**

**MP for Maungakiekie**

Just in time for Term One, Maungakiekie’s schools are all able to connect to faster; more reliable broadband says local MP, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

“In 2010, the Government set a target of getting all state and integrated schools access to better broadband speeds by 2016. We’ve done this, on time and on budget,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.

“Students, teachers, and parents in Maungakiekie will all benefit from this. It makes for reduced course material costs, better access to remote learning, and more collaboration between parents and teachers.

16 schools can now connect.”

Under the Government’s Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) and Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI) programmes, more than 2500 schools have had fibre laid to the gates, reaching around 782,000 students.

Now, 99.7 per cent of Kiwi students at state and integrated schools are now able to connect to UFB directly, with the remainder still able to access fast broadband via point-to-point wireless or satellite technology.

“I’m pleased our 16 schools will be among the most connected in the world, and will compete with students across New Zealand and the globe,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.
