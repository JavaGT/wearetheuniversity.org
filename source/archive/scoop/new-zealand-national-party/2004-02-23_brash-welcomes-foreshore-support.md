Brash welcomes foreshore support

National Party leader Don Brash has welcomed the results of a study by Massey University showing that more than half of Maori support Crown ownership of the beaches, foreshore and seabed.

The poll of 1000 people by Massey University found that 57% of Maori, and 88% of non-Maori said they wanted the Crown to retain title to the foreshore and seabed, protecting access rights for all New Zealanders.

"New Zealanders do not want separate titles and development rights for our beaches according to race, as Labour wants," said Dr Brash.

The survey also found that amongst Maori 78% agree the same laws should apply to all New Zealanders, and 61% support a firm time limit for resolving land claims.

"This is consistent with all the feedback I've had since my speech in Orewa. The fact that over half of Maori surveyed support National's position on the foreshore and seabed is yet another wakeup call for the Government.

"This poll shows the Government has been listening to extremist groups rather than mainstream Maori. They have been captured by a radical fringe, rather than acting in the interests of all New Zealanders.

"It is another illustration of how completely out of touch Labour is with ordinary New Zealanders, both Maori and non-Maori," said Dr Brash.
