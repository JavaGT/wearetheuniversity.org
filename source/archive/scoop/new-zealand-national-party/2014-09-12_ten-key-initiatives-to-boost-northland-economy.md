Ten key initiatives to boost Northland economy  

A re-elected National Government will promote ten key initiatives to unlock the Northland economy and lift it further up the regional growth ranks, National Party Economic Development Spokesman Steven Joyce says.

Steven Joyce, Northland MP Mike Sabin and Whangarei candidate Shane Reti today released the list of ten initiatives at an Economic Development Forum in Whangarei.

“These ten initiatives are all about doing the things that will most lift Northland's growth rate and provide opportunities for our young people to work in Northland,” Mr Joyce says.

“They cover infrastructure, skills, investment, innovation, and getting the best out of Northland's abundant natural resources.”

The top ten initiatives are:

1\. Commencing construction on the Puhoi to Wellsford Road of National Significance in 2016/17.  
2\. Further rollout of Ultra-fast Broadband and the Rural Broadband Initiative and addressing mobile coverage black spots across Northland.  
3\. Further lifting skills training with the Māori & Pasifika Trades Training Initiative across Northland.  
4\. Encouraging minerals exploration and oil and gas exploration across Northland.  
5\. Working with Ngapuhi to negotiate a Treaty settlement to provide an economic base for the largest iwi in the country.  
6\. Lifting productivity in the primary sector across Northland through the Primary Industries Initiative and the Māori Agribusiness Programme.  
7\. Continuing to advance the plan to create New Zealand's most northern National Park in the Waipoua Forest, and supporting initiatives to boost Northland’s tourism industry.  
8\. Reform Te Ture Whenua Māori Act to boost productivity and job creation from Māori land across Northland.  
9\. Complete the $8.56 million Primary Growth Partnership with the avocado industry to quadruple returns from the sector.  
10\. Completing and adopting the Northland Regional Growth Study to encourage more investment and job growth in the region.

“Northland has been chalking up a number of wins under this National-led Government.” Mr Sabin says.

“Whangarei is now New Zealand's first fully fibred city, Marsden Point has had the confidence to make a $365 million investment in modernising their plant, Northland College has revitalised its farm training with Lincoln University, and the Twin Coast Cycle Trail has been established. The challenge now is for all of us in the region to work together and make the most of these next opportunities.

“The most recent ANZ Regional Trends Report shows Northland is the fastest growing region in the country, with six successive quarters of growth, and year on year growth of 7.4 per cent,” Mr Sabin says. “But there is so much more potential to be realised."

“National remains absolutely committed to working hard and achieving the goal of lifting Northland's long-term growth rate,” Mr Joyce says.

“These ten key initiatives, alongside the rest of our Business Growth Agenda, will help provide Northland firms with the confidence to invest and grow jobs for Northlanders.”
