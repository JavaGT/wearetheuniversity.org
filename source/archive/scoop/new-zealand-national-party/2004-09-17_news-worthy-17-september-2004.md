17 September 2004 No. 12

Political correctness Every Government has its brand. This Government will be remembered for its political correctness. The illustrations are legend. Here are three (and I plan to provide more in subsequent issues:

\* November 2003 - the Government passes a law requiring mandatory micro-chipping of all dogs in New Zealand by 2015 - the flow-on costs to local councils, who are charged with maintaining the scheme, are enormous.

\* August 2001 - It is revealed that all Cabinet papers going before the Cabinet's Social Equity Committee are being vetted by the Ministry of Women's Affairs to ensure they are "not gender harmful".

\* July 2002 - About 50 endangered Archeys frogs are flown from Te Kuiti to Christchurch accompanied by three Waikato Kaumatua. They were given a powhiri upon their arrival at Canterbury University. The Department of Conservation spent $2355 flying the three Maori elders to Christchurch with the frogs. A long -suffering public is moving to a point where "enough is enough". Civil Union Bill This highly controversial legislation and its linked Relationships (Statutory References) Bill is currently before the Justice & Electoral Select Committee. There are 3,263 submissions and another 3,000 form submissions. There points are crystal clear.

\* The Bill is Labour Party manifesto policy

  
„h For heterosexual couples there is no significant difference between civil union and marriage. That is because the solemnisation of a marriage under the Marriage Act need not have any religious element. So the true purpose of the Bill has been masked - it is intended that the State sanction and endorse so-called same-sex marriages.

\* As the NZ Law Society has pointed out, the implications for de-facto relationships are very far reaching. If the Bill is passed, people in such relationships will be treated as if they were in marriage, yet that is often the very reason why they have chosen not to marry. Charities Bill The Government has finally realised what I (and others) have said from the outset. This Bill is hopelessly flawed. The Government now concedes "it is too heavy-handed and has too much red tape".

If one looks back at Labour Government measures to control charities, it is a sorry history. There are 37,000 charities in New Zealand. They range from the Cancer Research Foundation and the Heart Foundation to kindergartens and sporting clubs. Earlier plans involved taxing the trading operations of charities in the same way as other businesses and for charities to pay FBT. Those plans were abandoned.

Then the present Bill was introduced to amend the tax exemption for charities so that the charities had to first register with the Government before being entitled to a tax exemption. A Charities Commission was to be set up. Now it seems those plans are to be shelved. We should be encouraging the building of philanthropic frameworks in New Zealand and recognising the unique contribution of the charitable sector. The short point is that there is no need for the Bill.
