Statement on his Majesty Malietoa Tanumafili II

National Party Leader John Key says he is saddened to learn about the death of Samoa's Head of State, his Majesty Malietoa Tanumafili II.

His Highness was thought to be the oldest serving head of state in the world.

“New Zealand and Samoa have continued to enjoy strong ties during his reign. His majesty’s passing will be mourned throughout the Pacific.

“He had a close relationship with New Zealand and visited many times, including at the invitation of the late Maori Queen, Dame Te Atairangikaahu.

“He also attended St. Stephen's College in Auckland and Wesley College in Pukekohe.

“New Zealand sends its deepest condolences to the nation of Samoa at this time.”
