All is not well with NZQA, NCEA

National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says post-election briefing papers confirm the worst kept secret in the education system – NCEA is in trouble and NZQA is in no shape to fix it.

“The briefing papers confirm NZQA has been consumed with political management and multiple inquiries and has not fixed the problems with NCEA.

“Last week, NZQA and Steve Maharey said the problems had been fixed. This week, the briefing papers paint a picture of an agency struggling with low morale, high staff turnover and the pressure of close public scrutiny. Both stories can’t be right.

“These briefing papers suggest this weak and vulnerable agency is not in any shape to do the hard technical work and make the necessary compromises to ensure NCEA is a strong national qualification.

“As a new minister, Steve Maharey missed the chance to come clean and start afresh with parents, students and employers, but it looks like it’s going to be more of the same from Labour,” says Mr English.
