Brash hopes snow-hit districts will recover soon

National Leader Don Brash has expressed his hope that South Island districts badly affected by this week's snowstorms will recover soon.

"I have today been in contact with the Mayors of Timaru, Waimate, Mackenzie, Ashburton and Selwyn to express my support, and my hope that their districts get up and running again properly as soon as possible.

"Thousands of rural people are still without power today. I understand that the authorities are endeavouring to fix power lines as quickly as possible.

"Meanwhile, forecasters are warning that another cold snap is on the way this weekend, although Canterbury is expected to get only light snowy showers.

"However, this won't be welcomed at all in the worst-hit districts.

"I won't be visiting the districts yet because the authorities clearly already have their hands full, but I want those affected to know they are in my thoughts."

ENDS
