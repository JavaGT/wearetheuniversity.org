Hutt companies to benefit from Callaghan student grants  

Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, has welcomed news that six Hutt Valley companies will receive funding from Callaghan Innovation to employ students over the 2015/16 summer break, allowing them to gain important work experience in New Zealand’s fast-growing hi-tech sector.

R&D Student Experience Grants allow students with science, technology, engineering, design, or business qualifications to advance their skills and understanding of commercial R&D within New Zealand companies.

The six Hutt companies are:

· Formway Design Ltd (Seaview)

· Tekron InternationalLtd (Alicetown)

· Times-7 Holdings Ltd (Alicetown)

· CRL Energy Ltd (Gracefield)

· Nuenz Limited (Gracefield)

· Pertronic Industries Ltd (Taita)

“I’ve been privileged to visit some of the great Hutt companies receiving these grants and it’s fantastic that students will be based there over the upcoming summer break, upskilling themselves and gaining hands-on, practical, business experience.

“These grants are a win/win for everyone involved. The grants help keen, qualified Kiwis obtain work experience in New Zealand’s fast-growing hi-tech sector. The companies also gain by employing smart, ambitious young people to help advance their R&D projects.”

“This is a further step on the road to developing the Hutt Valley into ‘Technology Valley’, where science, technology and high value manufacturing drive economic growth, new jobs and higher wages for Hutt residents. To achieve that, we need many more of our young people becoming interested in science and technology, thinking about them as career options, and considering further higher-level study. We also need young people getting experience in R and D intensive companies – which this grant scheme is all about.

“I’m also pleased that Callaghan is developing a process that better matches businesses with graduates who have completed their study. It’s good news for the Hutt that an improved, on-demand R&D Career Grant will be available later this year.

Through the Business Growth Agenda, the National-led Government is backing the Hutt’s science and technology focus, through programmes such as:

Callaghan Innovation and its various R and D grant programmes, including support for Creative HQ’s new “Lightning Lab” digital accelerator  
Record investments in science and innovation  
New tax rules to encourage research and development  
Increased investment in engineering places, and promotion of engineering through the Education to Employment initiative  
Supporting the new engineering school at the WelTec Campus  
Funding a new ICT Graduate School in Wellington
