MP for Maungakiekie

**14 December 2009 Media Statement  
Tamaki College to open Service Academy in 2010**

Local school Tamaki College in Auckland will be one of seven secondary schools opening a new Service Academy next year, Maungakiekie

“This is a great opportunity for even more year 12 and 13 students to take part in a challenging and motivating programme,” Peseta Sam says.

“There are a number of young people who tend to leave school and find it difficult to find a job, or to move on to tertiary education.

“The new Service Academy is aimed at them. The programme will focus on giving them new skills and a chance to succeed,” he says.

The military-style programmes are part of the National-led Government’s Youth Opportunities package. They will be provided at schools with the help of the New Zealand Defence Force.

Students will take part in courses such as leadership and outdoor education, and work towards reaching NCEA Level 1 Mathematics and English or above.

“This Government wants to help these students return to a mainstream school, go on to tertiary education or find a sustainable job. The aim is that after a year at the Service Academy, they will be able to do just that.

“I’m really pleased for young people in our community that Tamaki College has been chosen.” Peseta Sam says.

The seven new Service Academies will be run through the following schools:  
\* Tikipunga High School, Whangarei  
\* Otahuhu College, Otahuhu  
\* Gisborne Girls’ High School, Gisborne  
\* Tokoroa High School, Tokoroa  
\* Tamaki College, Auckland  
\* Wanganui City College, Wanganui  
\* Te Kuiti High School, Te Kuiti
