National launches SKOOLS.co.nz

National launches SKOOLS.co.nz

National Party Education spokesman Bill English is today launching a new web site aimed at helping communities that face the prospect of losing their local school under Labour’s network review.

“If Trevor Mallard was listening to communities around New Zealand they’d be telling him to ‘Stop Killing Off Our Local Schools’ (SKOOLS).

“It’s hoped the [http://www.SKOOLS.co.nz](http://www.SKOOLS.co.nz) web site will become a useful resource for parents, teachers and students who want to know more about the network reviews, which threaten to close up to 300 schools.

“National shares community concerns about the impacts of school closures on smaller centres.

“We also question a process that forces good schools to close while allowing failing schools to remain open, and in some cases, expand.

“These communities have everything to fear because the Government has not been listening to them.

“The decisions are being made in Wellington, with little regard being given to the social consequences, not to mention educational outcomes.

“National believes parents and communities know what’s best for their children, they should be making the decisions - not the Minister from his ivory tower in Wellington,” says Mr English.

SKOOLS.co.nz is the latest in a series of successful web sites from the National Party, which has also been behind internet campaigns on the Qantas/Air New Zealand merger, the foreshore and seabed debate as well as the flatulence tax and leaky buildings crisis.
