Prison costs cloaked by Minister

Prison costs cloaked by Minister

The Corrections Minister is using a pending review of two prisons to refuse to release vital construction costs information, says National’s Law & Order spokesman, Simon Power.

“He is hiding behind this review because he does not want to release embarrassing information.”

Mr Power is releasing answers to questions that show Damien O’Connor is refusing to say what contractors are on the sites, estimated costings of their work, and how much they are being paid.

Damien O’Connor is refusing to release:

\- Details of initial estimated costs, ongoing payments, and expected total costs of work done by designers and engineers.

\- How much has been saved under the collaborative working arrangements by contractors and the department.

\- The contracting rates of consultants.

\- How many contractors and subcontractors are on the sites, and their names.

\- The cost of accommodation, meals, travel, car packages, or any other expenses for each member of the construction teams.

“Taxpayers have a right to know how much these mystery contractors are charging.

“The Corrections Department has previously admitted, reluctantly, that it has been paying one contractor $1,800 a day for a couple of years, so perhaps the reason they don’t want to answer is because there are more being paid that sort of money.

“And the collaborative working arrangements, being used at some sites, are supposed to be saving taxpayers’ money, so why will the Minister not confirm that they are?

“Damien O’Connor and his department are presiding over a $490 million constructions budget blowout, so you would think they would want to try to change the perception that they are hopeless managers by supplying this information.

“Or perhaps that is why they are not releasing it.

“Damien O’Connor is using the review of the Spring Hill and Otago Prison projects to deny me information, but I have asked about Northland and Auckland Women’s as well, so it’s obvious he is using the review as a shield for the entire construction programme.”
