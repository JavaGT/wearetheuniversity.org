Maharey deluded over reducing class sizes

Steve Maharey’s continued belief that Labour will deliver on its 2005 election policy that by 2008 ‘there are no more than 15 students in a class’ flies in the face of the advice from his own officials, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

“Officials have advised him that he has no chance of meeting the Government's revised promise of a ratio of 1:18, let alone the original ratio of 1:15, because there are not enough experienced teachers to teach new entrants.

“His officials have told him, ‘Our analysis suggests that approximately two thirds of the 700 positions will not be able to be filled’, and the only way to plug the gap is to crank up the immigration of overseas-trained teachers or recruit more beginning teachers.

“Disturbingly, officials go on to say ‘some schools might have to compromise on their quality criteria to employ extra teachers’.

“Relaxing the quality criteria is basically telling schools to be less choosy over who they hire. This is an insult to all principals and teachers who treasure their professionalism.

“The Minister’s reliance on recruiting greater numbers of beginning teachers to take up some new entrant roles shows how desperate Labour is.

“Previously he has said, ‘to guarantee that the intent of the policy is realised the extra teachers must be experienced teachers with the knowledge of how to teach literacy and numeracy to 5-and-6-year-olds’.

“The quality and experience of a teacher is vitally important, particularly for new entrant students. Compromising these attributes in an attempt to meet goals which officials say are not achievable will not bring the gains in learning that the policy aims to promote.”
