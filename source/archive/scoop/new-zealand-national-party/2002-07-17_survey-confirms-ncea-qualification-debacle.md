Survey Confirms NCEA Qualification Debacle

The Government's failed implementation of the new school qualification is the real scandal of this election, says National Education spokesperson Nick Smith, in today releasing a survey of teachers on the NCEA.

The nationwide survey was initiated by David Newton, a science teacher from Shirley Boys' High School in Christchurch, and involved over 1500 teachers from 89 schools throughout New Zealand.

"The survey showed:  
\* 90% do not have confidence in NCEA moderation system  
\* 71% are considering leaving teaching because of NCEA 1,2 & 3 workloads over the next 3 years  
\* 77% do not believe sufficient resources have been put into NCEA  
\* 80% do not think NCEA will be credible with employers, parents, educationalists or students  
\* 68% do not believe assessments give a valid indication of student ability  
\* 83% do not believe NCEA should continue in its current form

"This survey is a bombshell. It shows teachers have little confidence in the NCEA, and if teachers have no confidence, neither will students, parents or employers," says Dr Smith.

"The tragedy is that 57,000 Year 11 students are going to get a botched qualification at year's end. The Government has messed up the one chance these students have at a fifth form qualification and now wants the mandate to do it again next year for Year 12 students.

"The Government is being pigheaded in insisting the NCEA be rolled out for Year 12 when it is in such a mess at Year 11. It is not fair on students or teachers and will do irreparable damage to secondary education in New Zealand.

"A National-led Government would immediately halt implementation of the NCEA. We would restore the emphasis of an examination system, reverse the fragmentation of subjects, ensure assessment does not supersede learning and give students percentage marks," says Dr Smith.
