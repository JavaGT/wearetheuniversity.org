Bluster but no action over secret payout

Judith Collins MP - National Party Families Spokeswoman

Bluster but no action over secret payout

National Party Families spokeswoman Judith Collins is appalled that Rajen Prasad will face no formal action over his flagrant breach of the rules surrounding secret golden handshakes.

"Steve Maharey, Helen Clark and the entire Labour bunch are showing themselves to be the masters of double standards," says Ms Collins.

She is referring to Steve Maharey's refusal to release the details of the secret golden handshake which was paid out to former Families Commission CEO Claire Austin who was in the job for just three months.

"Maharey, Clark and Co talked tough on this stuff in Opposition, but in government they have shown themselves to be all bluster and no action.

"I'm sure Rajen Prasad is shaking in his boots at the prospect of a telling off from Steve Maharey - but the reality is that Mr Prasad has given away many thousands of taxpayer dollars in a secret payout and now Labour is protecting that secrecy," says Ms Collins.

"Mr Maharey must take real action against Rajen Prasad for breaking the rules. John Tamihere paid the price for accepting a golden handshake when he said he wouldn't, surely Mr Prasad should face the music for handing out a golden handshake when he shouldn't."
