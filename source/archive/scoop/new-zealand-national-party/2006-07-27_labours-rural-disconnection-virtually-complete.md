Labour's rural disconnection virtually complete

Labour's rural disconnection virtually complete

National Agriculture spokesman David Carter says Labour's connection to rural New Zealand has now been virtually extinguished after the departure of former agriculture minister Jim Sutton.

\"Labour now does not have a farmer in its caucus, or on its list," says Mr Carter. "Only Damien O'Connor, a former dairy farmer, is left as someone with even a vague connection with the sector."

"Though Mr Sutton was obviously a poor advocate for farmers by allowing stupid proposals like fart taxes, dog microchipping and public access across private land, his presence in Cabinet as a former farmer was better than nothing.

"As Helen Clark starts the process of rejuvenating her caucus, we will no doubt see a line-up of fresh-faced teachers, unionists and academics - but nobody with the interests of farmers at heart."
