The large increase in violent crime in Auckland puts new urgency in dealing with Auckland police numbers, says National's Justice spokesperson, North Shore MP Wayne Mapp.

"The 16.4% increase in violent crime in Auckland shows new thinking is needed if we are to get the officers the city desperately needs. It is time for Police training courses to be held in Auckland to train new recruits.

"This is an idea I have advocated for a long time, along with the Mayors of North Shore and Waitakere. Auckland is a unique city with special challenges for Police officers. It makes sense that Auckland recruits should do at least some of their training here, rather than at the Police college in Porirua.

"I will be asking my Auckland Parliamentary colleagues to put their weight behind this idea. If we can't get Aucklanders to go to Wellington to train, then we will have to bring the training to Auckland," said Dr Mapp.
