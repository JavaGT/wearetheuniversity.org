Bulk Funding Double Standard

Bulk Funding Double Standard - It's Out For Schools But In For Doctors

The Government's revealed a glaring double standard by scrapping bulk funding for schools, but deciding to introduce bulk funding for doctors, National List MP Max Bradford said today.

"On the same day the Government announces it is to introduce a new law to end bulk funding of schools, it announces it will bring bulk funding in for primary care providers.

"They've also decided to keep bulk funding of school transport.

"Where's the consistency in that?

"Why is bulk funding so bad for schools, but so good for GPs and the funding of school buses?

"We've got 20 schools in our electorate - with about 10,000 students - that have chosen to be bulk funded.

"They've done it because they can do more for students than being tied up in the straight-jacket of Wellington control. Good ones like Lynmore Primary have relished the opportunity.

"The schools are going to lose all that, and given the inconsistent approach to GPs and school transport, it is becoming clearer that they are only making the change because teachers' unions don't like it.

"The Government is developing a track record for pulling the plug on policies that work well and deliver benefits just because the National Government thought of them.

"If bulk funding of schools works to deliver students a better education then why pull the plug. The Government's stance just doesn't make any sense."
