Why doesn't Govt support Auditor General's study

Why doesn't Govt support Auditor General's proposed study?

National says it is surprised the Government won't support the Controller and Auditor General's proposed study of state sector agencies like Te Hau Ora O Tai Tokerau (THOTT).

The Auditor General has proposed that a wider investigation into contracting practices across the state sector was necessary after National MP Phil Heatley called for an audit of the contracts between THOTT and two Ministries.

"Today in Parliament Social Service Minister Steve Maharey said the Government didn't support the Auditor General's proposal.

"I can't understand this stance when it is clear that hundreds of thousands of dollars was of taxpayers money was wasted by this agency, and CYFS is still trying to recover $1.7m of money it spent.

"There could be many more organisations where there is little accountability doing the same thing. "The Controller and Auditor General said that, instead of auditing THOTT specifically, he wanted to conduct a more wide-ranging study of contracting practices across the state sector. He said there were other examples of community and voluntary agencies that had apparently failed to deliver services in accordance with their contracts. "The Government must make community and voluntary organisations accountable for the money they spend.

"I can only guess that it has something to hide in not wanting to find out if the problem is more widespread through the Controller and Auditor General's suggested study," Mr Heatley said.
