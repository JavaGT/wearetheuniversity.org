**27 March 2013**  
The Christchurch earthquakes have taken a huge toll on Cantabrians, but the rest of New Zealand is helping share the financial cost. When it comes to pulling together and coping with a crisis, there is no country in the world I'd rather be in than this one.  
Over two years on from the most devastating February 22nd quake, the progress of the rebuild of Christchurch is gathering pace. If last year was about demolition, 2013 is certainly about rebuilding a vibrant city that all Kiwis can be proud of.  
In my video this week, I talk about some of the great progress we've made in rebuilding wider Christchurch.
