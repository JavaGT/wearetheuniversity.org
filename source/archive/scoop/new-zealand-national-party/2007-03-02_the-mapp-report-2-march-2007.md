The Mapp Report 2 March 2007

Better Business Solutions

A National led government will provide provide better business solutions, and what better way to develop better business solutions than by listening to the business community? On Monday night, in Takapuna, I hosted a panel of leading business people who shared their views on the business environment and answered questions from North Shore business people.

Speakers included Roger Bell from Vero Insurance New Zealand Ltd, Mike Cushman from Pharmaceuticals Compounding Ltd and Dave Perkin from Beggs Big & Tall. National’s business spokesmen, MPs Mark Blumsky and Chris Tremain also attended and offered their perspective as businessmen and politicians. They have been holding forums throughout New Zealand. There are a few resounding messages.

Employment Law Stifles Business Growth

Labour employment law has made many business owners fearful of employing extra staff. Getting it wrong can be hugely costly for small businesses. My 90 day probation period proposal is a core National policy on employment law reform.

Calling Competent Staff

It is difficult for business owners to find competent staff. Young skilled workers are fleeing to Australia and Britain. We need a population of young New Zealanders who are excited about business and eager to develop business in the country. This can begin with changing the NCEA grading system so that mediocrity is discouraged. At present a mark of 45% qualifies for an NCEA result of ‘achieved’, but so does 72%. Many students just aim for 45%.

National can also provide a mentoring system in schools and continue this through to entrepreneurs entering the business market. We need to put business champions on a pedestal.

  
Catching Fraudsters

Businesses need better law enforcement. Many businesses are told that unless they put together a full case ready for prosecution, the police will take no action. In practical terms that means there is little protection against fraud.

Simple Tax Solutions So much of the tax system is complex and bureaucratic, especially for business. Small business is looking for much simpler systems. This is part of the pathway for reducing the cost of bureaucracy, and therefore taxes.

Entrepreneurs Paradise – Let’s Make it Grow New Zealand has a huge number of business start-ups. In fact it is one of the easiest markets to enter. But New Zealand is a small business market. Surviving and growing is a much bigger challenge. This is particularly true for businesses wanting to get into exporting, especially with the high cost of international trade shows. This is a real problem for New Zealand businesses which is not faced by Asian and European businesses. They are already in the midst of their markets. National will be looking at how to boost the role of New Zealand Trade and Enterprise to help businesses get into exports.

Business growth is the key to prosperity for every New Zealander. National will answer the call for better business solutions.
