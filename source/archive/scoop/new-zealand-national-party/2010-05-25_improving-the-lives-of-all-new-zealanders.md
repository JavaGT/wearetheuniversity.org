Improving the lives of all New Zealanders
=========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

**Budget 2010: Improving the lives of all New Zealanders**

This year's Budget was designed to create jobs, boost our economy and help Kiwi families get ahead. It also keeps us on track to reverse the deficit and get the Budget back into surplus.

Budget 2010 delivered the most sweeping changes to our tax system in 25 years.

Across the board tax cuts will leave a single person on the average wage better off by $15 per week and a family with two kids on the average wage better off by around $25 per week.

It will also mean that 73% of income earners will now pay a top tax rate of only 17.5%.

For hard working New Zealanders struggling to get ahead this will make a significant difference.

There will be a small increase in GST from 12.5 to 15%. Payments for Superannuation, Working for Families, benefits and student allowances will all increase to compensate for this.

In recent years unsustainable increases in government spending have led to rising debt. We are tackling this issue head-on and as a result government accounts are set to return to surplus 3 years sooner than predicted last year.

To remain internationally competitive, we are decreasing company tax rates to 28%. We recognise the difficulties that small business owners face, and it is important to give them a break.

We are helping families and the most vulnerable by investing hundreds of millions of dollars more in priority social services such as hospitals, schools, and safer communities.

We're putting an extra $2.1 billion into frontline healthcare over the next four years, and an extra $1.4 billion for better schools and early childhood education services. We're investing $321 million over four years in new initiatives in science, research, and technology, which will be of benefit to our economy.
