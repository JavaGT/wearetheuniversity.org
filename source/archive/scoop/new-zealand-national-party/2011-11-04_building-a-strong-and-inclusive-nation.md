**Building a strong and inclusive nation**

National will continue to build strong relationships between ethnic communities and New Zealanders and improve the settling-in process for new migrants and refugees, National Party Ethnic Affairs Spokeswoman Hekia Parata says.

"National recognises the important role ethnic and migrant communities have in our society and economy," says Ms Parata.

"Around one in four New Zealanders are now born overseas. With 60 per cent of New Zealand’s workforce growth coming from migrants, our ethnic communities are playing a bigger role in our society and our economy – helping us export more and creating more jobs," says Ms Parata.

Over the last three years National has established business forums to connect ethnic communities with businesses in New Zealand, promoted links with high-growth Asian economies, and introduced the Silver Fern Visa which provides 300 places a year for young migrant graduates to search for skilled jobs in New Zealand.

National has also worked closely with ethnic communities on New Zealand’s Free Trade Agreement negotiations.

"We will continue to foster connections between ethnic businesses and established New Zealand firms to help build a strong economy,'" says Ms Parata.

"We also want to ensure the public sector is responsive to the needs of our diverse communities, involve ethnic communities in events of national and cultural significance, and promote New Zealand as a study destination for international students."

National will roll out a whole-of-government strategy to improve outcomes for refugees and reduce state dependency.

"Currently there is no single Government department that has overall responsibility for meeting the needs of refugees," says Ms Parata.

"A centralised strategy is needed to bring together all the support that is available to refugees in New Zealand.

"Our plan is to build a strong, inclusive economy for the benefit all New Zealanders."
