Pharmac beware: Cheapest drugs not always the best

Pharmac needs to weigh up cost, quality and track record when it makes decisions about the 247 drugs currently out for tender, warns National’s Associate Health spokeswoman, Dr Jackie Blue (Pharmacare).

In its tender document Pharmac says it will accept a sole supply contract for the Salbutamol inhaler, used to treat asthma.

“This is a case of history repeating itself,” says Dr Jackie Blue.

In 2005 Pharmac introduced a sole supply contact with a generic salbutamol inhaler, Salamol, replacing Ventolin, which had been the cornerstone of asthma treatment for decades.

“Many asthmatics suffered with the switch.

“A report published in the New Zealand Medical Journal in August 2005 has outlined the numerous concerns asthma experts have with Salamol.

“Concerns included the fact that:

The alcohol content in Salamol was enough to fail a road side breath test;

Children were reluctant to use it because of the taste;

Children were being unnecessarily exposed to alcohol;

And the inhaler had a tendency to block, thereby failing to deliver medication.”

“A further report supported concerns that Salamol was less effective than Ventolin.

“Following the up-roar in 2005, Ventolin was brought back, with patients prepared to pay a part charge rather than risk their health

“Despite last time’s colossal failure with a sole supply contract with Salamol, Pharmac is again willing to put thousands of asthma sufferers at risk, just to save a few cents.

“When will Pharmac learn?”
