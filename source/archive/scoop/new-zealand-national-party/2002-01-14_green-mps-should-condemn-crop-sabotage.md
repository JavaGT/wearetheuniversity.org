Green MPs Should Condemn Crop Sabotage
======================================

The Green Party should be condemning the sabotage of experimental crops at the Lincoln Science Centre, not sitting on its hands, says National's Crown Research Institutes spokesperson, Dr Paul Hutchison.

"It's vital for New Zealand to be at the forefront of horticultural and agricultural research. This senseless attack is soul destroying for scientists who have seen years of work destroyed by saboteurs.

"The irony is that the experiments were designed to identify genetic sequence in potatoes linked to specific traits, so that conventional selective breeding of plants would be improved.

"Our GE scientists are a scarce resource and it's vital that they are given full support in this key area of biotechnology.

"When we have people like Jeanette Fitzsimons demanding that cows in calf be put down, when the aim is to find a cure for multiple sclerosis, and Nandor Tanczos, a former spokesperson for the Wild Greens, you have to question the Green Party's responsibility.

"The Greens should be vehemently condemning this senseless act of destruction at Lincoln," says Dr Hutchison.
