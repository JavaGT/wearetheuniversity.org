The provisional diagnosis of the presence of a deadly pig disease (PMWS) on a Waikato farm is a warning not to be ignored, says National's Biosecurity Spokesman Shane Ardern.

"It is a matter of when, not if, we have a major incursion that will threaten our economic future," says Mr Ardern.

National's recently released Biosecurity Discussion Document stressed the importance of an emergency capability to deal with major crises, something Labour's Biosecurity Strategy lacks.

"We are gambling with our future by failing to move faster to implement a stronger, more viable biosecurity package.

"Yet again, New Zealanders are facing up to the prospect of another exotic disease becoming a permanent resident.

"This is not good enough. We need to toughen up our border controls or suffer the consequences. We need action now," says Mr Ardern.
