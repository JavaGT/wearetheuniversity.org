National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop says there has been a significant drop in the number of school students being suspended, stood-down, excluded, and expelled from schools in the Hutt Valley.

“Under the National-led government, Hutt kids are staying in school longer and getting better results,” Mr Bishop says.

“In the Hutt South electorate, stand-downs have dropped 32 per cent since 2008, and suspensions have fallen 81 per cent.

“In the Rimutaka electorate, stand-downs have dropped 28.5 per cent since 2008, and suspensions have fallen 34 per cent.

“The national average decline for stand-downs is 28 per cent, while for suspensions the average decline is 37 per cent. The Hutt is therefore doing well compared to the rest of New Zealand.

“Exclusions and expulsions at Hutt schools are also down significantly.

“National is focusing on improving performance in the schooling system so every child has the opportunity to succeed, as we know high-quality education provides the opportunity for any child from any background to get ahead and make the most of their life”, says Mr Bishop.
