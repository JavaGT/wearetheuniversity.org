Business studies should be NCEA subject

Business studies should be NCEA subject

If the Labour Government is serious about building better relationships between schools and businesses it will allow schools to teach business studies as an NCEA subject, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

He is commenting on a statement today by Ministry of Education chief executive Howard Fancy that schools need to develop ‘strong and effective’ relationships with employers.

“NZQA has refused to approve achievement standards in business studies from innovative schools like Onehunga High School and strong demand from students,” says Mr English.

“While student numbers in accounting and economics are declining, I suspect there would be a lot of interest in a practical multi-skilled business studies course.

“I welcome Mr Fancy’s statement but his words will remain empty while anti-business bureaucrats continue to block the opportunity for our young people to learn about business.”
