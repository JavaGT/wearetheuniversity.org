Labour Must Drop Scholarship Fix-It Fee

Labour must drop scholarship fix-it fee

National's Education spokesman, Bill English, says Labour must drop the $30 fee for each scholarship reassessment.

\"Hundreds of students have lost confidence in the system and will be left wondering if their results are accurate. It's hardly fair that they should have to pay for reassurance after a fortnight of controversy surrounding the scholarship system."

Earlier this week Labour admitted there were considerable discrepancies in the NCEA scholarship exams, with some subjects being awarded significantly more pass marks than others.

400 students have subsequently been awarded 'Distinction Awards' as compensation. It is not known what weight these awards will carry with tertiary institutions.

"Students who failed scholarship exams will want to get the real thing if they can, rather than Labour's compensatory half-way award," says Mr English.

"It is not the fault of students that scholarship has turned into such a disgraceful shambles, and Labour shouldn't charge them for the privilege of fixing it .The least the Minister can do it wipe the reassessment fee."
