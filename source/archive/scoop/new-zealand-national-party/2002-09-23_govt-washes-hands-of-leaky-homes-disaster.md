Govt washes hands of leaky homes disaster

Bill English - National Leader

The Government is washing its hands of taking any interest in the leaking homes disaster, says National Leader Bill English.

“Today Helen Clark is telling the thousands of people affected to go to their lawyers so they can get their house fixed.

“Sending these people to their lawyers as the Prime Minister and George Hawkins have suggested is not the answer. Their costs will run into millions of dollars and they will see no solutions in sight for many years.

“Home ownership is part of the New Zealand way of life. It is no wonder homeowners are distressed when their asset is rotting. Helen Clark does not seem to understand there is a lot more to it than the Government’s liability.

“She is saying that because the Government is not liable for the leaky home problems, it has no responsibility to do anything. A week ago George Hawkins said there was no need for an inquiry but under pressure the Government decided to have an inquiry.  
“We are pushing for a wider inquiry that will help home owners identify liability.

“Helen Clark should take action now rather than wait until she is forced by the public to show more concern for thousands of affected homeowners.  
National is urging people affected by leaky homes to make submissions to the select committee inquiry. “People must ask for a wider inquiry and we also urge them push for a select committee hearing in Auckland,” Mr English said.
