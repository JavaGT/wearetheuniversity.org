NCEA: more evidence of re-marking

National Party Education spokesman Bill English today released a further two emails from NCEA markers claiming there is pressure to pass students who would otherwise have failed, in order to reach required pass rates as dictated by the NZQA.

One of the emails says 'we are forced to push through students who have not achieved into the achieved category who clearly have no knowledge of \[the subject\] at this level.'

Mr English says this kind of rejigging will create problems for students down the track.

"Pushing students through to the next level when they are not ready will make next year difficult for them.

"These emails back up a statement made by the principal of a Christchurch high school on radio this morning, confirming markers had told him they are under pressure to meet pre-determined pass rates," says Mr English.

"Education Minister Steve Maharey continues to avoid the issues with NCEA by launching personal attacks on myself, and anyone else concerned, about fair and valid assessment for students.

"However, continuing concerns from parents, exam markers and now school principals show there is significant anxiety about the level of unofficial re-marking of NCEA papers.

"NZQA is under enormous pressure to avoid the embarrassment of last year's exams by producing non-controversial exam results in January. Judging by the extent of re-marking so far, it will be a miracle if they are not perfect," says Mr English.
