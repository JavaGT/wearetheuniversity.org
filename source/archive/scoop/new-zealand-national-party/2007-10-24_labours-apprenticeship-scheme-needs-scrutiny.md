Labour's apprenticeship scheme needs scrutiny

Labour's failure to hold the coordinators of the Modern Apprenticeships scheme to account has resulted in some shocking completion rates, says National's Associate Education (Trade Training) spokesman, Colin King.

Figures released by the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) show co-ordinators have received millions of dollars in government funding to guide apprentices since late 2001, but many are failing to reach the TEC objective of a 75% completion rate.

"Coordinators are paid $2,000 per apprentice per year by TEC. One ITO has received $165,550 since the scheme started in 2001but has completed the training of just one apprentice.

"Another ITO has received $1,237,250 and churned out only 22 apprentices.

"Michael Cullen needs to explain the reason for such unmonitored under performance. Where is the accountability?

"The Minister's glib response to the damning figures was 'caution must be exercised in comparing the completion and payment figures provided, as the payments are towards coordination services for all Modern Apprentices who have trained from 2001.This includes the significant numbers of Modern Apprentices that are actively progressing towards the successful completion of their Modern Apprenticeship.'

"Without checks and balances there is no way of knowing whether taxpayers' money is being wisely spent. It is alarming that this scheme has been running for six years at a cost in excess of $200 million, but Labour can't tell us why some coordinators continue to receive funding with no results.

"For two years now, I have been asking for more accurate management of the co-ordinators' performance and nothing has been forthcoming, apart from a vague promise, six years too late, of an 'indicator' by the end of this year."
