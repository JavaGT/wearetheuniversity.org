Budget 2006: Dumped patients will take no comfort

The more than 20,000 New Zealanders dumped from hospital waiting lists this year will take no comfort from Labour’s Budget, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.

“The Government offers nothing to address the most pressing issues facing the health system today,” says Mr Ryall.

“Labour has no plan to deal with the growing shortage of GPs and specialists, no plan to provide surgery for the thousands of New Zealanders dumped from waiting lists, and no plan to cut bureaucracy.

“Labour fails to address the fundamental disconnect in the health system, which encourages people to see a GP but stops them getting anywhere near a hospital should they need an operation!

“With health inflation running at more than 5%, the extra money announced for aged care will not address pay pressure faced by rest homes, nor deal with carers’ travel costs.

“The 180,000 patients on hospital waiting lists must wait and wonder why the Government does nothing for their pain,” says Mr Ryall.
