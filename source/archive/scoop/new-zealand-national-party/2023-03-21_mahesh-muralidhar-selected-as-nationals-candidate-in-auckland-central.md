Mahesh Muralidhar Selected As National’s Candidate In Auckland Central
======================================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Phase One Ventures chief executive Mahesh Muralidhar has been selected by local party members as National’s candidate in Auckland Central for the 2023 General Election.

“I want to thank our local party members for backing me to campaign for a National Government as National’s candidate in Auckland Central. The hard work starts now and I’ll be meeting as many people as I can before October 14,” says Mr Muralidhar.

“I love our city and am incredibly aspirational for the people who call it home but it’s getting harder for many to afford to call Auckland Central home. Labour is spending $1 billion more per week than the previous government and all there is to show for it are higher costs and worsening outcomes across the board.

“The median rent in Auckland is almost $5,000 higher per year under Labour and those who own their homes are wondering how they’re going to find hundreds of dollars more a week to cover rising mortgage repayments caused by rate hikes desperately trying to put a lid on Labour’s runaway inflation. Making sure Auckland Central attracts and retains our best and brightest is a priority for me and that starts with fixing the cost-of-living crisis.

“I’m standing as National’s candidate because the National Party values are values that I stand by - limited government, competitive enterprise and caring communities. It’s the only party with a plan to strengthen our economy, to reduce the cost of living and make it easier for Kiwis. It is the only party with the ability to deliver. We’ll stop Labour’s wasteful spending and we’ll be focused on the issues that matter. I’ll do the same if I earn the right to represent Auckland Central as its next local MP.

“Another key issue for Auckland Central is rising crime. In 2022 there were almost 50 per cent more victimisations, which include offences like robbery, theft and assault in the Auckland City Police District than in 2017. The data bears out why people feel less safe on the streets of Auckland Central and we need to get serious about changing our approach. National has released plans to do exactly that by backing our Police to disrupt crime and setting clear consequences for offenders. I am committed to working closely with our community leaders to make Auckland Central safer for everyone.

“I took the Kiwi rite of passage and spent time working in Sydney and Tokyo but this has always been home. I’m running because I want the opportunity to give back to a city that has given me so much.

“I’ll stand up for the young people struggling to afford the basics, the start-ups and businesses we must support to unlock our productivity, our beautiful Hauraki Gulf islands and for everyone here trying to get ahead if I earn the right to be the MP for Auckland Central in Chris Luxon’s National team.”
