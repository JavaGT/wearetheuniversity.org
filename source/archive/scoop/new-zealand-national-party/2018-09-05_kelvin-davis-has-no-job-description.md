===================================

Kelvin Davis has no job description

Crown/Māori Relations Minister Kelvin Davis has been in the job for ten months but still has no idea what his job description is, National’s Crown/Māori spokesperson Chris Finlayson says.

“Mr Davis has held the Crown/Māori portfolio since October last year, he has conducted a number of hui around the country yet the public is none the wiser as to what he should be doing.

“When asked in the House today what he does, Mr Davis said an announcement will be made soon.

“The Minister has originally said he would take a paper to Cabinet in July outlining what his delegations are, it’s now September and Mr Davis is simply saying it’ll be made soon.

“A year in Government will have passed before Mr Davis has figured out what he should be doing. It’s costing the taxpayer thousands of dollars for a Minister who isn’t doing any work.

“How can he be held to account if no one, not even the Minister himself, has a clue as to what he should be doing?”
