**$1.1m health programme for under-5s**

Pre-schoolers in Thames-Hauraki are to benefit from a $1.1 million Government investment to boost nutrition and activity levels for under-fives.

The Project Energize initiative, currently managed by Sport Waikato in primary schools, is to be extended to up 128 early childhood centres, kohanga, kindergartens and community services in parts of Waikato, including Thames, Paeroa, Ngatea and Waihi.

It is the first in a number of announcements the Government plans about new investments in giving families a healthy start.

“Emerging evidence is that ‘Project Energize’ is producing fitter, healthier kids who weigh less, run faster and have a better handle on healthy nutrition than the national average,” Mr Ryall said.

Coromandel MP Scott Simpson welcomed the announcement.

“We know the earlier we start creating good habits in relation to food and exercise the better. The new Under 5 Energize project will support good nutrition and the development of fundamental movement skills for around 5,000 under five year olds in parts of the Waikato.”

Four nutrition and physical development experts will work with the centres to train and mentor staff and also encourage parents to be involved in healthy eating and activity through education workshops. They will support centre staff to develop individual healthy eating and physical activity plans for their children and to engage families in this process.
