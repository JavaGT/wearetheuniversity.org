Chinese school certificate announcement welcomed

Opposition Ethnic Affairs Spokesperson Pansy Wong has welcomed the announcement that Chinese will be a School Certificate Examination subject from this year.

"Last year National implemented Chinese as a Bursary subject and was keen to also offer it as a School Certificate subject. I am really pleased that the new Government is continuing the good work we started and that the announcement has been made in time for this academic year.

"Internationally, the Chinese language will become increasingly prominent. 1.7 billion people are of Chinese ethnic origin and it is important that New Zealand is able to develop links with them.

"We should encourage participation by our students in the Chinese language. Effective communication with these international communities will enhance our capability both culturally and economically.

"It is also important for our growing Chinese community that their children are able to maintain their mother tongue," Mrs Wong said.
