Education Minister invited to Southland
=======================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

15 February 2019

  
Invercargill MP Sarah Dowie is calling on Education Minister Chris Hipkins to come to Southland to hear the views of the community about the proposed changes to the Southern Institute of Technology.

“The Government is proposing massive changes to the Polytechnic sector which could drastically affect our well performing institution. Given the Government is only allowing six weeks of consultation, it owes Southlanders the chance to have their say.

“A consultation review panel will tour New Zealand, with the dates and locations being announced next week. If Southland is not on the list then it absolutely should be one of the locations visited.

“If the consultation review panel won’t come to Southland, then Education Minister Chris Hipkins should come to Invercargill and talk to our community. I will personally host a public meeting for him to attend so he can hear our views.

“Students are proud of their SIT experience. SIT feeds into our Southland Regional Development Strategy to attract 10,000 more people to Southland by 2025 and has helped diversify our community. It’s important that the Minister comes here and see this success for himself.”
