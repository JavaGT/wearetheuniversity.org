Bishop congratulates Hutt Valley Dragons’ Den winners

National List MP Chris Bishop has congratulated teams from three Hutt Valley schools on their outstanding performances at the 2016 Young Enterprise Scheme (YES) Regional Dragons’ Den finals held last night in Wellington.

Teams from Wainuiomata High School, Hutt International Boys’ School and Hutt Valley High School were selected out of 95 from around the region for the regional final, and asked to present in front of a group of business leader (“dragons”), requesting capital to expand their business – just like the TV show.

“The three Hutt schools all presented outstandingly – they were outstanding representatives of their schools and families. All the students involved should be very proud of themselves,” says Mr Bishop.

“Huge congratulations to Prestige Men’s Products from Wainui High School, who received $1200 from the Dragons – the most of any group, and double what the next group received.

“Prestige Men’s Products has developed a men’s hair product using discarded beeswax. It’s an innovative product and their pitch and presentation last night was near perfect – funny but full of professionalism and poise at the same time.

“I was also really proud of Ease from Hutt Valley High School, which was granted $600, the second highest amount of money. Ease are making a premium chocolate coconut milk and they’re working on whether they can get vegan certification for the product.”

Mr Bishop, the National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, says the level of entrepreneurship and innovation on display was extremely high.

“I am so impressed with the quality of our young entrepreneurs. I have a real passion for supporting the growth and development of young people in the Hutt so to see results like this is very encouraging,” says Mr Bishop.

“I encourage all teams to consider putting themselves forward for a Hutt City Youth Award when nominations open later this year, especially in the categories of Leadership, Entrepreneurship, and Science and Technology.”
