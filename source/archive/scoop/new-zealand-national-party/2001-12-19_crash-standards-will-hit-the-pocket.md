Crash Standards Will Hit The Pocket
===================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The Government's tough new crash standards for cars will hit low income families in the pocket and do little to improve safety on our roads, says National's Transport spokesperson Belinda Vernon.

"The ban on the importation of older cars will have serious consequences - the supply of older cars will dry up, car prices will be pushed up, people will stop upgrading their vehicles and safety will be compromised.

"The Government thinks it can avoid scrutiny by calling this a safety measure. It should read the advice of the LTSA and Treasury which say that the benefits of a newer fleet are likely to be achieved over time, without the Government taking any action.

"For most low income New Zealanders, an extra four or five thousand dollars for a vehicle is the difference between upgrading their car or not.

"The new frontal impact standards are not about safety. They're about the Government telling people what to do. These days, motorists place increasing importance on safety features in cars and weigh up many factors, along with price, before deciding what to buy.

"The Government should not judge their decision - or take their choice away," says Ms Vernon.
