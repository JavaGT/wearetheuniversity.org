Auckland facing major police shortages

Auckland facing major police shortages

Greater Auckland Police will be short over 130 frontline staff at the beginning of next year, according to projections by Police National Headquarters, says National's Police spokesperson Tony Ryall.

A staffing schedule released to the National Party under the Official Information Act shows the Auckland staffing crisis is going to get worse before any improvement.

"With tens of thousands of people flocking to Auckland over the summer, police resources are going to be incredibly stretched. It will be difficult to maintain order in South and West Auckland, if there is a breakdown in public security in Auckland City during this time.

"Violent crime in Auckland has hit a second record year in a row. Burglary response times are taking longer. Less than one in ten Auckland burglaries are actually solved. Crime has got worse in Auckland in the past three years. Yet, the leadership of the failing Auckland Police District and Labour's incompetent Minister Mr Hawkins carry on excusing this appalling record.

"Public confidence in Mr Hawkins' leadership of the Police is being tested and is wanting," said Mr Ryall. "Like the rotting homes debacle, Mr Hawkins was told of this looming staffing crisis two years ago, and has basically done nothing."

The official figures show Police will start next year 28 staff short in North Shore/Waitakere, 63 in Auckland City, and 42 in Counties Manukau. On current projections Police expect to fill only half of these vacancies by June next year. They are banking on recruiting British police officers to fill the gap, but there are no assurances on this.
