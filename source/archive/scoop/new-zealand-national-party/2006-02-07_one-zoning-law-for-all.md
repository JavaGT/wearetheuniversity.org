One zoning law for all?

One zoning law for all?

National's Education spokesman, Bill English, says Education Minister Steve Maharey must fess up as to whether or not he will continue to let Auckland Grammar School flout Labour's much-vaunted zoning laws.

Labour's school zoning policy promises that every child will have access to their local school, requiring schools to accept enrolments from all students legitimately resident in their zone.

At the weekend it was reported that Auckland Grammar has started turning students away even though they are legitimately resident in the zone.

Mr English says any number of schools would like to close their rolls so they control growth and manage their school better.

"If Labour lets Auckland Grammar continue to flout the zoning policy they must allow other schools to do the same.

"So far, all Mr Maharey has said is that the Ministry will look into the situation and deal with zone cheats. But Auckland Grammar's problem is not with zone cheats - they are turning away students with a legitimate right to attend the school.

"Parents will be left floundering because they believed that because they paid the premium for houses in the zone, their children would be entitled to attend the school," says Mr English.
