Briefing on Auckland laboratory contract

National Party members of Parliament’s Health Select Committee are looking forward to Wednesday's attendance by the Auckland District Health Board.

National MPs wrote to the chair of the Health Select Committee calling for a committee briefing on the controversial new community laboratory testing contract in greater Auckland.

That briefing will take place in public session this Wednesday between 4pm and 5pm.

"There is considerable interest and concern about the future of community laboratory services in greater Auckland,” says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.

“Nearly 120,000 Aucklanders have signed a petition calling for a review of the contracting process. The Royal College of GPs, the NZ Medical Association, doctors, and specialists have all spoken about their concerns.

"National is particularly keen to find out how the local DHBs will manage the risks of changing from one provider to another.

“We also want an indication of what contingency plans may be in place if things don't work out.

“Members of the three Auckland DHBs have their reputations at stake with this process, and we are determined to see that they have plans in place to ensure Aucklanders continue to receive quality lab services," says Mr Ryall.
