Maharey should be replaced too

National Party Broadcasting spokeswoman Georgina te Heuheu is welcoming the appointment of Sir John Anderson as the new chair of the TVNZ Board.

"We certainly wish him well, he has a big job ahead of him.

"But in order to deliver real change to TVNZ, Steve Maharey should have his head on the block.

"This is a Minister who has presided over the shambles for most of the past six years.

"Having already made a complete hash of the tertiary education portfolio before being replaced, he's fared no better in his role as Broadcasting Minister.

"It is high time Mr Maharey took some responsibility for the failure of the charter, which leaked memos now reveal as a source of major discontent within the state-run TV network.

"If Mr Maharey is really serious about tidying up the mess at TVNZ and giving the organisation a fresh start, then he must stand aside and let someone more capable fill his shoes," says Mrs te Heuheu.
