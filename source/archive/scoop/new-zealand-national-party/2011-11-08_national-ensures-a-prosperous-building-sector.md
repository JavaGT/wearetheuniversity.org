**National ensures a prosperous building sector**

National will continue to deliver a more efficient and productive building sector that stands behind the quality of its work, National Party Building and Construction spokesman Maurice Williamson says.

"When National came to office, the building sector was drowning in red tape. We took action and developed programmes to lift the skills of people in the building sector and raise productivity,” says Mr Williamson.

"We also committed up to $1 billion to a Leaky Homes Financial Assistance Package to help the many thousands of owners of leaky homes after nine years of no action under Labour. Already hundreds of owners of leaky homes have qualified for financial assistance from the Government and their local council to repair their homes.

"We've also launched the MultiProof scheme, which has seen an average cost saving on the consent process of about $1350.

"National will continue to cut red tape and costs in the building sector and increase consumer protection.

"Under the Building Act Review we’ve introduced two bills that will see clearer accountability in the sector and simplify the consenting process, enabling more homes to be built faster."

Building Amendment Bill No 3 introduces a new risk-based consenting system, where the amount of checking and inspection is aligned to the complexity of the work and the skills and capability of the people doing the work.

Building Amendment Bill No 4 covers consumer protection measures including mandatory written contracts for work over $20,000 and a requirement for builders to disclose their skills, qualifications and track record.

National has also lifted the number of Licensed Building Practitioners (LBPs).

"We have already reached 10,000 Licensed Building Practitioners and we’re well on track to reach our target of 14,100 by 1 March 2012," says Mr Williamson.

"A surge in licensing in Canterbury means the sector is in a better position for the rebuilding needed after the series of earthquakes.

“More effective regulation, clearer accountability and improved skills and knowledge will allow builders to build right first time and stand behind the quality of their work."
