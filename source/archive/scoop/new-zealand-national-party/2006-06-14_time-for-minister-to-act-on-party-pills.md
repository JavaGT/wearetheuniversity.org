Time for Minister to act on party pills

Time for Minister to act on party pills

A survey showing that one in five young people have tried party pills should be the final wake-up call for Jim Anderton to act, says National MP Jacqui Dean.

She is commenting on the findings of a Massey University survey, which show that 38% of people aged 18 to 24 have used party pills in the past year.

Sixty per cent of those surveyed believe the present regulation of party pills is too light.

“This survey shows that now is the time to act,” says Mrs Dean.

“Doctors and police have been frustrated at the slow progress towards regulating party pills. Now it seems even users of party pills support tougher regulation.”

Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton said yesterday he would refer the findings to the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs for consideration.

“Mr Anderton is the Minister in charge of drug policy. It is he who needs to take responsibility. The problem is much bigger than we ever imagined.

“He has sat on his hands while the evidence has mounted about the danger of these drugs.

"I call on him to do something about this widespread problem – and fast.”

Mrs Dean launched a petition last year calling for further research and much tighter controls on the advertising and sale of party pills. After gaining 7,500 signatures, the petition is now with Parliament's health select committee.
