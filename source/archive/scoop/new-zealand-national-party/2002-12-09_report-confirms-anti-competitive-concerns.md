Report confirms anti-competitive concerns

National’s concern that the proposed Qantas/Air New Zealand deal does not encourage competition is backed by today’s NECG report, says Nationals Transport spokesperson Roger Sowry.

“The reports backs our earlier worry about the lack of competition and it stretches the bounds of credibility that if the alliance took place we would get 53 thousand more tourists. Without competition that is just pie in the sky stuff.

“It is disturbing that the tourist figures being quoted were provided by Qantas and don’t appear to be based on scientific evidence.

“Numbers being touted are highly optimistic. Also the report refers to a possible detriment if Air New Zealand left the Star Alliance but makes no mention of Qantas leaving One World.

“ Competition within our skies is good for the public, exporters and tourists. This report shows that the proposed Qantas/Air Zealand deal is anti competition therefore in very simple terms it is not good and National will continue to fight against the proposal,”says Mr Sowry.
