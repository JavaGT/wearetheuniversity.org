Businesses say tax cuts are affordable

“Michael Cullen continues to be in a club of one with his claim that National’s plan to cut taxes, improve incentives and reward extra effort is unaffordable,” says National Party Finance spokesman John Key.

“The business community has clearly seen the long-term benefits of our plan and they‘re saying so in this morning’s Mood of the Boardroom survey.”

The survey, published in this morning’s New Zealand Herald, says 86% of CEOs believe Michael Cullen is guilty of an about-face with his spending commitments this election.

“If Dr Cullen released the full costings of his student loans policy we would be able to see just how irresponsible he’s been,” says Mr Key.

In the survey, 45% said Labour had made ‘poor’ spending decisions and a further 37% thought Labour had made only ‘average’ spending decisions.

“More than 90% of those surveyed are backing National’s tax plan. Labour’s targeted welfare has been roundly rejected.

“Business leaders are also concerned at the prospect of a Green/Labour Government, with 57% saying that would be the worst coalition combination for business.

“National has a plan to lift living standards and provide quality healthcare and education for all New Zealanders,” says Mr Key.
