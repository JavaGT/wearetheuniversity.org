National selects Northland candidate

Matt King has been selected by National to contest the Northland electorate at the 2017 General Election.  
Mr King has lived in Northland most of his life. He is a farmer, fraud investigator, volunteer firefighter with the Okaihau Brigade, and was previously a NZ Police Detective.

“I’m a proud Northland boy who has always called this place home, so it’s a thrill to be chosen. Now I’m looking forward to hitting the campaign trail and earning the right to be the strong, local voice Northlanders deserve,” Mr King says.  
“I’ve been a tradesman, a police officer, a farmer and a businessman. Whether you’re running a small business in Kerikeri, farming in Kaeo or showing visitors around in a stunning spot like the Bay of Islands, I know our local communities and their needs well.

“This is a part of New Zealand that has it all – stunning natural environment, fertile land, good schools, successful businesses, and a strong community spirit.

“Northland is a more prosperous place under this John Key-led National Government. Our economy is growing with more local jobs, we’re improving vital infrastructure, and investing in better social services.

“I’m the only candidate who will be a strong local MP, based in Northland, in a Government that gets results.”

Northland is New Zealand’s northernmost electorate, stretching from Cape Reinga down to Wellsford excluding the area around Whangarei. It includes the towns of Kerikeri, Kaikohe, Kaitaia, and Dargaville.
