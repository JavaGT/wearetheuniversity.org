Thousands of Coromandel homes are warmer and drier

Scott Simpson MP is thrilled that thousands of people in the Coromandel are living in warmer, healthier homes now they’ve had insulation installed as part of two Government programmes.

“The insulation programmes Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart and Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes are helping to reduce health risks for many households in the Coromandel electorate,” Mr Simpson says.

“Warmer, drier homes are better for people’s health. And healthy people don’t end up spending time and money going to the doctor or taking days off sick.”

The 2013 Budget allocated $100 million over three years to Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes. The programme offers free ceiling and underfloor heating to 46,000 low-income households, particularly families with children and high health needs.

Scott Simpson MP says he would like to thank organisations in the Coromandel for their continuing support of the programme.

Background

Who is eligible for Warm Up New Zealand: Healthy Homes?

• The home owner or main tenant needs to have a Community Services Card and there must be children under 17 years, adults over 65 years or someone with high health needs living in your home.

• Landlords with eligible tenants will also qualify, although landlords may be asked to make a small contribution.

• You must live in a house built before the year 2000.

How do I apply for free insulation as part of the programme?
