Bill English stands by homeopathy statement

National Party Education spokesman Bill English says he stands by the comments he made in a statement yesterday about the Tertiary Education Commission’s Strategic Priorities Fund.

“At no stage did my statement, or my office, suggest that AUT was involved with the ‘homeopathy for pets course’ which I identified yesterday as being further evidence of a botched tertiary education strategy.”

Mr English says he is concerned that Labour has designated this course as one that should be funded from the Strategic Priorities Fund.

\"If the Government thinks this is a strategic priority then they clearly have their funding priorities all wrong."
