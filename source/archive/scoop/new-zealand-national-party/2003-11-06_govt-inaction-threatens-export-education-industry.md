Govt inaction threatens export education industry

The Chinese Government's demand for a list of approved private education insitutions here proves the Education Minister's "bridge-building" trip to Beijing was just a PR stunt, says National's Asian Relationships spokeswoman Pansy Wong.

The New Zealand Government's been asked to draw up a list of approved private education providers to meet growing concerns about the wellbeing of Chinese students.

"Trevor Mallard's trip was clearly nothing more than a waste of taxpayers' money," says Mrs Wong.

"No PR stunt can mask the real problem. The recent high profile failure of several education institutions has exposed the lack of robust monitoring and follow-up systems in the sector.

"It's not surprising the Chinese Government is now calling for firm assurances that students studying here will be looked after.

"Labour has failed to enforce its export education sectors Code of Pastoral Care," says Mrs Wong.

"The Code has fallen victim to inaction and, as a result, poor insitutions continue to burden the export education industry and New Zealand's economy.

"A recent report commissioned by Auckland City says that international students generate $930 million annually and have created 12,800 fulltime jobs in the region. "The Government must act quickly to establish a robust monitoring system for institutions that are signatories to the Code or we will lose more students," says Mrs Wong.
