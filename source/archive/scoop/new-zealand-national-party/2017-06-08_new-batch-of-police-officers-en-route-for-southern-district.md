New batch of police officers on their way for Southern District

Police have announced how new constabulary staff will be allocated throughout the Southern District over the next 12 months, says Sarah Dowie, MP for Invercargill.

“The National led-Government is investing $503 million as part of our Safer Communities package to provide new staff and associated policing services across the country.

“The Southern region will see a total increase of 37 staff over the next four years. The allocation decisions have been made by District Commanders, based on crime patterns and police demand across each region.

“This is just the first allocation as part of a four year process. This announcement of four new staff will start in the next twelve months.

“The District Commander will be accessing how these additional police staff boost the existing Police capacity and the impact on crime in the region. The Commander will then be able to make informed decisions about the additional 32 staff based on demand over the next three years.

“These new staff will have an additional focus on child protection, adult sexual assault and serious crime to make sure the real problems in our communities are directly tackled.

“This investment will make sure our children and communities are safe and get our most vulnerable the protection and support they need.

“The Government is focused on delivering a more responsive police service, prevent harm and victimisation, resolve more crimes and more effectively target crime in our community.

“The process of recruiting and training police officers doesn’t happen overnight but the first recruits will start police college next month and be on the beat in October.”
