Collins Comments: Alcohol Interlock sentence
============================================

**Column: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

I am pleased to see the introduction of mandatory Alcohol interlock sentences for serious and repeat drink-driving offenders.

Hon Judith Collins

MP for Papakura

Passchendaele Multi-Media Competition

As a strong supporter of our New Zealand war veterans and our ANZAC 100 commemorations, I encourage Year 13 students to take part in the 2016 Battle of Passchendaele Multi-Media Competition recently launched by Minister of Veterans’ Affairs Craig Foss.

This is a great opportunity for students to learn about the New Zealanders who served and sacrificed so much on the Western Front 99 years ago.

The winner will receive a $2000 education contribution and, along with the runner up, attend the Battle of Passchendaele centenary commemorations in Belgium in October 2017.

Both students will travel with the New Zealand Defence Force as part of a larger group of Youth Ambassadors selected by the NZDF, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Youth Development and the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services’ Association.  

Entries close on the 26th September.

[Under this new sentencing option anyone convicted of two or more drink-driving offences within five years, and any first time offenders caught driving more than 3.2 times the legal alcohol limit, will be subject to an alcohol interlock sentence.](http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail19.com/t/i-l-ktdihjl-jrhhlhjlu-r/)

An alcohol interlock is a breathalyser wired into a vehicle’s starting system. In order for the vehicle to start, the driver must pass a breath test.

By physically preventing an offender from drink-driving it ensures not only the safety of the driver but the safety of their passengers and other road users.

[Police to attend all break-ins](http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail19.com/t/i-l-ktdihjl-jrhhlhjlu-y/)

[I welcome the Police’s decision to attend all house break-ins, which came into effect yesterday.](http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail19.com/t/i-l-ktdihjl-jrhhlhjlu-y/)

[While burglary rates are still below that of recent years, there has been an increase over the past 12 months. The Police have responded by raising dwelling burglary from a volume crime to a priority offence, reinforcing their commitment to tackling burglary and sending a clear message to offenders.](http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail19.com/t/i-l-ktdihjl-jrhhlhjlu-y/)

[The new policy sets the expectation of full attendance at dwelling burglaries so the public can now expect either a constabulary or scene of crime officer to attend within a reasonable time.](http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail19.com/t/i-l-ktdihjl-jrhhlhjlu-y/)

[Given the nature of policing there will be occasions where they cannot attend a dwelling burglary for a range of reasons, including adhering to the wishes of the victim. However, the Commissioner of Police has made his expectations clear.](http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail19.com/t/i-l-ktdihjl-jrhhlhjlu-y/)

[The Police have assured me they continue to make burglary a priority with ongoing work in every district to reduce this crime type while also focusing on increasing resolution rates.](http://newzealandnationalparty.cmail19.com/t/i-l-ktdihjl-jrhhlhjlu-y/)
