Saddam Found, Parker Still Missing!
===================================

Brian Connell  
National Commerce Spokesperson

26 January 2004

Saddam found, Parker still missing!

\"Otago deserves better representation on the Project Aqua debate," warns Brian Connell, MP for Rakaia and Spokesman for Commerce. "They are being poorly represented by the 'Invisible Man' himself, David Parker."

"Project Aqua - if it goes ahead - is going to have a huge impact on the Otago and Canterbury regions. Where is the Otago MP when all this is happening? No one knows! Does he support it fully? No one knows!"

"Whenever there's a hint of controversy or that his constituents might argue with Labour policy, David goes to ground. Finding Saddam was child's play compared to locating David when he has to risk offending someone by taking a stand!"

"When the Resource Management (Waitaki Catchment) Amendment Bill was debated before Christmas, David was out of there faster than a long-tailed cat in a roomful of rocking chairs!

"At last week's Project Aqua meeting in Oamaru, Pete Hodgson and Marian Hobbs had the courage to front up and debate the issues. As for David - rumour says he was there but that he didn't dare say anything. Otago deserves an MP who will take a stand, defend it and represent Otago properly." "As for the Greens, I'm a little cynical about their sudden determination to protect Otago in David's absence. They couldn't even be bothered running a candidate there last election, so forgive me for thinking this is cheap political opportunism rather than a genuine concern for the area."

"I oppose Project Aqua myself and I'm pleased to see the Greens do too - although I suspect their reasoning is based less on commercial realities than on their normal hostility to commercial developments!"

"It's a sad day for Otago when the Greens have a better articulated policy than the local MP! David has to start listening to his constituents and carry their views to Parliament. Whether he supports Aqua or opposes it, he can't straddle the fence forever!"

Ends
