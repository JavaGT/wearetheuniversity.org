Industry Bill Window-Dressing For Damaging Policies

A new law introduced into Parliament today creating yet another government agency is just window dressing to cover over the economic destruction currently being caused by the Labour-Alliance policies, National's Industry Spokesperson John Luxton said today.

"After being given the strongest growing economy of any incoming government in New Zealand's history, this Government seeks to paint the appearance of being industry friendly.

"It's trying to cover-up the lack of vision in the policies it's announced to date.

"If Jim Anderton thinks that his new agency will create jobs, he must be dreaming.

"Almost every policy implemented by this Government has been about making it more difficult for business and it shows.

\* Today's unemployment figures have risen for the first time in 15 months now up to 6.4%. \* Canterbury Manufacturers' report lower confidence in their latest survey. \* Industry has been very concerned by the Government's policies that have increased taxes and are about to increase ACC costs. \* The Employment Relations Bill is scary to Industry. \* The West Coast decisions are having repercussions across New Zealand's furniture industry and on one of the few viable industries on the Coast.

"The Economic Development (INZ & ME Dev) Bill is surely only window dressing over what is beginning to look like a major destruction of NZ industry under the policies of this visionless Government."
