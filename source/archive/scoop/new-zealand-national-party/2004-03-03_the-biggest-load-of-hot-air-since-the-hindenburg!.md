The biggest load of hot air since the Hindenburg!

“The biggest load of hot air since the Hindenburg!”

“John Tamihere’s Timaru speech on business was the biggest load of hot air since the Hindenburg disaster,” according to Brian Connell, MP for Rakaia and National party Commerce Spokesman.

“He told the hard-working people of South Canterbury how well they’ve done - as if they didn’t already know - and claimed he understood their concerns about Labour’s high taxes and their growing red tape burden.”

“But did he offer to do anything about it? No, not one iota. This was yet another speakfest without one drop of value being derived from the exercise. It was less relevant than Tariaana Turia at a seminar on racial harmony!”

“My advice to Mr Tamihere is to get out of politics and start a business, then perhaps he’ll understand why he’s just made a fool of himself.”
