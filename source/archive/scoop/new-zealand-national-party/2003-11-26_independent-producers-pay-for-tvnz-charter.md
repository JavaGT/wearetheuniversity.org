Independent Producers Pay For TVNZ Charter

"The quality of Kiwi television is doomed to decline if TVNZ is allowed to push on with plans to raid NZ on Air coffers and squeeze out competition from independent producers," says National Party Broadcasting spokeswoman Georgina te Heuheu.

"Reports that TVNZ intends to go for the whole bag, $60 million worth of TV production funds, shows the true cost of the Government's much lauded Charter," Mrs te Heuheu says.

"The Charter was meant to deliver better and broader programming to the NZ viewing public, but without competition in the sector, it's as much of a pipe dream as the Charter itself.

"We can not turn back the clock, only competition in the sector can guarantee quality programmes.

"TVNZ already gets huge amounts of taxpayer cash and it receives the lion's share of NZ on Air funding," Mrs te Heuheu says.

"If it is allowed to take the lot, that would disadvantage not only the viewing public but it also has the potential to destroy New Zealand's vibrant independent production sector.

"Those independents are the very reason New Zealand's been able to stamp its mark on both the small and big screens around the globe.

"Those independent producers have put thousands of Kiwis into paid employment and they're creating new and innovative ways to make television.

"The Broadcasting Minister must resist the efforts by state-television to pull the rug out from under independent TV producers. The public deserves both quality and choice," Mrs te Heuheu says.
