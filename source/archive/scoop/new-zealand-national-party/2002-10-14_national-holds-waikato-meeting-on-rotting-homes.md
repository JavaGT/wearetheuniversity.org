National holds Waikato meeting on rotting homes crisis

Wayne Mapp - National Housing Spokesperson

The rotting homes crisis is affecting the Waikato more than previously realised, says National’s Housing spokesman Wayne Mapp, after speaking at a public meeting in Hamilton today.

35 people attended the meeting organised by National this afternoon. Wayne Mapp and Karapiro MP Lindsay Tisch spoke at the meeting, attended by home-owners and industry people.

“The problem in the Waikato is on a larger scale than even the local council would appreciate.

“The only way to get to the scale of the problem is to inspect every home built with monolithic cladding and untreated timber. Otherwise many people may not even realise their homes are at risk.

"There was widespread support from affected homeowners for compulsory arbitration as suggested by National through the proposed Weathertightness Tribunal. The Government’s plan isn’t binding, which means wrongdoers can avoid liability.

“National has also called for a test case to be heard in the Courts to determine liability principles,” said Dr Mapp.

This is the fifth public meeting now organised by National for concerned homeowners. Hundreds of people have already turned out to public meetings organised by National around the country in recent weeks.
