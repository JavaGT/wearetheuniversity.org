More Maori wagging school

More Maori wagging school

National Party Maori Affairs spokesman Tau Henare says figures showing a jump in the number of Maori students wagging school are unacceptable and must be addressed by the Labour-led Government.

Figures from the New Zealand Schools Attendance, Absence and Truancy report for 2006 show 7.1% of Maori females and 6.6% of Maori males are playing truant.

The figures have climbed since 2004 and now Maori have a truancy rate more than 4% higher than New Zealand European students.

“The Prime Minister promised in her speech to address truancy with new initiatives and resources, but for some Maori children it is too late,” Mr Henare says.

“Already this week we have heard that 53% of Maori boys and 45% of Maori girls are leaving school without Level 1 NCEA.

“The Labour Government is clearly failing Maori children and it is time Maori got more than lip-service from Ms Clark – they need action to ensure they get the best possible education.

“In the entire 35 minute speech from the Prime Minister yesterday the only specific mention of Maori was around the forestry industry - not addressing our appalling education statistics.

“Is it a plan of the Labour Government to have unqualified Maori drop-outs staffing the forestry industry?”
