Vigilance needed to prevent further spread of Mycoplasma
========================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

National Party Spokesperson for Biosecurity Barbara Kuriger is calling on farmers to be vigilant in light of recent Mycoplasma Bovis incursions to help prevent the spread of the disease.

“The discovery of Mycoplasma Bovis in Ashburton is a strong reminder to our rural communities that we need to be increasingly watchful and report concerns to the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) if there are any suspicions of a further spread of the disease,” Ms Kuriger says.

“We cannot be complacent in any rural areas. The recent confirmation in Ashburton follows cases last year in Hastings, North Otago and the Winton District.

“It is important that farmers are familiar with the symptoms of infected cattle, which tends to show when animals are under stress. The current drought conditions around the country have already put pressure on farmers and animals, so the symptoms may be more visible if the disease is present.”

To report any concerns about the Mycoplasma Bovis disease please contact the Ministry for Primary Industries on 0800 80 99 66.
