Smarten up compo for pylon properties

National Party Energy spokesman Gerry Brownlee says Transpower "needs to become more realistic about the cost of access" as it seeks to progress its pylon plan from the Waikato to Auckland.

"National takes the issue of security of electricity supply to Auckland very seriously indeed.

"The Electricity Commission has been set up by Labour to properly consider all the feasible options and we welcome the commitment to securing supply for our largest city.

"However, we are also of the view that Transpower needs to sharpen up its ideas on compensation for affected landowners and the cost of access."
