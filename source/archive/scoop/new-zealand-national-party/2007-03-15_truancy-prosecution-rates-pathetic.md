Truancy prosecution rates pathetic

Revelations that just 17 parents and guardians have been prosecuted in the past three years for letting their children truant highlight a weak education system that is failing our most at-risk school students, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

“This is a tiny number of prosecutions in the face of a tidal wave of truancy,” says Mrs Rich.

The Ministry’s own survey last year found 45,000 secondary school students playing truant in one given week – that is 20% of all secondary students in New Zealand. The survey found truancy had increased 16% in the past two years.

“The figures broken down by ethnicity are also disturbing,” says Mrs Rich.

“The 2006 New Zealand Schools Attendance, Absence and Truancy report also shows 7.1% of Maori females and 6.6% of Maori males were last year absent without justification.

“This is an alarming rise and the figures are a disgrace. Truancy is quickly becoming Labour’s education legacy.

“The number of prosecutions is pathetic compared to the high rate of truancy.

“Prosecutions and fines are a clear way to send a message within the present laws. We need to support truancy officers. They need more tools in their toolbox and a Government that will back them.

“Labour has largely turned a blind eye to this rising problem. It's only answer was to restructure the service which caused disarray and distraction from the core task of getting truants back in the classroom.

“It's this basic - kids won't learn if they aren't there.

“Getting those kids back into a learning environment should be a national priority.”
