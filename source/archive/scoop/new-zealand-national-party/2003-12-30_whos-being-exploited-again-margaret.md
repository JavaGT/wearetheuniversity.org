Who's being exploited again Margaret?

Who's being exploited again Margaret?

"Labour Minister Margaret Wilson must really put up some facts to back her argument for controversial changes to employment law," says National Party Deputy Finance spokesman John Key.

"It has now been revealed that Margaret Wilson was asked by the Labour appointed Small Business Advisory Group, to provide examples of worker exploitation during the sale or transfer of an existing business - she couldn't.

Papers released under the Official Information Act show the group in its first official capacity on October 23rd, told the Minister that in their vast experience they had never seen examples of exploitation in this area.

"With all the arrogance of the same Minister that rammed through the Supreme Court against the will of most New Zealanders, Margaret Wilson has been unable to give details about who, where and how the alleged exploitation of employees was occurring.

"All the Minister could tell the group was that she knew of its existence and at some later date in future she would share her knowledge with them," says Mr Key.

"I find it amazing that this Minister, a former academic who has never had a small business, is so much better informed than the group of experts that the Government itself has selected to provide advice.

"This overwhelming arrogance only serves to further erode the credibility of John Tamihere's statement on December 4 that the Small Business Advisory Group is a 'powerful' voice for small businesses that is 'being listened to'.

"The Government has already given up on its objective to return New Zealand to the top half of the OECD in a decade.

"But when policies are being made based on suspicion, innuendo and assumption, it's little wonder economic growth is falling by the wayside," says Mr Key.
