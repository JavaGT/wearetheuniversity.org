Thousands spent on covering up rotting homes

The Government’s building industry regulator Building Industry Authority has spent $65,000 in six months trying to cover up the rotting homes crisis, National Housing Spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp revealed today.

In responses to questions from National, Internal Affairs Minister George Hawkins says the Building Industry Authority spent $64,495 on communications, public relations and media advice between May and November this year.

  
“This shows the BIA has spent a large amount of time trying to cover up the rotting homes crisis and not enough time making any attempt to solve it.  
“The public have not been fooled by this $65,000 PR exercise. Owners of rotting homes are angry that the Minister and the BIA have been so dismissive about this issue.

  
“What homeowners want is solutions, not the butt covering that we are seeing.

“The BIA is yet to pick up either of the second two points in National’s strategy to solve the crisis - that is the inspection of all homes built since 1996 and to change the Building Code to ensure that the crisis doesn’t affect any more homes.  
“The Government has turned a blind eye to this disaster, been flat-footed since it realised its mistake, and is still not providing any solutions to homeowners affected today and those wanting to build homes in future,” Dr Mapp said.
