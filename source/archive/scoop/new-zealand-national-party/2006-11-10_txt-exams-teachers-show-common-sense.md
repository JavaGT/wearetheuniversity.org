TXT exams: teachers show common sense

  
National Party Education spokesman Bill English has welcomed reports from around the country that teachers are taking a hard line against text language in NCEA exams.

He says students need clear rules about what’s acceptable and what’s not.

“NZQA and Education Minister Steve Maharey were out of line with the convoluted rationale that some text language might be ‘appropriate’ if the meaning was clear.

“Teachers who deal with low standards of literacy every day know that students will take the easy option if they can.

“The Government's statements on text language have been an invitation to students to forget what they have been taught because anything goes.

“Fortunately, the common sense of teachers in the real world has won out over the madness of bureaucrats,” says Mr English.
