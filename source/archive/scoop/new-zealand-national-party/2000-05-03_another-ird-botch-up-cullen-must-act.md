Another IRD Botch Up - Cullen Must Act
======================================

**Wednesday, 3 May 2000, 4:21 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Hundreds of thousands of taxpayers are in for another shock courtesy of another IRD mistake - this time on IR3 tax forms, Opposition Revenue spokesperson Annabel Young said today.

"IRD has admitted it has made a botch up with the instructions to people working out their ACC bill on the IR3 tax forms.

"IRD has used the wrong figures to help people work out their ACC and that means some taxpayers could end up calculating frighteningly large ACC bills.

"And all the IRD is doing about it is saying sorry.

"IRD needs to do more to help rebuild its credibility.

"Revenue Minister Michael Cullen must take more responsibility for his Department's problems. He needs to ensure the Department takes more action to make certain taxpayers know about the mistake.

"If the IRD wants people to have confidence in what it is doing it must either reprint the forms, or at least send a letter fixing the mistakes to every taxpayer concerned.

"The Minister can't sit back and watch - he must make certain the IRD does something more to inform people about the mistakes."
