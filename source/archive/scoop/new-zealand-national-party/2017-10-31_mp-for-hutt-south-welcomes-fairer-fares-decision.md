Media statement

**MP for Hutt South Welcomes Fairer Fares Decision**

Today the Greater Wellington Regional Council voted in favour of introducing a tertiary students’ discount on public transport across the Wellington region, to take effect from the middle of 2018.

“This is great news for young people in the Hutt and across Wellington” Mr Bishop said.

“I’ve been supporting the Fairer Fares campaign because young people in the Hutt told me the cost of transport to and from campuses was a real barrier to their success”

“For some students, the cost of transport could be over $20 a day if they lived in parts of the Hutt Valley or Wainuiomata and travelled to one of the Victoria, Massey or WelTec campuses in central Wellington. That represents a huge chunk of a student’s weekly living costs, allowance or wages from part time work”

“Wellington was one of the only places in the country not to offer a tertiary students discount, so it is about time our region got on board.”

“The decision today is the result of a sustained campaign by local students’ associations including VUWSA and MAWSA. They have worked for many years alongside elected regional councillors to deliver this for local students.”

“I am proud to have lent my support to this cause over the time I’ve been an MP based in the Hutt Valley.”

“I want to say congratulations to everyone involved in this campaign, and thanks to each of councillors who voted in favour at today’s meeting.”
