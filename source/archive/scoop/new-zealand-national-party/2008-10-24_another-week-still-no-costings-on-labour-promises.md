Another week: still no costings on Labour promises

National Party Finance Spokesman

**Another week – still no costings on Labour promises**

National Party Finance spokesman Bill English says another week has passed and Labour still hasn’t supplied a set of costings for all the promises it has made since it delivered a set of books showing a decade of deficits.

“Labour has made hundreds of millions of dollars of promises since the pre-election opening the books. Helen Clark has offered no advice about the impact of that spending on the government accounts.

“It is simply unacceptable for Labour to say there will be a mini-Budget after the election. They have known about the state of the books for weeks longer than National.

“They are either incapable of producing reliable figures, or they are being deceptive. New Zealanders deserve to know what Helen Clark’s promises will do to the debt and deficit tracks.”

Mr English has released a list of 29 promises\*\* that Labour has made since the PREFU. Many are uncosted, or the costings are unclear.

“Labour challenged National to say how it would fund its programme for economic growth. We have done just that. We have made some choices as we are committed to getting New Zealand out of deficits and on to an earlier growth path.

“Our opponents are offering uncosted promises in the hope they can deliver the bad news after the election.

“It’s time for Labour to produce some idea of how all these promises are going to be paid for or which ones they’re going to withdraw.”
