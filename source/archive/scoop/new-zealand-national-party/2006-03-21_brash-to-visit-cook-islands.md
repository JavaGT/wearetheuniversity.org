Brash to visit Cook Islands

National Party Leader Don Brash will make a short visit to the Cook Islands later this week.

Dr Brash, accompanied by National MPs Murray McCully and John Hayes, will be in the Cook Islands from Thursday to Saturday.

During that time they will call on Cook Islands Prime Minister Jim Marurai, deputy Prime Minister Dr Terepai Maoate and the Leader of the Opposition Sir Geoffrey Henry.

As well as meeting members of the Government, Dr Brash will visit the University of the South Pacific branch in Rarotonga, a local college, and NZAid-funded projects.

Dr Brash will also meet Cook Islands Chamber of Commerce members.

\"National is keen to extend and improve relations with Pacific communities and this visit will further that aim," says Dr Brash. "I am also interested in visiting other Pacific communities to further develop relations."
