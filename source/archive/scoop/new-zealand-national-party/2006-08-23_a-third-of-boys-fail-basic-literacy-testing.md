A third of boys fail basic literacy testing

A third of boys fail basic literacy testing

Almost a third of boys leaving the school system do not have the option of further skills training because their literacy skills are so poor, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

Mr English has today released an analysis of pass rates for NCEA level one literacy and numeracy standards, broken down by both sex and decile.

Across all schools, 31% of boys failed level 1 literacy credits.

"Too many teenagers - both boys and girls - are not even making it to the starting blocks in the race for tertiary education or skills training," says Mr English.

Increasingly, tertiary providers regard level 1 literacy credits as the minimum prerequisite for entry to pre-apprenticeship courses.

Mr English says the figures can't be used to judge whether a school is effective because no one knows what level the students were at when they arrived at secondary school.

"Individual schools' records show that significant numbers of students arrive at secondary school well below the expected level of competency in literacy, but there is no national picture.

"Until there is, the Government cannot take systematic action to solve the literacy problem.

"National would require schools to report progress of their students towards national literacy and numeracy standards."
