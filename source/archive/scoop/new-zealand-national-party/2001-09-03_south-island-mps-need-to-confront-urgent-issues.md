South Island MPs Need To Confront Urgent Issues
===============================================

**Monday, 3 September 2001, 1:56 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The threat of industrial action closing down Princess Margaret Hospital in Christchurch must spur South Island MPs into action, National MP David Carter said today.

"I have invited 29 South Island-based MPs to a meeting in Wellington on Wednesday to discuss several urgent issues, including this major one concerning Canterbury health workers.

"Possible strike action by these health workers will have serious repercussions for frail elderly patients in Canterbury.

"The South Island has quite different issues to deal with than the North Island because of its land mass and population. We need a strong, united voice to make sure the South Island is not disadvantaged by Government decisions, such as the population-based health funding proposals being advanced by Treasury.

"South Island health issues are a cross-party matter that needs to be tackled together.

"I am anticipating a good turnout of MPs at the 'South Island' meeting on Wednesday," David Carter said.
