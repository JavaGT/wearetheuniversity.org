National Party List MP Based in Wellington Central  
Media Statement

Local student selected as Youth MP

Paul Foster-Bell MP congratulates Summer O’Dywer of Samuel Marsden Collegiate on her selection as his Youth MP.

Summer is a Year 12 student and winner of her school’s prestigious Helen Davidson Scholarship for 2015. Summer studies sciences, languages, photography and advanced calculus.

As part of the Young Enterprise scheme, Summer is CEO of a student team developing a “Just Ask” app to provide tips to help other students who struggle with study.

“It was this sort of outward thinking about other students as well as work ethic and commitment that mark out Summer as having the right skills to be a Youth MP,” Mr Foster-Bell said.

“Summer will work for the youth of Wellington and to make our city a better place during her tenure as my Youth MP.”

Summer said she has two goals as a Youth MP. “I want to connect students to politics and educate them on how important voting and engaging is for our country,” Summer said.

“I’ll also work to have Wellington students’ issues heard in our Parliament so that we can start to make change where it’s needed.”

Before the Youth Parliament next July Summer plans to engage with as many students as possible by going around schools and running after-school workshops to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to get their views across.
