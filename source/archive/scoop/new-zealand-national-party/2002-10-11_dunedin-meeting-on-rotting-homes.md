Dunedin meeting on rotting homes

Wayne Mapp - National Housing Spokesperson

National is holding a public meeting on the rotting homes crisis in Dunedin on Monday.

National Housing Spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp said Otago people had contacted National’s website and MPs’ with concerns over rotting homes and worries about their loss of equity.

“While leaky buildings have been perceived as an Auckland problem they are a problem in Dunedin and wider Otago. People are heartbroken at what they’ve discovered about their home,” he said.

Building surveyor and leaky building investigator Theo Marlow, and barrister Adrian More who specialises in civil litigation will address the meeting. The public will have the opportunity to raise issues and ask questions.

“Those affected need to get together, find some answers and have input into the best way to deal with these problems and how to prevent this continuing to happen,” Dr Mapp said.

National sought for the second time this week an amendment to the Construction Contracts Bill, so that a Weathertightness Tribunal could be established to identify liability for homeowners. The Government did not support the proposal.

Dr Mapp said National had proposed straightforward solutions to leaky homes syndrome. “We are determined to find the answers for people affected now and others building in the future,” he said.

Monday’s meeting is at 12.30pm at the Federated Farmers meeting room, Harvest Court, 218 George St, (next to McDonald’s), Dunedin.
