New mental health facility for Christchurch

National List MP Nuk Korako has welcomed today’s announcement that Canterbury is to receive a $47 – $57 million new purpose built specialist mental health facility.

Mr Korako accompanied Health Minister Dr Jonathan Coleman and Prime Minister Bill English as they visited the Christchurch Hospital to make the announcement today.

“Mental health is one of our most challenging social issues and it affects a large number of New Zealanders. In Canterbury, demand for mental health services has increased significantly since the earthquakes and the long-term impact of those quakes are still being felt.

“We know how important it is for services to be moved from The Princess Margaret Hospital, so I was thrilled to read in the indicative business plan, released today, that a new mental health facility could be built within three years.

“This announcement represents a significant step forward and shows the Government’s ongoing commitment to Canterbury’s recovery.”

The Government invested $224 million into mental health at Budget 2017. This includes $100 million which is being invested into 17 new initiatives which signal a move towards a great focus on prevention and earlier intervention, as well as building resilience.

This investment through Budget 2017 builds on the $1.4 billion spent on mental health and addiction services in the last year.
