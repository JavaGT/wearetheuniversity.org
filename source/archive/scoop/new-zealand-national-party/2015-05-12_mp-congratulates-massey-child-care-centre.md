MP congratulates Tui Hoiho, Massey Child Care Centre on becoming a finalist for the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards

National MP Jono Naylor has congratulated Tui Hoiho, Kea and Kiwi Sections, Massey Child Care Centre on becoming a finalist in the Excellence in Leading category of the Prime Minister’s Education Excellence Awards.

“Early Childhood Education is an important development tool and the work that Tui Hoihi has done in this area has helped many children with their education going forward” Jono Naylor said.

“This work cannot be under estimated.

“It is fantastic to see a Palmerston North Child Care Centre recognised for their work in this way.

“These awards provide an opportunity for us to publicly recognise and celebrate the achievements on the education sector in New Zealand.

“Tui Hoiho has showcased a level of exceptional education practice which is why Tui Hoiho is a finalist. This is a great achievement.

“We know that when a child gets access to good quality early childhood education it helps that child throughout their schooling and beyond.

The winners of the four categories will each receive a professional development opportunity.
