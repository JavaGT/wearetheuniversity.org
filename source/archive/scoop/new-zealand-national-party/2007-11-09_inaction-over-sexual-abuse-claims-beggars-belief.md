Inaction over sexual abuse claims beggars belief

**Inaction over sexual abuse claims beggars belief**

National’s Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich says Education Minister Chris Carter needs to explain his inaction over sexual abuse allegations at Hato Paora College.

“The Ministry of Education has admitted it knew about allegations of sex crimes at the college involving the school’s principal, but did not instruct the school to contact police.

“It is incumbent on Chris Carter to explain to parents why his officials didn’t recommend that the school’s board take their complaints to the police.

“Parents up and down the country will be horrified to know that the Ministry of Education did not advise or instruct the board of the Feliding school to take their complaints directly to the relevant authorities.

“While the board’s decision to opt for an internal inquiry is questionable, it beggars belief that the Ministry of Education did not strongly recommend that investigations of such a serious nature be dealt with by the police.

“The police have the knowledge, experience, and statutory responsibility to deal with such complaints.

“Mr Carter needs to urgently explain why his Ministry took the course it did.”
