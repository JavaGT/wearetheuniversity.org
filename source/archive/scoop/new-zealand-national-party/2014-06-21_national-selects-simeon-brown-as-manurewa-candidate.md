National selects Simeon Brown as Manurewa candidate

The National Party has announced that Simeon Brown will be its candidate for the Manurewa electorate at the 2014 General Election.

Mr Brown was selected at a meeting of local party members tonight.

“I know Simeon will devote himself to championing National’s plan for more jobs, better public services in health and education, and safer communities,” said Northern Regional Chair Andrew Hunt.

“I would also like to thank Dr Cam Calder for his dedication to Manurewa as a list MP in the area over the past six years.”

Mr Brown said he was honoured to be chosen and would be running a strong campaign.

“John Key’s National-led Government has been working for Manurewa’s families after years of neglect by Labour.”

“We’re building a stronger economy that supports higher incomes and delivers extra support for our communities in a way that is effective and affordable. I’m looking forward to being Manurewa’s strong local voice for National at the election.”

Simeon Brown - Biographical Notes

A proud Manurewa resident, Simeon moved to the area in 2003 after spending his formative years in the Bay of Plenty.

Since completing his secondary education at Manurewa High School, Simeon has been studying at Auckland University towards a conjoint Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Law (Honours), majoring in Management and Public Law.

Simeon currently serves as Deputy Chair of the Manurewa Local Board, having been appointed to fill a vacancy before winning election in his own right at the 2013 local elections.

In addition to his current role, Simeon held various positions in the Clendon Residents Group and founded the Friends of the Waterfront Group after major fires destroyed much of the foreshore parklands surrounding Clendon in early 2013. He was also the inaugural Chair of the Manurewa Youth Council, ensuring that the voice of young people was heard strongly in the Unitary Plan debate in Auckland.

Outside of his community involvements, Simeon is an avid musician and boater.
