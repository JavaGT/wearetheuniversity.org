National's list promotes strength and diversity

The National Party's 2008 list promotes strength and diversity, says Judy Kirk, National Party President.

Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga (Maungakiekie) has been ranked at number 35, Hekia Parata (Mana) at 36, Melissa Lee (list) at number 37, Kanwal Bakshi (Manukau East) at 38 and Paul Quinn (Hutt South) at number 48.

\"The diversity and individual strengths of the candidates is outstanding. It is a list that truly blends experience with new talent."

The Party has 17 women in the top 60 and all National's returning MPs have been ranked on the list in the top 50.

"We've had a strong caucus over the last parliamentary term, all of whom have worked very hard. By placing them all in the top 50 we are presenting a united and experienced team who are now able to get on with job of campaigning hard for the party vote."

Youth is represented through Aaron Gilmore (Christchurch East) and Nikki Kaye (Auckland Central) ranked at 56 and 57 respectively.

Provincial New Zealand is also well represented with new talent. Simon Bridges (Tauranga) is ranked at number 51, Amy Adams (Selwyn) 52, Louise Upston (Taupo) 53, Todd McClay (Rotorua) at 54 and Tim Macindoe (Hamilton West) at 55. All are expected to campaign strongly to win their seats.

National's Campaign Chair Steven Joyce (list) is the highest ranked new candidate, at number 16 on the list.

Judy Kirk says this is the strongest list the National Party has put together for some time.
