National’s Shadow Cabinet revealed

National Party Leader John Key has announced a reshuffled portfolio lineup that will form the foundation of National’s team heading into the next election.

A highlight of the reshuffle is the replacement of the front bench group with a Shadow Cabinet that comprises the first 16 portfolio holders.

“We think it’s a Shadow Cabinet that can earn the respect of New Zealanders,” says Mr Key. “In the run-up to the next election, the Shadow Cabinet will lead National’s work in developing and refining its policies.”

Bill English has been elevated to the Deputy Leadership and the Finance portfolio. Katherine Rich will take over Education portfolio and move up one spot to No 8.

“Katherine has real ability and this move allows her to take on the challenge of tackling a major portfolio,” says Mr Key.

Gerry Brownlee will have a number of responsibilities including being Shadow Leader of the House and chairing National’s Strategy Committee. He also gets responsibility for Energy, State Owned Enterprises and State Services.

Simon Power is promoted from No 7 to No 4 and gets Justice and Commerce. He retains Corrections. Judith Collins and Tony Ryall retain their existing portfolios, and Mrs Collins moves up one spot.

Georgina te Heuheu and Tau Henare take joint responsibility for the Maori Affairs portfolio. Mrs te Heuheu will become Maori Affairs (Culture & Development) spokeswoman while Mr Henare becomes the Maori Affairs (Education & TPK) spokesman.

“Georgina and Tau will work in concert, playing to their respective strengths as they hold the Government to account and deepen and broaden National’s relationship with Maori,” says Mr Key.

Other features of the reshuffle include the elevation of Maurice Williamson from No 13 to No 9 while retaining his current portfolios.

Wayne Mapp gets the Defence and Auckland Issues portfolios, Chris Finlayson retains Attorney-General and has a change of title to the Treaty Negotiations spokesman. He also gets Arts, Culture and Heritage.

Tim Groser takes the Trade and Associate Finance portfolios, and Anne Tolley becomes Chief Whip with Nathan Guy taking the Junior Whip role.

As well as Mr Guy, other MPs from the large 2005 intake are given more responsibilities. Chester Borrows, a former police officer, takes over as Police spokesman, while Jackie Blue takes the reinstated Women’s Affairs portfolio.

Jonathan Coleman gets the Broadcasting portfolio, Kate Wilkinson becomes Labour & Industrial Relations spokeswoman. Pansy Wong takes the ACC portfolio, and also becomes Ethnic Affairs spokeswoman. Paul Hutchison gets the Tertiary Education portfolio.

“I believe this is a strong line-up that reflects the depth and diversity of talent in our Caucus,” says Mr Key.

“I am sure the team will take the fight to the Labour Government, as well as provide the policies New Zealanders will want to support.”
