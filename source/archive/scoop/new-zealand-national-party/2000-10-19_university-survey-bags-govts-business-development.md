University Survey Bags Government’s Approach To Business Development

“The Government’s credentials with the business community have been dealt another blow following a new Waikato University survey of businesses,” National Economic Development spokesperson Max Bradford said today.

“The Waikato University survey from across New Zealand contains hugely embarrassing findings for the Government.

“A resounding 92% of the region and nationwide businesses surveyed say they don’t understand Labour’s policies for small and medium enterprises, if there is any.

“The same survey shows a low level of satisfaction with government policies affecting business, especially the Employment Relations Act, reducing compliance costs, Government listening to business, regional development matters and the Peoples Bank. They’re also unhappy with the Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy.

“There’s a real lack of confidence about Jim Anderton’s regional policies. The survey concludes that ‘the Government does not appear competent in determining regional economic impacts of significant policies matters…the lack of developed regional economic modelling will potentially prove costly…and ‘regional level consultation is not occurring’.

“89% of Bay of Plenty businesses think the Government is not listening to business, and almost 60% of Waikato businesses have the same view.

“Just days away from its business forum and the Government is getting a fresh message that it has alienated business.

“The uncertainty, confusion and despondency the Government has created is deep seated across the country. It’ll take more than a talk-fest in a secret enclave with a few businesses to turn that around,” Mr Bradford said.
