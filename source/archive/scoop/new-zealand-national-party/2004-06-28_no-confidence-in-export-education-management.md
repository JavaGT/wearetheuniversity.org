No confidence in export education management

No confidence in export education management

A proposal by school principals to establish a quality mark to improve the reputation of New Zealand schools overseas is more evidence of the lack of confidence in the Government's ability to restore the credibility of the export education industry, says National MP Pansy Wong.

The Secondary Principals' Association is considering establishing 'Spanz International' as a quality mark in response to the slowdown in the number of enrolments of foreign fee-paying students.

The Association of Private Providers of English Language has criticised the New Zealand Qualifications Authority and the Ministry of Education, as regulators of the industry, for 'a complete failure' to check up on some private providers.

It was commenting on the Education (Export Education Levy) Amendment Bill which passed its select committee stages last week. The association said quality institutions had no way of managing risks if some businesses closed down, since control entry and quality assurance was managed by the NZQA and the Ministry.

Mrs Wong says: \"Trevor Mallard 's announcement of a $40 million package over the next four years to woo back international students is obviously cosmetic and has not inspired the confidence of those working in the industry."

"The Minister should order an inquiry into the role of the NZQA and the Ministry of Education to restore confidence in the industry, instead of blaming those of us who comment on the continuing problems," she says.
