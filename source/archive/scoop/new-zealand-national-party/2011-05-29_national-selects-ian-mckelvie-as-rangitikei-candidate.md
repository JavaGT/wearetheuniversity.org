National Selects Ian McKelvie as Rangitikei Candidate

National Party Rangitikei Electorate Chair Bruce Mills is pleased to announce Ian McKelvie will be the Party’s Rangitikei candidate for the General Election on 26 November.

“We had excellent candidates putting their names forward. They demonstrate the real enthusiasm and determination within the National Party as it gets closer to the election. I want to thank everyone who has taken part in the process.”

Newly selected Rangitikei candidate Ian McKelvie says he is looking forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege to represent the electorate in Parliament.

“This electorate’s had fantastic representation through Simon Power. He’s established a fine reputation as a hard worker and someone who gets things done. We all wish him success and happiness for the future.

“I will devote all my energy to making sure Rangitikei keeps its strong voice in John Key’s Government, because our community and our country needs the growth, the jobs, and the plan that this Government is delivering.

“The sense I get from our community is that they understand the importance of living within our means, and building the critical infrastructure that future proofs New Zealand and our region.

“As we emerge from the recession, and the earthquakes that have hit Canterbury, it has become even more important for our Government to control debt so that we have more choices in the future. We can’t leave young Kiwis picking up pieces from rash promises made in 2011.
