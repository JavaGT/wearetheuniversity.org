Report a step in the right direction

Barriers to active transport in Palmerston North report a step in the right direction says Jono Naylor.

The recently released Barriers to active transport in Palmerston North report is a step in the right direction to help locals use alternative modes of transport says Jono Naylor, National List MP based in Palmerston North.

“The government has made some key investments in cycling recently in Palmerston North including the Longburn Cycle track and developing the Manawatu River cycle track” says Naylor.

“These cycle tracks allow people to use them recreationally but also provide a safe mode of transport to get into the city centre.

“We need to promote active transport as it is environmentally friendly, reduces congestion and keeps people active and healthy.

“City leaders, the government and community groups all need to take responsibility for developing the right infrastructure.

“This report highlights barriers to active transport. Some we can’t change such as the weather but others such as infrastructure and cultural shifts can be looked at by the council and city leaders.

“I look forward to seeing what comes out of the public forum and working with locals to increase active transport in Palmerston North.
