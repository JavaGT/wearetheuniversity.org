Brash backs DIY builders

National Party Leader Don Brash today announced that National will repeal provisions in Labour's new building legislation that stop New Zealanders from carrying out DIY renovations on their own homes.

The Building Act 2004 will require that all significant building work must be carried out or supervised by a licensed building practitioner. When the owner of a building obtains a building consent, they must notify the local council of the building practitioner who will supervise or do the work.a

"This is unnecessary red tape which strikes at the heart of Kiwi ingenuity and self-reliance. Generations of New Zealanders have built and renovated their homes to get ahead in life," says Dr Brash.

He made the announcement at the home of Lynda Forscutt, a sole parent building her own home with the help of Habitat for Humanity.

"There is no evidence that the leaky home problem was caused by DIY builders. The Government's claim in Parliament that DIY building work is 'shonky' is a gross generalisation and an insult to the thousands of Kiwis who have built and renovated their homes," says Dr Brash.

"Under National, DIY builders will still be required to get a building consent and have their work certified as complying with the building code, as was the case prior to the implementation of the Building Act.

"National believes in independence and home ownership. We want people to have the freedom to build and improve their own homes without being bogged down by bureaucracy."
