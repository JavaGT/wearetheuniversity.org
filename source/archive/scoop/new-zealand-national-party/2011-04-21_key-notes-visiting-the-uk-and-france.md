**VISITING THE UK AND FRANCE**

I hope you have a happy and safe Easter and Anzac weekend with your family.

This week I left for [my visit to the United Kingdom and France](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15314.link) so I'll be in London on Anzac Day for commemorations at Hyde Park.

Anzac Day is a day to pay tribute to all our servicemen and women, both living and gone. I'm always impressed by the number of Kiwis who attend dawn services and other Anzac commemorations throughout New Zealand and the world. It's a great chance for us to come together as New Zealanders and remember our Anzac heroes.

A few of my other activities overseas include meeting Her Majesty the Queen for lunch, and meeting British Prime Minister David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.

My wife Bronagh and I will also attend the wedding of His Royal Highness Prince William and Catherine Middleton next week. We're looking forward to it.

This week I announced New Zealand's wedding gift to the couple. [We're donating $10,000 to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, which is one of their nominated charities](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15315.link).

**REMEMBERING WEST COAST MINERS**

The Government is [contributing $3.5 million to The West Coast Miners Memorial Events Centre in Greymouth](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15316.link).

This centre will be a memorial for all those who have lost their lives in West Coast mining disasters, including the 29 men who died in the Pike River tragedy last year.

The project was proposed by the West Coast community, and the Government is pleased to contribute to this enduring memorial to West Coast miners.

**STANDING ALONGSIDE CANTABRIANS**

I'd like to thank everyone who is working hard to help Canterbury get back on its feet. In my visits to the region, I've been encouraged by how well people down there are coping despite the continuing aftershocks.

This week [I announced extra funding for Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15317.link) because the tourism sector has been severely affected by the earthquake.

The Ministry of Economic Development, Christchurch City Council, and Christchurch International Airport will together support Christchurch and Canterbury Tourism with an extra $1.6 million.

Christchurch is the gateway for South Island tourism. This boost to funding will help rebuild existing tourism and travel activity.

I'm looking forward to visiting Christchurch again shortly after I return from overseas. The Government is 100 per cent committed to supporting Cantabrians in the weeks, months, and years ahead. For further information on the Government's response, see [www.cera.govt.nz](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15318.link).

Thank you to everyone who has made a donation to the official Government earthquake appeal at [www.quakeappeal.com](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15319.link).

**PUTTING VICTIMS FIRST**

Yesterday Justice Minister Simon Power announced [further measures to enhance the rights and services provided to victims of crime](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15320.link). The measures include: allowing victims to say more in their victim impact statements, improving the victim notification system, developing a Victims Code, and setting up a Victims Centre within the Ministry of Justice.

I want to eliminate the horror stories where victims are forced to relive a traumatic event simply because the system has been deficient or has let them down, and where it seems offenders are getting a better deal than victims. Where there is a balancing of rights to be done between criminals and victims, I will take a side. I will take the side of the victims.

This package of proposals builds on eight initiatives we put in place for victims last year, which are [funded through the $50 Offender Levy](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15321.link), and the introduction of [on-the-spot police safety orders](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15322.link).

**DELIVERING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE**

Last week Social Development Minister Paula Bennett announced that [10,000 young people have taken part in the Job Ops programme so far](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15323.link), including more than 3500 young Maori and Pacific people.

National's Jobs Ops programme provides employers with a $5000 subsidy to create a position for an unskilled 16- to 24-year-old. I first announced the programme in 2009 and we expanded it last year, so that more young people could take part and get work experience.

Of the more than 4500 young people who have completed their Job Ops programme, more than 70 per cent got a job, and 90 per cent aren't on a benefit.

Best wishes,

**John Key  
Prime Minister**
