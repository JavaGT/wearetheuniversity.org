E-Government Is All E-Spin
==========================

**Thursday, 26 April 2001, 3:32 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The Government's e-strategy announced today is full of e-spin with over seventy exemptions for government departments, says National's Commerce spokesman Tony Ryall.

"The Prime Minister's announcement talks about making Government 'convenient and easy for people to deal with', '\[picking\] up the whole of the public sector' and 'directly reduce business compliance costs'.

"Yet, the Government's Electronic Transactions Bill (currently before a select committee) provides for at least 71 exemptions for government departments. Numerous departments won't have to accept electronic communications.

"The Government wants e-Government but is providing exemptions for: Conservation Act, Citizenship Act, Fisheries Act, Health Act, Hire Purchase Act, Civil Aviation Act, the Courts, Quota Appeal Authorities, Land Valuation Tribunals, Waitangi Tribunal, Student Allowances Appeal Authority....the list goes on.

"If the Government was serious then it would oblige all departments and agencies to accept electronic communications. Their current strategy is wanting and the Government appears insincere," Mr Ryall said.
