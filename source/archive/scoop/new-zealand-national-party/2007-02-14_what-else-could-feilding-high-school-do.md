What else could Feilding High School do?

What else could Feilding High School do?

Rather than condemn Feilding High School, Education Minister Steve Maharey should offer schools some alternative to solving the issue of recovering unpaid compulsory fees, says National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.

Feilding High School refused entry to 70 students at the start of the year because their parents had outstanding fees from earlier years.

"The Minister is correct when he says a child's right to an education shouldn't be used as a bargaining tool between schools and parents, but what other choice did Feilding High School have?

"Exactly what strategies would the Minister advise schools to use when dealing with parents who refuse to pay their share of compulsory fees?

"There is no place for humiliating and singling out students on this issue, but parents at Feilding High School had ignored at least four accounts and, frankly, should have paid the bill or phoned the school to make alternative arrangements.

"If the Minister doesn't want students used as 'footballs' perhaps he could suggest some other way for schools to recoup fees."
