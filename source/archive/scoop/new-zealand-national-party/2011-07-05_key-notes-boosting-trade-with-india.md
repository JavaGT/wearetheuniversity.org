**BOOSTING TRADE WITH INDIA**

On Friday I got back from a five-day visit to India.

In New Delhi I met Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh to [build stronger ties between our two countries](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16234.link).

Two-way trade between our countries is already worth more than $1 billion a year and we want to boost that further. Finalising a Free Trade Agreement with India was always going to be a complex process. But being on the ground has made me more confident than ever that we're making good progress towards the conclusion of the deal, scheduled for early next year.

I also visited Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium, to play a bit of cricket with Stephen Fleming and announce some [new sports scholarships](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16235.link). And I enjoyed a quick visit to the impressive Taj Mahal with my wife Bronagh.

In Mumbai I went to Film City where the Bollywood movie _Players_ is being filmed. It's one of many Bollywood films which have been partly produced in New Zealand. Prime Minister Singh and I signed [an agreement that makes film co-production easier](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16236.link). As Tourism Minister I appreciate the immense value of having New Zealand scenery on show in films with such a huge audience.

I also got the chance to pay my respects to victims of the 2008 Mumbai Terrorist Attacks at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.

**UNCLOGGING THE GROWTH ARTERIES**

Yesterday I [launched the second National Infrastructure Plan](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16238.link) with Bill English and Steven Joyce.

Since we came into government, we've been working hard to improve this country's productive infrastructure because we know it's a driver of economic growth.

The plan shows the Government will spend more than $17 billion over four years on assets such as schools, hospitals, state houses, prisons, roads, broadband, and rail. This will help support jobs and build the foundations for economic growth.

**BETTER BROADBAND**

Last week the [roll out of fast broadband to our rural communities got underway](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16240.link). On Thursday the first three rural schools connected to ultra-fast fibre - Henderson Valley School in West Auckland, Te Kura o Omaio in the Bay of Plenty, and Granity School on the South Island's West Coast.

Broadband is a key part of National's plan to build a stronger economy, lift wages, and provide the world-class health and education services families need.

Our $300 million Rural Broadband Initiative will bring fast broadband to rural schools, businesses, and households. This is complemented by our [$1.5 billion urban ultra-fast broadband initiative](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16241.link), which will deliver broadband speeds of 100 Megabits per second to 75 per cent of Kiwis where they live, work, and study by 2019.

**FROM MY DIARY**

Yesterday I announced the [re-appointment of my Chief Science Adviser Sir Peter Gluckman](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16242.link) for another two years.

Tonight I'm attending [a state dinner for His Majesty King Tupou V of Tonga](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16243.link). On Thursday I'll be in Hamilton for the day, and in the evening I'll be speaking at a public meeting hosted by the _Waikato Times_.

Best wishes,

**John Key  
Prime Minister**
