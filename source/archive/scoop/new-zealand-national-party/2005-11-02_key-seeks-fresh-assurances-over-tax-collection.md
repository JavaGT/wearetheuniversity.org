Key seeks fresh assurances over tax collection

Key seeks fresh assurances over tax collection

“If IRD can’t answer its phones, how on earth will it stay on top of the complicated individual calculations that will be required when Labour’s Working For Families package is fully rolled out?”

National Party Finance spokesman John Key is commenting after the release of Inland Revenue’s annual report that shows the department is still failing to meet its targets for answering the phone on time.

“Given this result, it’s hard to believe the previous Minister who repeatedly reassured us that taxpayers won’t end up in debt due to the complexity of Working For Families.”

In Australia a similar programme of “targeted welfare” left taxpayers who had underestimated their annual income owing more than $1 billion.

“The previous Minister said that IRD would have no difficulty coping with the burgeoning caseload,” says Mr Key.

“Will the new Minister, Peter Dunne, repeat this assurance for the thousands of families who might now end up in debt because of Labour’s complete aversion to a fair tax system?”
