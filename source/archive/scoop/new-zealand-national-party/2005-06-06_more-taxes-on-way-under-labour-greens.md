More Taxes On Way Under Labour-Greens

More taxes on way under Labour-Greens

  
A Labour-Green government would have to raise taxes to implement any of the Greens' hugely expensive tertiary education package, National's Education spokesman, Bill English, says.

"The Greens have promised a universal student allowance and no tertiary fees, as well a total loan write-off for students who stay in New Zealand. The total cost of that would be well over $1 billion a year.

"The Greens have made it clear they want a coalition with Labour and places at the Cabinet table. Labour will have to make concessions to the Greens, and this is easily the most expensive of their policies.

"However, this policy alone means a Labour-Green government would have to raise taxes if they are serious about it.

"If the Greens aren't serious about it then they shouldn't mislead students by promising them something they won't deliver.

"Dr Cullen has said that all the surplus is accounted for, so if we believe him and the Greens win any concessions on tertiary policy, he will have to increase taxes or do a U-turn on his self-imposed fiscal constraints.

"Labour will have to deal with more of these extravagant promises from the Greens.

"Dr Cullen should tell students now that he won't pay for the Green's policy, or he should tell taxpayers how far he will raise taxes," Mr English says.

"Labour will be wishing the Greens had stuck to peak oil."
