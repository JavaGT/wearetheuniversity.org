Quick-Fix Solution Not Good Enough
==================================

**Tuesday, 20 March 2001, 2:59 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The Minister of Education is scrambling to find a quick-fix solution to the inadequacies of the National Certificate of Education Achievement, National's Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.

"In a five minute meeting today Trevor Mallard offered to partially meet one of National's concerns about the NCEA. His offer was very conditional and not in a bipartisan spirit.

"National has three major concerns with the NCEA:  
\* Assessment that shows a wider spread of ability than credit, merit or excellence must be available to students and appear on reports.  
\* There should be rigorous levels of moderation both school to school and student to student to ensure consistency in quality across the country.  
\* There must be a funding commitment for support resources for classroom teachers.

"When the Minister is prepared to discuss these matters in a constructive way, we will be prepared to listen.

"Mr Mallard's insistence on imposing a dumbed down grading system in the NCEA jeopardises the value of the secondary school qualifications being sought by young New Zealanders from next year.

"Mr Mallard needs to stop playing clever politics and start talking constructively," Mr Brownlee said.
