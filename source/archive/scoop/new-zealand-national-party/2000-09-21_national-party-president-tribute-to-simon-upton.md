PRESS RELEASE

  
For Immediate Release

Acting National Party President Bernard Duncan has paid tribute to Simon Upton for the insight and intellectual rigour which he brought to his portfolio areas during his 19 years as an MP.

"He will also be missed for his contribution to the Party's affairs in our Central North Island region," Mr Duncan said.

"The Party wishes Simon well in his new role. It is one which people can feel proud to know is being filled by a New Zealander.

"It is likely that National's next list nominee, Alec Neill, will take Simon's place in National's caucus team.

"Alec has considerable Parliamentary experience and is highly regarded, especially in the Party's Canterbury-Westland region. Mr Neill will bring with him expertise in a range of areas; notably justice, rural and provincial issues.

Simon Upton will formally retire in the New Year.

Bernard Duncan Acting President.
