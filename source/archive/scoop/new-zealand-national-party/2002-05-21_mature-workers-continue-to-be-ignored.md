"The growing problem for people aged over 45 to get a job is highlighted by the long-term unemployment figures," says National's Welfare spokesman Bob Simcock.

"The long-term unemployment figures for people aged over 45 are the fastest growing by age of any group and yet it is clear this week's Budget is not going to address this increasing social problem.

"The problem I know is even worse than what official figures show as many older people don't bother registering and yet they want to work.

"I am so concerned about the situation, I have instigated my own survey in the Waikato. Already the comments coming back show many people in the mature age-bracket have had bad experiences purely because of their age.

"In Christchurch the local mature employment agency is facing a funding crisis and I know many other such agencies around the country are facing similar difficulties," Mr Simcock concluded.
