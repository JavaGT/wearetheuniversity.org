National building high-tech experience in the Hutt

  
National Party Hutt South candidate Chris Bishop today congratulated the eight Hutt Valley based businesses who have received a share of $4 million worth of R&D Student Grants available through Callaghan Innovation.

Callaghan Innovation announced 154 businesses nationwide have received grants to employ students for internships in order to develop their skills and understanding of commercial R&D within New Zealand.

"This is further great news for Hutt students working towards careers in science, technology and engineering. With these grants, companies will be able to give locals real work experience in the Hutt Valley’s growing high-tech hub,” Mr Bishop says.

"Local firms also benefit from hiring young, enthusiastic students to advance their company’s R&D projects."

"R&D Student Grants build on recent government science initiatives benefiting the Hutt such as a new $3 million engineering school at WelTec and the Education to Employment (E2E) initiative to improve the skills available to local high-tech firms."

"It is part of National’s ongoing commitment to improve the role of innovation in our economy and boost New Zealand’s economic growth."

The eight Hutt Valley businesses are Quest Integrity, Tekron International, Black Pearl Mail, Formway Furniture, CRL Energy, Pacific Door Systems, Pertronic Industries, and Dulux.

Students interested in gaining one of these places at a local firm should contact their university, institute of technology or polytechnic; or by visiting the Callaghan Innovation website: [https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/what-we-do/funding-and-grants/rd-student-grants](https://www.callaghaninnovation.govt.nz/what-we-do/funding-and-grants/rd-student-grants)
