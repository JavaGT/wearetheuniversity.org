Labour should focus on quality of qualification

Labour should focus on quality of qualification

  
National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the Labour Government should focus on the quality of NCEA qualifications, rather than trumpeting about a small increase in the number of students completing them.

He is commenting on the Ministry of Education’s release today of school-leavers’ statistics, which show there has been a 1% increase in the number of secondary students gaining University Entrance.

The Ministry also claims that just 13% of students leave school with no qualification.

But Mr English says the Minister has no way of knowing whether this increase is due to improved teaching or whether it’s the result of lower standards.

“The Ministry’s claim that just 13% leave school with no qualification is dubious when almost a third of students fail the basic level 1 NCEA literacy standard.

“I find it very hard to understand how these students can gain the national qualification without a basic competency in literacy. If they can, we are all in a lot of trouble.”
