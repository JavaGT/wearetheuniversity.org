Big Turnout Expected For 'Stop The Hurt'

Big Turnout Expected For 'Stop The Hurt' Conference

More than 140 people are set to gather at Parliament tomorrow for a major conference on child abuse. The 'Stop the Hurt' conference, which will be chaired by the Commissioner for Children Roger McClay, will examine the arguments for and against Mandatory Reporting.

Organiser Bob Simcock says politics must be set to one side for the conference. "This is not about politics, it's about the safety and welfare of our country's kids.

"The diverse range of social agencies and people from throughout the country attending this conference clearly shows that it is non-partisan," Mr Simcock said.

"You certainly couldn't claim this conference was stacked one way or the other. As far as we can tell there appear to be about equal numbers of participants at this conference who stand on both sides of this issue.

"My only disappointment is that Labour and the Alliance have apparently blacklisted the conference, in addition to banning CYFS from taking part. Both New Zealand First and ACT are sending representatives," Bob Simcock said.

Agencies confirmed as having representatives at the conference include the Auckland College of Education, Barnardos, Birthright, Early Childhood Development, Child Abuse Prevention Services, Christchurch Care and Protection Resource Panel, Christian Counselling Centre, Dunedin Council of Social Services, Early Start Project and Family Health trust, Family Start (Nelson, Hamilton and Porirua), Franklin District Truancy Service, Hoki Mai Counselling Services, IHC, Kidsreach Trust, Safer Banks Peninsula, Ma Te Whanau Timata, Memorial Hospital, Mental Health and Counselling Services, Womens Refuge, Rape Crisis, National Council of Women, Northland Health, NZ Business Roundtable, NZ Childcare Association, NZ Kindergartens Inc, NZ Medical Association, PPTA, School Trustees Association, NZ Police Child Abuse and Paedophile Squad, Richmond Fellowship, Open Home Foundation, Otaki Children's Health Camps, Papatuanuku Trust, Parent Help, Parentline, Pinnacle Youth Leadership Trust, Rahui Pokeka Maatua Whangai Trust, Raukawa Development Trust, Royal NZ College of General Practitioners, Plunket Society, Safer Communities Council, Safer Hamilton, Salvation Army, UNITEC, Shakti Migrant Services Trust, Starship Childrens Hospital, Tamariki Ora Service, Te Kohanga Reo National Trust Board, Taeaomanino Trust, Te Runanga O Raukawa, the Community Trust of Wellington, the Institute for Child Protection Studies and Waikato Safer Communities.
