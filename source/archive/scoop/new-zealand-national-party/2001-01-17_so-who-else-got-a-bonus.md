So who else got a bonus?

Prime Minister Helen Clark needs to come clean on which other government departments and agencies have flouted her 'austerity' regime and paid bonuses to staff for simply doing their jobs, National MP Tony Ryall said today.

"Helen Clark said she would stop all this. It's been 14 months and she hasn't. The Prime Minister said she would set high standards. Well, we're still waiting.

"NZQA staff got a payout for shifting offices. Housing NZ staff got three days holiday for implementing government policy. So which other Government agencies gave out taxpayer money to staff for just doing their jobs?

"Did any senior ACC staff get a bonus payout or extra holidays for implementing the Government's changes to accident compensation? Did any Department of Labour staff get a bonus payout or extra holidays for advising on ACC and Employment Relations Bill matters? Did any HFA or Health Department staff get any goodies for managing the transition to the new system? And did anyone in WINZ get a special bonus for implementing changes to the student loans system?

"If the Prime Minister is in charge, then she will fix the NZQA payouts and HNZ holidays. She said 'You don't expect to be paid more for \[implementing government policy\]. She should be true to her word and set things right. "If the Prime Minister is in charge, she will reveal who else has been flouting her rulings.

"The National Opposition will be asking parliamentary questions and using the Official Information Act to uncover more of this government's 'Golden Thank Yous', and which Ministers knew and didn't do anything about them," Mr Ryall said today.
