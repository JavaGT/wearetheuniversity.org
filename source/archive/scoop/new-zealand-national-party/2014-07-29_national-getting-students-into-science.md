**Media Statement:**

**National getting students into science**

National Party Hutt South candidate Chris Bishop today supported the government’s launch of A Nation of Curious Minds: He Whenua Hirihi I te Mahara, a programme to boost community involvement in the science sector.

Managed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Ministry of Education this blueprint will make it easier for teachers to demonstrate the opportunities science provides and to attract students from a wider range of backgrounds to study science and technology.

“I encourage our local high-tech firms to talk to students about the exciting career prospects available in their firms in order to attract the next generation of skilled employees”, Mr Bishop said.

“By working through the government departments in this programme, Hutt firms can ensure there are students choosing science and choosing to pursue their careers locally.

Among the programmes to help achieve the goals in the plan are a contestable fund available for projects aimed at engaging harder-to-reach groups, and a Science Skills in Education initiative to support schools and teachers to build confidence and access resources to build exciting science programmes.

“Lifting student engagement and achievement in science is essential if we want increase incomes and give high-tech business in the Hutt the skills they need to develop new products and grow their business.

“National is continuing to promote innovation in the economy by increasing the funding available through programmes like the National Science Challenges, the Marsden Fund, and the development of Callaghan Innovation based right here in Lower Hutt.
