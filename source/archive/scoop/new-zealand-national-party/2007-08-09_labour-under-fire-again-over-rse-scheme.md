Labour under fire again over RSE Scheme

Labour under fire again for arrogance over RSE Scheme

The National Party's Immigration spokesman, Lockwood Smith, is wondering how long it will take the Government to concede its Recognised Seasonal Employer Scheme will be the kiss of death for many key industries, after yet another plea to delay the programme.

"Already, Horticulture and Pipfruit NZ and NZ Winegrowers have called for the Labour Government to extend the Seasonal Work Permit scheme which is due to be abolished when the RSE takes effect on 30 September.

"They are rightly concerned that their industries will face serious labour shortages if the SWP is scrapped too early.

"Today, members of the Central Otago Winegrowers Association have expressed grave concerns about the way the RSE is being foisted on them without any prior consultation.

"They are very worried about the economic impact and timeframe of the scheme which is being rushed through with obscene haste.

"It is clear that for many winegrowers the RSE will be prohibitive and the timeframe in which they have been ordered to implement it is unrealistically short."

Dr Smith says it is only this week that the Government has begun consulting with Central Otago winegrowers about the implementation of the scheme and the axing of the Seasonal Work Permit scheme.

"This is no doubt due to the pressure being placed on Immigration Minister David Cunliffe by National which, unlike the minister, cares deeply about the effect this harebrained scheme will have on our vital industries."
