**The recent** tsunami that swept across parts of Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga touched many lives here in New Zealand. It is during a disaster such as this that we realise just how close we are to the people of the Pacific, and how much we have in common. This week the police held a memorial service, and I was privileged to join them as they remembered those who were lost. The police have seen firsthand the destruction of the tsunami as they helped Samoa with victim identification experts, specialist search teams and radio communication teams. On a personal note, my husband has been in Samoa for the past week. He has let me know that the reconstruction phase is well under way with building materials and tools needed. The generosity of New Zealanders to this disaster has been very much appreciated in Samoa and Tonga. It’s also important to note that most of Samoa escaped the tsunami. The Samoan government has made it clear they need tourists to visit, experience their fantastic hospitality, and help rebuild the economy.

**As Minister** of Veteran’s affairs, I represented New Zealand in Poland last month to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the start of World War II. The ceremony was held at Westerplatte on the Baltic coast, where the Germans fired the first shots against Poland at the start of their invasion on September 1, 1939. I placed a candle at the Monument of the Defenders of Westerplatte along with other world leaders to represent New Zealand’s contribution and sacrifice during the war effort. The ceremony was an opportunity to honour their sacrifice, and remember the terrible human toll of war. I then travelled to Paris to take part in a special ceremony to commemorate our country’s war-time alliance with France. The atmosphere surrounding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe was incredible. Thousands of Parisians, veterans, soldiers – and a sprinkling of Kiwis, I'm pleased to say - turned out to remember the special relationship between France and New Zealand.

**Over the** past few months you’ve noticed there are more police on our streets. One hundred new cops have joined the beat in Counties Manukau – proving this Government is committed to increase frontline police staff by 300 by 2010. So far Papakura has welcomed ten officers, Pukekohe, four, and Manurewa, 25. Comments made by Labour spokesman Clayton Cosgrove that boosting police numbers in Counties Manukau was an “ill-considered promise” was deeply upsetting to local residents. This area is the fastest growing district in the country and faces serious long-term pressures on policing. I believe there’s no better deterrent to crime than having plenty of police officers on the beat.

**Recently,** I took part in the Supercity Pub Debate held at the Papakura RSA alongside representatives from the Labour and Green parties. It was a very enjoyable evening full of lively discussion. Auckland’s Supercity will go ahead and the Government is committed to securing the best possible deal for districts like Papakura in local board arrangements. National wants to establish 20 to 30 local boards to give districts – like Papakura – the opportunity to retain their local voice. We want Papakura’s best interests to be preserved by local representatives. However Labour supports 14 to 20 local boards – meaning representation will be less local. If Labour had prevailed, Papakura would have a poorer chance of securing its own board.

**I was** pleased to hear about the success of local students in this year’s Lions Club Young Ambassadors awards. I congratulate Chynna Phelan (Papakura High School), Sylvie Chan (Rosehill College), Elliot Hurst (Strathallan College) and Erin Foster (Pukekohe High School) for their success. Well done to you all!

**I’m delighted** that Edmund Hillary Primary School in Papakura has been selected as one of the first 14 schools nationwide to receive an ICT upgrade. The students and teachers can look forward to improved access to online learning tools as part of the Government’s $34 million broadband boost. It will allow Edmund Hillary Primary School to access a wider range of online resources and tools, and deliver relevant and engaging programmes for pupils. The Government is committed to providing the educational resources students need to achieve success.
