Minister blames parents for NCEA confusion

Education Minister Steve Maharey is now trying to blame parents for the confusion and concern over NCEA, says National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

"The Minister's answers to questions in the House today reveal his true thoughts on NCEA.

"Steve Maharey wants to paint the picture that it's only parents who are concerned about NCEA, and that their concerns should be dismissed because they simply don't understand it.

"That's an insult to parents, but also the many Principals and teachers who continue to raise legitimate concerns about NCEA.

"The Minister is all over the place in his rebuttal over NCEA criticisms.

"First he tries to hold the line that NCEA is a success, but in the next breath talks about the need to 'restore confidence' in NCEA.

"If things are going so swimmingly, why are schools looking for alternatives and why is he aiming to 'restore confidence'?

"New Zealand school students, worried parents and the schools which have gone public with their concerns over the system should be listened to.

"As long as the Minister is deaf to legitimate concerns, our country runs the risk of developing of a two-tier exam system for kiwi students.

"It's time he owned up to the problem and stopped pretending that it's just in the minds of concerned parents who simply want the best for their children."
