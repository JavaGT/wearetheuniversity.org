Aust launches raid on our best and brightest

National Party Leader Don Brash says all New Zealanders should be concerned by the latest twist in Australia's raid on our best and brightest.

"The significance of the across-the-board tax cuts announced overnight in Australia should not be overlooked," says Dr Brash.

"For New Zealand this means more competition for the skills that we need to keep our economy growing.

"The Labour Government doesn't have the first clue about putting the right incentives into the economy to allow people to get ahead under their own steam.

"In contrast, a National government would have put the right incentives in place.

"Last month was an opportunity lost in New Zealand, because on 1 April a National government would have introduced the first tranche of its extensive tax cuts package.

"Instead, we have seen the Australian Government yet again cut taxes.

"Substantial tax cuts are most definitely on the agenda for the next National government.

"By then, of course, we will have lost thousands more of our best and brightest people across the Tasman. The public can thank Labour for that."
