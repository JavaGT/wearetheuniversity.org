National would overturn waka jumping legislation

A National Government would repeal the undemocratic waka jumping legislation which was passed today, National Party Leader Simon Bridges says.

“The Electoral (Integrity) Amendment Bill, or waka jumping legislation, is an affront to democracy, it stops individual MPs standing up for the voters who elected them. It would more accurately be called the ‘Winston Peters Self Preservation Bill’ as it was his bottom line for entry into the Coalition.

“This Bill is also bad for New Zealand’s international reputation, with international watchers confirming it would likely affect our reputation as one of the world’s most transparent and democratic countries.

“The Bill has been condemned by 20 legal and political academics, eight professors from the Universities of Auckland, AUT, Victoria, Canterbury and Otago released a submission opposing the law change and attesting to the breach of the Bill of Rights.

“The Green Party has had to compromise its principles and been called out by its own supporters for it, Labour’s Māori caucus has failed to stand up for what’s right and Mr Peters has again shown who’s really in charge.

“It’s a sad day for New Zealanders, and a sad day for democracy. National would overturn Mr Peter’s anti-democratic Bill.”
