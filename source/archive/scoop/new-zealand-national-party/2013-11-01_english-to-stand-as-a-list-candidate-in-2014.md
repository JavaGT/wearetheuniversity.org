**English to stand as a list candidate in 2014**

Deputy Prime Minister Bill English has today announced that he will seek nomination for the National Party list and step down as MP for Clutha-Southland at the election next year.

“This afternoon I met with my electorate committee in Gore to inform them of my decision,” he says.

“It has been a privilege to represent the electorate since 1990 and I have particularly enjoyed working for my constituents.

“I will continue as MP for Clutha-Southland until the election next year. I am strongly committed to the re-election of a John Key-led Government in 2014 and to my roles as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance. We have made considerable progress since our election in 2008 and there is still plenty of work to do.

“However, representing one of New Zealand’s largest electorates has required considerable travel and time away from my family, particularly since becoming a minister. I have therefore decided that it is a good time to strike a better balance between my family and government commitments.

“I wish to thank the people of Clutha-Southland – and before that Wallace – for electing me as their representative in eight elections. I also thank my electorate team, including my electorate committee and my office staff in Gore, Balclutha and Queenstown, for their hard work and support over the years.

“I will continue to take a strong interest in issues affecting Southland and Otago and I’m confident the National Party will provide strong representation for the area into the future,” Mr English says.

ENDS
