Education Minister should meet principals

Education Minister Chris Carter should be sitting down and talking to North Shore college principals about funding rather than conducting a spat with them through the media, says National Party Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.

“Chris Carter should just get over himself and address the problems in a meaningful way.

“It looks as if he’s been caught fiddling the school funding figures by claiming he’s giving more to them than he actually is.

“But his only response is to make up some excuse to not meet the 10 principals.

“Instead of arguing in the media about GST, he should be sitting down with them, as he was scheduled to do, and work through the issues that have seen, for example, information technology costs going from almost nothing in 1999 to $565,000 this year.”
