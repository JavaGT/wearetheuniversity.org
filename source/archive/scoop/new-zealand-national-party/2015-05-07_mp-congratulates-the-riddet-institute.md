MP congratulates The Riddet Institute on selection as a Centre of Research Excellence

National MP Jono Naylor congratulates The Riddet Institute at Massey University on being selected by the Tertiary Education Commission as a Centre of Research Excellence (CoRE) in the second round of funding.

The successful CoREs will focus on sustainable pest management solutions, food science and human health, earthquake disaster resilience, and Māori research. All CoREs will contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand.

“The Riddet Institute will contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of New Zealand and continue the work of the strong research centre in Palmerston North” Jono Naylor said.

“This highlights the great work the research sector in Palmerston North does, especially around food science.

“The Riddet Institute have played a critical role in the establishment of FoodHQ and this recognition in regaining their CoRE status will further enhance the growth of the food research sector in Palmer North” says Naylor.

The four CoREs announced today are in addition to the six CoREs that were successful in the 2013/14 funding round. Of the 10 CoREs that will be funded, five are existing CoREs and five will be receiving CoREs funding for the first time.
