**Hutt schools funded to trial innovative teaching approaches to technology**

Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, says he can’t wait to see the results of a Hutt Valley schools’ project in 2 years’ time which has been given $300,000 as part of a fund to encourage innovative teaching practices.

“I’m happy to see our local education providers working together to raise achievement for children here in the Hutt Valley,” Mr Bishop says.

“This project involves eight schools including St Patrick’s College (Silverstream), St Bernard’s College and Sacred Heart College here in the Hutt. It aims to enhance student outcomes in technology in a number of Catholic secondary schools.

“This funding follows the success of two Hutt Valley projects in round one led by Maungaraki School, a collaborative project investigating teaching practices encouraging student agency, and Sacred Heart Petone who are leading a two year collaborative project to identify ‘best practice’ for learners transitioning to school.

“I am especially excited about the focus on enhancing student outcomes in technology. This feeds well into our drive to make the Hutt Valley ‘Technology Valley’ by preparing our kids for a hi-tech future.

“The project is the largest one of 46 selected in this second round of the Teacher-led Innovation Fund. This fund supports teachers’ bright ideas that evidence shows are working and can be shared across schools.

“It is part of National’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative which aims to encourage collaboration between schools to lift teaching practices to help Kiwi students achieve.”

This round of the fund involves 114 schools and six early childhood education providers. It is committing about $3.6 million of the $18 million fund. The next funding round will open in November.

“These projects will trial new ways of doing things, all with the aim to increase achievement for young New Zealanders,” Mr Bishop says.

“Where these projects are successful, other schools will be able to learn from the successes as well so that excellent practice becomes common practice.”
