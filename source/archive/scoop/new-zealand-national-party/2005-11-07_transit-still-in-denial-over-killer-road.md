Transit still in denial over ‘killer road’

National Party Port Waikato MP Paul Hutchison says Transit and the Labour Government must stop dragging their heels over State Highway Two, dubbed the ‘killer road’.

“Both Transit and the Labour Government are in denial over this piece of killer highway.

“It’s taken the suffering of yet another family for Transit to finally take the remedial step of closing a passing lane. How many more crashes will it take to fix the road properly?

“As far as we can see, neither the Government nor Transit appear willing to commit to a long term solution for this ‘killer road’, which has claimed 40 lives in five years.

“With increasing frequency more than 30,000 vehicles-a-day use the stretch of highway.

“Labour is dreaming if it thinks there’s likely to be a miraculous decrease in traffic on this busy route, given Coromandel’s growing popularity with summer crowds.

“Unless the policymakers start treating this road with the urgency it deserves, it is inevitable there will be more preventable deaths.

“I have written to Transport Minister David Parker asking for a concrete commitment to a permanent solution,” says Dr Hutchison.
