Another talkfest for bureaucrats

The latest Regional Development conference announced by Jim Anderton today will be another expensive bureaucratic talkfest, says National's Regional Development spokesman John Carter.

"After the last conference it emerged that a large proportion of the attendees were bureaucrats from Wellington. Jim Anderton has certainly been successful at job creation - but only for Wellington bureaucrats.

"So far his regional development strategies have been an abject failure. For all the hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars spent, very few individuals or businesses have actually seen any real benefit.

"What New Zealand needs for regional development is simple. We need lower taxes, less red tape, and less bureaucracy, particularly in dealing with employment law and the Resource Management Act.

"Talk is cheap. Business people will never take Jim Anderton and his various schemes and bureaucracies seriously until he actually does something about the enormous compliance costs and red tape his Government is responsible for.

"Real economic growth doesn't come from pouring taxpayer money into cocktail parties for bureaucrats and politicians. It comes from entrepreneurs and small business people working hard and taking a chance," said Mr Carter.
