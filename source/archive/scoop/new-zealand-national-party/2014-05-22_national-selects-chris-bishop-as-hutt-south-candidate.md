“Lower Hutt is full of friendly, creative, hard-working people who are proud of where they live. It’s where I was born and raised, and I’m passionate about making the Hutt even better,” said Mr Bishop.

“I’ll be working hard to win the support of Hutt South to give our communities a strong new voice.”
