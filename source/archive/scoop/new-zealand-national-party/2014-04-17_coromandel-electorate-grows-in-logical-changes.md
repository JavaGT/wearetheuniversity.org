Coromandel electorate grows in logical changes

The Coromandel electorate is now a little bit bigger.

Coromandel MP Scott Simpson has welcomed people who will join the electorate from Waikato, as part of changes to electoral boundaries.

Around 1,400 residents on the west side of the Firth of Thames will now be included in the Coromandel electorate for this year’s general election, including the people of Kaiaua and Mangatangi.

“The changes mean that everyone who lives within the Hauraki District Council’s area is now united in the Coromandel electorate. And that’s logical,’ Mr Simpson said.

Scott Simpson MP said “I think the Boundaries Commission has done a good job. It makes sense for the Coromandel boundary to include the part of Hauraki District which was previously not part of the electorate.”
