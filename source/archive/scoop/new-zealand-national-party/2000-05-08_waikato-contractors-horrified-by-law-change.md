Waikato contractors horrified by law change

"Waikato courier drivers, bread and rural mail deliverers and information technology specialists are horrified at the impact the Government's new employment law will have on them," Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.

"Local MP Tony Steel and I met with about 70 contractors yesterday (Sunday) to discuss the Employment Relations Bill.

"They are astounded by the Government's law change and are appalled that the Government wants to totally turn their employment status inside out.

"The rural mail deliverers, bread deliverers, home-care workers and courier drivers displayed real and deep concern that the Bill will threaten their livelihoods and jobs.

"Changing their status to employees changes their way of doing their job and business.

"Their concerns have been reflected by people appearing before the Parliamentary select committee.

"The Screen Producers and Directors Association of New Zealand - representing our film industry are deeply concerned about the Bill.

"SPADA says that 'the impact of the Bill as it stands, on the screen production industry would seem to be at variance with the initiatives of both the Government and our industry which are designed to encourage growth, employment and export potential of this creative industry'."

"The fears from small businesses and employers around the country are very real.

"A consensus is developing that the Employment Relations Bill means more costs and fewer jobs. National is fighting to change the Bill to limit the damage."
