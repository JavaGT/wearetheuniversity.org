Employers Ripped Off By ACC Tax-Grab

Employers are being blatantly ripped off by Labour's ACC levies, says National's ACC Spokesman Gerry Brownlee.

"Figures released show that ACC has built up a massive reserve fund, yet the Government has ignored advice to lower employer levies.

"This is daylight robbery. ACC themselves have told Minister Lianne Dalziel the levy is too high, but she is happy to continue a totally unnecessary tax grab.

"Workplace accidents have reduced, but employers are not having the savings passed on to them. Employers are missing out on thousands of dollars they could be re-investing in their business.

"Combined with the 40% hike in premiums for self-employed this year, it makes a mockery of the Government's claims to be business-friendly. Unnecessary costs like these just make it more difficult to take on more staff.

"National will release our ACC policy soon, which will go back to the successful competitive model," said Mr Brownlee.
