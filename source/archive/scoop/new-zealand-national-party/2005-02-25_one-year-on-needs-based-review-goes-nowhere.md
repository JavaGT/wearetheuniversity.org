One year on 'needs-based' review goes nowhere

Gerry Brownlee MP - National Party Maori Affairs Spokesman

One year on 'needs-based' review goes nowhere

"One year after Helen Clark appointed Trevor Mallard to conduct a review of race based policies, nothing has changed," says National Party Maori Affairs spokesman Gerry Brownlee.

"Even the Minister charged with ending the nonsense, Mr Mallard, is looking for an electorate secretary who has a 'commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi', who 'demonstrates an awareness of the implications of the Treaty', and who 'recognises and acknowledges the contribution of Maori staff'.

"As predicted, Labour has completely failed to deliver any meaningful review of its race based policies," says Mr Brownlee, who has also conducted an audit of recent Government jobs advertised on a single day in Wellington's major newspaper.

"Some reference to the Treaty of Waitangi appeared in at least 10 of the departmental job ads placed in recruitment section, covering nearly 30 different positions.

"The tally of 10 doesn't include advertisements from organisations that Labour will distance itself from, like universities, training institutes and health boards.

"Helen Clark was never serious about her so-called review of race-based policies and that'll be further underlined when Labour seeks to delay Parliament's discussion of the Bill proposing the deletion of Treaty principles from legislation.

"All Trevor Mallard has done is issue lists of departments that have conducted, or are conducting, their own internal reviews. At the same time he's fired cheap political blanks at things like school powhiri.

"Only National can be trusted to deliver policies based on need not race," says Mr Brownlee.
