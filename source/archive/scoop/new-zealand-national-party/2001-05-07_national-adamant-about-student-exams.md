National Adamant About Student Exams
====================================

**Monday, 7 May 2001, 11:59 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

National's Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee has dismissed comments by the PPTA of National's plans to introduce external exams to the secondary school qualifications system as purely self interest.

Mr Brownlee again made clear that National is committed to ensuring students have an internationally recognised qualification that actually means something.

"National is adamant that external exams, with marks awarded, will be introduced alongside the NCEA - if it survives. We want what's best for young people and for the New Zealand economy.

"We believe that students and their parents want to know exactly how well they've done. Our qualifications system must ensure New Zealand keeps its place in the developed world.

"I welcome Mr McCann's admission that most teachers are 'lukewarm' about the NCEA. I want to make it clear that National will not put up with a substandard qualifications system.

"National is committed to recognising student achievement and rewarding excellence.

"National will work with teachers and other experts in the education field to establish the National Education Scholarship. We believe our teachers have the skills and enthusiasm to transform education in this country.

"Many teachers are concerned about the outcome for students and they will support our move," Mr Brownlee said.
