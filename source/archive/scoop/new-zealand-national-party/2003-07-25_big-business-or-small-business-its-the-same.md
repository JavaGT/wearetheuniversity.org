Big Business Or Small Business - It's Still The Same

Don Brash National Finance Spokesman

Big business or small business - it's still the same

National's Finance spokesman Don Brash is attacking John Tamihere's claim that the needs of small business differ totally from the requirements of big business.

"In his role as Minister for Small Business, John Tamihere is only succeeding in irritating thousands of New Zealanders who run small businesses by trying to separate their role and needs from those of the bigger players.

"As the New Zealand Business Roundtable has rightly pointed out, large businesses are typically just small businesses that have succeeded and grown," says Dr Brash.

"All businesses, big or small, are battling the same problems - this current Government's anti-growth policies. The regulatory framework that Labour has put in place is doing nothing to help businesses and the country's long-term growth prospects.

"The Minister for Small Business needs to understand that size makes no difference when it comes to the role of business.

"What the Government should be focussing on is removing the roadblocks to growth and success".

Dr Brash also criticised John Tamihere's suggestion that "40% of GDP is produced out of the Beehive."

"He would have been more accurate to have said the Government commandeers 40% of all goods and services produced by ordinary New Zealanders.

"Like too many others on the Left, he fails to realise that the Government itself produces very little," said Dr Brash.
