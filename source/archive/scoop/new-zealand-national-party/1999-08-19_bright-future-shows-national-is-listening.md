Bright Future shows National is listening
=========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

“The Government’s ‘Bright Future’ package draws on the ideas raised by more than 2,000 people at 25 forums around the country earlier this year. National listened and is now acting,” said Hunua MP, Warren Kyd today. He is particularly pleased that it implements recommendations of the Commerce Select Committee, which he chairs, in connection with the compliance costs of small business.

In February 1999 the Government announced 5 steps to move New Zealand forward:

 Lifting our skills and our intellectual knowledge base.  
 Better focusing the Government’s efforts in research and development.  
 Improving access to capital.  
 Getting rid of red tape, which stifles innovation.  
 Promoting success, and supporting creative and innovative New Zealanders.

The Enterprise and Innovation Ministerial Team then held forums around the country to discuss these steps with key people in business, education and research.

“Drawing on the ideas raised at the forums, we have set out our vision for New Zealand’s Bright Future. It is a comprehensive package of initiatives, that represents a substantial investment in developing our knowledge economy.”

Mr Kyd described the Bright Future initiatives as very practical steps forward. They build on National’s strong base of economic fundamentals, such as low interest, low tax and the Employment Contracts Act.

“The 25 forums were concerned that we do not adequately celebrate success and provide rewards for our most talented students. Our scholarships package recognises, rewards and supports our best students and encourages everybody to aim for success.”

Mr Kyd said the government was called on to do more to improve the regulatory environment and will be doing so. It is implementing the changes recommended by the Commerce Select Committee and especially those to reduce taxation and statistical information compliance costs.

“We are committed to making it easier to do business. We will continue to reduce tax compliance costs, cutting red tape and removing outdated regulations and laws.

In contrast to the Labour/Alliance Bloc, National will not be increasing tax for business and higher
