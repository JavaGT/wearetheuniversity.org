Labour's legacy of taxes and racial tension

National Party Leader Bill English says Helen Clark appears to have developed yet another case of selective amnesia in the launch of a book heralding the Labour Government's achievements.

"Labour's introduced some 17 sly taxes, and is proposing at least seven more.

"They've fuelled racial tension by policies of separatism and they're allowing welfare dependency to snowball out of control at a time when we're enjoying the best economic conditions in a generation," Mr English says.

"The Prime Minister has personally put New Zealand offside with our traditional friends and allies and then refused to offer a genuine apology.

"She has been prepared to apologise on a number of other occasions, but she won't say sorry to the people that count - the people of New Zealand for her failure to address issues around the Treaty of Waitangi.

"She's dodged more questions than any Prime Minster should be allowed to get away with and she's refusing to hold her Ministers to account for the mistakes that they make," says Mr English.

Below is a brief list of the Labour's real achievements:

\*John Tamihere attacks Maori elders

\*Parekura Horomia's horror performance in the House

\*Jim Sutton and Pete Hodgson call farmers "whingers"

\*Clark butchers hope of a US free trade deal

\*Phil Goff is photographed holding hands with Arafat
