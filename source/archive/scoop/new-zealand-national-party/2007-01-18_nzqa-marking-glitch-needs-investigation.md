NZQA marking glitch needs investigation

NZQA marking glitch needs investigation

Claims by a Dunedin school principal that NCEA results are still not available for almost a third of subjects offered at the school must be investigated, says National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

Logan Park Principal Jane Johnson told the Otago Daily Times a third of the school's NCEA papers had recorded "results not available" when students checked on the Internet yesterday afternoon.

"NZQA claim this is a glitch and that marking went smoothly.

"This is a typical NZQA response, but for the pupils left wondering what happened to their results, this is a serious and distressing error.

"Many students are relying on these results as they plan their next year of study, and to be left in limbo simply isn't good enough.

"NZQA claimed yesterday that "most" students would get their results online and promised that 85% would have received them in the mail by the afternoon.

"Clearly, this has not happened. For the sake of the teachers, students and parents left wondering, NZQA must immediately investigate the problem and issue an explanation."
