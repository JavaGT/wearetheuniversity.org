**FAREWELL TO HMNZS CANTERBURY**

The Navy’s multi-role ship HMNZS Canterbury has arrived in the Pacific with a cargo of essential reconstruction supplies for the areas hit by the recent tsunami.

I toured the ship and farewelled the crew before they sailed last Saturday. Canterbury was in planned maintenance when the tsunami struck. The Navy worked very hard to get the ship ready for sea within five days. They did an excellent job.

Canterbury’s arrival marks the next phase of New Zealand’s aid effort. This follows the delivery by air of medical supplies and other urgent requirements in the days following the catastrophe.

The cargo on board Canterbury includes engineering vehicles, timber and water purification equipment. She also carried several containers of donated goods from the Tongan and Samoan communities.

The delivery of Kiwi aid to our brothers and sisters in the Pacific is a proud event to be involved in. Well done to everyone.

**PREPARING FOR A NATURAL DISASTER**  
It is important that New Zealanders have confidence in our civil defence arrangements.  
The Government has set up an independent review looking at how the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management responded to the recent tsunami threat.  
The review is expected to be completed by the end of October and will run alongside the Ministry’s own review of its response.  
National is committed to ensuring that we have the best systems and to supporting civil defence teams and communities around New Zealand.

**MILFORD CENTRE**

The Milford Residents and Ratepayers’ Association recently held a public meeting on the development of Milford centre. The owners of Milford Mall, the New Zealand Retail Property Group, are proposing a private plan change that would permit a higher density of development on the current mall site. The redevelopment would offer a much larger retail area which will bring increased jobs and business to the Milford area. However, some residents are clearly anxious about the nature of the proposed development.

When hearings for the plan change are held I suggest that all interested residents make an effort to attend. In the meantime it is a good opportunity for the Milford community to think about the direction they would like to see the development take.

  
**OUT AND ABOUT**

**Passchendaele commemorations**

Last Saturday I joined the Prime Minister at the March Past and Review in Takapuna to mark the 92nd anniversary of the World War 1 battle of Passchendaele. The Army led the parade, with the other services, cadets and RSA members also involved. It was a very moving occasion. This battle took place over two days and cost more New Zealand lives than any other single event in our history. Amongst others, the Prime Minister and I laid wreaths.

**Farewell to Afghanistan troops**

On Monday I visited the Ohakea Air Force base to farewell the latest rotation of Defence Force and police personnel to the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan. There are 145 people in this group. They comprise the fifteenth such rotation to serve in Bamiyan province. Our PRT is making a very significant contribution in Bamiyan. They are providing essential reconstruction to help the people of Afghanistan build a better future. They will make us proud, as have their predecessors.
