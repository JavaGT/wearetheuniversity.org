Increasing efficiency of justice system
=======================================

Govt plan for increasing efficiency of justice system

The Government today continued its drive for reform of the justice system by releasing a bill plan seeking input on proposals to shorten court waiting times and trials, increase efficiencies, and introduce technology to criminal proceedings.

The bill plan will form the basis for a Criminal Procedure Bill to be introduced to Parliament next year.

"It's estimated that the reforms we're proposing have the potential to save thousands of court events and court sitting hours," Mr Power said.

"This will lead to cases progressing through the system much more quickly, resulting in a more efficient system that delivers justice to victims, witnesses, defendants, and the community," Mr Power said.

"The Criminal Procedure Simplification Project is a substantial piece of work, and I'm confident its reforms will be effective. The bill plan shows how the changes would work as an integrated package."

The release of the bill plan closely follows the recent introduction of the Courts (Remote Participation) Bill to allow the greater use of video-links in court proceedings.

"Our courts have used audio-visual technology for witness evidence for some time

"Allowing that technology to be used for a wider range of criminal proceedings would mean offenders can appear in court by video-link for routine appearances, making courts faster and safer, and saving money and resources.

"This consultation is another milestone in this Government's commitment to substantial overhaul of the justice system.

"We've looked at victims' rights, and how victims can be supported through the court process, and we're looking hard at legal aid.

"I encourage court users and the public to express their views on the bill plan."
