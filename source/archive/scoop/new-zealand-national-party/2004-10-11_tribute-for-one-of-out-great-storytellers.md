Tribute for one of the great storytellers of our time

National Party Arts, Culture and Heritage spokeswoman Georgina te Heuheu today paid tribute to Maurice Shadbolt, who died yesterday, describing him as 'one of the great storytellers of our time'.

"He was a first class, prolific author who contributed enormously to New Zealand's fine literary tradition. In doing so he not only brought great joy to thousands of readers over the years, but also brought international acclaim and fame, not just to himself, but to all of us and to our nation.

"Maurice Shadbolt will be missed by all who loved his stories and writings but mostly by his family and loved ones. As New Zealanders we owe them a debt of gratitude for their generosity in sharing this literary icon with us all," says Mrs te Heuheu.
