'Extremely unsafe environment' no place for kids

Revelations that a Christchurch school has advised parents that it is an "extremely unsafe environment" requires immediate action from the Minister of Education, says local National MP David Carter.

The Maori immersion school - Te Kura Whakapumau I Te Reo Tuuturu Ki Waitaha - has written to parents warning of rife bullying, theft and fighting among the students.

"It is fundamental to our education system that when parents deliver their children to school they know they will be cared for in a safe atmosphere that fosters learning," says Mr Carter.

"The school's management is obviously in chaos. The principal denies that  
pupils are in danger, yet the school newsletter is absolutely explicit, describing the school as an "extremely unsafe environment".

"The Minister of Education has spent the past six months promoting the closure of schools, many of which were capably delivering education, yet has no comment on this school.

"Is this another example of one standard for Maori education and another for non-Maori?", asks Mr Carter
