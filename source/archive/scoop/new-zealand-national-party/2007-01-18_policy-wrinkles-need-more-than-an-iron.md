Policy wrinkles need more than an iron

Policy wrinkles need more than an iron

Education Minister Steve Maharey's plea for more time to sort out the issues of under-capacity for the Government's "20 hours free" early childhood education policy is too little too late, says National's Associate Education spokeswoman, Paula Bennett.

In response to the release of Official Information Act documents showing that 14% of early childhood services will not offer the scheme, and 47% will have 'little or no capacity' to meet demand for the policy, Mr Maharey asked for time to 'iron out' the issues.

"He says parents and centres need more time to look through what is being offered.

"A quick glance at the papers released by Mr Maharey's own Ministry will show any parent or centre that what is on offer can't be delivered as promised in 2005.

"It is too late to plead for time to sort this policy 18 months after it was promised to parents.

"Like the student loans bribe, this is another example of policy being developed on the hoof around a Labour Party election strategy table, not the usual official processes within the Ministry, which take time.

"No amount of 'ironing' will get rid of the wrinkles in this poorly planned policy."
