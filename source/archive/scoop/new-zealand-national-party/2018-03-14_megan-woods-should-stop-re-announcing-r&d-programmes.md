**Megan Woods should stop re-announcing R&D programmes**

Science and innovation Minister Megan Woods should stop re-announcing the previous Government’s R&D programmes and come up with some of her own, National Party Science and Innovation Spokesperson Parmjeet Parmar says.

“Ms Woods has attempted to fool the media by re-launching the MBIE Innovative Partnerships programme which was previously announced and launched by the National Government in 2016,” Ms Parmar says.

“It is clear that she has nothing new to say on research and development.

“The Ardern-Peters Government have spent so much on its bribe to university students that the word around town is that there will be no new funding available for research and development in this year’s budget.

“Labour has set a big target of lifting research and development spending to 2 per cent of GDP but they have no plan on how to get there.

“Ms Woods needs to stop re-treading the previous Government’s programmes and announce the detail of her own policies.”
