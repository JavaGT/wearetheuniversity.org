First Golden-Handshake Of Health Reforms Revealed
=================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The first massive golden handshake of Annette King's health reforms has been revealed - with the former Healthlink South boss being paid out $265,000 for quitting her job, National Health spokesperson Wyatt Creech said today.

"This is a huge pay-out and can only be blamed on the Health Minister and her health reforms.

"Healthlink South boss Jane Parfitt got the payout because her board was being merged with the Canterbury Health Board to form one District Health Board under the Government's health reforms.

"Annette King promised in February there would be no golden handshakes from her health reforms.

"She must front up and explain why this has happened, and how many more golden handshakes are in the wind as people lose their jobs in the widespread health restructuring.

"This Government railed long and hard against golden handshakes when they were in Opposition.

"This payout is much bigger than those they were yelling from the rooftops against.

"What's worse is that this is in the health sector, at a time when all people want is for health professionals to get on with the job of delivering health services.

"People are sick of golden handshakes. They are also sick of health restructuring.

"Annette King needs to start listening to the concerns about the health reforms.

"Instead she's ploughing on imposing more costs, payouts and upheaval."
