Evaluation of Modern Apprentice scheme shambolic

Government officials have admitted they have no way of measuring completion rates for their much-celebrated Modern Apprentice scheme, says National’s Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.

“At this morning’s Education and Science Select Committee, Tertiary Education Commission officials admitted they had no way of measuring the completion rates on the Modern Apprenticeship scheme.

“This scheme has been running for seven years, under a Labour Government that has invested millions of dollars but with no way of seeing if they are getting value for money.

“Instead, we see the scheme trotted out periodically for ‘feel good’ media on apprenticeships.

"Celebrating the 3000 apprentices that have graduated needs to be seen in context of the number that enrolled and failed.

“How can the public possibly know that taxpayer dollars are being spent well, or if this scheme is a success, if the Government and officials continue to dodge questions over completion rates?

“The Government invested an extra $34 million into the Modern Apprentice scheme last year, and with that increased investment must come accountability.

“Labour has no idea how the programme is operating, how many people are dropping out of it, or how the coordinators are spending the taxpayers’ funding they receive.

“It is time the Tertiary Education Minister fronted up and explained just where taxpayer money is going, and how many of his modern apprentices are dropping out.”
