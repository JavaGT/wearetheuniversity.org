Time for answers on the foreshore and seabed

The time has come for Margaret Wilson to tell New Zealand what the Government has in store for the foreshore and seabed, says Dr Wayne Mapp, National's Spokesman for Treaty of Waitangi and Constitutional Issues.

"Under pressure in the House to provide the nation with answers, all the Minister can say is 'wait for the legislation'.

"New Zealanders have waited and lived with this uncertainty for long enough," says Dr Mapp. "I challenge Margaret Wilson to come clean and answer the following questions:

\* Will there be a dual title of Crown title and customary title?

\* Will Maori have co-management of all of the foreshore and seabed?

\* Will the High Court have jurisdiction to deal with customary title and customary rights?

• When will the legislation be introduced?

"These are all simple questions that the Government has more than ample time to consider. "They have made countless u-turns on this issue. Having considered every possible option at least once they must surely have developed a policy.

"The Government owes it to New Zealanders to come clean on an issue that stands to affect the livelihood and lifestyle of thousands of people across the country," says Dr Mapp.

"If the legislation is due soon, and it must be, then the Government already knows the answers. Why won't they tell New Zealand?"
