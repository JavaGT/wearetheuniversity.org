News Worthy

22 February 2008 - No. 238

The Year of the Rat

One of the significant features of the Lunar New Year is that the celebrations continue for a 15 day period from (in this year) 7 February. Somewhat similar perhaps to the 12 days of Christmas.

On Tuesday in a Parliamentary setting the Chinese New Year was celebrated with a cultural programme and speeches by the Prime Minister and others. It was very much a Parliamentary occasion.

Politics continues however to loom large at such events. On the lectern confronting those present was a line of Chinese characters which for those fluent in Chinese detracted from the occasion. Translated it read "Labour Party supports Chinese". The Government propaganda machine had clearly been in full flight. Not disclosed was the funding source for the propaganda.

  
The finance company collapses

In the last eighteen months 14 finance companies have collapsed. There is little doubt that more will follow. The delayed Government response has been to introduce the Financial Advisers Bill which requires competency of financial advisers, disclosure of conflicts of interest and provisions seeking to hold financial advisers accountable.

I have always been surprised at the readiness of investors to place money in finance companies in the New Zealand setting.

Many investors have not received appropriate returns for their risk. For example, while finance companies engage in riskier lending than banks, this is only partly reflected in the returns on short-term deposits. The average difference between the interest rates on 1 year term deposits at banks, and 1 year finance company debentures has been consistently around 1%.

So one can ask why an investor would put money into a finance company and not go off to a bank like Westpac or Rabobank and earn a monthly rate of interest, on a reasonable deposit sum of in excess of 8%.

Deposit-taking finance companies, on average, have a margin between debentures and loans - the interest spread - around twice that of banks, and it is significantly more for companies lending for consumer purposes.

The legislation will catch the unsuspecting because of its scope. Bank tellers will fall within its umbrella as well as other classes of occupation. A customer who goes into a trading bank and says to the teller "I have $20,00 to invest, what do you suggest I do" is clearly seeking financial advice and the response from a teller will likely be in the form of an opinion identifying particular financial products offered by the bank.

The legislation needs substantial improvement. There are provisions relating to enforcement of obligations but New Zealand lags behind other countries in that it has no provision for class actions where a group of investors bring proceedings on behalf of others in a setting where loss has been suffered. Our rules of procedure provide for "representative actions' which have significant limitations.

Amidst claims by the Government that National is stealing Labour policy is the reality that the reverse is in fact true. The illustrations are countless and include the following (links to releases available on www.richardworth.co.nz)
