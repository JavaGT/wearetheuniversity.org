Maharey must explain scholarship timing

Maharey must explain scholarship timing

National Party Education spokesman Bill English says Education Minister Steve Maharey must explain why it is taking so long for scholarship exam results to be released.

The results are now scheduled to be released to students on February 23, almost one month later than NCEA results, despite the fact that the marking was completed in mid-January.

Mr English says that by the time students receive their results most will have started tertiary study.

"Releasing exam results so late that they come out after students have made all their choices is nonsense. Being thorough is one thing, but this is beyond a joke.

"After last year's mess, Labour is so paranoid about the results that they have forgotten about the students who should have had the results when making decisions about their futures.

"We know the results are ready now because they were accidentally posted on NZQA's website last Saturday for a few hours."

Mr English says he looks forward to Mr Maharey's explanation as to why they are so late.
