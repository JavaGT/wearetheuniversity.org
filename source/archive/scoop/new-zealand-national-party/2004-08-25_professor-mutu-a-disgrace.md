Professor Mutu a disgrace

An assertion by Professor Margaret Mutu that government action over the ownership of the foreshore and seabed will lead 'inevitably to civil war' is disgraceful, says National's Associate spokesman for Treaty and Constitutional Issues, Wayne Mapp.

Professor Mutu's comments came in a submission to the select committee this afternoon.

"On questioning she was absolutely adamant that a Palestinian-style insurrection would break out in the North with all the violence of bombings and shootings that that entails," says Dr Mapp.

"For a senior Auckland University professor to make such inflammatory statements is simply outrageous.

"Her statements make one wonder about the University's employment policies.

"Freedom of speech does not extend so far as to threaten civil war. That is tantamount to treason.

"I can only hope the University of Auckland will distance itself from such dangerous and extremist rhetoric," says Dr Mapp.
