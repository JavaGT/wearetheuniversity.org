Hon Roger Sowry Announces Retirement

National Party President Judy Kirk has acknowledged the outstanding contribution to the National Party and New Zealand politics by Hon Roger Sowry.

Roger has been a member of the Party since 1977, and held many Party positions up to being elected to Parliament in 1990 as the MP for Kapiti.

In Government, he held the positions of Junior and Senior Whip, Minister of Social Services, Work and Income, Leader of the House, Minister of Social Welfare, Minister in charge of War Pensions, and Associate Minister of Health. Roger also had a key role in the negotiation of a coalition agreement with New Zealand First, following the 1996 election.

In Opposition, Roger has been the spokesman on Health and Transport, and is currently the spokesman on Labour and Industrial Relations, and Energy.

As Deputy Leader of the Party, Roger was a member of the National Management Board and played an important role during the constitutional changes.

Judy Kirk said she understood and respected his decision.

"I am delighted that Roger has offered to assist with the candidates' college and help in any way leading up to the 2005 election.

"It has been a pleasure working with Roger. I wish him and Shirley every success for the future."
