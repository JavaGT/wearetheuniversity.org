National selects Karl Varley as Wigram candidate

The National Party has announced Karl Varley will be its candidate for the Wigram electorate at the 2014 General Election.

“Karl brings a thorough understanding of Christchurch issues and will run a strong campaign in Wigram,” said Canterbury-Westland Regional Chair Roger Bridge.

  
Mr Varley said he was honoured to be selected and looking forward to the challenge ahead.

“It’s an honour to be selected as National’s Wigram candidate,” says Mr Varley.

“Canterbury communities have been well-served by a Government which is making the rebuild a priority, investing in better public services, and building a stronger economy with more jobs.

“I will be working hard to win the support of our communities to give Wigram a strong voice in John Key’s National Party.
