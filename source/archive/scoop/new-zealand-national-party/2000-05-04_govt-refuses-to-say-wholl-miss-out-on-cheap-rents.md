Minister refuses to say who'll miss out on cheap rents

Thousands of State house tenants deserve to know now whether they'll be lucky enough to qualify when Labour introduces income-related rents, National's Housing spokesman Tony Ryall said today.

"The Housing Minister's announcement today totally ignores the uncertainty that state house and low-income tenants are facing over whether or not they'll get these cheaper rents.

"These are people on benefits or low-incomes with little money to spare, and they are all expecting Labour to deliver on its promise of cheaper rents. These people deserve to know now whether they will be hit by big rent costs after December 1 when they've all been led to believe their rent will go down.

"Ask any state house tenant - they'll tell you they thought they would get income-related rents under Labour.

"Labour has got state house tenants' hopes up. Housing Minister Mark Gosche should reassure them that their rent is coming down and when," says Mr Ryall.
