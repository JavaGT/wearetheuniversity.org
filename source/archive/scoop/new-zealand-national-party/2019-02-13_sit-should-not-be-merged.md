SIT should not be merged
========================

Sarah Dowie - MP for Invercargill

13 February 2019

  
Southern Institute of Technology should not be merged under a Government proposal, Invercargill MP Sarah Dowie says.

“Students who speak highly of their SIT experience cement SIT’s reputation as an institution of choice. SIT feeds into our Southland Regional Development Strategy to attract 10,000 more people to Southland by 2025 and has helped diversify our community.

“Under today’s announcement, all of the decision making about what’s best for Southland will be stripped from us and given to Wellington bureaucrats. The could lead to mass job losses.

“This undermines the unique character of SIT and erodes local autonomy.

“SIT’s pastoral care regime is tailored to Southland and is one of the reasons why so many mature students and families are attracted to the region for study.

“SIT had a $3 million surplus and is regarded as one of the most successful ITP’s in the country. This surplus would be absorbed into deficits north – it’s not fair, hands off our money.”
