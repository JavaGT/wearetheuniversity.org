Public need reassurance about navy ship

National Party Defence spokesman Wayne Mapp says Defence Minister Phil Goff must reassure the public that the lives of our servicemen and women are not being put at risk by the serious issues raised about HMNZS Canterbury.

“Following a report last night, the Minister must tell the public what issues he is aware of with the Canterbury.

“Issues such as broaching and propeller emergence, as reported last night, are of particular concern, given that New Zealand Navy ships must be capable of operating safely in the rough conditions of the South Pacific.

“National raised concerns about the Canterbury when the contract for its construction was first awarded.

“We were particularly concerned about the Government’s decision to buy a one-off unproven ship in preference to a well-proven Dutch design that had already been built for three navies around the world.

“Our concern was that choosing a one-off model could lead to unproven design risks – concerns that now seem to have been realised.

“A small Defence Force like New Zealand’s should always purchase well-proven designs.”
