Rt Hon Wyatt Creech  
Opposition Health spokesperson

HEALTHLINE DELAY UNNECCESSARY

The four-month delay to the new 24-hour freephone Healthline is disappointing and unnecessary, Opposition Health spokesperson Wyatt Creech said today.

"The National Government announced in May that the new Healthline would be up and running in January. Health officials have been working since then to get it in place.

"But new Health Minister Annette King blocked it when the Government changed, and now the whole thing has been delayed.

"The delay did not need to happen and is really disappointing for the people on, the East Coast, Northland, the West Coast and Canterbury.

"They will now have to wait longer to access the Healthline which was to help ensure they had the right health services, from the right person at the right time."
