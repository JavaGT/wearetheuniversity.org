Bullies quivering in fear at Labour’s ‘resource ca

Bullies quivering in fear at Labour’s ‘resource cards’

Bullies will be quivering in fear at Labour’s latest waste of good education money, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.

“Hot on the heels of ‘Wassup’ badges for Maori education, comes Education Minister Chris Carter’s latest flagrant waste of money – ‘personal information cards’ to combat bullying.

“This is beyond a joke. How is giving every student from Year Three a ‘personal information card’ informing them about ways to keep safe in their school environment going to do a thing to prevent bullying?

“I can just see seven-year-olds waving the cards in the face of the lunchbox thief.

“Chris Carter has totally lost the plot on this one. Has he not learnt anything from the Wassup incident?

“Taxpayers want their education dollars spent on teaching children to read, write, and do maths.

“Schools are crumbling, literacy and numeracy levels are disgraceful, and parents are being forced to pay more and more to prop their children’s schools up.

“Labour delivers them Wassup badges and bullying cards.”
