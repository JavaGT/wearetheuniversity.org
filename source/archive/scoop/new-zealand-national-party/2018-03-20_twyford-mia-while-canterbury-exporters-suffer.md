Twyford MIA while Canterbury exporters suffer

National is demanding the Transport Minister show his face and step in on behalf of the transport sector as unions continue their chokehold Canterbury exporters, Transport spokesperson Jami-Lee Ross says.

“Rail and Maritime Union members have just this afternoon announced they will resume strike action and plan to walk off the job at the Lyttleton Port from midnight tonight for five days.

“This is the sixth strike notice this union has issued since Phil Twyford became the Minister of Transport six months ago – and he is yet to wade in and speak out in support of the sector he represents.

“These unions are clearly becoming emboldened by this kid-glove treatment this Government gives them and Canterbury’s hardworking manufacturers and exporters are suffering for it.

“The Unions know that the more disruption they cause, the more likely they are to force the Government to side with their excessive demands.

“Our transport industry continues to be held to ransom and the New Zealanders who rely on coastal transport are the losers for it,” Mr Ross says.
