**MP Foss visits Peka Peka wetlands**

  
Peka Peka swamp alongside SH2 south of Hastings, once a healthy wetland and food source for Maori, is being returned to its former beauty. An outdoor education centre will also be built.

Craig Foss MP for Tukituki took the opportunity to see firsthand how the project was progressing. He said “The work that has already been completed is very impressive. The expertise of the Regional Council and the generosity of community groups and individuals is turning Peka Peka into a reference and champion site for other projects. This is a fantastic example, visible to thousands who pass the wetlands everyday, of what a difference can be made by turning a dumping site and swamp into a thriving wetlands.”

\"I was fascinated to learn that the material from the long demolished Mayfair site in Hastings had been illegally dumped on the Peka Peka site. Some of the remains have been left exposed as a reminder of how the area used to be viewed as a wasteland. The contrast between the ugly demolition material and the beautiful new wetlands is stunning."

Ten years ago the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council began the Peka Peka restoration project. Helicopter and ground spraying has targeted the willows in particular. Community and school groups have put in many volunteer hours at the swamp. The Council’s clearing programme has improved the flow of water through the wetland, and controlled animal and plant pests.

“The official opening is scheduled for October. The end project is planned to be an educational site for all to enjoy. Such forward thinking is what makes our region one of the best to live in,” said Craig.
