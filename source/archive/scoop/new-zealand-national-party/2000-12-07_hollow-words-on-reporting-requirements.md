Hollow words on reporting requirements

Education Minister Trevor Mallard's proposed changes for school reporting requirements are hollow words, National's Education spokesperson Nick Smith said today.

"Mr Mallard talks about wanting to give parents, communities and government better information.

"This is the Minister that cancelled national testing for literacy and numeracya in primary schools, is proposing to downgrade secondary school qualifications by not giving percentage marks and who is on the public record promoting the abolition of the Education Review Office.

"No amount of bureaucratic report writing will substitute for abolishing the key tools in measuring student and school performance.

"Mr Mallard's record makes a joke of any new reporting requirements," Dr Smith said.
