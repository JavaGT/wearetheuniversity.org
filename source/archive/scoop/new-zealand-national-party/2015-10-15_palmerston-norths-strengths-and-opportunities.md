Regional Economic Activity Report highlights Palmerston North’s strengths and opportunities

Today the Minister for Economic Development released the 2015 Regional Economic Activity Report. This report includes information on regions in New Zealand and how regions compare with national averages.

The report by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment provides the most recent facts from Statistics New Zealand on the economy of each region. It supports the Government’s Business Growth Agenda by increasing understanding of the New Zealand economy and its component regional economies.  
“This report reinforces Palmerston North’s strengths and highlights areas of development for our city and region,” National List MP Jono Naylor says.

“It is encouraging to see the report showcase our solid foundation based on the primary sector and our increasing diversification as a region.

“As this report indicates, we need to do more to boost incomes in Palmerston North. This report highlights some of the opportunities for growth in our city and region. These include tourism, business and logistics.

“Our region contributes 4% of New Zealand’s GDP.  

“I am encouraged that in certain areas we are competing well with the rest of New Zealand. These include Home Affordability and Education, particularly Māori Student Achievement,” Naylor says.
