Child Abuse Reports Despicable

Child Abuse Reports Despicable

A report showing almost half the students in two South Island special secondary schools have been sexually abused is despicable, says National’s Child Policy and Disability spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.

The New Zealand Herald today reported Australian academic, Professor Freda Briggs findings that 44% of the 115 boys and girls surveyed at two South Island special schools had been abused, ranging from “rude games” to rape.

“Any abuse of children is unacceptable and sexual abuse of children with disabilities is despicable,” says Dr Hutchison.

“Professor Briggs considers a picture of cause and effect, where some children were abused because they were disabled, and others likely suffered from mental and learning disabilities because they had been abused.

  
“These children deserve a level of protection that this Government is failing to provide. The Briggs study shows us how we can do that through a number of sensible and research substantiated recommendations.

“The study makes it clear that while the task of teaching these children how to be safe is a difficult one, it can still be done and it must be done.

“While one always has to be careful with results of single surveys, both the Disability and Education Minister must urgently investigate these very serious findings.”
