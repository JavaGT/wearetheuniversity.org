Govt hypocritical and alarmist on schools

Steve Maharey’s hysterical reaction to National’s suggestion of using private money to build state schools is both alarmist hype and the height of hypocrisy, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

“Labour has overseen, and continues to fund, a rapid expansion in private education provision.

“Steve Maharey’s disgust for private provision of education is fascinating, given that his Government has done exactly that with early childhood provision in the past eight years.

“The hypocrisy continues in the compulsory sector, with Labour shelling out more than $320 million to private schools since becoming Government. Steve Maharey should come clean on whether his vehement opposition to any private involvement in education means that current funding is at risk.

“What National is proposing is actually mainstream Labour policy in both the UK and Australia, where the model has proved incredibly successful.

“Public Private Partnerships (PPP) allow the private sector to reduce costs and share the risks, allowing teachers to concentrate on teaching, not buildings and facilities.”

In New South Wales, nine primary and secondary schools have opened using this partnership, and a further 10 schools are now under development. The NSW Treasury has found them to be ‘an improvement on traditional public sector delivery.’ The state of Victoria is looking at the same options.

“And in the UK, the darling of the ‘third way’, Tony Blair, has done exactly that – with great results. By autumn 2007, there will be 80 academies, or independent state schools, open - with a further 50 expected to open by autumn 2008. Steve Maharey is now criticising what is the accepted and proven policy of governments he has previously had high praise for.

“Schools are, and will remain, the heart of our communities. Their strength comes from the leadership of principals, the dedication and professionalism of teachers, the involvement of parents and, of course, the contribution of students.

“National believes in education being of the highest standard. We expect students to be given the very best education, and make no excuses for expecting the environment they work in to be of a similar high quality.”
