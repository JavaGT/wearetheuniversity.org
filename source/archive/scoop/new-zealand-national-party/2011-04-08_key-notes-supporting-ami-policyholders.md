Key Notes: Supporting AMI Policyholders
=======================================

**Friday, 8 April 2011, 7:25 pm**

**08 April 2011**  
**Key Notes: Supporting AMI Policyholders**  
From the moment the earthquake struck, the Government has given its full support to Canterbury.  
That's why Finance Minister Bill English announced a [back-up support package for AMI Insurance policyholders yesterday](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15135.link) . It's about giving tens of thousands of policyholders the certainty they need and making sure the rebuilding of Canterbury is not delayed.  
The Government will invest in AMI only as a last resort and we'll take every possible step to minimise the cost. If AMI is unable to raise capital itself, as a last resort the company would ask the Government to invest up to $500 million of equity in AMI, with the right to take ownership and control of the company.  
We'll know more about the full extent of claims AMI faces in the months ahead, so I'll keep you posted.  
National is committed to rebuilding Canterbury. Other recent steps we've taken include the creation of [a new government agency to lead the rebuilding efforts](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15136.link), and the [extension of our business and employment assistance packages](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15137.link).  
**CONDOLENCES TO ROGER KIRK'S FAMILY**  
I was saddened by [Roger Kirk's sudden and tragic death](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15138.link) on Wednesday. I knew Roger well and he was a good friend of the National Party. My thoughts are with Roger's family and friends.  
**VISITING TAUPO**  
[](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15139.link)  
Yesterday I was in Taupo, which is a great part of the country. I chatted to workers at the Tenon sawmill, caught up with Dairy Business Conference attendees, and met the great residents and staff at Summerset Retirement Village.

**BUILDING A STRONGER ECONOMY**  
National is pressing on with its comprehensive economic plan and working hard to build the foundations for a stronger economy. At the beginning of this month a few changes came in:  
• We cut company tax to 28 per cent.  
• Our employment law package came into effect, including the [extension of the successful 90-day trial period](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15140.link).  
• [Benefits and pensions increased to keep pace with rising costs](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15141.link).  
These changes are about creating jobs, boosting incomes, and protecting our most vulnerable.  
**TACKLING BULLYING**  
One of my priorities as Prime Minister is making sure Kiwi kids get the opportunities they need to reach their full potential. That's why National is taking a tough stance on bullying in schools. I'm determined that we'll do everything possible to make sure schools are as safe as possible for our young people.  
Education Minister Anne Tolley has written to all boards of trustees to reaffirm their responsibilities. We want boards and school principals to work together to make sure they have a good plan in place to tackle bullying.  
**MAKING OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER**  
Police Minister Judith Collins recently announced that recorded [crime dropped last year by 6.7 per cent](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-15142.link). This is good news for New Zealanders and a credit to our law enforcement officers.  
National is relentlessly focused on tackling crime and making our communities safer. We're committed to addressing the problem of crime in this country and we're making good progress.  
**FROM MY DIARY**  
Next week I'm speaking at the Age Concern conference in Wellington on Tuesday, I'll be in Christchurch on Thursday and Rotorua on Friday, and I'm off to the V8s next Saturday.  
Best wishes,
