Urgent inquiry needed into Onehunga 111 fiasco

National’s Law and Order spokesman, Tony Ryall, wants an investigation into the Onehunga High School 111 fiasco.

A group of 15 ‘thugs’ armed with wood and a hammer terrorised the school, leaving the principal, a teacher, and a student injured.

"The school principal says it took multiple phone calls and 25 minutes for police to get there. The police say it took 10 minutes.

"The 111 system remains a weeping sore – the symbol of Labour's neglect of policing and safety.

"This has been a dreadful and shocking act of violence. The public expect a rapid response. What went on here?

“National expects full disclosure by the authorities. In the past, complaints have been met with a wall of indifference. Urgent action is needed.

"I daresay that if these thugs had been speeding from the school at 62 kilometres an hour, a police officer would have been there straight away,” Mr Ryall says.
