Maori incomes fall further behind

Maori incomes fall further behind

The gap between what Maori and Pakeha earn has steadily increased under Labour, says National’s Maori Affairs (Culture & Development) spokeswoman, Georgina te Heuheu.

“On Tuesday, the Prime Minister spoke of reducing inequalities, yet a look at income parity between Māori and Pakeha reveals a widening gap.”

The New Zealand Income Survey shows that in 2000, Māori aged over 15 earned 82% of what Pakeha earned. In 2007, Māori aged over 15 earned just 73% of what Pakeha earned.

“The growing disparity in incomes is even more alarming when considered in dollar terms. In 2000, Maori aged over 15 earned $86 a week less than Pakeha. Last year, Maori aged over 15 earned $197 a week less than Pakeha.

“Labour came into office promising to close the gaps between Maori and Pakeha. Despite all Labour’s rhetoric, the income gap has widened significantly.

“It is no wonder incomes are not improving when Maori students are failing in far higher numbers than Pakeha at school, and when little has been done to address chronic truancy.

“Labour has had almost nine years to improve outcomes for Maori and has, instead, left a legacy of neglect.”
