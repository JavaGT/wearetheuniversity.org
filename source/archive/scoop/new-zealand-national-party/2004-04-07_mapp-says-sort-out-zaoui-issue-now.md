Mapp says sort out Zaoui issue now

Sorting out the future of Ahmed Zaoui must be the new Inspector-General of Security's first job, says National's Immigration spokesman, Dr Wayne Mapp.

He says a new Inspector-General must be appointed urgently.

Dr Mapp is commenting on Matt Robson's complaint to the Police Complaints Authority, which he says is only intended to drag out the issue.

"It is the new Inspector-General's job to decide whether or not Mr Zaoui is a national security risk.

"But instead, the Inspector-General is likely to be blocked from doing his job by a new wave of litigation from Mr Zaoui's lawyers.

"The Belgium Appeal Court found Mr Zaoui guilty of involvement with terrorist organisations.

"The Refugee Status Appeals Authority was wrong to substitute the fully argued case in Belgium, which was emphatic that Mr Zaoui was a danger to Belgium's security, with their own one-sided version.

"It is time we stopped spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on prolonged litigation, appointed a new Inspector-General, and let him get on with his job", says Dr Mapp.
