Southern area widely affected by rotting homes

The rotting homes crisis is affecting Central Otago more than previously realised, says National’s Housing spokesman Wayne Mapp, after speaking at a public meeting in Queenstown today.

Fifty people attended the lunchtime meeting organised by National, including homeowners from as far away as South Canterbury and Invercargill. Dr Mapp and Queenstown lawyer Philip Wilson addressed the meeting.

“The problem in Central Otago is widespread because there has been much development there in recent years. We also had people from Timaru and Invercargill travel long distances to the meeting because they are so concerned about their problem homes.

“The only way to find out the true scale of the problem is to inspect every home built with monolithic cladding and untreated timber. Otherwise many people may not even realise their homes are at risk.

“We are still pushing for the Government to initiate inspections of homes built since 1996,” Dr Mapp said.

Dr Mapp said he would follow up an issue raised at the meeting by a lawyer who questioned the responsibility of insurance companies in relation to rotting homes.

Today’s meeting was the ninth public meeting organised by National for concerned homeowners since September.
