National calls for investigation at Canterbury DHB

National calls for investigation at Canterbury DHB

National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall, is calling for an immediate independent investigation into Canterbury DHB’s security systems, following revelations a woman obtained photo ID and posed as a registered nurse at several Christchurch hospitals.

The woman faked a permission form to get Canterbury DHB photo ID, which identified her as a registered nurse and Maori health worker.

“For an impostor to be given a security clearance ID card on false pretences is very serious,” says Mr Ryall.

“Impostors have previously provided treatment to patients, which is incredibly dangerous.

“Canterbury DHB says it has spent $1.4 million on security – that is wasted money if patients cannot be protected from impostors and crooks.

“There needs to be an immediate independent investigation to obtain an assurance that this sort of fraudulent act will never happen again and that patients have not been put at risk."
