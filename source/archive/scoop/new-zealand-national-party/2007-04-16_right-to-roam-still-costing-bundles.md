Right to roam still costing bundles

Rural Affairs Minister Damien O'Connor needs to reveal how much taxpayer money he has wasted on Labour's right to roam agenda, says National's Agriculture spokesman, David Carter.

Answers to parliamentary questions show that to date Labour has spent $599,063 of taxpayer money on its Walking Access Consultation Panel.

"The figure has risen by nearly $200,000 since February and it's not even the final bill.

"The bill keeps going up. Is the work continuing by stealth, even though Labour has tried to give the impression they have backed down?

"Rural New Zealanders will be outraged if that is the case.

"What we know is that Labour is continuing to spend hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on a failed concept that was roundly rejected by landowners. Even city dwellers saw it for the attack on private property rights that it was. "The right to roam plans caused angst and uncertainty for farmers, cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in the end we were virtually left with the status quo.

"Everyone thought that was the end of it. Why won't Labour let it lie?"
