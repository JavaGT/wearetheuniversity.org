Hodgson condoning patient suffering

Health Minister Pete Hodgson must immediately instruct DHBs to get back to the negotiating table as provincial hospitals prepare for another week of disruption, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.

He is commenting on reports that the radiographers’ union is ready to negotiate, but DHBs have refused.

“By sitting on his hands and ignoring this crisis, Mr Hodgson is condoning the suffering of patients up and down the country,” says Mr Ryall.

"He has become too distracted supporting the Mallard dirt-file and the pledge card scandal to deal with it.

"He calls himself Labour’s strategist. He's doing a hopeless job in health, with the sector facing never-ending industrial chaos.

"The Government has been told that thousands more patients will be affected this week. Two days of industrial action disrupts all kinds of surgery and hospital care.

“Mr Hodgson told DHBs earlier this year he had an appetite for industrial action – patients are paying for that this week.

"The Government must instruct its DHB negotiators to go back to the table. It’s not too late to avoid another week of disruption,” says Mr Ryall.
