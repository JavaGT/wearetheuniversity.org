Another speed camera scam

National's Police spokesman Tony Ryall says demerit points for speed camera tickets will be another foul-up that won't do much for road safety.

Commenting on Labour's proposal - expected in early December - to copy New South Wales and Victoria in slapping demerit points on speed camera tickets, Mr Ryall says the only result there has been a jump in the number of scams.

"In Victoria, there is demerit point trading. It is not uncommon for family members to transfer demerit points between themselves to avoid getting a disqualification period.

"And in some companies, it is not unheard of for other staff to accept demerit points so top salespeople can keep their cars on the road. "It's illegal and dishonest - and apparently widespread.

"The fact is, Victoria's road toll has remained virtually unchanged for the past ten years, yet New Zealand's has dropped 37% over the same time.

"And New South Wales' road toll has fallen only 3% over the same period, despite motorists being hit with double demerit points at times," says Mr Ryall.

"Why adopt road safety policies that have failed in Australia?"

"Transport Minister Paul Swain should stop looking across the Tasman for guidance and target what's happening on the roads here.

"He's grasping at straws. Lower tolerances, hidden cameras and now demerit points on speed camera tickets, all miss the point. What the Government should be focussing on is police visibility, driver fatigue, seatbelts and drink driving," says Mr Ryall.
