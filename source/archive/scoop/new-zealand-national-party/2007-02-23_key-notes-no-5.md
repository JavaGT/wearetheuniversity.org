Key Notes No. 5

  
23 February 2007

  
I have spent the last few weeks exploring some of the themes I outlined in my Burnside speech - in particular, my belief that there should be opportunity for all kids, regardless of background.

National's Food in Schools initiative, which I launched on February 3, has been running very successfully. We have been working to put generous corporate donors in touch with needy schools. The charity KidsCan has already benefited from donations from Tasti Foods and James Crisp Ltd.

As a result of the publicity about this issue, KidsCan has been overwhelmed by demand from schools for food for hungry pupils - despite the Labour Government's denial that there is a need for this kind of help.

  
Recent visits

Following my visit to McGehan Close at the beginning of this month, I was invited back to the area by entrepreneur Scott Gilmour to learn more about his â€˜I Have a Dream' programme. The project aims to give better opportunities to disadvantaged children.

Four years ago, an entire Year 4 class of Wesley Primary School students was â€˜adopted' onto the scheme, including three children from McGehan Close. The trust then pledged to work with them until they finish high school in 2012 and will pay for tertiary education if any of the children choose to go on with further studies.

This is exactly the kind of innovative programme - providing real opportunities for Kiwi kids - that we want to support in both opposition and government.

After our successful caucus meeting in Gisborne, I made a return visit this week to learn more about Maori cultural and economic development in the region.

Myself and my colleagues - including our Maori Affairs spokespeople Georgina te Heuheu and Tau Henare - were extremely impressed with the organisations that we met, such as the Tairawhiti Museum and the iwi governing bodies Te Runanga o Nagati Porou and Te Runanga o Turanganui-a-Kiwa.

I found the kapa haka at Ngata Memorial College especially moving. The school is named after Sir Apirana Ngata, who was an MP from 1905-1943 for the National Party and its forerunners, and for whom I have tremendous respect. The legacy of his leadership remains in the legislation he led related to Maori land tenure and development, Maori social and cultural advancement, retention of the Maori language and his emphasis on the importance of education.

  
Taito Philip Field

Unfortunately, the beginning of the parliamentary year last week was tainted with the continuing saga of Taito Philip Field.

Despite having described Field as unethical and immoral, it was not until he publicly rained on her parade by talking about standing against Labour on the day of her big speech that Helen Clark finally chose to start the process to expel him from the Labour Party.

Without an overall majority in the House, the Government now faces the prospect of being held to ransom by potentially unreliable political allies. Helen Clark will now have to decide whether it is morally right for her to continue to rely on Field's vote.

  
New Member

We recently welcomed a new MP to Parliament - Katrina Shanks - who has replaced Don Brash from the National Party list. Katrina delivered a very good maiden speech on Tuesday - talking about her personal values and what she hopes to achieve in Parliament.

Katrina is based in the Ohariu-Belmont electorate in Wellington and I'm sure she will serve the interests of the local area with both enthusiasm and commitment. I am delighted to have her on board.
