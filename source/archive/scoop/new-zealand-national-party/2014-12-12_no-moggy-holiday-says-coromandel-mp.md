No Moggy Holiday says Coromandel MP

Scott Simpson  
MP For Coromandel

**No Moggy Holiday says Coromandel MP**

There is support from a Government MP for the NZ Veterinary Association’s call for a strategy to ensure the welfare of cats and the protection of New Zealand’s wildlife.

Coromandel MP, Scott Simpson, says the impact of feral, stray and companion cats is a significant wildlife conservation issue in the Coromandel.

“With tens of thousands of summer visitors headed to the Coromandel over the next month or two, I hope those with cats will think twice about bringing them on holiday. Our precious native birds are under enough threat without having even more cats on a summer feeding tour.

“Each year a percentage of those visiting cats end up not going home with their owners, only adding to our already large feral cat problem.

“Rather than simply packing the family moggy up and taking them on holiday, I’d encourage cat owners to make other arrangements for their pets this summer.
