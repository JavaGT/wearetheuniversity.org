Wananga Mess Entirely Labour's Making

Wananga mess entirely Labour's making

National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the mess at Te Wananga o Aotearoa is entirely of Labour's making.

The Minster of Education today approved an urgent $20 million loan to help meet the wananga's immediate financial needs.

Mr English says it is typical of Labour to throw money at a problem in the hope that it will go away.

"Labour has been throwing taxpayers' money at the wänanga for six years now without demanding anything in return in the way of standards or accountability.

"The wänanga has been encouraged by Labour's policy that provides strong incentives for it to enrol thousands of students in large-scale, low-cost courses.

"Labour was never sure that the students enrolled in these courses started them, let alone completed them.

"Mr Mallard also spent $120,000 on a consultant to watch over the wänanga. Either he chose to ignore the advice of the consultant or it was a waste of money.

"Because of Labour's stupid tertiary policy this will be the first of many taxpayer bailouts of tertiary institutions going broke.

"It is time Helen Clark held the Minister of Education to account for the trail of carnage he has left in the tertiary education sector," says Mr English.
