National’s position on therapeutic goods unchanged

National’s position on therapeutic goods unchanged

The National Party’s position on the trans-Tasman Therapeutic Goods regime is the same today as it has been since the proposal was first examined by a select committee in 2003, says National Party Leader John Key.

“If the Government removes the complementary medicines from the legislation, then we will support it. If they don’t, we won’t.

“That has been our position since 2003 and continues to be our position.

“I have personally explained our position to Australian Prime Minister John Howard, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, and High Commissioner John Dauth. I have also explained it to Helen Clark and Michael Cullen.

“Today’s NZ Herald story misrepresents our position. The story correctly quotes me as saying ‘If they came to us now with that proposal, we will sign it.’

“I was, of course, referring to the Trans-Tasman Therapeutic Goods regime - not the proposal put up by NZ First. I repeatedly made that clear to the NZ Herald yesterday.

“National has never received a copy of the NZ First proposal, to the best of our knowledge.

“Our position is simple: If complementary medicines are removed from the regime, National will support it.

“We have stated our position in thousands of letters and emails to concerned New Zealanders, to Government ministers verbally on many occasions, and in:

\* The National Party’s minority report on the select committee inquiry, 18 June 2004.  
\* A letter from former National Party Leader Don Brash to the Prime Minister, on 7 July 2004.  
\* A letter from Murray McCully and Tony Ryall to Phil Goff and Annette King, on 30 June 2006.  
\* A letter from Tony Ryall to Health Minister Annette King, on 12 September 2006.

“If we are presented with a proposal from the Government that meets our position, we will support it. If the Government doesn’t, then we won’t.”
