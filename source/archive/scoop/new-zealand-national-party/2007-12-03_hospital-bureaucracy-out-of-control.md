Hospital bureaucracy out of control
===================================

Hospital bureaucracy out of control

The number of hospital managers will top 10,000 in the next year, showing that the health bureaucracy is out of control under Labour, says National's Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.

\"And this army of bureaucrats does not include the 1,250 Ministry of Health staff. Nor does it include managers in the 81 PHOs or endless consultants."

National is releasing information today which shows the number of health managers and administrators have grown by a quarter - or almost 2000 staff - since Labour came to office.

"At the same time, the number of vitally needed hospital doctors increased by only 1,200.

"The health bureaucracy is growing out of control, while far too many patients are forced to wait and wait for operations and specialist's appointments.

"When thousands and thousands of patients have been culled from hospital waiting lists, this massive bureaucracy is an appalling indictment on Labour's policies.

"This past financial year alone has seen a massive $544 million spent on hospital managers and administrators.

"Last month, National revealed over the past six years, the payroll at the Ministry of Health rocketed by 55% and staff numbers increased by 24%.\*

"Fewer Kiwis are getting elective surgery on a population basis since Labour came to office. Labour has bought bureaucrats instead of operations.

"Helen Clark promised to cut a swathe through the health bureaucracy. But typical Labour, the health bureaucracy has become fatter and fatter".
