Cullen's tertiary reforms off to disastrous start

Michael Cullen's tertiary reforms are off to a shocking start with the last minute news today that Otago University won't be receiving the funding that the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) had indicated, says National's Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.

"Labour's so-called reforms are supposed to be 'high trust and low compliance', but after months of negotiation the university has been let down by TEC three hours before the agreement was due to be signed.

"TEC has a huge bureaucracy of over 340 staff, and has hired 13 'investment' managers and 13 'strategic stakeholder' managers in order to help 'streamline' the plans.

"If this is an example of Michael Cullen's streamlining, we should be very afraid.

"In the past eight years Labour has made numerous attempts to reform tertiary education. This has cost over $400 million, and resulted in no gains. This money would have been much better spent on education, rather than bureaucrats.

"It is ominous that even before the tertiary reforms have been formally implemented, a major university such as Otago has been let down at the eleventh hour."
