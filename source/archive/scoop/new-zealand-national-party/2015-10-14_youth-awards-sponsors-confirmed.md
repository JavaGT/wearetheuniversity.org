Youth Awards sponsors confirmed

A huge number of Hutt Valley businesses and organisations have been confirmed for the inaugural Hutt City Youth Awards, a new initiative designed to shine a light on talented young people in Hutt City.

Chair of the organising committee, Chris Bishop MP, says that he and the organising committee have been overwhelmed by the response from local organisations.

“It’s great to see the community getting behind this new initiative. Thanks to all who have come on board as sponsors and supporters.

“The platinum sponsor is WelTec, which is highly appropriate as a tertiary institution with a significant Hutt presence, educating and training our young people.

“Each of the eight award categories have major sponsors as well. The prizes for each category winner include both a monetary prize, as well as a special experience for each winner that will help them in the future – such as a mentorship or support.”

Sponsors of the award categories are:

• Westpac (sponsor of the Award for Overcoming Adversity)  
•  
• Label and Litho (sponsor of the Leadership award)  
•  
• The Hodge Group (entrepreneurship)  
•  
• Weltec (service to the community)  
•  
• GNS Science (science and technology)  
•  
• The Dowse Art Museum (the arts)  
•  
• Ignite Sport (contribution to sport)  
•  
• Natraj School of Dance (tolerance and diversity)

Other sponsors include Hutt City Council, the Hutt Valley Chamber of Commerce, Ignite Sport, Pete’s Emporium, and Hutt Radio.

“The response to the Hutt City Youth Awards has been very positive – in fact we’ve decided to extend the nominations deadline out to the 6th of November,” Mr Bishop says.

The Hutt City Youth Awards are open to all young people aged 12 to 21 with a strong connection to Lower Hutt. Nominations close on 6 November 2015, and the Awards Ceremony will be held on 3 December 2015.
