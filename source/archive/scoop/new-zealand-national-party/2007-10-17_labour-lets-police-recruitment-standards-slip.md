Labour lets police recruitment standards slip

The Government has allowed physical and mental entry standards for police recruits to slip just so it can keep NZ First happy, says National's Police spokesman, Chester Borrows.

"The report on Police Standards and Assessment Practice confirms there are now lower minimum entry criteria on two important physical recruitment standards, and in reasoning and mental ability tests.

"Last year they increased the times that recruits have to complete the 2.4km run, to take account of age and gender, and lowered the wall-climb test from 1.8 metres (6ft) to 1.2 metres (4ft).

"The report says these changes 'did not follow a sound and rigorous process to ensure the changes were defensible', and 'lacked a sound rationale or research evidence on which to base the changes'.

"In other words, there was no sound reason to change them, other than to allow more people to pass the entry test - they lowered the bar.

"And they did that because they were having trouble reaching their target of 1,000 police, which was their confidence and supply agreement with NZ First.

"On the performance of new recruits on the general mental ability entrance test, the report also finds that 'Overall, the changes in pass marks in Examination One support the claim that there is a decline in performance'.

"This is an acknowledgement that more people are going to Police College who would not have made it in the past, requiring extra tuition before they graduate.

"It's all very well for Annette King to say the report 'provided assurances that the Police are training recruits to an acceptable standard, and that police are capable of doing their jobs when all their training has been completed' when those who fail are put into the workforce on 'limited duties' till they pass the relevant tests.

"That is compromising public safety, and it's time Annette King admitted it.

"She said there would be no reduction in standards, but that's what's happening."
