Key Notes: Vote National

**VOTE NATIONAL FOR A STRONG, STABLE GOVERNMENT**

I'm on the National Party Bus Tour for the last couple of days of the election campaign. I'll be taking the opportunity to talk to voters in towns and cities along the way about National's plan to build a brighter future for families, and seek their support on Saturday.

I'm urging all our supporters to get out and give their party vote to National. Your party vote is crucial under MMP. Only the party vote determines the make-up of the Government after the election. Every party vote for National is vital to ensure a strong, stable National-led Government.

**OUR POST-ELECTION ACTION PLAN**

Yesterday I laid out [National's Post-Election Action Plan.](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-17758.link)

It outlines the immediate and critical steps we'll take to secure a brighter future for New Zealand families in a turbulent world.

We'll get straight back to work on making our economy stronger, by balancing the books, repaying debt, and creating more jobs. We'll also take steps in other important areas - welfare, law and order, education, health and rebuilding Canterbury.

To carry out this plan, we need a strong, stable National-led Government and only a party vote for National can deliver that.

**THANK YOU**

I'd like to say thanks to all National Party members and supporters for their hard work during the campaign.

In the lead-up to the election I've been working hard alongside our team to make sure New Zealanders know we can keep building a brighter future if they give their party vote to National this Saturday.

We've relied on the support and generosity of National Party members and supporters to fund this campaign, so I'd like to thank you for your support.

Best wishes,

  
**John Key  
Prime Minister**
