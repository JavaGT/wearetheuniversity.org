Brash meets Samoan PM

National Party Leader Don Brash today met Samoa’s most senior political figures, including the Prime Minister, Hon Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi.

“I am gaining a good understanding of the challenges facing the Samoan Government and the region from these meetings,” says Dr Brash.

He also met the Deputy Prime Minister, Hon Misa Telefoni, the Minister of Finance, Hon Niko Lee-Hang, and Governor of the Central Bank of Samoa, Leasi P. Tommy Scanlan.

“I was struck during these meetings by how important the educational opportunities in New Zealand have been in cementing the relationship between the two countries.

“This has been of great benefit to both Samoa and New Zealand,” says Dr Brash.

This afternoon Dr Brash and his party will visit the National University of Samoa, which offers programmes developed and supported by NZAid. This evening the Prime Minister of Samoa will host a dinner for Dr Brash and his colleagues.

Tomorrow, Dr Brash will watch a Fautasi (Long Boat) race, which is part of the Teuila Festival, visit a factory that makes electrical parts for vehicles, and lunch with the Minister of Finance and his officials.

Dr Brash arrives back in New Zealand on Saturday morning.

This is the second visit to a Pacific Island nation Dr Brash has undertaken this year to familiarise himself with the Pacific region. In March he visited the Cook Islands.
