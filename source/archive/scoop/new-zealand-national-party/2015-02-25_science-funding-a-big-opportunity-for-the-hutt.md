Science funding a big opportunity for the Hutt

  
Last week Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce announced government funding of $1 million for a new contestable fund to fund innovative projects aimed at helping young people engage with science and technology.

The “Unlocking Curious Minds” fund is part of the “A Nation of Curious Minds - He Whenua Hihiri I Te Mahara" national strategic plan for science in society, which was launched at Boulcott School by Ministers Joyce and Parata with Mr Bishop in July last year.

The objectives of the fund are to support projects that use innovative and best-practice approaches to help New Zealanders that have had fewer opportunities to learn about and engage with science, in particular young people aged 18 years and under.

“Science and technology is a big part of the Hutt Valley’s future, and we need many more of our young people growing up thinking about science and technology”, says Mr Bishop.

“It would be great to see Hutt Valley groups apply to the fund to get some innovative projects up and running. Lifting student engagement and achievement in science is essential if we want increase incomes and give high-tech business in the Hutt the skills they need to develop new products and grow their business.”

Through its Business Growth Agenda, the National-led government has a strong focus on science and innovation. The government is making record investments in science, research and development, and the Marsden Fund, as well as delivering programmes like the National Science Challenges. Callaghan Innovation, based in the Hutt, is the government’s HQ for high-tech businesses.
