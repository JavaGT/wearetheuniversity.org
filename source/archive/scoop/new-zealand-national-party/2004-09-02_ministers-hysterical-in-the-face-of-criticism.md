Ministers hysterical in the face of criticism

“Increasingly hysterical claims by Trevor Mallard and Steve Maharey about my criticism of the NCEA shows the government is worried about the credibility of their policy.

“A number of statements made by the Ministers are just plain wrong,” he says.

“And we have seen Mallard at his bullying, shouting, dishonest worst.

The box I presented to the NZQA contained student assessment books on the basis of which credits were awarded. These credits had been signed off by teachers.

The assessments were signed off by long-term staff, not by a relief teacher.

No teacher involved is subject to competency procedures.

The school itself confirmed problems in the New Zealand Herald last Thursday morning, before I raised the issue in the House.

There was no discussion of the matter at National’s Caucus meeting.

Sandra Goudie has not threatened to resign as a result of my actions.

“I have not apologised to the school because there is no reason to do so. Mr Mallard was lying when he said this today in Parliament,” says Mr English.

“Trevor Mallard and Steve Maharey are willing to say or do anything to shut down criticism of the NCEA but I will not be bullied like this and neither will parents and teachers.

“Mr Mallard should commit to a review of the NCEA to fix these problems which are widely acknowledged so that we can be assured of consistency and quality in the education system”.
