Where're the checks on tax-funded pilots?

Judith Collins MP  
National Party Welfare Spokeswoman

Where're the checks on tax-funded pilots?

National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins says Labour is failing dismally in its responsibility to keep tabs on tax-funded employment programmes.

\"You've got hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes being poured into different pilot programmes which aren't being evaluated. The Minister is failing in his duty to be a responsible guardian of the public purse."

Ms Collins has released the details of four separate employment programmes designed to assist those on sickness or invalids benefits get into work. They have cost the taxpayer a total of $1,172,278.

"None of these programmes has been formally evaluated. Not one!

"How can the Ministry learn from experience if it rejects a formal evaluation process?

"How can we be sure that taxpayer money hasn't been wasted and won't be wasted in the future if the Minister refuses to order proper reviews?"

Ms Collins says given the explosive growth in sickness and invalids beneficiaries under Labour, the Minister should be making sure that taxpayer money is being properly targeted.

"If Labour was serious about helping sickness and invalids beneficiaries back into work, they'd be doing their homework to make sure they're not doomed to repeat the mistakes of yesterday."
