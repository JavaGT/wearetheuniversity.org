MP for Maungakiekie Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says there has been a significant drop in the number of students being suspended, stood-down, excluded and expelled from schools in the electorate.

“Under National, kids are staying in school longer and getting better results,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Around New Zealand students are staying engaged in our classrooms. Latest figures show that since 2008, the number of suspensions in state and state-integrated schools has dropped 38 per cent.

“Here in Maungakiekie, stand-downs have dropped 6.7 per cent since 2008 and suspensions have fallen 19.1 per cent.

“Exclusions and expulsions have dropped by 24.9 per cent and 66.5 per cent respectively. These figures show we have more kids staying focused on their education.

“National has worked hard to offer more options for students to keep them engaged in learning, such as Trades Academies and Partnership Schools.

“We are supporting our teachers and school leaders to lift student achievement by helping them to collaborate and work together to share best practice in Communities of Schools.

“The Positive Behaviour for Learning (PB4L) programme is also helping create a more inclusive and supportive environment for students who need a bit more support.

“National is focusing on improving performance in the schooling system so every child has the opportunity to succeed, as we know high-quality education provides the opportunity for any child from any background to get ahead and make the most of their life,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

**_Notes for editors:_**

A stand-down is the formal removal of a student from a school for a period of up to five school days.

A suspension is the formal removal of a student from a school until the school’s board of trustees decides the outcome at a suspension meeting.

An exclusion terminates the enrolment of a student aged under 16.

An expulsion terminates the enrolment of a student aged 16 or over.
