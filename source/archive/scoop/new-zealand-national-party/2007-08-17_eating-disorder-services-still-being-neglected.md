Eating disorder services still being neglected

Eating disorder services still being neglected by Govt

National’s Women's Affairs spokeswoman, Dr Jackie Blue, wants the Health Minister to explain what he’s done to address a chronic lack of services for people with eating disorders, a year after a highly critical report was released.

“A 2006 Ministry of Health report highlighted serious shortfalls in services around the country. Not only is there a workforce shortage, but there remains a lack of specialist beds for eating disorder sufferers.

“Another major problem is a lack of national co-ordination around eating disorder services.

“I would have expected Pete Hodgson to have acted immediately to address growing concerns, but he’s done little of note.”

Dr Blue says that’s not surprising, given the ignorant and dismissive response from one of the Minister’s officials who was responding to a query by an AUT communications student.

“When asked about the regional variation in services, the official said ‘services are not always available where little boys and girls with eating disorders live’.

“That’s an appalling attitude.

“Between 10% and 15% of the population at any one time suffers from an eating disorder.

“Around 280 new cases are diagnosed each year, yet there are only 13 beds at in-patient clinics dedicated to eating disorders.

“Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa which is a life-threatening illness affecting more and more young women.

“I can only hope the Minister ignores the appallingly ignorant advice of his official and acts on his own Ministry’s report which is now over a year old – sooner rather than later.”
