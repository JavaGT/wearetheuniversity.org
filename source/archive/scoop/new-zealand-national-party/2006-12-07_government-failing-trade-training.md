Government failing trade training

Technology teaching in secondary schools is in a poor state and needs to urgently improve, says National's Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.

Mr King is seeking a briefing on the report by the PPTA, "Technology: theory without practice".

"The report gives an enlightening snapshot into the darker corners of Labour's failure to address serious teacher shortages in the technology areas of the school curriculum.

"It's disgraceful that school leavers have to take out student loans for pre-employment training to learn the things they should have learnt at school.

"The report also says many technology centres are totally inadequate and even more concerning, often unsafe.

"Such a poor state of affairs clearly demonstrates that yet again the Labour Government is heavy on rhetoric, but fails to deliver when it comes to meeting the needs of future school leavers."
