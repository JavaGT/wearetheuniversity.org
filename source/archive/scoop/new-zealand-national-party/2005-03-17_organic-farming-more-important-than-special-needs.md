Organic farming more important than special needs?

Organic farming more important than special needs?

National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says parents of children with special needs will be outraged by Trevor Mallard’s assertion that support for their child is less important than organic farming.

During Parliamentary question time Mr Mallard was asked what he would say to parents of children with special needs about his decision to spend millions on dodgy tertiary courses while their children went without vital support.

Mr Mallard replied that he would tell the parents about the Government’s support for organic farming, referring to his decision to spend $160,000 on courses on alternative therapies and homeopathy for pets.

He replied to the question by saying, “I would tell them to listen very carefully to the member, listen to him trying to run down New Zealand’s organic farmers, and I would say to them that this Government has worked very hard to get people into jobs…”

“Parents may be less than impressed to hear just how low a priority their desperate and urgent needs are,” says Mr English.

“Today a parent action group presented the Education Select Committee with evidence that children with serious complex needs have recently had their support cut.

“I suggest Mr Mallard meets with the growing number of parent action groups, and Autism New Zealand to explain his insulting and insensitive response,” says Mr English.
