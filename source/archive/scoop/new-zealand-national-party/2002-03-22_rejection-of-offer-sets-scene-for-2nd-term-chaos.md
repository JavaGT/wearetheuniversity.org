Rejection Of Govt Offer Sets Scene For Second Term Chaos

The PPTA's rejection of the Government's latest pay offer is a further blow to the secondary education sector, says National's Education spokesperson Nick Smith.

"The Government has left Year 11 (Fifth Form) students totally exposed by proceeding with the new NCEA qualification without settling the teachers dispute.

"This latest chapter in teachers' pay negotiations will only heighten the concerns of 56,000 students and their parents that their school qualification will fall victim to industrial disruption.

"The secondary education sector is in a shambles at the hands of Trevor Mallard.

"I once again urge the Prime Minister to intervene to sort out this mess so that student qualifications are not put in jeopardy," says Dr Smith.
