This weeks example of Political Correctness

Has it gone too far?

I’ve always said that the polytecs and universities are among the true spawning grounds for political correctness. This was certainly proved once again by Damien Kruz, a media commentator from Victoria University, who decided that Vernon Small of the Dom Post had “alienated and relegated” Mr Satyanand by describing him as of “Asian” ethnicity.

I had no idea that Mr Satyanand would be embarrassed by being referred as being ethnic Asian. In fact I am sure that Mr Satyanand is very proud of his Indo-Fijian roots.

Have we become so politically correct that we can’t even mention that someone is Asian? Perhaps he could have been described as a District Court judge who’s ancestors who had been the victims of British policy in India.

Labour Is Show It's PC Roots

Georgina Beyer’s Human Rights (Gender Identity) Amendment Bill has once again raised its head in Parliament this week. This is despite Helen Clark telling Beyer that her bill to protect transgender people from discrimination is “history”.

The purpose of Beyer’s Bill was to protect “gender identity”. This would cover people who call themselves “transsexual”, “transvestite”, “transgender” and “cross dresser”.

Why do we need a special law for transgender people? We don’t have laws to protect people that chose to drive certain cars or eat certain foods, why should we have a law to protect people that chose to have a certain gender?

Helen Clark’s decision to quash the Bill was intended to show that the Labour government was finally taking notice of criticism about their politically correct leadership. I have often said that sunlight is the best disinfectant.

But it now looks like the Labour Party are reverting back to their politically correct roots.

  
UK Trip

Next week I will be visiting the UK, where I will be presenting a speech on the comparisons between political correctness in New Zealand and in the UK. The event has been organised by The Campaign Against Political Correctness, an organisation with strong support for Conservative Party MPs. Exposing the absurd in both countries is certainly part of the roll back of political correctness.

  
We are moving... as of Monday 24 April the Takapuna office will be operating from our new premises at Suit 4, 15 Anzac Street, Takapuna. Please feel free to drop in to say hello and to have a look around.
