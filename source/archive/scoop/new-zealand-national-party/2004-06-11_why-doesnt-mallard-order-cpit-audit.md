Why doesn't Mallard order CPIT audit?

Why doesn't Mallard order CPIT audit?

Education Minister Trevor Mallard should be consistent and order an audit into allegations of a conflict of interest at Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

The Minister has ordered an audit into allegations of a conflict of interest at Cambridge High School, saying it would be irresponsible not to follow them up.

"A comparison of the conflict at Cambridge High School and the allegations issued at Christchurch Polytechnic shows that the Minister is applying different standards," Mr English says.

"The principal of Cambridge High, Alison Annan, is accused of using public money to benefit her private business, an international college.

"Senior staff members at CPIT, including former Christchurch Mayor Vicki Buck, are directors of a private software company which has received more than $5 million of public money as part of a deal with CPIT.

"Mr Mallard has taken high-profile, personal steps to secure an inquiry into the case of Cambridge High but has sat on his hands over CPIT.

"He has to explain why he is so motivated about one apparent conflict of interest involving Cambridge High and not at all interested in the apparent conflict involving Christchurch Polytech," Mr English says.
