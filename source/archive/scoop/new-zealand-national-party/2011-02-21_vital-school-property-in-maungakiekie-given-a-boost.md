Vital school property in Maungakiekie has been given a $2,169,257.43 boost says Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga MP for Maungakiekie.

“The Government’s Jobs and Growth package means we have new classrooms and a new non-teaching area and much needed building upgrades,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“The Government has spent a total of $2,169,257.43 million upgrading our schools in Maungakiekie This is directly benefiting our students and gives our teachers modern and effective working environments.

“ I was able to see first-hand the considerable investment made in Stanhope Road School at the recent opening of its new facilities,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“We are now spending $200 million a year more on school property than the previous government. This Government is committed to building a quality education system for our children, and I’m pleased we are seeing the benefits of this here in Maungakiekie”.

“Upgrading schools in Maungakiekie has also kept construction firms going at a time when other parts of the market have slowed down. Throughout the country, an additional 2000 jobs have been created because of this building programme.”

Jobs and Growth is the Government’s multi-billion dollar investment to fast-track important construction projects throughout New Zealand. Total spending on schools was $628 million last year and is expected to rise to $741 million over the next year.
