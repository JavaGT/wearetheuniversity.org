Collins Comments

Column - By Judith Collins.

Last Friday, I was honoured to join thousands of New Zealanders in Christchurch’s Hagley Park for the Memorial Service to those who were lost in the recent earthquake.

The service was a chance for all Christchurch, and all New Zealand to stand together and grieve. I don’t think anyone would not be moved by the strength and solidarity shown by the people of Christchurch after this terrible event. Grieving families were seated at the front of the 100,000 strong crowd. I know that they took great comfort in this inspiring service.

The aftermath could have been so much worse were it not for the courage and hard work of Police and emergency services. These extraordinary people turned up each day to help others at a time when many had, themselves, suffered loss or damage in the quake.

Our Corrections staff also played their part, ensuring the smooth running of our prisons and Community Probation Centres during this difficult time.

I also thank specialist personnel from outside New Zealand who have been working shoulder-to-shoulder with our men and women at the frontline of this crisis.

As Christchurch continues the long road to recovery, our deepest sympathies are with the people of Japan as they come to terms with their own natural disaster.

Japan is a good friend of New Zealand and was one of the first countries to send Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) personnel to assist with Christchurch’s rescue operation. We are grateful our USAR team was able to join the vast recovery effort on Japan’s west coast.

Back in the electorate I’m delighted to hear Papakura retailers are rallying to revive business in the town centre. Papakura is a great place to live and I trust efforts to revive our business district will encourage people to continue shopping locally.

I enjoyed attending Papakura Inlet Protections Society’s (PIPS) annual Canoe Day recently. It was great to see so many families making the most of Pahurehure Inlet – especially now an area of the mangroves has been removed. Thanks to the PIPS team, Auckland Council, Wai Care services and the Papakura Sea Scouts for hosting a great day out.

A big well done to Daisy Discombe and Kelsi Walters of Rosehill College who won gold at the North Island Secondary School Rowing Champs held at Lake Karipiro last weekend. Daisy and Kelsi were awarded first place in the Under-17 women’s sculls. Congratulations to you both – Papakura is proud of you!
