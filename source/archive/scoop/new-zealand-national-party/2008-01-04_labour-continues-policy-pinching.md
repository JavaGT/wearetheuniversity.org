Labour continues policy pinching

Labour continues policy pinching

A desperate Labour Government is continuing to pinch National Party policy, this time from the party’s rural discussion document, says National’s Associate Agriculture spokesman, Craig Foss.

“Our rural issues discussion paper, released in June last year, states that National will reinstate agriculture and horticulture as NCEA scholarship-level subjects.

“That’s because National believes land-based industries are the engine room of the New Zealand economy and our best and brightest students should have a level financial playing field of choice and incentives as they balance their career choices.

“Our proposal to reinstate agriculture and horticulture as NCEA scholarship-level subjects is a solid endorsement and investment into the future of our land-based industries.

“But, what do you know? The Orchardist magazine reports that: ‘The word in Wellington is that it is likely that the standards for Agriculture and Horticulture Science will be developed to be available for NZ Scholarships in 2009’.

“This is another ‘me too’ from Labour which has been sneakily claiming National Party policy as its own so far trades training, instant protection orders, National Party charities and literacy policies, even, apparently, income tax cuts.”
