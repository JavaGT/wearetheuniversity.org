Govt breaks health election promises
====================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Wyatt Creech Acting Leader of the Opposition  
Opposition Health Spokesperson

Govt breaks health election promises

"The Government has broken its health election promises, " Opposition Health spokesperson Wyatt Creech said today.

"The extra money for operations is about a third of what Labour promised.

"New Zealanders were expecting $200million a year for waiting lists. They're getting $74million.

"All that does is continue the money in the Waiting Times Fund that needed topping up anyway, and National would have done it anyway.

"The Health Minister has let down thousands of New Zealanders who expected Labour to deliver on its election promise to pour hundreds of millions of dollars a year to cut waiting lists.

"The Government promised to implement the Mental Health Blueprint - but they've fallen $40million short of what was needed.

"The Government is also admitting huge cost over-runs with its health restructuring. The $30million budgeted is over seven times more than they told New Zealanders it would cost.

"It is appalling that the Government is taking $100million a year off smokers with their tobacco tax - and is only putting in a meagre $5million a year for smoking cessation initiatives. New Zealanders expected more than that.

"There's nothing in here to cut the cost of going to a doctor, for cheaper prescriptions or better and more health services for most New Zealanders. The health spending is a major letdown for most people."
