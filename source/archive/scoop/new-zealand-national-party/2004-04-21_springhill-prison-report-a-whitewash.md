Springhill Prison report a whitewash

Springhill Prison report a whitewash

The Corrections Department report into iwi consultation over Springhill Prison in Waikato is a whitewash, says National's Police spokesman Tony Ryall.

"This report is written by the department about the department. How rigged is that?

"It doesn't tell the people of New Zealand just who will be held responsible for this extravagant use of public money.

"What is needed is a thorough independent audit of what went on.

"This report is designed to take the heat off the culture of extravagance that has seen $1.5 million paid out in iwi consultation while consultation with other New Zealanders was a mere pittance.

"The cringing political correctness of this Government has cost New Zealanders a lot of money," says Mr Ryall.

"How can anyone accept the department's admissions of failure when senior managers and Government MPs keep defending the spending?"
