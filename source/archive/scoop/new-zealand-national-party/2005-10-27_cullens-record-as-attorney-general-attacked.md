Cullen's record as Attorney-General Attacked

Chris Finlayson MP National Party Shadow Attorney-General

Finlayson attacks Cullen's record as Attorney-General

National's new shadow Attorney-General, Chris Finlayson, today launched an attack on Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen for his performance as Attorney-General.

"My only disappointment in my new role is that I will not be shadowing Dr Cullen who, in his brief and undistinguished period as Attorney-General, showed that he had no understanding of the office and its responsibilities," says Mr Finlayson.

"Dr Cullen failed to support the judiciary. The Supreme Court, established with much fanfare by Labour, remains housed in the basement of the High Court in Wellington and there is no prospect of a permanent home any time soon.

"Dr Cullen's record of law reform is pitiful. For example, in 2005 Labour once again failed to make any progress with the Law Practicioners and Conveyances legislation.

"Given this poor performance, the tertiary education sector should be regarding Dr Cullen's appointment as its new minister with fear and trepidation.

"One can only hope Labour's new appointment to the role, Dunedin 'entrepreneur and businessman' David Parker, will do a better job than Dr Cullen. Surely he couldn't do worse," says Mr Finlayson.
