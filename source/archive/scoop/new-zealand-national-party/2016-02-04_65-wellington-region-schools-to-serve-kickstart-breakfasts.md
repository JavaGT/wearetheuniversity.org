65 Wellington Region schools to serve KickStart Breakfasts this term

As the school year begins again, MP Paul Foster-Bell MP is pleased 65 schools in the Wellington region are serving KickStart Breakfasts.

“Breakfast prepares kids for learning so it’s important all children start the day with a full stomach.

“These schools offer the KickStart Breakfast programme, ensuring their students have a bowl of Weet-bix and milk before the school day starts.

“The majority of parents in our region do a superb job, but we want to make sure all young Kiwis have the chance to make the most of their schooling,” says MP Foster-Bell

The KickStart Breakfast programme is a partnership between Government, Sanitarium, Fonterra and the community. In 2013 the Government provided $9.5 million over five years to expand the programme from 2 to 5 mornings per week and to any school that wants or needs it, regardless of decile.

“Since the Government expanded the programme to 65 more schools in the Wellington region have started serving KickStart Breakfasts.

“This week the six millionth KickStart Breakfast was served, showing the success of the programme not just here in Wellington, but nationwide.

“Thanks to KickStart students are healthier, better behaved, and more focused, with 99.5 per cent of schools satisfied or very satisfied with the Kickstart Breakfast programme,” says MP Foster-Bell.
