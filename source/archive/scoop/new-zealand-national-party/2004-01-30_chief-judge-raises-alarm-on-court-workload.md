Chief Judge raises alarm on court workload

National is calling for a major financial review of the country's court system as the Chief District Court judge predicts more increases in the workload of district courts.

Yesterday Chief District Court Judge Carruthers was reported as saying that the reclassification of methamphetamine from Class A to Class B could see more cases being considered in the District Court to make space in the High Court.

"Over the past few weeks, National has demonstrated the parlous state of our nation's courts. Waiting lists are getting longer, it is taking longer for cases to be heard, and around 40 cases have had to be abandoned in the past few years because of time delays," says National's Police spokesman Tony Ryall.

"Yet the Government is content to sit and do nothing as justice is denied to thousands of victims and defendants.

"Will the Government only wake up when some high profile drug dealer avoids justice because his case has taken too long?

"National says the Government must stop funding social engineering and support the basic infrastructure of the justice system. The Government should be investing in more judges, improved technology and case management systems," Mr Ryall says.
