Local MPs welcome Singapore Airlines to Wellington

  
Local National MPs Paul Foster-Bell, Chris Bishop and Brett Hudson are excited by the announcement today that Singapore Airlines services from Wellington to Canberra will commence in September. They are delighted that there will be a new connection to Singapore, opening up another way for New Zealanders to be able to do business with that country and the wider Asian region.

“This is a vote of confidence in Wellington as a destination for holidaymakers and business travellers by one of the world’s top airlines. Whether it be our renowned café scene, the exhibitions at Te Papa, or Zealandia sanctuary, Wellington stands to benefit from an extra 95,000 visitors,’ said Paul Foster-Bell.

“These four new flights per week offer another quality route for our filmmakers, software programmers, exporters, and the chance to bring in more foreign students to study at Victoria, Massey, WelTec and elsewhere,” said Brett Hudson

“This is great news for the Hutt. We will welcome visitors from both Canberra and further afield to our wonderful bush walks, the world-class Dowse Art Museum and of course the fantastic retail therapy along Jackson St,” said Chris Bishop.

“It will also allow our high tech manufacturing and research sectors to better access existing markets and link into new markets. It has my full support,” said Chris Bishop.

This show of faith is very positive for both local tourism and business, and underlines the wider growing business confidence in the region demonstrated by recent economic surveys.
