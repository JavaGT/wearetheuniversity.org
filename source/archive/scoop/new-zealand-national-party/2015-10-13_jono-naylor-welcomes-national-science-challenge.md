**Jono Naylor welcomes National Science Challenge High-Value Nutrition announcement**

Today the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has announced $10.9million in grants to Food Researchers under a new government scheme aimed to boost exports and science.

“I welcome the news that Massey University has received $600,000 in funding for a preliminary project to establish current knowledge on the food science of health foods,” National List MP Jono Naylor says.

This will lead into a larger $1.5million programme to support the design and development of food and beverages that maintain their health benefits through to the point of consumption.

“This is part of the wider programme of work to support collaboration between organisations and develop a more robust food science and research sector in New Zealand.

“This funding further underlines the significance of Palmerston North’s position at the forefront of food research in New Zealand.

“I am encouraged to see Palmerston North based institutes receive this funding and look forward to seeing the programmes develop,” Naylor said.
