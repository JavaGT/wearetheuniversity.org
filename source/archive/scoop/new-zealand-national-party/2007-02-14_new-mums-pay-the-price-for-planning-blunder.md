New mums pay the price for planning blunder

National's Health spokesman, Tony Ryall, wants to know who is responsible for an apparent planning blunder that is forcing new mums away from their homes and families to have their babies.

\"Millions of dollars have been spent on the new Christchurch Women's Hospital, but it appears to be too small for the city's growing population. As a result, women are being kicked out of the beds just hours after having their babies and some are being shipped to other centres."

The new hospital has the same number of maternity beds and neonatal cots as the old one.

"New hospitals are being built around New Zealand based on Ministry of Health bed projections, but it would appear these projections are now seriously flawed," says Mr Ryall

"What other blunders have been made in the planning of the new Christchurch Women's Hospital?

"Is this an isolated case, or is the same short-sighted approach being taken elsewhere?

"The public deserve to know the full story. The Canterbury District Health Board report into the new hospital must be released immediately so we can establish the size and seriousness of the problem."
