National Candidate calls for 'School Gardens'

National Candidate calls for 'School Gardens'

National candidate for Mt Roskill and breast cancer campaigner Dr Jackie Blue supports the fruit in schools programme to combat cancer but is also calling for the widespread introduction of school gardens, particularly in urban areas.

"For many children living in cities fruit and vegetables are just things sold at supermarkets. School gardens are ideal for teaching children about healthy eating and for educating them about nature, care and maintenance, responsibility and working co-operatively. They also instil a sense of pride," Jackie Blue says.

Dr Blue says school gardens are used widely overseas and the positive down-stream benefits are numerous.

"Gardens can be used to teach social studies enabling students to learn about other cultures, how they grow their food, what they eat and where their own food comes from. Retired community members could be enlisted to help teach students about gardening. The possibilities are endless."
