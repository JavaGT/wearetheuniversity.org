Questions over teacher training scholarships

Questions over teacher training scholarships

National's Education spokesman, Bill English, wants to know why just 10% of $10,000 teacher training scholarships went to males last year.

Each year the Government gives out around 800 scholarships to the value of $10,000 to people interested in teacher training. Last year just 80 of those were awarded to males.

Mr English says it's important that young men and boys have positive role models.

"The proportion of male teachers is dropping each year, even in boys' schools.

"I would have thought a $10,000 scholarship would be attractive to anyone.

"I want to know whether the low number of male scholarship recipients is because males just don't apply, because male students aren't doing well, or if it has something to do with the pervasive political correctness in our education bureaucracy.

"Female teachers do a great job but, ideally, our children need a better balance of men and women in our schools," says Mr English.
