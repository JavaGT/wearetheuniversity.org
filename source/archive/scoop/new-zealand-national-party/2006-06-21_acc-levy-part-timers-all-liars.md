ACC levy: part-timers all liars

National's ACC spokesman, Paul Hutchison, wants answers as to why ACC is charging a full-time ACC levy for people who list themselves as self-employed part-timers.

"The ACC Helpline has said the charges are because part-timers are not telling the truth," says Dr Hutchison.

"Without any individual notification, ACC began automatically charging all self-employed part-timers at least the minimum full-time levy, irrespective of how much they may have earned - thus over-charging thousands of honest New Zealanders.

"It's no wonder New Zealanders are fed up with a Labour Government that introduces more than 40 new taxes in the past seven years, and now allows the ACC monopoly to sneakily invoice all self-employed part-timers for a full-time levy.

"ACC has published a 2005/06 pamphlet titled 'Understanding your ACC Levies', which makes no mention of any distinction between full-time and part-time levies."

Dr Hutchison says self-employed part-timers should be aware they are being over-charged by ACC.
