Labour tries to buy votes with a sausage
========================================

**Friday, 12 November 1999, 10:55 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

It’ll take more than a free sausage to win Wellington Central but it is still scandalous that Labour’s Marion Hobbs is offering to “crank up the barbecue” for local votes, says National MP Annabel Young.

She was commenting on an invitation that Labour candidate Marian Hobbs has distributed in the Te Aro area.

“I will be complaining to the Electoral Commission about Labour’s offer to provide a free barbecue for Wellington voters. If the barbecue is free, it is a clear breach of the prohibition on treating. Treating is a serious breach of the Electoral Act with serious penalties for the candidate involved.”

“If Labour is going to sock the voters with a pay-per-sausage cost, then its invitation is grossly mis-leading.”
