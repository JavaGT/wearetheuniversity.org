Universities fear Crown control

Universities fear Crown control

There are grave fears that the recently introduced Education (Tertiary Reforms) Amendment Bill will allow the Labour Government to control all university activities, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.

“At today’s parliamentary select committee, Michael Cullen played down a suggestion the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) could control universities under the Bill but left room for uncertainty.

“Universities are concerned that the Bill establishes TEC control by preventing them from undertaking any activity not written in an approved ‘plan’.

“The fear is that the Bill gives TEC the control of private revenue and assets – including private research contracts and philanthropy – by providing the Minister with the ability to direct the ‘plan’ and, therefore the university’s activities.

“The Bill is typical of this Labour Government’s arrogant and controlling behaviour and must be challenged.

“National will seek to amend the Bill to allay universities’ fears.”
