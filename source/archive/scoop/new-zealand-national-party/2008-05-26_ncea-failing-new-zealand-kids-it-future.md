NCEA failing New Zealand kids’ IT future

Reports that senior ICT groups and academics believe NCEA is failing to equip secondary school pupils for a future in the industry should be cause for grave concern, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.

The report, authored by Digital Technology Guidelines (DTG), was reviewed by 11 senior computing and ICT tertiary-level academic practitioners from all over New Zealand, and found teaching of ICT skills was vague and unsuitable.

“New Zealand Computer Society Chief Executive Paul Mathews said he was horrified to discover that not a single NCEA Technology Achievement Standard met the set criteria.

“If NCEA is not adequately preparing our secondary school students for one of the most important industries in the future of this country, then parents, teachers and the wider public should be very worried.

“National’s broadband plan will roll out a $1.5 billion fibre network to homes and businesses - an investment we make because we know IT is a pathway to increased productivity, raising wages, and gaining a competitive edge with other OECD countries.

“That is the reason National also has such a strong focus on lifting educational standards.

“The reports today that NCEA is failing to teach, encourage, and foster the young people who are most able to drive the knowledge revolution that will turbo charge New Zealand’s economy is sobering to say the least.

“Labour has today admitted there is a problem and has promised to address it.

“After eight years in Government and with fewer than six months till an election, it is hard to believe they have the time, commitment, and desire to do so. “
