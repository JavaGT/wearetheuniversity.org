Hutt secondary schools lifting student achievement

  
National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, Chris Bishop, has congratulated Hutt Valley secondary schools for their improvement in student achievement rates since 2008.

The New Zealand Qualifications Authority recently published student NCEA achievement data for every school in the country.

“It’s great to see an increased number of students in the Hutt achieving NCEA Level 1. That’s a vital first step on the road to leaving school well-equipped to enter further study, work or training,” says Mr Bishop.

“I’m really pleased in particular that 66 per cent of Year 11 students at Wainuiomata High School achieved NCEA Level 1 by the end of the 2014 academic year, compared to 45 per cent of students by the end of 2008. At Taita College, 56 per cent of Year 11 students achieved NCEA Level 1 by the end of 2014, compared to 32 per cent of students by the end of 2008. These are considerable increases and a testament to the hard work of teachers, principals and most importantly the students.”

Other notable results from the Hutt Valley for NCEA Level 1 include:

· 56 per cent of Year 11 students at Naenae College achieved NCEA Level 1 by the end of the 2014 academic year, compared to 41 per cent of students by the end of 2008

· 76 per cent of Year 11 students at Upper Hutt College achieved NCEA Level 1 by the end of the 2014 academic year, compared to 63 per cent of students by the end of 2008

Mr Bishop says that gains have also been made at higher levels of study. At Wainuiomata High, 70 per cent of Year 12 students at Wainuiomata High School achieved NCEA Level 2 by the end of the 2014, an increase from 56 per cent of students by the end of 2008. And 65 per cent of Year 13 students at Upper Hutt College achieved NCEA Level 3 by the end of the 2014 academic year, compared to 45 per cent of students by the end of 2008.
