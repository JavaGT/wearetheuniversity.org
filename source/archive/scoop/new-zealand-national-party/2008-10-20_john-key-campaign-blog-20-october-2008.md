John Key: Key Notes

Campaign blog: 20 October 2008

I started this weekend getting my hands dirty on Saturday morning taking part in a makeover at Tamaki Primary School (YouTube video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yl7FEgS2rI).

It was good to get some exercise, given that the time pressures of an intense election campaign do not allow me much time to get any exercise.

On Saturday afternoon I went to a colourful Diwali celebration at the Viaduct Harbour.

The Indian community were out in force and I got a great reception. Helen Clark, John Banks and myself were all presented with hats to wear - pictures of which made their way into at least one Sunday newspaper yesterday.

Then yesterday I flew to Nelson for a family BBQ day out. It was a chance for families to enjoy the fine weather and entertainment put on by local National MP Nick Smith.

There was children's face painting (including "JK08"!) and a sausage sizzle raising money for the local hospice. A few weeks ago I announced extra funding for hospices, which do a vital job for communities.

After the Nelson visit, I flew to Wellington for a press conference in the National Party Caucus room at Parliament about the situation with our banking system. http://national.org.nz/Article.aspx?articleId=28772

I announced our intention to approach the issue of wholesale banking deposit guarantees in a constructive and bipartisan way with the current Government.

We should be moving towards such a guarantee given that we do not want to risk seeing banks having to tighten credit in New Zealand.
