Labour lets HNZ tenants off the hook for debts

Reporters Note: Regional Figures Attached

“Fewer than half of former tenants who owe money to Housing New Zealand are on a plan to repay the debt,” says National Party Housing spokesman Phil Heatley.

Answers to parliamentary questions show that of the 1,590 former tenants who owe money, 677 were on a debt repayment scheme. Total former tenant debt stands at $1.25 million, made up of $273,951 unpaid rent and $877,014 damages.

Mr Heatley has already released figures showing the amounts owed to HNZ by current tenants for back rent and vandalism has increased by 20% in eight months.

“These latest answers show that former tenants are also heavily in debt, most for damage and vandalism.

“When you lay that increasing debt against the rate of recovery from former tenants questions arise as to whether HNZ is doing enough to catch some of the larger debts before they become insurmountable.”

Official figures show the highest debts were $13,103 in Dunedin, $11,875 in Mt Roskill and $11,430 in Whangarei.

“All of those big debts came from damage or vandalism as opposed to unpaid rent.”

Mr Heatley says tenants who repeatedly and deliberately damage state houses should be given a short, sharp message.

“There are more than 11 thousand families languishing on the Housing New Zealand waiting list. If existing tenants won’t play by the rules there are plenty of others waiting who will.”
