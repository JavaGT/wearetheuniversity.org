Answer the questions Dr Cullen...

"Yesterday I challenged the Minister of Finance to answer 20 questions about how Labour's policies will help get New Zealand back to the top half of the OECD.

"So far his silence has been deafening," says National's Finance spokesman David Carter.

"Dr Cullen has been about as compliant and shifty on answering my 20 questions as the Prime Minister was with the police during the Paintergate debacle.

"However, the questions I have asked Michael Cullen are ones he must answer before Labour can claim any credibility about achieving 4% economic growth," Mr Carter says.
