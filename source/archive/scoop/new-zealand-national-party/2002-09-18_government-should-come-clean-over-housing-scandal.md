Judith Collins

National Internal Affairs Spokesperson

  
17th September 2002

  
The Government is trying to avoid the leaking building crisis by suppressing key parts of the report, and refusing to debate the issue in Parliament, says National's Internal Affairs spokesperson Judith Collins.

"What else is the Government trying to hide from the public? Parts of the Building Industry Association's report dealing with compensation were excluded, or toned down for legal reasons.

"The Government has also turned down the opportunity to debate the matter in Parliament.

"Thousands of homeowners are affected, and there are millions of dollars at stake. The Government can't make this issue go away by not talking about it," said Ms Collins.
