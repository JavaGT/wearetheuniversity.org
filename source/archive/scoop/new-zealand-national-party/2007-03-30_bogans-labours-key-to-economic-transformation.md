Bogans – Labour’s key to ‘economic transformation’

Labour is dishing out thousands of dollars to research on bogans in a bid to reach their key goal of ‘economic transformation’, says National’s Research, Science and Technology spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.

One student has scooped $96,000 in research funding to study the everyday lives of bogans.

Part of the research looks at their practices, which include ‘moshing’ and ‘headbanging’.

Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen says this type of research is a ‘great investment’ which is ‘underpinning our transformation into a knowledge economy’.

“This is all very interesting,” says Dr Hutchison. “But how is this type of research actually going to improve our economic performance?

“It’s not credible that this type of research will improve our economy.

“Our research dollars are already stretched.

“Government funding for agricultural science, through the Foundation of Research Science and Technology, has dropped from $63 million in 2004 to $50 million in 2005/06.

“Agricultural research and development is vital for the industry to prosper and compete on the world stage. This is one example where research can benefit out economy.

“Dr Cullen’s comments illustrate yet again this Government’s muddled thinking on the vital link between research and economic success.”
