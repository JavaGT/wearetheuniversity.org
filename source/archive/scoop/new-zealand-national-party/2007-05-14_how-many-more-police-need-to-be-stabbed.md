How many more police need to be stabbed?

How many more police need to be stabbed?

How many more police officers have to be stabbed before the Labour Government starts working harder to get stab-resistant vests to frontline officers?

That's the question being asked by National MP Chester Borrows, following today's stabbing of a Hamilton police officer.

"It is a relief that the officer's injuries were not serious, but how long before something the Minister writes off as an operational matter becomes a matter of life or death?

"According to media reports the officer had been measured for a stab-resistant vest, but was still waiting for it to arrive.

"Police officials say only 40% of frontline officers in Waikato have vests.

"The police officer stabbed four times last week was one of three officers at the scene. Only one had a vest.

"Isn't there now a danger that criminals will target non-vest wearing officers?

"Frontline police were first promised the body armour by June last year and they're still waiting.

"Police Minister Annette King has said that 'By the end of July 2007, it is anticipated that 95-98% of response staff will have stab-resistant body armour issued'.

"Police officers should not be kept waiting for this protection."
