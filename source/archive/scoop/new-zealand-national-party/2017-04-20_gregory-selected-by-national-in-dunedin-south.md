Matt Gregory has been selected as National’s Dunedin South candidate for the 2017 General Election.

Mr Gregory currently works as a Business Manager and Site Leader for ANZ Bank in Mosgiel. He has extensive experience in the banking sector, and has also served in the New Zealand Defense Force as a soldier and medic. Mr Gregory lives in Mosgiel with his wife Kylie and their young son Edwin.

“I’m proud to live in Dunedin South – it’s made up of some truly fantastic communities, so I’m excited about standing for National here,” Mr Gregory says.

“New Zealand and the Dunedin area is growing strongly, and we’re benefiting from the leadership National has shown in Government.

“As local MP, I would be a tireless voice for the Dunedin South electorate in a Government that is working to sustain that growth, build for growth, and act for the people most pressured by change.

“Dunedin South deserves a strong local voice in a Bill English-led National Government with a strong plan to make Kiwis better off at work and at home, with the means to achieve it.

“I’ll be running a vigorous campaign focused on the issues that matter to local families and businesses, like ensuring we continue to invest in health, housing, education, and vital transport infrastructure.”

The Dunedin South Electorate covers South Dunedin, Mosgiel, Outram and stretches inland to Middlemarch and the Longburn Reservoir. National won the party vote at the 2014 General Election with a close to 2,500 vote majority.
