Tertiary Ed- the Maharey principle on steroids

National's Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson says tertiary students should be asking what happened to Steve Maharey and Liz Gordon on the way to the Government benches.

The New Zealand Herald reported today that the fourth TEAC report 'Implementing the Strategy' recommends limiting the number of students in second year degree programmes and higher fees for some students.

"So much for two parties that promised cheaper, more open access to tertiary education. Labour wooed students with lower fees, the Alliance with no fees!

"Now a document has leaked under the door which has the sort of proposals that would have had Steve Maharey and Liz Gordon jumping up and down two years ago.

"This Government's performance in tertiary education is the Maharey principle on steroids - what Labour say in Opposition is definitely not what it does when in Government," Mr Williamson said.
