**National Party Women’s Caucus celebrates Women in Politics**

The National Party Women’s Caucus paid tribute to New Zealand’s first National Party Member of Parliament, Dame Hilda Ross, at an event held last night in her honour. The Party also holds a Memorial Fund in her name.

“It is timely that we celebrate Dame Hilda’s life as we reach the 120th anniversary of women’s suffrage in New Zealand,” says Hon Hekia Parata, Chair of the Fund.

New Zealand became the first country where women secured the right to vote in Parliamentary elections when a new Electoral Act was passed into law on 19 September 1893.

“Last night was a night for firsts. We celebrate the first woman National Party MP, we commemorate being the first women in the world to vote, and our special guest speaker was the first New Zealand woman Prime Minister, Dame Jenny Shipley.

“These women have inspired us all and are trail blazers for the growing number of women in Parliament,” says Ms Parata.

The Dame Hilda Ross Memorial Fund works to encourage and support women into the National Party Caucus.

Dame Hilda Ross was born on 6 July 1883. She was a music teacher, a JP, a war-time fundraiser, a businesswoman, an arts leader, a wife, and a mother. In 1941 she was elected to the Waikato Hospital Board, and in 1944 was elected Hamilton’s Deputy Mayor, preparing her well for Parliamentary service when she won the Hamilton by-election on the 26 May 1945.

In 2012, 32 per cent of Members of Parliament are female, compared to just 13 per cent a generation ago in 1984. In the early 21st century women have held each of the country’s key constitutional positions: Prime Minister, Governor-General, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Attorney-General and Chief Justice.
