Helen Clark doesn’t care about homeowners - English

Helen Clark’s shown her contempt for homeowners by accusing the media of “banging on about issues of no substance” in connection with the leaky buildings crisis says National Party leader Bill English.

“The Prime Minister now obviously fancies herself as an expert in the construction field.

“She’s shown supreme arrogance by dismissing the concerns of qualified architects and professors.

“And to make matters worse she’s turning her back on thousands of homeowners when many are out of pocket by tens of thousands of dollars,” says Mr English.

“She’s choosing to back her besieged Internal Affairs Minister, who by his own admission doesn’t read his mail.

“George Hawkins has had his head in the sand for months on this issue, his complete incompetence in dealing with the matter led to hundreds more homes being built with fundamental flaws.

“The Prime Minister’s made a huge gaffe here, under-estimating the size of the problem just like her Minister.

“What’s also clear is that this Labour Government’s still not taking the leaking homes crisis seriously, it’s high time someone took some responsibility,” Mr English says.
