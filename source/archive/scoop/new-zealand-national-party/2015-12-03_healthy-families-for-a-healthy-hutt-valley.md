**Healthy Families for a Healthy Hutt Valley**

National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop joined Health Minister Jonathan Coleman this morning in officially launching Healthy Families Lower Hutt at the recently opened Walter Nash Centre. Mr Bishop says the $3 million investment over four years will help the community to think differently about how to address the underlying causes of poor health at a local level.

“The Government’s investment in Healthy Families Lower Hutt signals our commitment to supporting Hutt families to live healthier and fuller lives. This new initiative is about encouraging all of us to make good food choices, be more physically active, and moderate our alcohol and tobacco consumption,” Mr Bishop says.

“We are encouraging a community-wide approach to tackle the issue of how we all live a healthier life. Involving the whole community is a more effective way to address the drivers of obesity and chronic disease.”

Hutt City Council is the lead provider and is supported by a local governance group which includes leaders from Te Runanganui o Taranaki Whanui, Te Awakairangi Health Network, Sport Wellington, Pacific Health Service Hutt Valley, New World Stokes Valley, Hutt Valley DHB, Te Awakairangi Maori Relationship Board and Taita College.

“The Mayor and the Council have shown great leadership in the development of the Walter Nash Centre. With new facilities, sport and recreation opportunities, and the Government’s Childhood Obesity Plan, our community will have a comprehensive plan to tackle childhood obesity,” Mr Bishop says.

The roll out of Healthy Families NZ is one of the 22 initiatives in the Childhood Obesity Plan. The initiative has already been launched in the East Cape, Invercargill, Rotorua and Waitakere, and will also be launched in the Far North, Whanganui, Manukau, Manurewa-Papakura and Spreydon-Heathcote.

The rollout is supported by $40 million over four years committed to the initiative in Budget 2014. Healthy Families NZ has the potential to impact the lives of over one million New Zealanders.
