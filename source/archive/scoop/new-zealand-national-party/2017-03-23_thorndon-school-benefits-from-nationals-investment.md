Thorndon School benefits from National’s investment

Thorndon School’s $9 million redevelopment is a good example of National’s ongoing commitment to improving local schools, National’s Wellington Central candidate Nicola Willis says.

A lunchtime ceremony at the school, attended by Hon Nikki Kaye, was held today to mark the beginning of the construction phase of the development.

"This is fantastic news for the students, families and teachers of Thorndon School. They will benefit from state-of-the-art new facilities, including 13 new teaching spaces, a redeveloped library and a new administration block,” Ms Willis says.

"I'm pleased to see how clever the design for these buildings is - it really makes the most of a compact inner-city site. It will ensure Thorndon school students still have plenty of outdoor space to run around in. I'm sure all involved in the school will be pleased to see the back of weather tightness issues they've had to contend with."

"Wellington schools are benefiting significantly from the National Government's large-scale upgrade of New Zealand schools, with $117 m worth of project announced in just the past five months.

"The developments at Newtown School, Kilburn Normal School, Northland School, Brooklyn School and Wellington East Girls College, will be of particular relevance to the people of the Wellington Central electorate.

"Wellington schools perform really well and contribute hugely to the quality of life Wellingtonians enjoy. The quality of teaching that goes on in these new classrooms is the most important thing, but having a great environment to teach and learn is a fantastic advancement."

“Over the last eight years, National has invested a record $5 billion in education infrastructure.

“I’m proud to be running to give Wellington Central a voice in a Government that builds for growth, is improving the quality of our schools, and knows what it takes to give our kids somewhere great to learn.”
