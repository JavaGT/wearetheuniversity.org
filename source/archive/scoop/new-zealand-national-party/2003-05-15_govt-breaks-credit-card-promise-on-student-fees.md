Govt breaks credit card promise on student fees

The Government has broken yet another one of the promises it made to students ahead of the last two elections, says National Party Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power. "Today's budget announcement on fees will inevitably lead to increases for students throughout the country.

"The fee maxima programme offers no protection to students, and shows that the Government is more intent on maintaining the bureaucracy than improving the student's lot.

"In its second term, the Government should have been able to offer some relief to students," says Mr Power.

"Instead Labour's conveniently forgotten its pledge cards of the past two elections.

"In 2002 it promised 'to keep tertiary education affordable' - selective memory strikes again.

"The Government can not be trusted," he says.

"Currently an Otago student studying for a BA would pay $2950 in course fees.

"The scheme announced in the budget now sets the maximum for that same course at $3900, leaving room for a potential increase of up to a thousand dollars," says Mr Power.

"In Auckland, the rise could be as much as $600, at Victoria $900 and Canterbury around $500.

"Take Engineering where fee maxima will set the top fee at $5000.

"Currently students completing an engineering degree pay between $4,200 and $4,500.

"Student anger is justified, when the Minister abuses their trust, breaks another promise and wastes more opportunities," Mr Power says.
