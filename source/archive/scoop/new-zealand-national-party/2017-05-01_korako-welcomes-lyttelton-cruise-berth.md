**Korako welcomes Lyttelton Cruise Berth**

The announcement that Christchurch City Council will fund a $56 million cruise ship berth has been welcomed by National List MP Nuk Korako, who has been campaigning for some time to bring the cruise ships back to Lyttelton.

“I, and others in the community, have been concerned for some time that some cruise ships may choose to bypass Canterbury altogether if we didn’t get something in place here in Lyttelton,” said Korako.

“Once the cruise ship companies established other routes, it would have been difficult to get them back.”

“A new cruise berth is vitally important to Lyttelton, but also to tourism in the wider region,” said Nuk Korako.

“I am delighted that the Council has agreed with our stance that we must have the cruise berth restored to Lyttelton.”

“I want to acknowledge everyone in the community whose hard work and advocacy on this issue has contributed to a positive outcome for Lyttelton.”

The berth is part of the wider Lyttelton Port Recovery Plan announced by the National-led Government in 2015, which assists in fast-tracking works that contribute to the recovery of the port.
