Standards for teachers - but not pupils

Standards for teachers - but not pupils

It is bizarre that the Government is supporting national standards for teacher trainees but has dismissed national standards for students, says National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

National wants national standards for primary pupils to catch under-achievement earlier, but the Government has rejected the idea out of hand.

"The Teachers' Council is now promoting national standards for student teachers whose literacy and numeracy skills are completely inadequate.

"Does the Government not see the irony? If these student teachers had been made to meet national standards in reading, writing and maths when they were at school, they wouldn't need to catch up now.

"The Minister's failure to consider national standards in primary schools, where literacy and numeracy problems can be first identified, while embracing national standards for trainee teachers, shows his dismissal is more about politics than any genuine interest in helping students read and write.

"Under a National government children will learn the basics at school - not when they're about to be let loose on another generation completely ill-prepared".
