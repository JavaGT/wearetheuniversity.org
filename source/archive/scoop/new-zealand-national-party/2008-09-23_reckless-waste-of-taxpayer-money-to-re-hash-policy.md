Reckless waste of taxpayers’ money to re-hash policy

Labour’s frenzied, last-minute spending spree has reached a new low with news that hundreds of school principals are being flown to Wellington for what is being called a ‘briefing’ on Labour’s Schools Plus policy, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.

“Schools that are struggling to raise funds are appalled that Labour can find tens of thousands of dollars to fly in 120 principals at the taxpayers’ expense as a gimmick to sell this flawed policy.

“Schools Plus is an admission that Labour has badly failed young people.

“In 2002 they signed the Mayor’s Taskforce for Jobs agreement and promised to have ‘every 15 to 19-year-old in work, training, education, or another constructive activity for their future’ by 2007.

“They failed that time, so they’re re-heating their old goal under the Schools Plus guise. Why should we believe they’ll get to their 2014 target this time?

“Schools are struggling to find money for essentials and Labour thinks it’s perfectly reasonable to throw all these education dollars at airfares, rental cars, and petrol to brief them on a doomed policy that few of them have any confidence in.

“Tomorrow’s briefing to principals, which could just as easily be delivered by email, is a shameful waste of money that would be far better spent where it’s useful – on our children’s education.”
