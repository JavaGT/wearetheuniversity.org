Labour's Immigration Policy Dangerous
=====================================

MEDIA RELEASE  
GERRY BROWNLEE  
MP FOR ILAM

LABOUR'S 'OPEN BOARDERS' IMMIGRATION POLICY - DANGEROUS

Labour and the Alliance are quite happy to throw open New Zealand's doors to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, said Gerry Brownlee, Government Whip and member of the Social Services Select Committee.

"It might only be one boat-load at the moment, but the moment they land thousands more will set off for New Zealand," Mr Brownlee said.

"The Labour/Alliance bloc have to face up to the hard facts of immigration.  
"Earlier this year, there was an international conference on Illegal migration in Bangkok and the Chinese officials said they were extremely concerned about the illegal immigration industry.

"This make a mockery of Labour's claims that they opposed the bill out concern for the communist Chinese Government's reaction.

"The people who run these illegal immigration schemes are the modern-day slavers. They prey on people's hopes and dreams in a vicious and calculated way," he said.

It is unacceptable for Labour and the Alliance to allow this misery to grow. They are crying crocodile tears for want of an agreed immigration policy. New Zealand has a record of generous support for genuine refugees and will always treat those who claim refugee status fairly.

"We have a right to protect our borders from unscrupulous immigration entrepreneurs who seek to profit on our generosity. The Labour/Alliance stance on the Amendment Bill is totally unacceptable" said Mr Brownlee."
