**National continues to provide warmer, drier homes**

Prime Minister and National Party Leader John Key today announced the National Party housing policy, which includes a commitment to complete the insulation of every State house built before 1978 by the end of 2013.

"This will ensure thousands of New Zealand families have a brighter future through living in warmer, drier, and healthier homes," says Mr Key.

"By the end of 2013, National will ensure the remaining 4600 State homes built before 1978, when insulation became standard for State houses, are insulated where it is practically possible."

"Funding for this will be allocated from Housing New Zealand's baseline so National is also fulfilling its promise to do better with the money we have," says Mr Key.

Since National came into Government in 2008, more than 133,000 privately-owned homes have also been retrofitted with insulation under its $347 million Warm Up New Zealand: Heat Smart insulation and clean heating scheme.

"National is committed to retrofitting at least another 50,000 homes," says Mr Key.

Under the scheme, homeowners with houses built before 2000 are eligible for 33 per cent of the cost of installing ceiling and under floor insulation, up to a maximum of $1300.

"This scheme has ensured about 2000 Kiwis are in full time employment."
