OECD – dropout numbers increasing

Steve Maharey needs to explain the disturbing downward trend in the numbers of students finishing high school, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

According to the OECD’s Education at a Glance report, issued yesterday, New Zealand is bucking the trend of most OECD countries, with the continuing to decline.

“Since 2000, when 80% graduated, the percentage has fallen every year, to 77% in 2002, 75% in 2004 and finally, 72% in 2005 – a 10% drop in just five years.  
“While NZ girls are just over the OECD average of 82%, boys are way behind. Only 61% of boys complete high school.

“Academics and practitioners agree that staying at school for longer makes a big difference to the long term prospects of young New Zealanders.

“After eight years of a Labour Government, it’s appalling that graduation rates, according to the OECD report, are significantly worse, not better.”
