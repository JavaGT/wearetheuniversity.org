National Party Leader

3 June 2002

Fronting Up in the South Island

National Party Leader Bill English's Fronting Up tour hits the South Island tomorrow, as he visits Dunedin, Oamaru and Timaru.

"I have been getting a great reaction from people as I've been out on the road. We've listened carefully in opposition to concerns people have about the long-term future for New Zealand. People want to hear what National stands for, and what I believe in.

"I've been talking about tougher sentences and more police, our plans to support small business, how we raise standards of education for every child, and the need to complete historical Treaty claims.

"There is also strong support for our proposal to hold a referendum on MMP at the 2005 election."

Tomorrow Mr English will also be a guest DJ for Dunedin radio station 4X0, playing his choice of music for an hour. Later in the day he will attend Grey Power meetings in Oamaru and Timaru, visit Summit Woolspinners, and hold a press conference with Aoraki polytechnic journalism students.

"I'm looking forward to meeting people at public meetings, in schools and workplaces, and talking about issues that matter to real people," said Mr English.
