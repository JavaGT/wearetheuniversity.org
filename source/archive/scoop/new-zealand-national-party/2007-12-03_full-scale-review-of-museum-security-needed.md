**Full-scale review of museum security needed**

National’s Defence spokesman Wayne Mapp is calling on the Government to conduct a full-scale review of all museums carrying valuable war medals.

Dr Mapp says the theft of nine of the country’s 22 Victoria Crosses as well as two George Crosses and an Albert Medal from the Army Museum at Waiouru, should prompt the Government to ensure security at the Wigram Airforce Museum and the Navy Museum at Devonport, is absolutely sound.

“Medals bestowed on our military personnel are part of our national heritage and must be safeguarded for future generations.

“Both museums at Wigram and Devonport are home to a number of valuable medals which must not be put at risk.

“While the current focus must be on retrieving the stolen medals, the Government should be reviewing security operations at Wigram and Devonport to ensure a theft like this never happens again.”
