Student loans frustration grows

Student frustration at Labour's inability to deal with the student loan issue is understandable, says National Leader Bill English.

"Labour promised to fix the student loan problem, yet instead under their stewardship, student debt has escalated.

"Under Labour, student debt has increased at least $1.5b to nearly $5b, students are borrowing more, and the number borrowing is soaring.

"Long-term student debt projection has been revised up by around 30% since Labour's scheme was introduced.

"National will soon be announcing a policy on the student loan problem," Mr English said.
