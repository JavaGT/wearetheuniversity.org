Dear Philip

Thanks for your email regarding DHMO. I know Sue would be absolutely supportive of the campaign to ban this toxic substance in NZ. Unfortunately, the reality is that she is working on many such issues, and there are only so many hours in the day! That being said, and taking into consideration her time constraints, did you have any ideas in mind on how she could be of assistance to the campaign?

Kind Regards

Dear Ms Kedgley,

I seek your support in the international campaign to have dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO) banned in New Zealand. I have been totally frustrated in my attempts to have this issue taken seriously by the relevant public authorities and seek your and the Green Party's support to have it addressed.

Dihydrogen monoxide (also known as Hydrogen hydroxide, Hydronium Hydroxide or simply hydric acid) is a chemical used in nuclear power stations, US Navy propulsion systems and many chemical industries. It is colourless, odourless, tasteless and kills uncounted thousands of people each year. It is even present in some imported foods. The chemical is commonly found in pre-cancerous cells and is prevalent in acid rain. In its solid state DHMO causes some tissue damage and in gaseous form severe burns.

I would urge you to check out the website and the information from the Dihydrogen Monoxide Research Division on the problems DHMO causes to both public health and the environment. ( www.dhmo.org/research.html and www.dhmo.org.facts.html).

The campaign to ban DHMO is well underway in the United States but is in its infancy in New Zealand. Award winning scientist Nathan Zohner has undertaken research showing that 86% of the population supports a ban on Dihydrogen monoxide. A similar study by US researchers Patrick K McClusky and Matthew Kulick also found 90% of citizens participating in a survey supported the petition for an outright ban of DHMO in the US. The US campaign has been undermined by industrial companies citing economic justification for maintaining supplies of DHMO and thus holding over Federal agencies like the FDA and EPA.

If you would like any further information please do not hesitate to contact me. I would be particularly interested in whether you would be prepared to support our campaign for New Zealand to be declared DHMO free.

Yours Sincerely

Philip Gully
