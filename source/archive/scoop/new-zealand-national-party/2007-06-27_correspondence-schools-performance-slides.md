Correspondence School’s performance slides

Labour’s tinkering with The Correspondence School has led to a slide in its performance, which has been highlighted in the latest Education Review Office (ERO) report, says National’s Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.

“The Differentiated Service Model (DSM) introduced by Trevor Mallard 18 months ago has done nothing to lift performance and has, in fact, seen quality slide.

“The ERO report was concerning enough that they are returning to do another review in two years, rather than the standard three years. And the school itself will conduct a review on how the DSM is working at the end of this year.

“Since Labour’s reforms of almost two years ago, things have only got worse. The ERO report prior to Labour’s fiddling was much better than the one released this week.”

Some of the concerns raised by ERO include:

\- ‘Significant proportions of students enrolled in the programmes during the course of the year do not submit required work or complete final assessment’.

\- ‘Programmes and resources for delivery of the technology curriculum in Year 7 and Year 8 are outdated’.

\- ‘Examples of lack of responsiveness to students’ interests, needs and circumstances, and changes to pedagogical thinking and practise, are of particular concern'.

\- ‘Considerable inconsistencies are evident in completion, quality and rigour of the teacher appraisal process’.

“This report on teaching quality at The Correspondence School does nothing to encourage confidence.

“By meddling with this iconic New Zealand system, Labour has put at risk a high-quality distance learning model that is the only option for 600 young, rural students.”
