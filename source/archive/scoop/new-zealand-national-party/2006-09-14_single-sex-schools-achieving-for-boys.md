Single-sex schools achieving for boys

Single-sex schools achieving for boys

Ten per cent more boys attending single-sex schools leave with a qualification than their peers at co-ed schools, says National's Education spokesman, Bill English.

Ministry of Education figures show that while 31% of all boys leave school with no qualification, just 21% of boys at boys' schools leave with nothing.

Only 14% of girls attending single-sex schools leave without a qualification, compared with 24% of all girls.

"These figures show that it is worth investigating the culture and teaching practices at single-sex schools to gain a better understanding of what's working," says Mr English.

"The disparity in achievement levels between students at single-sex schools and students at co-ed schools may be related to the fact that single-sex schools tend to be higher decile."

Just 16% of students leaving high-decile (8-10) schools leave without NCEA level 1, compared to a staggering 44% from low-decile (1-3) schools.

"But, whatever the reason, the difference between boys' and girls' success is significant and cannot continue to be swept under the carpet," says Mr English.
