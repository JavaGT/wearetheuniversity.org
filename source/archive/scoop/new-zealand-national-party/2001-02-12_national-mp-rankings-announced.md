National MP Rankings Announced
==============================

**Monday, 12 February 2001, 12:38 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley has today released the revised rankings for National MPs, in accordance with the portfolio reshuffle announced last week.

The top nine places in the rankings make up the new National front-bench.

The reshuffle has also affected the rankings of the National middle-bench (those rated between 10 and 18). The rankings beyond this point remain unchanged.

Please note that the rankings from 32 to 39 are for the new intake of National MPs from the 1999 election and remain, as with the previous rankings, in alphabetical order.

The new rankings are as follows:
