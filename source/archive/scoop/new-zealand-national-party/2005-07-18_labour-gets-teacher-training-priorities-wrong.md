Labour gets teacher training priorities wrong

Labour gets teacher training priorities wrong

  
National Party Education spokesman Bill English says Labour is training far too many primary school teachers, many of whom have no prospect of getting a job in New Zealand.

Ministry of Education figures show that 56% of primary teaching graduates from 2000 had found work by 2004. Of those graduating in 2002 50% are yet to find work.

“Labour is spending millions training more primary teachers despite a surplus. This money would be much better spent plugging the gaps in secondary teaching where there is a considerable shortage,” says Mr English.

“New graduates tell me that outside of Auckland only about a third of new graduates can find work.

“This is just another example of Labour’s failings in tertiary education. It wastes $50 million annually on a bureaucracy to oversee the sector which can’t even make obvious and necessary decisions like directing more resource away from primary teaching and into secondary teaching.”
