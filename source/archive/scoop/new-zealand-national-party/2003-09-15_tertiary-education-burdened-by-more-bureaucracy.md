Tertiary education burdened by more bureaucracy

Tertiary education burdened by more bureaucracy

National Party Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power says the Labour Government has failed to curb massive growth in the size of the bureaucracy within tertiary education.

The National Party is releasing figures from parliamentary questions today that show spending on tertiary education administration has climbed by 33.3% since 2001, while Student Component funding has only risen by 7.1%.

"These answers make Steve Maharey's claim that 'we are committed to a steadily rising tide of funding' look far from convincing.

"Mr Maharey's pledged public support for the knowledge economy and says he wants to increase New Zealand's skills base, but that doesn't match-up with his decision to invest in bureaucrats rather than our tertiary institutions and students.

"In light of the figures provided by Mr Maharey, the Government just looks mean, preferring to spend its money on the bureaucracy rather than on students.

"Fee maxima have kept Tertiary Education Institutions tied to minimal fee increases and meagre funding student component funding increases.

"Meanwhile, the bureaucrats have been raking it in," Mr Power says.

"Tertiary institutions and students have every reason to be angry. Fee maxima and the Student Support Review has given neither of these groups hope of increased funding," he says.
