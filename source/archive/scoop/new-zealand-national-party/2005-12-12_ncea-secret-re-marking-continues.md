NCEA: secret re-marking continues

  
National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says he has been approached by more NCEA exam markers who have confirmed that results are being adjusted on a much larger scale than Labour and the NZQA are willing to admit.

NZQA has published a list of 11 NCEA standards that have been officially remarked.

In Parliament last week, Mr English produced two emails he has received showing that NZQA is leaning on markers to make unofficial changes in other standards, ensuring a greater proportion of students pass.

“In the past couple of days, another two markers have come forward to confirm the NZQA is applying pressure in further subjects,” says Mr English.

“These two markers have confirmed to me that another two standards, which are not on NZQA’s list of those being officially remarked, have been extensively re-marked.

“In one case, markers have been through the papers three times to try and get the results that NZQA have demanded.

“Another marker told me that the questions were so badly set that students answers didn’t meet any of the requirements of the marking schedule.

“These markers were motivated to approach me with their stories as a result of what they believe are untrue statements by the Education Minister Steve Maharey and NZQA about the extent of re-marking.”

Mr English says Mr Maharey and his officials are trying desperately to avoid the embarrassment of last year’s NCEA exams by quietly rejigging results to hide the extent of this year’s problems.
