**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The National Party has appointed IT consultant Dale Stephens as the Party’s Maori Vice President.

The former police officer has tribal affiliations with Te Rarawa from the Far North and was National’s candidate for Ikaroa Rawhiti at the last election.

“Dale was selected from a high quality field of four nominations. He will be a real asset to the National Party in his new position,” National Party President John Slater said today.

“Dale is an IT recruitment specialist with Morgan & Banks Technology. Dale took up this position after a 22-year career in the New Zealand Police where he rose to the rank of Inspector

“He comes in to this position from his current role as chairperson of the party’s Wellington Division Maori Advisory Committee.

“Dale brings with him wide ranging skills in policy development and analysis, a wide network of support from within both the public sector and private industry and some clear plans for developing Maori policy. Dale sees his greatest support coming from his immediate family who also hold high profile roles in the public arena. His brother Tainui is the executive producer of Maori programmes for TVNZ and sister Mamari is a lecturer in Maori studies at Victoria University.”
