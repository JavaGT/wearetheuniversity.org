Latest exodus to Australia worrying

National Party Leader John Key says immigration figures showing an acceleration in the number of Kiwis leaving to live in Australia are a wake-up call for the Government.

“These numbers are further evidence of the failure of the Labour-led Government to address the core issues of why Kiwis are leaving.

“They are a vote of no confidence in Helen Clark’s Government.

“There is no other way to describe figures that show 28,000 Kiwis left for Australia last year – an increase of 7,300 over 2006, and the highest net loss in 20 years.

“They highlight the fact that we need to make meaningful changes if we are to encourage tens of thousands of people to stay here.

“Our economy cannot afford to lose them.

“Kiwis are tired of waiting for tax cuts and improvements in their basic living conditions. That’s why record numbers of them are voting with their feet.

“New Zealand is already struggling under a skills shortage and this exodus will add to those worries.

“Labour has not taken advantage of the strong tailwind it inherited, failing to transform the economy to a level where many of these people want to stay.”
