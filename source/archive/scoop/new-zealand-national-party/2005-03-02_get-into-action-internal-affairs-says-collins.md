Get into action Internal Affairs, says Collins

The Department of Internal Affairs is dragging its feet in investigating potential paedophilia, says National's spokeswoman for Families, Judith Collins.

She is commenting after receiving an abusive email from a person who took an obvious interest in paedophilia.

"The email specifically said that my behaviour in speaking out against paedophilia was disgraceful, and was driving thousands of young people to commit suicide each year," says Ms Collins.

She passed the email on to Internal Affairs, and asked them to investigate.

"The sender obviously had quite an unnatural sympathy towards paedophiles, and had taken the time to write to me about the issue. I believe it warrants more investigation," says Ms Collins.

"Yet Internal Affairs appears to be indifferent.

"Their reply simply said that while the content may have been offensive, the email was not in itself an objectionable publication, and was not an offence under the Films, Videos and Publications Classification Act 1993.

"I'm sure it's not, but that doesn't mean no more investigation is warranted," says Ms Collins.

"This person takes an obvious unnatural interest in paedophilia, and has emailed me signalling as such, yet Internal Affairs is 'unable to take further action'. Not good enough," says Ms Collins.
