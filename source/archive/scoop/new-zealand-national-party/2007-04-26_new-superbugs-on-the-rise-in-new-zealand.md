New superbugs on the rise in New Zealand

New superbugs on the rise in New Zealand

An Environmental Science & Research report which says New Zealand has new strains of bacteria that cause urinary infection resistant to multiple antibiotics, is extremely worrying says National’s Associate Health spokeswoman, Dr Jackie Blue.

The antibiotic resistance is caused by an enzyme (ESBL) that is produced by the bacteria.

The report found that while ESBL superbugs are widely established in the community, not all laboratories are testing for them.

The November 2006 report which reviewed samples from almost 90% of laboratories over a 4 week period, confirmed that the prevalence of the Klebsiella ESBL producing strain had gone from non-existent in 2000 to 4.2% in 2006.

  
A startling finding was that in Hawke’s Bay a staggering 40% of Klebsiella urinary infections were superbug producers. Other regions that had significant involvement were Wellington, Auckland and Canterbury which had rates of 5.7%, 5.3% and 2.1%.

Dr Blue says that while the cost and potential impact on hospitals would be considerable, of greater concern was that antibiotic options would eventually run out.

“Urinary infections normally respond to oral antibiotics, however with the new strains, people may need hospitalization and access to IV antibiotics.

  
“Guidelines need to be developed urgently on preventing cross infection, monitoring and treatment.

“On going education about appropriate antibiotic use was essential to prevent further antibiotic resistance occurring.

“These new superbug strains are already well established internationally.

“While New Zealand has lagged behind because of its relative isolation, these new superbugs are here.

“We don't have the luxury of being complacent.”
