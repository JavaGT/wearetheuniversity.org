National selects Mangere & Manurewa candidates

National has selected two new Auckland candidates, with Agnes Loheni in Mangere and Katrina Bungard in Manurewa.

Ms Loheni, of Samoan descent, runs a successful Pacific clothing brand. Mrs Bungard is a teacher and Head of Department at Elim College, and serves on the Counties Manukau District Health Board.

“Mangere is a vibrant and positive place, with hard-working families and businesses succeeding not locally but around the world,” Ms Loheni says.

“National believes in Mangere, which is why it is investing in vital infrastructure like roading and new schools, improving housing, and improving social services.

“I have extensive ties to Mangere so I am really excited to be running here to give our communities the strong National voice they deserve.”

Mrs Bungard says she is honoured to be selected and is looking forward to getting out on the campaign trail for National in Manurewa.

“Bill English and his united National team are working hard to grow the local Manurewa and Auckland economy, build for future growth, and support people most pressured by change.

“Manurewa is getting ahead under National, and it deserves an MP that is aspirational for the area, understands local issues, and knows what it takes to get ahead.”
