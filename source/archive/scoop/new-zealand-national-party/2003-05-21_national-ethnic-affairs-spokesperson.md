Asian communities want more police on the beat

Claims that an Asian student crimewave is sweeping the streets of Auckland have angered National's Ethnic Affairs spokesperson, Pansy Wong.

"Asian communities, like all communities in Auckland, are concerned that police in our largest city are struggling because they're seriously under-resourced and understaffed.

"The last thing Asians living here want is New Zealand to be seen as a soft touch for criminals. Asian communities have long called for tougher sentencing and more police on the beat," says Mrs Wong.

She says it shouldn't be forgotten that Asian students are often the victims of crime.

"Whether the offenders are Asian or not, Asian communities still expect these people to be dealt with properly by our police and justice system.

"The problem here is a police force in Auckland stretched to the limit trying to handle a staggering workload. All the Government's come up with in the Budget is a few extra police that won't even replace the number of officers leaving the force.

"I am still waiting for Labour to put resources into implementing the Auckland City District Police - Asian Responsiveness Strategic Plan which was drawn up between the police and Asian community representatives 2 ½ years ago.

"Meanwhile, I have no hesitation accepting Senior Constable Steve Lamb's suggestion of patrolling Auckland streets with police one evening to see first-hand what they are dealing with," says Mrs Wong.
