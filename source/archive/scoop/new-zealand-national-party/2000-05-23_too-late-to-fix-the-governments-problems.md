Too late to fix the Government's problems
=========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

It will take more than a tactical olive branch to fix the problem the Government has with economic policy, National Finance spokesperson Bill English said today.

"It's families who are hardest hit and that's what is driving the concern. Many families just see higher interest rates, higher petrol prices, a new tobacco tax and flat house prices. They are starting to see disruption and uncertainty in their workplace and Government largesse for special interest groups.

"They also see their friends and family leaving New Zealand in large numbers and a Government more concerned about doing deals with its mates than about the national interest.

"They can also see the Government divided over basic issues like the Reserve Bank and they don't get any comfort from the idea that Jim Anderton might get to set their rates instead.

"The Government's problem with business is just as deep-seated. Dr Cullen has decried almost any business point of view as extreme, and even before the election warned them to co-operate with Labour or else. Why will people who have been abused and threatened suddenly believe Dr Cullen has changed his spots?

"This government of university lecturers has no idea of the values and the reality of business, and that can't be fixed.

"Dr Cullen and Helen Clark need to understand it's the real effect on people's pockets and jobs and families that is driving concern about economic policy, not just a few Right wing extremists.
