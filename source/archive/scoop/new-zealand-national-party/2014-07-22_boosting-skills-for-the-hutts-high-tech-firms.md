**Boosting skills for the Hutt’s high-tech firms**

National Party Hutt South candidate Chris Bishop today encouraged students to take up engineering careers using the National-led Government’s additional bridging courses, work placements, and scholarships resources.

The government launched today a new Education to Employment (E2E) initiative to grow enrolments at institutes of technology for students wanting to become engineering technologists and technicians.

“National has a great record having injected more than $50 million over the last few Budgets to grow engineering student numbers, today’s announcement is about promoting the opportunities now available for students,” says Mr Bishop.

“I’m fully behind Lower Hutt developing its high-tech hub to support the local economy and provide jobs.

“This push for more engineering skills comes on top of National’s $3 million new engineering school at WelTec’s Petone campus, the announcement of a new ICT graduate school in Wellington, and the large investment in commercial science research through Callaghan Innovation based in the Hutt.

“In addition, I’m the only Hutt South candidate supporting investment in critical infrastructure for local high-tech firms such as the Ultra-fast Fibre Broadband rollout and better transport links through the Petone to Grenada and Transmission Gully projects.”
