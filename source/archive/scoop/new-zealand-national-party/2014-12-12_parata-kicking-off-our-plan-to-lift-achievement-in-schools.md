Kicking off our plan to lift achievement in schools

  
This week we approved the first communities of schools which will work together to share expertise, leadership, and quality teaching under our plan to lift the achievement of New Zealand students at school.

This will be a big win for thousands of New Zealand children as schools will be working together in a way that hasn’t been seen before.

**International evidence and New Zealand-based research is clear – quality of education and school leadership are the two most important in-school factors in a child’s education.**

The first 11 communities approved involve schools in Auckland, Napier, Picton, Nelson, Blenheim, the West Coast, Selwyn, Canterbury, Central Otago, Otago, and Southland. They will begin from term one next year and together have nearly 38,000 students.

National firmly believes every New Zealand child deserves the best education possible.

That’s why we introduced National Standards so parents, teachers, and principals know how students are doing at school. It’s why we’re building new schools, and investing more money than ever before in education.

And it’s also why we’ve introduced this policy to help to lift the achievement of our children at school.
