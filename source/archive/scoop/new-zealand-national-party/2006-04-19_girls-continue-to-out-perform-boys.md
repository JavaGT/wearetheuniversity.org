Girls continue to out-perform boys

Girls continue to out-perform boys

NCEA results for 2005 show the gap between boys' and girls' achievement in the classroom is persisting, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

He has today released figures showing that 14% more girls than boys passed NCEA literacy requirements last year, although the gap was smaller in numeracy.

In NCEA 2005, 20% more girls than boys gained University Entrance.

"Education Minister Steve Maharey must front up to parents of boys and explain why he isn't taking this problem seriously," says Mr English.

"Labour is more concerned with making announcements than making progress - a leading school principal has today revealed that a reference group set up by Labour in 2004, with much fanfare, has been nothing but a useless talk shop."

Mr English says there are plenty of opportunities for improvement in boys' achievement.

"NCEA results show that boys attending single-sex schools achieve at similar levels to girls. Something about the culture and teaching practise in boys' schools works and boys in co-ed schools could benefit from it.

"We know what works and it is the Minister's job to provide the leadership to get more people doing it," says Mr English.
