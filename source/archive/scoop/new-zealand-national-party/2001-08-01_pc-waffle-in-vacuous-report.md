PC Waffle In Vacuous Report
===========================

**Wednesday, 1 August 2001, 3:52 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The third TEAC report 'Shaping the Strategy' is full of PC waffle with no real recommendations to help advance New Zealand's tertiary education system, National MP Tony Ryall said today.

Mr Ryall questioned Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey about the quality of the report in Parliament this afternoon.

"The report talks of a 'vision for a vision', 'characteristics of the vision for the vision' and of 'a desirability for a desire'. This sort of insipid waffle demonstrates exactly what's wrong with New Zealand's tertiary education system.

"It's a yapping lap dog of a report when it could have been a Huntaway.

"The report talks of the necessity of 'building stronger bridges into tertiary education'. If the TEAC report is the bridge to that bridge then it definitely will be the bridge to nowhere.

"It tries to be all things to all people with no clear sense of direction. There is no rigour and no analysis. If the authors' own students produced work like this, they would be given a fail grade.

"The round of statements supporting this report are like something out of 'The Emperors New Clothes'. They are all too polite or PC to speak up and say what they really see," Mr Ryall said.
