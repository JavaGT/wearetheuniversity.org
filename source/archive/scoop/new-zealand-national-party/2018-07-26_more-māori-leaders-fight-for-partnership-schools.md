Jo Hayes - Maori Education

26 July 2018

National’s spokesperson for Māori Education Jo Hayes stands in support of Dame Tariana Turia who has joined the fight for partnership schools, their students and their families.

“Dame Tariana has come out in support of the Treaty of Waitangi claim lodged by Sir Toby Curtis and Dame Iritana Tawhiwhirangi which opposes the shutdown of kura hourua (partnership schools),” Ms Hayes says.

“Like Sir Toby and Dame Iritana, Dame Tariana is a highly respected Māori leader and her support of partnership schools is further evidence that the Government is wrong to axe partnership schools and highlights the detrimental effect ending the model will have on Māori.

“It couldn’t be clearer that Education Minister Chris Hipkins’ scrapping of partnership schools is going to adversely affect Māori and Pasifika students who are currently excelling within the education model that was implemented by National in 2012.

“Partnership schools have worked for young Maori, many of whom are succeeding in education for the first time in their lives. It beggars belief that the 18 Māori MPs in the Coalition have not spoken out on this and Labour’s ideological opposition to these schools.

“These MPs are letting young Māori down by not fighting for the schools. They are either being kept silent by their coalition partners or they are unwilling to speak up for the communities that they represent now that they are Ministers. This is just wrong.

“Common sense must prevail to prevent young Māori from languishing in an education regime which does not work for them.”
