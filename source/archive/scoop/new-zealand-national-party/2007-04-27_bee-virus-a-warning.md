Bee virus a warning

Bee virus a warning

The discovery of Deformed Wing Bee virus in Waikato and Northland that occurs in Varroa-weakened hives is a warning Labour should take seriously, says National's Biosecurity spokesman, Shane Ardern.

"I've been saying for several years that the dangers we face are not just from the initial incursion. It's also about how Varroa will impact on our environment and our primary production industries in years to come.

"The Biosecurity Minister's appalling lack of immediate action to stem the flow of Varroa in the South Island will cost New Zealand dearly in the future.

"Not only are our hives now exposed to viruses but we also face a future where treatment for Varroa infected hives could be compromised.

"While the Labour Government has dismissed the concerns of the bee industry, the United States is holding workshops to come up with a plan of action to combat bee colony collapse disorder.

"The Deformed Wing Bee virus is a warning to Labour that they must step up and take responsibility now before we also face the same crisis as the United States."
