End the uncertainty for rural electricity users
===============================================

End the uncertainty for rural electricity users

National Party Energy spokesman Gerry Brownlee is repeating his call for Energy Minister David Parker to end the uncertainty surrounding the review of Section 62 of the Electricity Act.

“I’m pleased that Mr Parker has recognised the real concern this review is causing within the rural community, but would urge him to expedite the process and put an end to that uncertainty.

“I have been raising the genuine concerns of rural communities up and down the country, and cannot believe that this Minister has such a cavalier disregard for the concerns of thousands upon thousands of New Zealanders.”

Meanwhile, Mr Brownlee is urging Mr Parker to stop trying to score cheap political points and deal with some of the serious issues within the energy portfolio.

“Why for instance, has the Minister remained silent on criticisms from the Wind Energy Association, which says Labour is in fairyland with its targets for ‘renewables’?

“When I asked them this morning, not a single member of the Wind Energy Association was able to say their projects had been given a problem free passage through the Resource Management Act process.

“If Mr Parker was serious about delivering on Helen Clark’s unattainable goal of carbon neutrality, the Wind Energy Association’s concerns should be ringing alarm bells in his office.

“Mr Parker needs to start focussing on the big issues.”
