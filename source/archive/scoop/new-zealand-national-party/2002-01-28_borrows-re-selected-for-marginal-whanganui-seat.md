Press Release 27 January 2002

BORROWS RE-SELECTED FOR MARGINAL WHANGANUI SEAT

The National Party has selected Chester Borrows as its Candidate for this year's General Election in a meeting Friday night.

Mr Borrows who was the candidate in the seat last election and made a strong bid for the Constituency in 1999 was elected unopposed.

"Labour currently hold the seat by 3,100 votes but boundary changes add about that many votes to the electorate, as the towns of Kaponga, Manaia and Eltham come into the electorate," said Gerard Langford, the National Party Electorate Chair.

"With the new boundary changes this has become a very marginal and winnable seat for us. Chester won every booth in South Taranaki except Patea last time around and we expect a great result," he said.

Mr Borrows is an ex-Policeman having served for 24 years and achieving the rank of Detective Sergeant. He has spent the last 17 years in South Taranaki and is well known for leading the Goodwin murder investigation at Kaponga.. In 1978 Mr Borrows was awarded the Queens Commendation for Brave Conduct, and his name Published in the Gazette, after arresting an armed murderer in Wellington while being unarmed himself.

"Since the last election Chester has been at University and has completed a four year law degree in just 2 years. He is hard working, committed to the Whanganui Electorate, and we are very proud to have him as our candidate," said Mr Langford.

Mr Borrows is married with three children and has lived in the electorate since 1985. He is currently working as the interim minister in the Hawera Presbyterian Parish. This involves preaching, visiting and officiating at weddings and funerals.

"Since last Election Day I have been working behind the scenes and am keen to start campaigning again. The whole electorate is crying out for some credible representation in crucial issues, such as local health services, tertiary education and law and order," said Chester Borrows. "I am extremely worried about the direction many young people are heading in today. I am sick of seeing young people out on the streets late at night, often drunk and making nuisances of themselves. I want to encourage greater parental, community and individual responsibility for dealing with these problems."

Mr Borrows says his campaign will start immediately for the Election expected to be held in October of this year.
