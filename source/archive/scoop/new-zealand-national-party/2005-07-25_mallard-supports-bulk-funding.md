Mallard supports bulk funding

Mallard supports bulk funding

National Party Education spokesman Bill English says Labour and its friends at the teacher unions will be surprised and embarrassed by Trevor Mallard’s move towards the bulk funding of schools.

He is commenting on the release of the proposed terms of reference for a review of school funding which refer explicitly to Labour’s willingness to discuss trade-offs between teachers’ salaries and school operational costs.

Mr English says this idea is an abomination to teacher unions because, in practice, it amounts to bulk funding.

“There is no other way to describe the trade-off between teachers’ salaries and other costs. It’s bulk funding, pure and simple.

“The education unions will want Mr Mallard micro-chipped. Both the PPTA and the NZEI are running costly campaigns against National and now their Minister has undermined them by indicating that he actually agrees with National’s policy.

“It’s taken six years but finally Mr Mallard has opened his eyes to the fact that Labour’s ‘salaries first, students second’policy makes it hard for schools to do the best for their students,” says Mr English.

Resourcing mechanisms to be examined will include:

i) untagged cash funding; ii) contestable funding; iii) application funding;  
iv) in-kind resourcing; v) central purchasing; vi) partial-payment central purchasing;
