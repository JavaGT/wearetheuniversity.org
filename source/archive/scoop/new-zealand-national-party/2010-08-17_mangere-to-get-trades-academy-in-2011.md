Mangere to get Trades Academy in 2011
=====================================

**Mangere to get Trades Academy in 2011**

The Government today confirmed that Southern Cross Trades Academy based out of Mangere will be one of nine new Trades Academies to open in 2011.

"This is great for our students and for Mangere. It will keep young people engaged in learning, while they gain valuable skills for the workforce," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

"National promised to provide more educational opportunities through Youth Guarantee and Trades Academies, and we're delivering on that promise."

Southern Cross High School in Mangere will offer National Certificate Level 2 in hospitality in 2011. Thirty places will be available, with students spending three days a week at Southern Cross and two days on work experience.

"This innovative, flexible, and cooperative approach to education will help keep our 16 and 17 year olds within the education system longer and prepare them for work," Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

"It's fantastic for our community to be hosting one of nine academies that will help more than 800 young New Zealander's get the skills they need to succeed."

The academies are based on partnerships between schools, tertiary institutions, industry training organisations and employers. They enable students to earn both NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification, while gaining practical skills in the workplace.
