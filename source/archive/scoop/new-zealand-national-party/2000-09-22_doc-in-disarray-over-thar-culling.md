DOC In Disarray Over Thar Culling
=================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The news that the Department of Conservation intends to cull Himalayan Thar in the Mount Cook National Park, instead of allowing them to be used as a lucrative foreign exchange earner, shows that DOC "has no ability to think laterally", National's Tourism spokesperson David Carter said today.

"Hunting guides want to fly overseas clients into our high country to shoot the thar, an approach which could earn up to a million dollars in foreign exchange.

"Meanwhile DOC plans to spend thousands of dollars culling them. I don't see any sense in that.

"An opportunity exists for co-operation between DOC and hunters to shoot thar in specially designated areas of the Park.

"That would be a win-win situation for everyone.

"Why doesn't DOC tender a concession and earn income, rather than needlessly wasting taxpayer resources?

"From the point of view of earning foreign exchange and attracting more visitors to New Zealand DOC needs to be more sensible," David Carter said.
