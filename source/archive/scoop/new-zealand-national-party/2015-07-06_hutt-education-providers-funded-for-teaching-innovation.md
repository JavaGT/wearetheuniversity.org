Hutt education providers funded for teaching innovation

Two Hutt Valley projects, involving a range of local education providers, have received funding from the government’s $10 million Teacher-led Innovation Fund.

Work led by Maungaraki School will be funded for 18 months for a collaborative project investigating teaching practices that encourage student agency, and that have an impact on the achievement of priority learners. Our Lady of the Rosary School and Korokoro School will also be involved.

Sacred Heart Petone will lead a two year, collaborative teaching project into identifying “best practice” for learners transitioning to school. It will foster enduring connections with families, whanau, and communities. Other providers involved will include Imagine Childcare, Petone Beach Kindergarten, Alicetown Playcentre, Korokoro School andMaungaraki School.

The Teacher-Led Innovation Fund is part of National’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative, which aims to encourage collaboration between schools and lift teaching practice. The fund is open to primary and secondary teachers in state and state-integrated kura and schools, one of which is collaborating with neighbouring ECE services.

The fund is designed to encourage schools to look at different approaches to learning, particularly for students who are Māori, Pasifika, have special education needs, and/or come from low socio-economic backgrounds.

“It’s great to see Hutt education providers working together and taking advantage of this funding to focus on really important issues in our education system. I’m really looking forward to seeing the results of the work.

“I encourage other Hutt providers to consider applying when the next round of funding opens in November.”

The Hutt projects are two of 39 selected in the first round of funding. $2.6 million of the $10 million has so far been committed.  
“Our unrelenting focus as a government is on raising educational achievement for all students. The high calibre of entries for the Innovation Fund shows that our best teachers are really engaged with students, want to provide them with rich learning opportunities, and want to constantly improve their own teaching practice”, says Mr Bishop.
