Labour gives up on student loans

Labour gives up on student loans

The Government has failed to deliver on its promise to keep tertiary education affordable as graphically illustrated by figures on the level of student debt, says National Party Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power.

\"Whatever happened to Labour's pledge card election promise to cut the cost to students of tertiary education?"

In a letter to the University Students Association the Government has confirmed that student debt passed the $6 billion mark in March, and it has grown by about a billion dollars in the past year.

"The level of student debt has now doubled under Labour, and the average debt size is growing too," says Mr Power.

"Figures we've obtained from Inland Revenue show the average student debt has climbed from $12, 497 last year to $12,643 this year.

"And there is still no sign of the report into the much anticipated review of student support.

"Just last year, in the lead-up to the election, Steve Maharey promised that 'Labour will: In the first year of its second term, undertake a thorough Review of Student Support.'

"Still no release date has been set," says Mr Power.

"Labour promised the world but they've delivered very little.

"It's time for students to hold Mr Maharey to account," says Mr Power.
