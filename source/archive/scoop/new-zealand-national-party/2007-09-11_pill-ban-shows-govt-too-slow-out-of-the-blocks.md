Pill Ban Shows Govt Too Slow Out of the Blocks

Anti-party pill campaigner and National MP Jacqui Dean said the Manukau City Council was effectively doing the Government’s work for it, with its decision to remove party pills from all liquor outlets in the area.

“The Manukau City Council has decided that time has run out for party pills and has shown courage and leadership by removing them from liquor stores in the area.

“This moves clearly shows that communities want party pills gone and that the Government has been too slow in getting them off our streets.”

Back in June, Associate Health Minister Jim Anderton announced a ban on benzylpiperazine-based (BZP) products, or party pills, with the legislation likely to be passed by Christmas.

“Mr Anderton has clearly mis-read community concern over this issue. He should have shown some leadership months ago and pushed the ban on party pills through rather than leaving council’s like Manukau to do his dirty work.”

The Manukau City Council has moved to remove the herbal highs from all liquor outlets, thus pre-empting Government plans to ban party pills.

“We’ve been talking about the dangers of party pills for over two years now and still the Government expects people to wait.”

Mrs Dean said it was likely other councils around the country would follow Manukau’s lead.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if other council’s around the country, who’re frustrated at the Government’s inaction, don’t also move to run party pills out of their towns.”
