NCEA results show more students achieving in Mt Albert

List MP Melissa Lee welcomes the news that more kids in Mt Albert are passing NCEA Level 2 or higher. “In 2012 82 per cent of 16-year-olds achieved at least NCEA Level 2. This is 4 per cent more than passed in 2011,” Melissa Lee said.

"This is fantastic news. I want to say congratulations to all our hard working students, and thank you to all the parents, teachers, principals, and community members that helped our kids achieve this.”

The final NCEA results from 2012 show that 68 per cent of 16-year-olds achieved NCEA Level 2 last year – up 2 per cent from 2011.

“We know the better the school education, the better the opportunities for further education, employment, higher wages, and a better living standard,” Melissa Lee said.

“That’s why National set a Better Public Services target of 85 per cent of all 18-year-olds having achieved NCEA Level 2 or an equivalent qualification in 2017.

“We set it at all 18-year-olds because we want to capture everyone, including those students who gained the qualification in another learning environment.

“I believe making sure all children get a good education is the most important thing our Government can do to raise living standards and create a more competitive and productive economy for all New Zealanders – one of National’s priorities this term.”
