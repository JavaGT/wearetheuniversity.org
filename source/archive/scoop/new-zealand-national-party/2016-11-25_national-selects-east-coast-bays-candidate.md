**National selects East Coast Bays candidate**

Erica Stanford has been selected by National to contest the East Coast Bays electorate at the 2017 General Election.

Mrs Stanford is a born and bred East Coast Bays resident, having lived in the electorate for 35 years. She currently works as Senior MP Support in the local electorate office of Hon Murray McCully and has experience working overseas in export sales roles.

“I’m really thrilled to be chosen and grateful for the support I’ve received throughout the selection process,” Mrs Stanford says.

“Having been raised here, and now in turn raising my own kids here, I’m not exaggerating when I say I think it’s the best place to live in Auckland.

“We have a strong sense of community, fantastic and hard-working local businesses, great schools, and a stunning natural environment. I am now looking forward to going out and earning the right to be the next strong local voice for East Coast Bays.

“As a community advocate, a mother, and someone passionate about backing business growth, I know what our suburbs need to lock in the gains of the last few years.

“East Coast Bays has benefited from National’s sensible economic management and track record of getting things done for families and businesses.”

The East Coast Bays electorate covers the north-eastern suburbs of Auckland’s North Shore including Long Bay, Browns Bay, and Rothesay Bay, and extends west to cover Albany, Rosedale and Schnapper Rock. While the electorate’s boundaries have changed numerous times, the general area has been represented by Hon Murray McCully since 1987.

“From watching Murray up-close working for him, as one of his constituents, and seeing his work for New Zealand on the world stage, I know I’ve got big shoes to fill,” Mrs Stanford says.

“I feel incredibly lucky to count him as a mentor and friend, but will be campaigning on my own accomplishments, local knowledge, and commitment to ensuring East Coast Bays has a dedicated local voice in John Key’s National-led Government that has delivered for New Zealand and has a clear plan for the future.”
