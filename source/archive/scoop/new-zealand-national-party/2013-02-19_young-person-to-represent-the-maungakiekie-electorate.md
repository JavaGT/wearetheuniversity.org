“This is an exciting opportunity for one our electorate’s youth to experience first-hand and participate in the machinery of government, and be part of the public decision making processes in New Zealand,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“I am looking for an exceptional young person who is willing to get out and engage with the youth in our communities, gather their views and represent them in Parliament.

“If successful, this person will join 120 other Youth MPs from all over New Zealand when they take over New Zealand’s Parliament on 16 and 17 July.

“This year, my selection process will include engaging with local secondary schools to nominate two students for an opportunity to compete against other nominated students from the other local secondary schools at a gala evening on 3 April, to be selected my Youth MP by the selection panel.

Mr Lotu-Iiga further advises that, in addition to nominations from secondary schools, in recognition of young people who may be suitable for nomination but not currently in the secondary schooling system, there will also be opportunity to submit an application through the Electorate Office, for consideration to compete against the other nominated students.
