AUS gets it wrong

National Party Education spokesman Anne Tolley says a breathless attack by a spokeswoman for the Association of University Staff on National’s plan to improve trade training for young Kiwis is wrong.

“Nanette Cormack has got her facts wrong.

“The claim that National’s commitment to a Trades Academy in South Auckland amounts to capital funding for a private education centre is incorrect. Southern Cross is a State School.

“Second, National’s commitment to getting more trades in our schools was announced in June 2007, so Ms Cormack’s attack on that is totally out of date.

“I have absolutely no problem with Ms Cormack expressing a view. But it is important that she get her facts straight.

“National has made a substantial commitment to public school funding where Labour has not. It has costed its policy and revealed the figures. Labour has not. Where’s the attack statement from Ms Cormack on that?”
