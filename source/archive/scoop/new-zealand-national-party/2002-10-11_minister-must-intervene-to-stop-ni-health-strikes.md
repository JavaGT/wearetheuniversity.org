Minister must intervene to stop NI health strikes

Dr Lynda Scott - National Health Spokesperson

National Health spokesperson Dr Lynda Scott says Health Minister Annette King must explain to North Island patients what measures she is putting in place to ensure continued health services during industrial action this month.

Industrial action is looming at at least nine hospitals over the next month. On Tuesday 2000 Waikato nurses strike. Nurses at Taupo and Rotorua strike on Wednesday, followed by nurses at Gisborne and Northland the next week when therapists at Mid Central Health also withdraw their services.

Dr Scott said Annette King had a history of ignoring health strikes and allowing services to close down or be significantly reduced.

“These strikes will push waiting lists out even further, with the cancellation of operations and appointments. The Minister has had plenty of warning about this industrial action, and plenty of experience after the mess that occurred in Canterbury.

“Health boards around the country are desperately short of funding and having to cut services as it is. They cannot maintain the staff they have. This is the Minister’s responsibility and she must intervene,” Dr Scott said.
