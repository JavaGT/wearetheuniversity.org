Hon Bill English  
National Party Education Spokesman

Good appointment, bad strategy

National's Education spokesman, Bill English, says the appointment of experienced politician Russell Marshall to the Tertiary Education Commission will not fix Labour's fundamentally flawed tertiary education strategy.

"The Government has opted for a high-cost bureaucracy and politicised mechanism to direct the choices hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders enrolled in tertiary study.

"Steve Maharey left the tertiary education strategy in a shambles but it will take a lot more than one sensible appointment to sort it out.

"National will support Russell Marshall if he cracks down on low-quality courses and pulls back budget blowouts."

Mr English says that in the long-term the Government will have to go a much less complicated and more strategic means of directing the tertiary sector.
