Sickness And Invalids Outnumber Unemployed

Judith Collins MP

National Party Welfare Spokeswoman

28 March 2005

Sickness and invalids outnumber unemployed

National’s Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins has released figures which show that, in every region except Wellington, there are now more people getting sickness and invalid benefits than there are getting the dole.

“No amount of Labour Party propaganda can disguise the fact that under Helen Clark, true unemployment is being obscured by the numbers on the sickness and invalid benefits.

“Here we have vast numbers of people collecting long-term benefits that aren’t work tested, while New Zealand businesses are facing their worst skills shortages in 30 years.

“Answers to Parliamentary questions show that in Canterbury and the West Coast, the number of sickness and invalid beneficiaries outnumber those on the unemployment benefit by three to one.

“In the Auckland, Waikato, East Coast, Central and Southern regions there are twice (or nearly twice) as many sickness and invalid beneficiaries as there are on the unemployment benefit.

“Yet in April last year, after two typically cynical pre-announcements, Labour unveiled its much-heralded sickness and invalid benefits pilot strategy.

“So why is it that by the end of January this year there were even more people on those two benefits than there were last April?

“While the pilot has had some limited success for relatively small numbers of people, Labour still refuses to accept there is any abuse of the system.

“Labour has made a lot of noise about sorting out the mess, but nothing ever happens. They bluntly refuse to talk about work testing and they’re predicting the number on welfare will rise.

“National will work to reduce the number on welfare by about a third over the next ten years.

“National will also implement a more thorough medical evaluation process for sickness and invalids’ benefits. In particular, the next National Government will work with doctors’ groups to ensure consistency in the way those applying for sickness and invalids’ benefits are evaluated,” says Ms Collins.

From December 1997 to June 1999 (under the previous Government) the number of community wage (sickness) beneficiaries was decreasing.
