Flood Victims Still Waiting For A Lifejacket
============================================

**Wednesday, 12 April 2000, 3:10 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The Government should match its words with action and come up with a funding package for the Alexandra flooding work programme, says Otago MP Gavan Herlihy.

"The time for rhetoric is over. The Alexandra community needs action. Some residents and businesses are faced with the untenable situation of squatting in uninsurable flood-prone properties," Mr Herlihy said.

Mr Herlihy's comments follow a meeting today between community representatives, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister and senior Government Officials.

"The Government must negotiate immediately with Contact Energy Limited to come up with a funding package to implement the various flood remedial actions recommended by Alex Adams, the Flood Solutions Co-ordinator.

"Of immediate concern are those houses and commercial businesses that are uninhabitable and those properties that are now uninsurable.

"Alexandra residents should not have the anxiety of waiting any longer," Mr Herlihy said.
