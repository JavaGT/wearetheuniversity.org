National MP Jono Naylor is delighted that 2,448 children in the Manawatu-Wanganui region are receiving free breakfasts in schools under the KickStart Breakfast programme.

“As children head back to school this term I am pleased to announce 86 schools in the Wanganui Manawatu region are offering free breakfasts through the KickStart Breakfast Programme.

“This is an increase of 30 local schools participating since the Government expanded the programme,” says National MP Jono Naylor.

KickStart provides free breakfasts five days a week in all primary and secondary schools, regardless of decile, that want or need it.

“An overwhelming majority of participating schools report the programme is very important to them.

“Schools also advise that through KickStart they are seeing improvements in the health and wellbeing, concentration, and behaviour of students.

“KickStart helps to keep New Zealand children healthy and ready to learn,” says Naylor

5 million breakfasts across the country have now been served since the Government expanded the programme in 2013.

KickStart Breakfast is supplied through the National Government’s partnership with Fonterra and Sanitarium.
