Maharey backdown will be too late for families

The Government's ill thought-out '20 hours free' childcare scheme is coming apart at the seams, and they need to move quickly to tell parents what will be happening when it starts on July 1, says National's Early Childhood spokeswoman, Paula Bennett.

She is commenting on a report that Education Minister Steve Maharey has decided to visit some centres and to 'sit down and listen'.

"Just four months before the scheme for 3- and 4-year-olds is due to start, he's finally decided to go and listen to the people who will have to deliver the scheme.

"He's finally softening because he realises that if he fails to deliver this promise to families then it is a potential election loser.

"National have been telling him all along that centres will not be taking up the scheme, that thousands of children will miss out, and that this was just an ill thought-out election bribe with no chance of delivery.

"Now, finally, he has met with the sector and now even thinks he might visit a few centres.

"But it is too little, too late.

"Parents have a right to know what will be available to their children come July 1.

"Addressing cost issues in May's budget, as Steve Maharey has suggested, is simply ridiculous.

"How out of touch can he be? Parents need to know where they stand right now.

"Even Steve Maharey knows this scheme is not going to work in its current form.

"He needs to move quickly to let parents know what will be happening come 1 July."
