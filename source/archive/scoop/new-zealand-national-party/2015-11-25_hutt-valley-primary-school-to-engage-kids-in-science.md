**Hutt Valley primary school to engage kids in science and tech**

Students at Koraunui Primary School in Stokes Valley will be the beneficiaries of new funding which aims to engage more young Kiwis with science and technology. Under the Unlocking Curious Minds contestable fund pilot, Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce today announced that additional funding of nearly $1 million has been awarded to 25 new projects, including $20,000 for Koraunui Primary.

The announcement is being welcomed by National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, Chris Bishop, who says the success of Koraunui Primary will help continue to transform the Hutt Valley into “Technology Valley”.

“This funding will help nurture the mind of the Hutt’s future scientists and innovators. There is a lot of potential for the Hutt Valley to become New Zealand’s centre for the science and technology industries, and it is important that we encourage our young people to take up the challenge,” says Mr Bishop.

“This project will also teach students about collaboration, with the involvement of local engineers, Hutt City Council personnel, and local tradespeople. This positive community-based approach to teaching and learning is a blueprint for success in the Hutt.”

Koraunui Primary students will investigate the science and engineering of structures that can be built by the children in the new development of a community garden in the school grounds. Mr Bishop says this will provide additional benefits to the community alongside the educational value provided to the students.

A further Unlocking Curious Minds funding round calling for new applications is expected to be announced before the end of the year. For more information, visit [www.curiousminds.nz/ucm](http://www.curiousminds.nz/ucm).
