$200,000 to support popular Polyfest

National’s Pacific Affairs Spokesman Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has today announced that if re-elected National will provide financial backing for the most popular Pacific youth event in New Zealand, the ASB Polyfest.

Polyfest is an annual Auckland Secondary Schools Maori and Pacific Islands Cultural Festival. Attracting around 9,000 students, it is the biggest event of its kind in the world.

National will contribute $200,000 over three years.

“Polyfest is the largest Māori and Pacific youth festival in the country as well as one of the largest secondary schools events in the world. It provides an opportunity for families and young people to come together and share their cultural heritage through song, speech and dance.

“The cost of putting on the event has increased over the years, and this year’s event was hit hard by Cyclone Lusi which affected attendance and revenue,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

National will provide $150,000 of funding over three years, plus an additional $50,000 next year to help mark the Festival’s 40th birthday celebrations. These celebrations are expected to attract over 100,000 people.

Mr Lotu-Iiga says the injection of funds will ensure schools, parents and communities can continue to enjoy this popular festival.

“Pacific language, culture and values need to be preserved and National recognises that, that’s why we are providing funding to help support and provide certainty to this iconic event,” adds Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“Celebrating and sharing our cultural identity is essential for the wellbeing of our children, families and the wider community.”
