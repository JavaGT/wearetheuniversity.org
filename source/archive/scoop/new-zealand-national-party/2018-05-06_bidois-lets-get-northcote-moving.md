Bidois: Let’s get Northcote moving
==================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

**Bidois: Let’s get Northcote moving**  
  
National’s Northcote candidate Dan Bidois officially launched his campaign today, outlining a plan to get the electorate moving and to fight for the area to get the services it pays for and deserves.

Mr Bidois was joined by party leader Simon Bridges and hundreds of supporters from the electorate and across Auckland.

“People living and working here do not feel like they are being listened to, do not feel like they are getting their fair share,” Mr Bidois says.

“We pay for everyone else’s improvements but don’t see any ourselves and as your Member of Parliament I will fight for a plan that will get Northcote moving.”

Mr Bidois outlined his three campaign priorities, focussing on a comprehensive set of transport solutions; fighting against fuel tax increases the electorate won’t benefit from; and ensuring housing developments are supported with good infrastructure and services.

“I want to bring my economic credentials, my real-world experience, and my determination, to get results for Northcote – in opposition where I can now, and in the future, in a new National-led Government,” Mr Bidois says.

Party leader Simon Bridges told the audience that Northcote really matters to National, but that it was taking nothing for granted.

“By-elections are notoriously tough to fight, but Dan Bidois is absolutely the best candidate with the skills and determination to deliver for Northcote,” Mr Bridges says.

“National is committed in Opposition to holding the Government to account for its reckless spending and lack of focus on results, and then to lead the next Government so we can get on with the job of lifting incomes and improving the lives of all New Zealanders.

“Dan will be an important part of our team and we will be fighting hard to have him join our Caucus in June.”  
  
  
**Dan Bidois Campaign Launch Speech**  
  
Well good afternoon all!

It’s fantastic to be here launching our campaign for Northcote.

Today I am going to lay out my three point plan for Northcote, tell you what I stand for, what I will stand against, and how we can improve the lives of the people of this great area I call home.

Firstly, let me acknowledge Party president Peter Goodfellow, Board members, all of the Members of Parliament in the room, the Northcote executive, and all of our supporters, Party members and my family.

I especially want to acknowledge our party leader Simon Bridges. It’s been said that we look a little like each other. Well Simon, if I can be anywhere near as successful as you have been in your political career, then I’ll be pretty happy.

This election isn’t about me though. It’s about the people of Beach Haven, Glenfield, Birkenhead and all of the other great communities that make up Northcote.

It is for the workers, those down on their luck, the aspirational, the retired, the successful and those struggling from pay-cheque to pay-cheque. I believe in them, I believe in their abilities and I believe they deserve an MP who will stand up for them and who will fight for them.

I am that person.

This election is about the people of Northcote and who will be most effective local voice in Parliament, to fight for them to get what they work hard and pay for. I do not under estimate the magnitude of the job I will have as the local MP for Northcote.

I am going to state it quite simply.

People living and working here do not feel like they are being listened to, do not feel like they are getting their fair share.

Year after year they pay their rates, they pay their taxes and they feel largely ignored compared to other parts of Auckland.

They see progress being made in other parts of the city and they quite rightly ask why are we paying for it, why aren’t we addressing our challenges here in Northcote.

Let me say this:

ENOUGH of Northcote residents being treated like a piggybank by Auckland Council and this Labour Government.

ENOUGH of Northcote watching as the city grows and we are getting left behind.

ENOUGH of Council and government bureaucrats telling us that they know better.

Northcote needs a fighter – and you know what, I’ve been a fighter all my life.

I was really lucky to be adopted by a wonderful family when I was 9 months old. We weren’t wealthy but my parents worked hard and instilled that value in me.

I dropped out of school at 15 and almost went down the wrong track in life.

What saved me was a butcher’s apprenticeship which taught me about personal responsibility and respect for my boss’ business. It taught me respect for the business he created, and the wage he paid me.

At around the same time I was diagnosed with bone cancer. That really makes you think about what’s most important in life. It taught me to value each day, to grab opportunities – and to care about others.

I then had another life-changing moment when I discovered my passion for education. It opened my mind and challenged me and I loved it, I ended up with a master’s degree from Harvard.

Initially I set my sights on a corporate career but I had in mind that I would one day come back and do something for my community.

I feel incredibly privileged and humbled to be the National Party Candidate for Northcote. But at the end of the day what are we fighting for on behalf of the people of Northcote? Well here’s what I stand for.

**First, transport. Let’s get Northcote moving.**

Knocking on doors, I’m consistently hearing that this is the biggest issue for the people of Northcote.

From buses to ferries to Onewa Road to second harbour crossings and Skypath. We spend too much time sitting in traffic or waiting for a ferry and we are over it.

We pay for everyone else’s improvements but don’t see any ourselves and as your MP I will fight for a comprehensive transport plan that will get Northcote moving.

There isn’t one solution so I will hold Council to account for us to get our services improved, for example they could actually listen to the community and trial T2 lanes!

Central government too needs to address the traffic concerns here and I will be fighting hard to ensure that happens - whoever the government is.

I will support Skypath, but make sure that it stacks up financially and residents’ rights and privacy are maintained.

**Second, I say NO to new fuel taxes for Northcote.**

I’ve done the math. Northcote residents are going to pay an extra $11.6 million per year in fuel taxes. That’s made up of $6.3 million for fuel excise and $5.3 million for Regional Fuel Taxes. That’s $700 extra a year per family.

How on earth can the Council and this Labour government justify taxing us more when we don’t even get our fair share now?

They charge families more, while letting Council off the hook for expenditure they should already be prioritising.  
We already have significant shortfalls in our own Auckland Council transport plan and I don’t believe we should pay more in regional and government fuel taxes to fund other parts of the city, without getting anything for it.

**Finally, let’s improve our local services.**

As your MP I want to ensure intensified housing developments have the infrastructure they need around them – that means carparks, waste-water drainage, sufficient schools and transport infrastructure.

If there are intensification plans without the necessary services proposed, like what’s proposed on Zion Road, then I will oppose them and I’ll be vocal about it.

So friends, that is what I stand for and that’s what we are campaigning on. Transport, no more fuel taxes, and improved services for Northcote.

Our campaign is a positive one. I will not participate in mud-slinging. I will debate the issues that matter to the people of Northcote and I am not interested in personality politics.

I’ve got an outstanding team alongside me. We have been campaigning in rain, hail, and sunshine. I want to thank Paula Bennett our fabulous and always energetic campaign chair. I want to thank the over 200 volunteers that have already been out supporting me.

As of today, we have already hand delivered 30,000 flyers, have over 100 billboards up, hosting pub meetings, human hoardings and been knocking on thousands of doors – and the campaign hasn’t officially started till today.

I look forward to meeting as many people of the Northcote electorate that I can in the next 34 days.

We cannot take anything for granted. I’ll be working hard to earn the right to be your MP.

Northcote, our campaign is just getting started. We’ve got a lot of work to do, and I know I can count on the support of all of you here. So let’s get out there and show Northcote just how strong our commitment to them is.

Thank you.
