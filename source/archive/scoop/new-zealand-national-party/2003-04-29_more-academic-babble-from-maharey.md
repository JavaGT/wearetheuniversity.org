More academic babble from Maharey

The new funding package for social scientists shows how totally out of touch Labour is, according to National's Tertiary Education spokesperson Simon Power.

"At a time when cancer patients have to go to Australia to get treatment and police can't afford to investigate car crashes, Labour has decided that what New Zealand really needs is $8.6 million of spending on social science academics.

"Former sociology lecturer Steve Maharey is giving an indication of how he will use his new powers to control who gets money in the tertiary sector. We can expect to see more funding for bureaucratic bodies like the 'Social Policy Evaluation Research Committee.'

"I wonder what John Tamihere makes of all this. If the policy they produce is as coherent as his press release and speech, then we are in for a whole heap of trouble," said Mr Power.
