Taxpayer ad campaign for ECE misses target

Taxpayer ad campaign for ECE misses target

National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich is questioning whether taxpayers received value for money from a poorly targeted TV ad campaign for the Government's fraudulent 20 hours free policy.

"When academic research confirms that mums are key to the decision about children's participation in early childhood education, why has the 20 hours free commercial been shown during hardcore wrestling shows like Smackdown, Raw, and Extreme Championship Wrestling - shows watched largely by young men?" Mrs Rich asked in Parliament today.

Answers to written parliamentary questions show the TV campaign, worth more than $260,000, secured advertising spots in the most unlikely of places.

"I would argue that placing taxpayer-funded ads for early childhood education during shows like Smackdown, Raw and ECW is unlikely to be a very effective vehicle to promote any kind of early childhood education message.

"Labour has been pretty blatant about the purpose of this campaign.

"Given the looming failure on the key promise of 20 hours free early childhood education for all 3 and 4-year-olds, Steve Maharey's hoping parents will pressure ECE centres into accepting the Government's second rate policy.

"In a bid to sway opinion, Labour is spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars advertising a policy that does not yet exist, and a policy which early childhood centres are rejecting in droves. It's even more wasteful when the communications are so ill-targeted.

"What's the point of paying for cheap slots during wrestling, car shows and golf when many of the viewers will not be remotely interested in an early childhood education message?"
