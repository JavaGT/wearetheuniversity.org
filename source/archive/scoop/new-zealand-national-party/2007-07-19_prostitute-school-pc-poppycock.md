Prostitute School - PC poppycock

National Party Family Affairs Spokeswoman

Prostitute School - PC poppycock

The fact that the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) will seriously consider funding a course in prostitution would be side-splittingly hilarious if they weren't so deadly serious, says National's Family Affairs spokeswoman, Judith Collins.

At yesterday's Education and Science Select Committee, MPs were questioning TEC officials on changes into how tertiary education is funded. From next year institutes will be bulk funded and concerns have been raised that the TEC refuses to dictate what is or isn't appropriate as a course subject.

"CEO Janice Shiner actually told the select committee that, if someone offered to provide a course in prostitution, they would assess it against the same criteria as any other course.

"Has Labour not learnt from the 'ghosts of courses past'? Does it not recall the public ridicule over funding twilight golf and hip hop research?

"Does it not strike anyone else as idiotically ironic that Labour is happy to dictate almost every aspect of its citizens' lives through its social engineering policies, but can't make a decision on what might be appropriate for tertiary education funding?

"They are happy to tell New Zealanders they can't be trusted with saving for their retirement, eating healthily, or disciplining their children, but can't make a simple synapse connection that using taxpayer funds to teach girls how to sell their bodies might be unwise."
