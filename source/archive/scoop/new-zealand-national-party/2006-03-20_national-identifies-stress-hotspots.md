National identifies stress 'hotspots'

National Party Welfare spokeswoman Judith Collins says official figures have identified the welfare system's stress "hotspots".

"Waitemata boasts the largest number of people collecting a non-work tested stress benefit," says Ms Collins.

"There are 1,481\* people collecting a stress benefit in Waitemata. The region with the second highest number is Canterbury on 1,160\*."

Ms Collins says that when the numbers are broken down as a percentage of the total number of sickness beneficiaries, Nelson surprisingly emerges as the stress capital.

"15.6% of working age people receiving a sickness benefit in Nelson are on that benefit because of stress."

Using the same calculations, Manukau ends up having the least stressed beneficiaries, "even though it's just down the road from Waitemata".

According to the figures there are 7,468\* beneficiaries collecting a stress benefit.

"National believes there needs to be a more consistent approach to the application of the non-work tested sickness and invalid benefits. We simply should not continue to accept failure by encouraging so many people to opt out of the workforce indefinitely because of stress. Common sense tells us that being out of work and on a benefit is likely to add stress rather than to take it away.

"Yes, there will always be those who can never work because of sickness or injury, but let's not give up on those who are able to help themselves," says Ms Collins.
