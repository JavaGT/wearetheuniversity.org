Porn birth is liberalness gone too far

Dr Paul Hutchison - Port Waikato MP

National MP Dr Paul Hutchison, a specialist obstetrician, says the appropriate Government Minister should take an urgent appeal to the Court of Appeal to stop the commercial filming of the proposed birth at Waikato hospital for pornography.

“The focus of any labour and delivery should be on the safety and well-being of the mother and child. The fact that the High Court judgment will allow two cameramen at the birth is a reflection of society getting it’s priorities totally out of perspective.

“Even though the judge has put restrictions on the situation including disallowing any images of the baby, liberalness has gone too far if we condone filming of births in a public hospital for the purposes of pornography.

“If this isn’t sending the wrong signals about what is usually a private, sensitive and miraculous event in a family’s life, what is?

“The last 30 years have seen a welcome renaissance for patients during birth – but this is frankly bizarre, and whatever Minister is responsible should make an urgent appeal to stop it,” said Dr Hutchison.
