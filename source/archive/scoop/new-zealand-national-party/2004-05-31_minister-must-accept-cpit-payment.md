Minister must accept CPIT payment

Steve Maharey must accept Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology's offer to pay back $80,000 that it spent on inducements in breach of the rules, says National's Education spokesman, Bill English.

\"Maharey has been nit-picking about the rules but hasn't indicated that he will take any action over the CPIT funding scam."

The chairman of the CPIT council told Christchurch radio listeners that CPIT would pay back the $80,000 it spent on purchasing the gifts it gave to those enrolling in the controversial Cool-IT course if it is found that the inducements were in breach of the rules.

"Section 3.1.1.2 of the Interim Guide to Tertiary Funding expressly states that money cannot be spent on inducements," says Mr English.

"Steve Maharey should take the money to show that the Government will enforce the prudent use of taxpayer money.

"I understand the $80,000 covers only book vouchers. CPIT also paid $20 to schools and libraries for each enrolment and this money should also be paid back.

"I welcome moves by the Government to cut the funding and tighten the rules," says Mr English.
