Maharey embarrassed on employment policy

Maharey's tirade against National's employment policy shows how insecure he feels about his own performance as Minister of Social Services, says National's employment spokesman Bob Simcock

"His constant reference to the unemployment rates shows he is uncomfortable looking at what is actually happening to New Zealand families as a result of his management.

"If things are going so well why are food banks in such demand?

"Why do we have 18,000 young people under twenty years of age living on welfare?

"Why are so many people over forty finding it impossible to even get an interview for a job?

"Why is the forestry industry still finding it hard to get anyone to work in low skill jobs?

"The answer is that Maharey has overseen a period of lowered expectations, where work is increasingly seen as optional. His low expectations for his fellow New Zealanders are a betrayal of the three hundred and seventy thousand people who have to live on welfare.

"When it comes to dealing with unemployment the Labour Government has been comfortable harvesting the easy fruit and leaving the rest to rot," said Mr Simcock.
