Brash to visit Samoa

National Party Leader Don Brash flies to Samoa this week on a trip that will include meetings with the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition.

He will leave on Wednesday afternoon and arrive home on Saturday.

During the visit he will meet Samoan Prime Minister Hon. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Deputy Prime Minister Hon. Misa Telefoni, Finance Minister Hon. Niko Lee-Hang, and Central Bank Governor Leasi P. Tommy Scanlan.

He will also meet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Hon. Asiata Saleimoa Va'ai.

Other activities will include a visit to the National University of Samoa, inspection of an NZAid project, and attendance at a long boat race that forms part of the Teuila Festival.

This is the second visit to a Pacific Island nation this year by Dr Brash. In March he undertook a similar trip to the Cook Islands.

\"National is keen to extend and improve relationships with Pacific communities. This visit to Samoa will build on that aim, and I'm looking forward to my talks with both politicians and local people."

Dr Brash will be accompanied by National Foreign Affairs spokesman Murray McCully, Associate Foreign Affairs spokesman (Pacific Affairs & ODA) John Hayes, and a member of Dr Brash's staff.
