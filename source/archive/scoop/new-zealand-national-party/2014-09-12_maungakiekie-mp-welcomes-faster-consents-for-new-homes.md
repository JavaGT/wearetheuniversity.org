Maungakiekie MP welcomes faster consents for new homes

Maungakiekie MP welcomes faster consents for up to 2,678 new local homes

  
Maungakiekie MP Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga welcomes the announcement of 3 new Special Housing Areas (SHAs) in Maungakiekie which will enable up to 2,678 new homes to be built.

SHAs were initiated as part of Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013. The sites are recommended by the Auckland Council and approved by Cabinet and the Governor-General.

The 3 new areas will fast-track the consent process on houses in Barrack Road in Mount Wellington, Morrin Street in Ellerslie and the Tāmaki Regeneration Area. This will cover approximately 113 hectares or an area around 70 times the size of Eden Park.

“The new areas will open up thousands of new homes in our electorate and community by making it faster to gain consents. Instead of waiting an average of 1 year for the consent process, approval is now legally required within 3 months. This means quicker access to more warm, dry and affordable homes for our families.”

“This also complements the work we are doing to address housing affordability. We are making development contributions fairer and more transparent, we have removed tariffs and duties from building materials and we are investing in industry skills and trades training.”

“It also shows that the work our government is doing on housing in Auckland is having a tangible impact. Building consents for the year to the end of July show an increase of 30 per cent. This is the highest rate of increase in a decade.”

“We are committed to ensuring all New Zealanders have access to affordable housing. That is why we have also released details of our $218 million HomeStart package to help more than 90,000 first home buyers into their first homes over the next 5 years.”
