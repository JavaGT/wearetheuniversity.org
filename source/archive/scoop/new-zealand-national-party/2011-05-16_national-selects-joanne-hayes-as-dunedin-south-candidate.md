**National Selects Joanne Hayes as Dunedin South Candidate**  
National Party Dunedin South Electorate Chair Robyn Broughton is pleased to announce that Joanne Hayes will be the Party’s Dunedin South candidate for the upcoming General Election.

“The National Party values the support we receive from the Dunedin South Electorate and we are delighted to have Joanne as our candidate to contest the November 26 election.

“Joanne will put her heart and soul into campaigning for the issues that matter in Dunedin South.

Hayes says she is humbled by the selection and looking forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege to represent the people of Dunedin South in John Key’s Government.

“For the community this election is about giving Dunedin South a strong voice in Government. The sense I get from the community is that it understands National’s plan to grow the economy, to start living within our means as a country, deliver enduring jobs, and build the critical infrastructure to future proof New Zealand and our region.

“As we emerge from the recession, and the disaster that has hit Canterbury, it has become even more impor¬tant for our Government to make sensible spending decisions so future generations of Kiwis aren’t left with a legacy of debt.

“I believe that John Key’s reliable and proven leadership is critically important for our country’s future and will be doing my utmost to insure it continues.”

Hayes has a strong background in health, business, and agriculture. She is currently the Chief Executive of Ngai Tai O Te Awa Trust.

Of Scottish and Maori descent, Hayes was raised in the rural community of Rangiwahia and attended Massey University. A mother of two, Hayes currently lives in the Manawatu with her husband Pat, and will move to Dunedin in June.
