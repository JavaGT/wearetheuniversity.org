Kids should be safe at school

Kids should be safe at school

National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich is calling for an independent investigation into how an eight year old Christchurch girl was able to wander from her classroom and out of school grounds where she was then indecently assaulted.

The Christchurch Press today reported the case after the young girl's mother came forward.

The woman said her daughter had become 'frustrated' in class and wandered outside, across a school field and out an open back gate. A man living next to the school saw her on the street and lured her into his house where he allegedly indecently assaulted her.

"This is a sickening situation and every parent and teacher's worst nightmare," says Mrs Rich.

"The Board of Trustees has acted appropriately in conducting an investigation however, given the serious nature of the incident and the friction this has caused between the Board and the parent, I believe it is important that an independent investigation is undertaken.

"After such a serious breach of a child's safety, it is vital that a fresh, independent set of eyes check that proper process and procedures were followed, and make recommendations not only for the school concerned but others throughout New Zealand.

"Every parent should be able to assume their child will be safe when they drop them off to school.

"The parents at this Christchurch school deserve an assurance that every aspect of this tragedy has been reviewed and changes made to ensure all students are safe and secure."
