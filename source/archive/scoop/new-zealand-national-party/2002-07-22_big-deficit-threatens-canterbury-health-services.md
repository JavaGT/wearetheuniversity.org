Big Deficit Threatens Canterbury Health Services

The future of Canterbury GP services hanging in the balance shows that the region's health system is only just being held together, says National Health Spokesperson Roger Sowry.

"As a result of its large $23m deficit, the Canterbury District Health Board is considering cutting back or dropping some of the services it funds. Pegasus is Canterbury's largest GP and deserves certainty with its contract.

"These deficit cuts are putting Canterbury primary health care services at risk. The Canterbury board cannot confirm that there won't be disruptions to health services in the region this week.

"Here we have a board with a poor record when dealing with disruptions, with a large deficit they simply can't wipe without cuts to services, and at the same time Labour is claiming that voters should believe that Labour is looking after health services.

"This board has such a high deficit and has services at risk because the Government has not funded it adequately. National will wipe district health board deficits and put more money into health services," Mr Sowry said.
