**Funding For Firth Restoration**  
  
The Firth of Thames is one of five sensitive waterways earmarked for restoration as part of a $20 million investment by the Department of Conservation and Fonterra.

The work will be carried out through a 10-year partnership between DOC and the dairy giant which will include farmers, conservationists and iwi.

“Some people are of the belief that big business and the environment cannot co-exist. This Government not only believes they can co-exist, but that they can work together in a way benefits both. This partnership is an excellent example of that,” said Coromandel MP Scott Simpson.

Fonterra’s commitment of $20m is the largest ever corporate contribution to conservation work. It will fund a massive programme to be undertaken with communities to restore wetland habitats, better control nutrients, reduce pests and weeds and enhance native wildlife.

“This project will get local conservationists and farmers working side-by-side in their local communities doing practical work to improve waterways – something that all of us want. I think we will quickly find it is not one side or the other and business growth and, with the right attitudes and processes, environmental protection can go hand in hand.” The other four areas selected are Kaipara Harbour in Northland, the Areare, Ruatuna and Rotomanuka Peat Lakes in Waikato, Lake Ellesmere in Canterbury and Waituna Lagoon in Southland.

The next step will be forming local teams of farmers, conservationists, local authorities and iwi to develop action plans for each water body. The focus is on improving water quality and enhancing the habitat for native species like mudfish, bittern, fernbirds and long-finned eel.

“The partnership is part of the Government’s Bluegreen agenda of drawing business and conservation closer together to support economic growth and jobs while protecting our natural environment and great Kiwi lifestyle,” Mr Simpson said.
