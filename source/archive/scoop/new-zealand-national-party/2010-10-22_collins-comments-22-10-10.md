**Collins Comments**  
This month I was privileged to visit New Zealand’s Police contingent serving in **Afghanistan.**

I enjoyed staying with our officers and our Defence Force on site at the Provisional Reconstruction Team (PRT) camp in Bamyan Province before flying to Kabul to catch up with our Defence personnel based there and to have meetings with officials.

I learnt a great deal about the daily tasks facing our officers in the region and was delighted to hear praise for the officers from local Police and officials. New Zealand Police are well regarded for the mentoring role they have in the training of the Afghan National Police in Bamyan.

Our team’s professionalism and ability to connect with Afghan people made me immensely proud.

These officers are making an enormous contribution in the area by developing the skills of the local police force so Afghanistan can move towards a more peaceful and stable future.

Last week the Prime Minister announced **The New Zealand Defence Service Medal** which would recognise the contribution of NZ servicemen and women in military training and active duty.

The medal will recognise non-operational military service in the Defence Force by New Zealanders who have served for more than three years since World War Two, and those who did compulsory military training or national military service.

The Government is initially calling for applicants aged 50 and over, but it will be opened up to all others within a year. In cases where an ex-serviceman or woman has passed away, their family can still apply for the medal.

As Minister of Police, I recently launched a new system that enables deaf and hearing impaired people to contact the **111** emergency service by text.

The vast majority of us take a lot of comfort from knowing that in an emergency, help from Police, fire or ambulance is just a call away but our deaf and hearing impaired community often has a more challenging time summoning help.

I’m delighted the new 111 text service will give these New Zealanders quick access to emergency services no matter where they are.

I’d like to acknowledge the successful candidates in the recent **local body elections**. I congratulate former Papakura Mayor Calum Penrose on his election to the new Auckland Council as councillor for the Manurewa-Papakura Ward.

I also congratulate John Robinson, Brent Catchpole, Graham Purdy, Michael Turner, Caroline Conroy and Hine Joyce-Tahere on their appointment to Papakura’s local board.

I share their pride in Papakura and look forward to working with them in the future. My commiserations go to the unsuccessful candidates who put their names forward and worked hard to be elected.

I enjoyed attending the annual **Pink Breakfast** at Strathallan School to help raise money for Breast Cancer. The creativity and hard-work he students put into the event was amazing. Well done!
