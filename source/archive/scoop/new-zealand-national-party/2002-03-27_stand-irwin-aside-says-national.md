Stand Irwin Aside Says National
===============================

National MP Murray McCully has called for Teachers' Council chair, Kathleen Irwin, to be stood aside pending the State Services Commission inquiry announced today.

Mr McCully said he was pleased that the Minister of Education will establish a formal inquiry following questions raised during the General Debate in Parliament this afternoon.

"Mr Mallard has described the new Teachers' Council as "the flagship for ethics and standards in education". Clearly the Minister now acknowledges that serious questions need to be answered given the statement by Victoria University that they had no knowledge of Ms Irwin's contractual relationship with the Christchurch College of Education, whilst she was a fulltime employee of Victoria.

"Questions also need to be answered as to why Ms Irwin was the shareholder/director of a company called He Parekereke Limited at the same time that she was director of He Parekereke (the Institute for Research and Development in Maori Education)," said Mr McCully.
