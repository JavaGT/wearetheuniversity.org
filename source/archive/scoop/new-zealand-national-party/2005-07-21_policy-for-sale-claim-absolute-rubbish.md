'Policy For Sale' claim absolute rubbish

National Party Leader Don Brash says a Labour claim that National is putting policy up for sale is "absolute and total rubbish".

"This is another panicked and desperate attempt to get the debate off issues that affect mainstream New Zealanders - like the student loan burden and the pressures on working mothers.

"It is absolute and total rubbish to suggest that our policies are written by anyone other than New Zealand National Party politicians. I can assure the public our policies are home-grown with the best interests of all New Zealanders in mind.

"Can I suggest that Mr Mallard focus his attention on debating the merits of our policy," says Dr Brash.
