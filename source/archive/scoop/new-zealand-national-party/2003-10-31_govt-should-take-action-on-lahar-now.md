Govt should take action on lahar now

Govt should take action on lahar now

The Government is standing on the sideline instead of taking action to prevent a lahar flow down Mt Ruapehu, says National Party Conservation Spokesman Shane Ardern.

Mr Ardern's comments are in response to a memorandum of understanding between Genesis and the Taupo District Council which will see an unnecessary additional lahar warning system added to the Mt Ruapehu Crater Lake.

"Putting in another warning system when they could prevent this disaster entirely is ridiculous," says Mr Ardern.

"Now we will be able to monitor the lahar progressing down the Whangaehu River or the Waikato Stream or the Mangatoetoenui River. I'd prefer to see it prevented from happening all together.

"We have the technology and the know how - let's make it happen now, not wait for disaster to strike.

"While the Government might be happy with "risks to public safety being minimised", I am not. I want a guarantee that action will be taken to ensure there'll be no lahar," says Mr Ardern.
