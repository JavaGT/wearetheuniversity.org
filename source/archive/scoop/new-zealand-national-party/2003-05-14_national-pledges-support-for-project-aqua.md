National pledges support for Project Aqua

The National Party is throwing its support behind Meridian Energy's new hydro project in Otago known as Project Aqua.

"Meridian has done a good job at mitigating environmental issues and looking at agricultural irrigation possibilities before lodging its consent application," says the National Party Energy spokesman Gerry Brownlee.

"It's just the sort of project New Zealand needs to avert the power crisis of tomorrow.

"But there's still a long way to go before it gets off the drawing board and becomes a reality, given that resource consent applications have only been filed today," Mr Brownlee says.

"It's vital the proposal isn't held up by excessive and time consuming process as RMA requirements are met.

"New Zealand desperately needs this additional generation and local bureaucracy should not be allowed to slow up the development," Mr Brownlee says.
