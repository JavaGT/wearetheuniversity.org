Key Notes: Supporting Canterbury

**17 June 2011**  
**SUPPORTING CANTERBURY**  
Life is tough for many Cantabrians at the moment. Monday's aftershocks are another blow for the city and its people, who have already been through so much. But this doesn't change the Government's long-term commitment to the region, which includes $5.5 billion over six years to help with rebuilding.

On Tuesday I visited Christchurch to show the Government's support and to catch up with those involved in the earthquake response.

I know the biggest concern for many homeowners is property and land damage. Unfortunately there are some areas we won't be able to rebuild in. The Government is working towards the next steps for residents in those areas.

The Government has said all along it wants homeowners with insurance to regain as much equity as possible, and we're working hard to achieve that. We know it's frustrating and patience is wearing thin, but this is a huge and complex task, which will take some time. We hope to be able to provide certainty for homeowners soon.

All New Zealanders are thinking of you at this very difficult time, and we will continue to support you. I encourage those who have damaged homes to make use of support available - such as our [temporary accommodation assistance package](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16070.link).

**VISITING AUSTRALIA**

On Sunday I'm leaving for a [two-day visit to Australia](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16072.link).

In Canberra I'll be addressing the Australian Parliament. It'll be the first time a New Zealand Prime Minister has done this. I'm looking forward to reinforcing our strong trans-Tasman ties in my address.

While in Canberra, I also have a number of meetings, including with Governor-General Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Cabinet Ministers, and the Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott.

The trip concludes with a quick visit to Sydney. I'll be going to a special fundraising dinner for the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, which has been generously organised by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

**SHOWCASING OUR PRIMARY SECTOR**

On Wednesday I had a great day chatting to people at Fieldays in Mystery Creek. This is a huge annual event, which I always really enjoy going to. It's a chance to celebrate our rural communities and our primary industries.

**BOOSTING TRADE WITH INDIA**

Next week [I'm going to India with Trade Minister Tim Groser](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-16075.link) and a 25-strong business delegation. Our visit is about building stronger ties between New Zealand and India, and boosting two-way trade.

India is a rapidly rising player in the Asia-Pacific region, and we want to make the most of the opportunities it provides. Boosting trade will help our businesses grow, create jobs, and raise wages.

I'll meet India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to talk about issues including the New Zealand-India Free Trade Agreement negotiations.

**FROM MY DIARY**

I'm looking forward to officially opening Queenstown Winter Festival next Friday, before heading to India on Sunday.

Best wishes,

  
**John Key  
Prime Minister**
