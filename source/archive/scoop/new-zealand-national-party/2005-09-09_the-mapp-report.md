NATIONAL'S ACTION PLAN FOR GOVERNMENT

Yesterday, National Leader Don Brash launched National's action plan for the 10 things National will do first in Government. It sets out the key priorities for a National Government, as below:

Reduce Taxes Before April 1, 2006

1\. To provide the right incentives for people to stay in New Zealand, work hard and get ahead, we will reduce Labour's $7 billion surplus by implementing our Fair Tax Plan commencing 1 April 2006, and cutting personal income taxes so that 85% of New Zealand taxpayers pay 19% tax or less on their incomes.

Tax Deductions For Student Loans and Childcare by 1 April 2006

2\. To recognise childcare costs and interest on Student Loans as legitimate working expenses for mainstream Kiwis, we will legislate to make interest on student loans and pre-school childcare costs (up to $5000 per child) tax deductible from 1 April 2006.

Fix The RMA in 9 months

3\. To ensure New Zealand builds a road system and other much-needed infrastructure to allow us to remove congestion and get ahead as a country, we will introduce a substantive RMA amendment bill before the end of 2005, and pass it on before July 2006, so that planning applications can be processed quickly and costs reduced.

Nationwide Maths and English standards in 2006

4\. To ensure that every New Zealand child has the chance to reach their potential, we will introduce nationwide maths and English standards in 2006, hold schools accountable for achieving them, and provide reading and maths vouchers to parents whose children are struggling.

Treaty Claims Filed By 2006 and settled by 2010

5\. To reserve New Zealand's drift to racial separatism and put Treaty grievances behind us, we will require all historical Treaty claims to be lodged by the end of 2006 and use direct negotiations and an accelerated settlement process to complete the Treaty settlements by the end of 2010.

Tough Crime Law by 1 July 2006

6\. To keep New Zealand safe from career criminals, we will introduce and pass legislation to abolish parole for all violent and repeat offenders by 1 July 2006.

Overhaul NCEA in early 2006

7\. To ensure New Zealand school-leavers receive valuable and meaningful qualifications , we will overhaul NCEA before final exams in 2006, and we will overhaul NCEA before final exams in 2006, and we will introduce Plain English Report Cards so parents and students are given easy to understand grades.

Welfare Reform by 1 April 2006

8\. To reduce the waste of having 300,000 working age New Zealand adults on benefits and to ensure all of those on benefits really need the help, we will introduce more thorough medical checks for those on invalid and sickness benefits by 1 April 2006, and we will implement a comprehensive work for the dole scheme by 1 April 2007.

Cut Wasteful Expenditure in 2006 Budget

9\. To ensure that Government focuses on providing taxpayers with value for money, we will increase our investment in frontline education, health and police services in the 2006 Budget, while cutting Labour's culture of wasteful programmes like Radio Sing-a-long courses, Treaty Information advertising and Prisoner Compensation.

Remove 'Principles of the Treaty' by 1 April 2008

10\. To ensure one law for all, and to make sure Government acts on the basis of need not race, we will remove all reference to the "Principles of the Treaty" from the relevant Acts of Parliament by 1 April 2008, and we will abolish the Maori seats in Parliament before the next General Election.

LABOUR LIES: # 8

MYTH# 8 : Labour has increased Defence spending .

Truth: Defence spending has been dropping as a percentage of GDP. In 1998/1999 expenditure was 1.04% of GDP. In 2004/2005 the rate is 0.82% of GDP (based on Treasury figures). That is why we have fewer defence capabilities than in 1998/99. In contrast, Australia has increased defence expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and is 2.1% of GDP a year.
