Working hard to rebuild Canterbury

  
A re-elected National government would continue the pace and high standard of the Canterbury rebuild, National’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesman, Gerry Brownlee, says.

“The rebuild of Christchurch is going ahead full steam as we’ve embraced the rare opportunity to build a new, vibrant and exciting city,” Mr Brownlee says.

“In rebuilding greater Christchurch we’ve listened to what locals said they wanted their rebuilt city to deliver, and recognised the things that have always made Christchurch a great place to live, work and raise a family in.

“A re-elected National government will continue to ramp up construction in the central city, led by key anchor projects such as the Convention Centre Precinct, Justice and Emergency Services Precinct, and the Bus Interchange.

“Investment in these and other projects is already encouraging businesses and retailers to return to the central city in force.

“Our vision is that this city be rebuilt as a place we can all be proud of – a great place to live in, work in and raise a family in.

“We will harness the opportunity to build state-of-the-art new classrooms, tertiary facilities, hospitals, housing, justice and emergency services facilities, and transport links.

“We will also use the chance to create something special in the large residential red zone, taking into account public feedback and ideas.

“As we move further through the recovery phase, the role of government agencies will change, but our commitment remains the same.

“We will move the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) from 1 February next year as a departmental agency.

“Housing CERA within DPMC will enable its functions to be wound back gradually.

“CERA will continue to operate in Canterbury beyond April 2016, when the earthquake recovery powers granted by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011, are due to expire.

“We will also review the Canterbury earthquake legislation to decide what provisions are not required and what may need to continue beyond April 2016, and establish a group to advise on what CERA’s functions should be after April 2016.

“The stable leadership of the National Government, and the resilience of Cantabrians, has kept the regional economy strong, with high levels of business and consumer confidence.

“We will stay the course and finish rebuilding Christchurch into a thriving city, standing by Cantabrians all the way,” Mr Brownlee says.
