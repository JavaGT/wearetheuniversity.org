Thousands wait years for state houses

Thousands wait years for state houses

The Government's policy of income related rents on state housing is feeding a huge and growing waiting list for state houses, says National Housing Spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp.

"Thousands of people are waiting for state houses and most don't have a hope of getting into one for years, because the Government has raised expectations that everyone who wants a state house can get into one.

Dr Mapp was responding to briefing papers to the new Minister of Housing which show 4200 people are waiting on Housing New Zealand's high need waiting list when there's just 746 vacant houses.

"The Government doesn't recognise that it should be selling state houses to long-term tenants in order to free up money that could build new houses for those in genuine need.

"In state housing there should always be a mechanism encouraging people to move on and buy their own home, but the Government's ideology against selling state houses is blinding it to sensible practical solutions.

"The effect is it is drawing more and more people into state housing, creating a never ending demand that it can't meet," Dr Mapp said.
