$850 Fee Hike At Lincoln University
===================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Lincoln University is estimating that a fee rise of more than $850 would be required to avoid service cutbacks as a result of the Government's 'woefully inadequate' funding offer, National's Tertiary Education Spokesperson Maurice Williamson said today.

Information requested by National under the Official Information Act shows Lincoln University's council is considering various scenarios in light of the Government's funding offer.

"A fee rise of up to 25%, or $850 per student, shows the extent of the funding problem. Lincoln pointed out in a covering letter that it would shy away from such a high fee rise but would seek a lower fee increase and service cutbacks.

"Lincoln's financial situation combined with Massey's projected $11.5 million service cutbacks or 27% fee hike spell doom for agricultural research and study in New Zealand.

"How does the Government expect our country to capitalise on the knowledge wave with this sort of serious under-funding in our tertiary institutions?

"Service cutbacks won't be confined to Massey and Lincoln. Universities throughout New Zealand will be forced to make service cutbacks as a result of Labour's failure to meet its pre-election pledge to reduce the cost of tertiary education for students. We shouldn't forget the pre-election promise of Labour's coalition partner, the Alliance, which promised to make tertiary education free.

"New Zealanders did not vote for a lower standard of tertiary education in order for Labour to claim it fulfilled its pledge to reduce the cost for students," Mr Williamson said.
