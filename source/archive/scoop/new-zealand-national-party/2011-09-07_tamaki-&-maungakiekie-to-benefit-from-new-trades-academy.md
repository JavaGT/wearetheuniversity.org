**Tamaki & Maungakiekie to benefit from new Trades Academy next year**

National MP’s Allan Peachey, MP for Tamaki, and Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, MP for Maungakiekie, welcome news that a new Trades Academy will open in Tamaki College next year.

“This is great for young people here in Tamaki and Maungakiekie,” Mr Peachey says.

“Our new Trades Academy will offer 30 places at Tamaki College and will partner with Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT). I expect more schools to partner with the Trades Academy over time”. Mr Lotu-Iiga says

“That will lead to better qualifications, practical skill training, and ultimately better job opportunities”. Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“Some of the courses on offer include Automotive Engineering and Building and Construction, which is an important industry for not only our region but a vital industry for the future of the country as we look at rebuilding Christchurch. It also offers our young people a wider range of career choices” Mr Peachey says.

“Some kids just don’t fit in regular classrooms. That doesn’t mean they don’t want to learn, it just means we need to rethink how to keep them involved in education’. Mr Peachey says.

A Trades Academy means students can earn NCEA credits and a tertiary qualification while gaining practical skills in the workplace. They are still enrolled in school but can study at other sites, thanks to partnerships between schools, tertiary providers, employers, and industry training organisations.

“National’s approach to learning for 16- and 17-year-olds is about engaging them in practical education. We want to help young people contribute to growing our local and national economy and productivity as young people with better skill levels enter the labour market.” Mr Peachey and Mr Lotu-Iiga concluded.

The Government confirmed 10 new Trades Academies would open in 2012, in addition to the eight opened this year and the three already announced for next year.

By the end of 2012, there will be 2000 free places in 21 Trades Academies around the country. Students are still enrolled at school but may study at another site, for example at a workplace or polytechnic, on some or all days throughout the term.
