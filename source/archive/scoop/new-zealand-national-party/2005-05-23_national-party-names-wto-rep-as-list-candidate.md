National Party names WTO rep as list candidate

Tim Groser, currently New Zealand’s World Trade Organisation Ambassador and Chair of the Agriculture Negotiations, has accepted an offer from the President of the National Party to stand as a List Candidate at the forthcoming General Election.

The details of his position on the List will be announced in due course.

“Tim is an outstanding New Zealander. While he is not a household name in New Zealand, he is a pivotal figure in New Zealand’s international trade effort, and he will bring excellent skills to the National Party team,” says National Party Leader Don Brash.

Tim, born in Perth Scotland, came out to New Zealand with his parents in 1958. After completing his education (Victoria University, First Class Honours), he has served as a policy adviser in a number of key Departments: Treasury, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Prime Minister’s Advisory Group. He has served New Zealand with distinction in a number of capacities, including being New Zealand’s Chief Negotiator in the GATT Uruguay Round: the Round that brought agriculture into the system of world trade rules for the first time and conferred substantial benefits on the NZ economy.

Tim is regarded as one of the world’s leading experts on international trade. As the Listener editorial of 14 August 2004 put it: ‘Much \[progress\] appears due to the Olympian effort of New Zealand’s Ambassador to the WTO, Tim Groser. Described recently as ‘the most powerful man in world agriculture’ Groser was responsible for brokering the final groundbreaking deal in a marathon 13-hour session’.

“Tim is keen to bring his experience to New Zealand politics. It is however vital to our economic interests that he is in a position to continue as Chair of the Agriculture Negotiations, at least until the end of this year, when the Members of the WTO collectively review that appointment.

“Given New Zealand’s interests and the bipartisan tradition that has traditionally marked our international trade policy, discussions are underway to find a formula that, while protecting Tim’s democratic right to stand for Parliament, allow him to continue with his international responsibilities,” says Dr Brash.
