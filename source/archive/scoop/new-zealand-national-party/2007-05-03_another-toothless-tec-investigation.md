Another toothless TEC investigation

National’s Associate Education spokeswoman, Pansy Wong, says she has no confidence in the Tertiary Education Commission’s handling of an investigation into allegations that some Auckland tertiary providers are offering cash kick-backs to students despite an investigation in 2006.

In a statement today, TEC confirmed it is looking into fresh allegations which have arisen since its initial investigation in 2006.

“The fact that tertiary providers engaged in these practices before, during and after the 2006 investigation shows that TEC and its investigations are a joke,” says Mrs Wong.

“These allegations concern the misuse of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money. It is a serious allegation of fraud and must be investigated by the proper authorities.

“If TEC’s past performance is anything to go by, another toothless in-house inquiry will be ignored by providers and taxpayers will continue to be ripped off by these charlatans. It’s time to bring in the experts.”
