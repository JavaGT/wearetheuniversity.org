### Cullen and the TEC a laughing stock

Michael Cullen and the Tertiary Education Commission's (TEC) ability to make sure that education providers aren't attempting to scam the system is in serious doubt, says National's Associate Education spokeswoman Pansy Wong.

Thirteen private education providers are under investigation for the second time for offering cash kickbacks to senior students who enrol in their English classes.

"Following the TEC's first botched investigation, they changed their policy so these providers could not access student loans and allowances for new students from 1 January 2007.

"Earlier this year, I exposed evidence which appeared to show that some of these providers who signed declarations that they had stopped offering, or had never offered, scholarships, had made false statements, which led to the TEC undertaking yet another investigation.

"In spite of this, three of these providers are still advertising in newspapers that they can arrange student loans, allowances and stationery expenses free of charge for senior students. One ad was published only two days ago.

"So, while the TEC is supposed to be investigating these institutes, they appear to be openly defying them.

"Michael Cullen has previously said that these 13 providers don't have access to student loans or allowances. How can he explain these advertisements, which appear to offer evidence to the contrary?

"For all the millions pumped into the TEC, you'd think they'd have the resources, expertise and will to be able to get to the bottom of these alleged scams once and for all.

"What is it going to take for the Minister and the TEC to take this matter seriously? Or shall we wait for the third round?"
