Not a sausage for 80% of low income families

"The Housing Minister and Prime Minister will be trumpeting the implementation of Income Related Rents at a barbecue tomorrow but the four out of five low-income families who won't be getting a sausage from this policy aren't invited," National's Housing spokesman Tony Ryall said today.

"This policy is unfair to those on low-incomes who can't get a State house. The waiting lists for State houses will soar as demand for cheap accommodation rises.

"How is the Minister going to reduce the waiting lists for State houses if no-one wants to leave?

"What incentive is there for State house tenants to earn a higher income when the Government will claw-back up to 91 cents for every extra dollar that they earn?

"The 80% of low-income families who will miss out on income-related rents because they don't have the right landlord will be having a far different Christmas than their neighbours. The cost of living for these families, like others in New Zealand, is a real issue under this Government," Mr Ryall said.
