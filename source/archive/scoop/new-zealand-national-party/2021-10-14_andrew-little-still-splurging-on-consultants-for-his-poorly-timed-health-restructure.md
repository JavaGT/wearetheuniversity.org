Andrew Little Still Splurging On Consultants For His Poorly-timed Health Restructure
====================================================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Andrew Little must explain why he continues to splurge on consulting firms for the government’s poorly-timed health restructure instead of focusing on frontline services while we are in the midst of a pandemic, says National’s Health spokesperson, Dr Shane Reti.

In reply to a question from me, Andrew Little has revealed spending of $7 million on consultants in just a year including $6 million on 21 Ernst & Young staff. Not one of these dollars has delivered a single health outcome to date.

“That $ 7 million could have funded nine resourced ICU beds which is more beds than what is currently available in any of Hutt Valley, Lakes, Mid Central, Northland, South Canterbury, Tairawhiti, Wairarapa, West Coast or Whanganui DHBs.

“The government’s costly distraction with restructuring the health system in the middle of a Pandemic may explain why our Intensive Care Units were so unprepared for Delta. New Zealand has around a third of the ICU beds of Great Britain per capita.

“They should have focused on beefing up our ICU capacity instead of consultancy fees but is hardly surprising from a government that has totally failed to prepare our health system for a Delta outbreak

It is incomprehensible that this government thinks it is a good idea to restructure the health system in a pandemic. Put resources where they’re needed!”
