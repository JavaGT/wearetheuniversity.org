We won't see Hawkins for dust

George Hawkins' abysmal performance on Holmes tonight means we won't see him answering questions on leaky homes in Parliament tomorrow, predicts Shadow Leader of the House National MP Gerry Brownlee.

"We can expect to see George Hawkins gone, Helen Clark ducking questions and Labour bringing in hard-man Trevor Mallard to try and take the heat out of the issue.

"The fact is this issue has got away on the Government, it is huge, and they know what they have put in place is hopelessly inadequate.

"While Ministers are dodging and ducking the issue in Parliament, thousands of homeowners are coming to us for help. We won't stop advocating for homeowners and accountability until we get a result," Mr Brownlee said.
