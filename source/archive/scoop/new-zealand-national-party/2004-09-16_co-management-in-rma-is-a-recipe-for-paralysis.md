Co-management in RMA is a recipe for paralysis

National Party Finance spokesman John Key says the Government's plan to insert a specific Maori co-management clause as part of its tinkering with the RMA is a "recipe for further paralysis".

"The Government has made plenty of noise about how the changes to the RMA give Maori no more say in important decisions than they do everyone else.

"But there's more sizzle than sausage in those statements," says Mr Key.

"The Government is actually saying one thing and doing quite the opposite with its co-management clause.

"The Minister is dancing on the head of a pin with his answers to questions in Parliament today.

"Most New Zealanders will find it hard to understand how a direct reference to iwi co-management in the Bill does not mean special rights and privileges are being conferred on Maori.

"If Maori aren't getting extra rights as a result of the Government's proposed amendments what did David Benson-Pope mean when he said 'councils will involve iwi in developing policy'? "The Government has also promised to provide councils with a list of Maori tangata whenua which they will be expected to deal with. However, the Minister admits he has 'absolutely no idea' whether Te Puni Kokiri has written the list or when councils will get it.

"The National Party, councils and undoubtedly Maori, will be interested to see that list because I think it will inevitably be controversial and likely to kick-start a fierce new debate among Maori and local authorities," says Mr Key.
