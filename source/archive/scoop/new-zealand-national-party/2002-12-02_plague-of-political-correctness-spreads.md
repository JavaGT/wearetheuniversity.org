Plague of Political Correctness Spreads

It’s bad enough ratepayers will be paying more because of Maori consultation provisions in the local Government Bill, now roads users will be hit too, says the National Party Local Government spokesman Gerry Brownlee.

“The Labour Government’s Land Transport Bill will lead to more cases like that in the Waikato, where road widening was delayed because of Maori concerns about an apparent ‘Taniwha’,” says Mr Brownlee.

“The new bill, due to come before Parliament tomorrow, will include clauses ‘consistent’ with those in the Local Government Bill that we’re fighting to stop.

“I repeat - clauses like these, enshrined in legislation, are divisive.

“National stands for one standard of citizenship, not two, as advocated by both these proposed new laws,” Mr Brownlee says.

Meanwhile National’s campaign against the Local Government Bill’s gathering momentum.

“We’ve been inundated with responses from ratepayers.

“One Auckland group says the impact of the Local Government Bill on Councils would be like ‘letting an alcoholic loose in the bottle store’.

“Tonight the National Party’s continuing its public push against the Local Government Bill, hosting a meeting at the Dowse Art Gallery in Lower Hutt from 6:30pm,” Mr Brownlee says.
