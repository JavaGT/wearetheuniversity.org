Further boost to ICT funding in schools

Local schools Royal Oak School and Royal Oak Intermediate School are set to benefit from a new round of ICT upgrades, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

Education Minister Anne Tolley and Communications and Information Technology Minister Steven Joyce have confirmed that 100 more schools will benefit from a $21.5 million allocation for school network upgrades.

The new roll out is the latest round of the $150 million boost for school network upgrades, which is part of the government’s $1.5 billion Broadband Investment Initiative.

“We want to ensure our schools can provide the best possible education for our students and this roll out will make a significant contribution to that,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“Here in Maungakiekie, ultra-fast broadband can make a real difference to our economic and social wellbeing. Students need to be able to take full advantage of the benefits of technology.”

Upgrading the schools’ networks will mean teachers and students in every classroom will have the capability to access ultra-fast broadband.

“Access to high-speed broadband is a vital part of ensuring students get a 21st century education in a 21st century economy,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“We expect that up to 2000 schools will be upgraded over the next six years. We’re aiming to have ultra-fast broadband access to 97 per cent of schools, serving 99.7 per cent of all students, in that time.”

More schools will be invited to upgrade their networks in early 2010.
