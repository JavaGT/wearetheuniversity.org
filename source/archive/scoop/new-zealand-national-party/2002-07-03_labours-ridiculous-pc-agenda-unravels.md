Labour's Ridiculous PC-Agenda Unravels
======================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

3 July 2002

"Reports that proposed new food safety laws may require people to obtain permits for fund raising barbeques and sausage sizzles is politically-correct law-making gone mad," says National Party Leader Bill English.

"Peter Leitch - aka the 'Mad Butcher' - is absolutely right when he says this proposed law is nonsense.

"Sausage sizzles are often the lifeblood of many sports clubs and help schools fundraise. I want to help support these efforts, not hinder them by imposing ridiculous regulations and laws."

However, Mr English warns that barbeque permits may only be the thin edge of the wedge under a raft of new PC-laws New Zealanders will have to endure if Labour is re-elected.

"Already Helen Clark and her politically-correct colleagues have already signalled they want to outlaw stress in the workplace, ban smoking in bars and introduce bureaucratically-decreed pay equity legislation.

"The last thing this country needs is a Government that wants to impose a whole lot of unnecessary, costly, bureaucratic, politically-correct new laws.

"This is the wrong track for New Zealand to be heading down. We should be fostering and encouraging self-help and innovation not extinguishing it with stupid, petty laws.

"It's apparent that if re-elected Labour will be more interested in arresting netball mums for holding unlicensed sausage sizzles, than addressing substantial issues like fixing the health system, educating our kids or setting New Zealand on the path towards long-term, sustainable economic growth," Mr English says.
