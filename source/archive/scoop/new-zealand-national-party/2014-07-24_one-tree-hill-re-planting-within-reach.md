One Tree Hill re-planting within reach

**One Tree Hill re-planting within reach**

The re-planting of Maungakiekie/One Tree Hill is within reach after today, as Parliament passed the third reading of the Ngā Mana Whenua o Tāmaki Collective Settlement Bill, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, MP for Maungakiekie said.

The Bill will give effect to the deed of settlement signed between the Crown and the Tāmaki Collective. It recognises the interests of Auckland iwi and hapū in specific maunga (volcanic cones), motu (islands) and lands, including Maungakiekie/One Tree Hill.

“The Auckland Council has previously said there would be no re-planting before Māori interests in Maungakiekie/One Tree Hill are resolved,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said. “This bill recognises and addresses those interests and allows Māori, the Crown and the people of Maungakiekie to look forward.”

Treaty settlements in the Auckland region were stalled under the previous Labour government, meaning that the issue of re-planting could not be progressed.

“Under the Bill, a new Maunga Authority, consisting of iwi and Council representatives, will govern Auckland’s iconic maunga for the benefit of Māori and all the people of Tamaki Makaurau Auckland,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.

“It is up to the Authority to make the decision about re-planting Maungakiekie/One Tree Hill. My feeling is that both iwi and Council are in a positive place to make this happen.”

“Today is an important day for all New Zealand, and our local community,” he said.

This morning Mr Lotu-Iiga hosted over 20 young leaders from One Tree Hill College with their Principal Mr Nick Coughlan. “They were all fresh faced, young and reflected the face of Tāmaki Makaurau, with Māori, Pākehā, Pacific, Asian and other ethnicities,” Mr Lotu-Iiga said.

“Like me these young people were are aware of the history of their home. We will never forget our history, particularly our Māori tradition and the injustices that went with that history. However, in remembering those that have gone before us, we can anticipate our future and that was seen in those children of One Tree Hill College who were at Parliament today.”
