Need an operation? Don't rely on the public health system

The health system is failing to meet the public need for surgery, says National Party Associate Health spokesman Dr Jonathan Coleman.

"The Health Select Committee was told today that the South Canterbury District Health Board cannot fund elective services to ensure that all patients will receive treatment before they reach a state of unreasonable distress, ill health or incapacity," says Dr Coleman. "At the same time, the DHB believes that its elective volumes are adequate relative to other DHBs.

"It is obvious that DHBs are judging success on numbers rather than whether they are meeting clinical needs.

"The situation at South Canterbury DHB reflects the situation nationally. Some would say that to guarantee getting an operation under this Labour Government, you better have private insurance," says Dr Coleman.
