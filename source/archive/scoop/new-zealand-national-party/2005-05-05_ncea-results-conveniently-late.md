NCEA results conveniently late

National's Education spokesman, Bill English, says the fact that final student results are yet to be posted and no national statistics are available six weeks after they were promised is proof that the NCEA shambles is far from over.

"The NZQA website now advises that final results will not be available until 'May/June' rather than April, as scheduled.

"When asked in Parliament today, Education Minister Trevor Mallard could provide no explanation for the delays.

"He tried to say that some students already have their results, but the NZQA says it will still be some weeks before results are posted to students." Mr English says the delay means that 2004 national NCEA statistics will not be available for analysis until after the deadline has passed for submissions to Labour's review of the NCEA.

"The NCEA review has been subject to a deluge of highly critical submissions from schools and teachers, and the publication of the 2004 results would provide more damming ammunition. "This all looks a bit convenient. It's clearly not in Mr Mallard's best interests to have this information available, and parents know he's not above this kind of face-saving political interference," says Mr English.
