Hospital managers cost half a billion dollars
=============================================

Hospital managers cost half a billion dollars

Salaries for hospital managers and administrators will top half a billion dollars for the first time this year as the health bureaucracy grows out of control, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.

Latest figures show that the number of health bureaucrats has jumped by almost 2000, a rise of 23%, and the cost by 35%, since Labour came to power.

These numbers do not include the 1,100 Ministry of Health staff, PHO managers or consultants.

“These figures prove exactly what National has been saying all along – that the health bureaucracy is growing out of control while far too many people are forced to wait an unfair amount of time for operations – if they get them at all,” says Mr Ryall.

"Helen Clark says there's no fat in the system. These figures prove there is plenty of fat in the health bureaucracy and it needs to be cut out.

“The Government has been trying to mislead the public on the extent of the blowout in the health bureaucracy by fudging the numbers.

“Pete Hodgson said in his maiden speech as Health Minister earlier this month: ‘The flipside of the myth, that it has all been spent on bureaucrats, also needs to be exploded. About 1.5 per cent of health expenditure goes to the Ministry of Health; the other 98.5 per cent goes to those who deliver services. The number of bureaucrats in the Ministry of Health has remained virtually unchanged from six years ago.’

"When you've got thousand of patients being culled from waiting lists, you don't need to be employing more and more managers and administrators,” says Mr Ryall.

The information comes from answers to parliamentary questions. They show a 23% increase in the number of health managers and administrators. In addition, the Government claims the Health Ministry has grown from 1,020 to 1,090 since 1999, but this does not include PHO managers and consultants.

"On top of the half billion dollars for hospital managers, you have to add the  
$80 million of salaries in the Health Ministry and the public money to run the 80-something PHOs – and you can see the health bureaucracy is growing like topsy.”
