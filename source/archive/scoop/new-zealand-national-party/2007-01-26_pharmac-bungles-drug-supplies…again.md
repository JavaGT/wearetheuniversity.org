Pharmac Bungles Drug Supplies…Again

Pharmac Bungles Drug Supplies…Again

For the second time this month Pharmac has bungled the supply of medication, with another drug nearly out of stock, says National’s Associate Health spokeswoman, Dr Jackie Blue.

“Earlier this month, stocks of Adrenaline ran out with new supplies of the essential drug only due to arrive in the country today.

“Now in a few days, calcium tablets that are widely used for prevention of osteoporosis in post menopausal women, will be out of stock.”

Both generic forms of calcium tablets, calcitabs and osteo 500, will be affected.

“What is most alarming is that Pharmac knew about the looming shortage a month ago,” says Dr Blue.

“While running out of calcium tablets is not life-threatening and not in the same league as running out of adrenaline, it will still be a huge inconvenience to individual patients.

"Pharmac has only just given the okay for pharmacists to dispense this medication in monthly lots instead of the mandatory three months.

“As one Pharmacist has said to me, what’s the use of that when there is no stock to dispense?

“If it had authorised monthly dispensing earlier, we wouldn't be in this situation now.

"The Government’s drug buying agency should have managed this situation better. This latest shortage just further highlights Pharmac’s ineptitude.”
