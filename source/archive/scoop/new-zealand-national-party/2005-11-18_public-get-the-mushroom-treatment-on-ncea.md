Public get the mushroom treatment on NCEA

National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says Labour is hiding ministerial briefing papers that paint a very negative picture of the NCEA and NZQA.

“The briefing written by the NZQA for the incoming minister has been leaked to some in the media but Steve Maharey has not released it publicly.

“In a bizarre interview this morning Minister Steve Maharey said he had asked journalists not to publicise the briefing because it might upset students sitting exams.

“Media reports so far suggest the briefing lifts the lid on poor morale in NZQA and low public confidence in NCEA.

“This is an astonishing U-turn by NZQA who have always maintained that the NCEA is flawless and that its critics are stupid.

“Steve Maharey must release the briefing papers now. The public have every right to know whether his Government believes in its own national qualification, and every right to worry when a minister tries to keep them in the dark,” says Mr English.
