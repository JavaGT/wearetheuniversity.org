Vic fee increases just the beginning

Students at tertiary education institutions throughout the country should expect substantial fee increases as a result of Labour's student loan policy, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

"Treasury officials have suggested that Labour's policy of removing interest on student loans could lead to other policy 'adjustments', including 'restrictions on access to tertiary education'.

"During the election campaign Labour told students that fees would be kept down by their fee maxima policy. In fact, that policy allows for significant fee increases and exemptions.

"Victoria University's alleged plans to increase fees are an inevitable consequence of Labour's policy.

"Labour's student loan policy is an extremely large fiscal commitment and will inevitably lead to increases in other costs associated with tertiary education.

"Students would be right to ask themselves what good an interest free loan is when they have to borrow increasingly more for ever-growing fees," says Mr English.
