Historic 73rd National Party Annual Conference

  
This year’s 73rd National Party annual conference being held in Christchurch will be a celebration of a number of historic achievements for the Party, says outgoing National Party President Judy Kirk.

“It is the first time that we have met as a Party to celebrate National’s Election win last year and the first time in a decade that we can welcome a Prime Minister to our conference,” says Mrs Kirk.

“This conference is also significant in that we are able to welcome 58 MPs.

“I am very proud that my seventh and last conference as President will be marked by such historic milestones.”

The conference is being held at the Christchurch Convention Centre this weekend (August 1 – 2) and will be attended by more than 500 delegates and observers from across the country. It will be the largest conference in many years.

Highlights include the keynote address by Prime Minister, Hon. John Key, speeches from senior Cabinet Ministers, the election of new Board members and the election of the Party’s new President.

Mrs Kirk says while the conference will celebrate the success of the National Party’s 2008 election win, it will also be sharply focused on working towards another victory in 2011 and beyond.

“The party is in great shape with a solid front bench of Cabinet Ministers who are supported by a talented and driven caucus,” says Mrs Kirk.

“Now that we are in government and implementing our policies, we must ensure we retain the mandate the country gave us and continue to deliver for New Zealand.

“Therefore, it is very important we do not rest on our laurels.”

Mrs Kirk says Conference 2009 is a special personal milestone for her as well.

“When I was elected President in 2002 the Party was facing very challenging times. It was a time for rebuilding and regenerating,” says Mrs Kirk.

“I never once thought that was unachievable.

“There are many achievements I am proud to have overseen including a substantial growth in the Party membership, the establishment our Candidates’ College and attracting a diverse range of outstanding candidates who went on to become MPs in 2005 and 2008.”

Mrs Kirk says she is looking forward to supporting the Party’s new President who will be elected at this year’s conference.

“I am so pleased to be departing at such an exciting time for the Party. Morale is high and we have a great and visionary leader in Prime Minister, Hon. John Key. I am confident we have the very best team to see the country through for years to come.

“I would like to thank all the Party leaders I have worked with who have provided me with unwavering support and encouragement: Hon. Bill English, Dr Don Brash and Hon. John Key.

“The success we have achieved as a Party is also due to the tireless work of all Party members and volunteers who have given so much of their time and energy.

“It has been a great privilege to work with such a talented and dedicated team and a wonderful feeling, as I end my term, knowing how much we have all achieved together.”
