Labour ignores pleas from struggling schools

Labour ignores pleas from schools struggling with decile changes

Steve Maharey is refusing to listen to pleas to give schools at least a 12-month lead-in time to make adjustments to their funding cuts caused by decile changes, says National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

\"The Minister has given schools only three months to find the money they need to compensate for the withdrawal of funding resulting from decile increases."

After each census there is a routine evaluation of each school's decile rating. While some schools might go down a decile and receive more funding, others are re-rated upwards to face funding reductions.

"This has shaved an estimated $2.5 million from the operations budgets of secondary schools and potentially $8 million from primary and contributing schools.

"Aotea College in Porirua is $85,000 short and Fairfield Intermediate in Hamilton needs to find another $80,000 a year due to Labour's changes - three months is simply not long enough to make changes.

"After major economic changes in some communities, some schools have been facing significant decile hikes. One school I have spoken to has jumped from 2 to 5, leading to a major reduction in funding of some $53,000.

"In Otago alone, 53 schools have had a hike in their decile ratings. What this means is less money to spend on things like special education, reading recovery and school trips.

"No school welcomes a reduction, but the issue here is a reasonable transition time to make necessary changes.

"Steve Maharey was asked directly in Parliament today whether he would consider a 12 month lead-in time, and refused to answer, saying instead he would 'work with schools on a case-by-case basis.'

"However, schools are telling me that Ministry officials have refused to extend the run-in time to 12 months, which has put them in an invidious position.

"It is only fair that schools are given the leeway to find the money to fulfil the funding shortfall."
