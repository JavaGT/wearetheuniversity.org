Trades the loser with Labour’s new university

Labour’s announcement of a new university campus in South Auckland is a major blow for any potential growth in trades and polytechnic education, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.

“For two years the Government has been working on a tertiary education hub in South Auckland alongside Manukau City Council, Auckland University of Technology and Manukau Institute of Technology, as well as the Counties Manukau DHB.

“Everyone else involved thought Labour believed in an integrated strategy to lift skills with relevant tertiary courses, when what they have done is a deal behind closed doors in favour of a university campus.

“The local polytechnic, Manukau Institute of Technology, and Manukau City Council have been left high and dry.

“All the talk of collaboration, reducing competition, and partnership has turned out to be just talk. So has Labour’s much-promoted focus on skills and trades.

“When Labour has a choice, they always favour university education.

“The South Auckland community has made it clear they need a balance of technical and university tertiary courses, and thought that was where they were heading by working together.

“Labour has shafted the South Auckland community for its own political interests.

“This is a deal done to try to boost Labour's re-election chances and has nothing to do with the long-term needs of South Auckland and its economy.
