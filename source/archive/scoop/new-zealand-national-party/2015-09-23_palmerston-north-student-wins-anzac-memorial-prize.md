**Palmerston North Student wins ANZAC memorial prize**

Local student Emma Holmes has won third prize, years 11-13, in a competition commemorating World War I – _Their Stories, Our Stories_.

“The competition got students to create something – be it a poem, a piece of art, or a garden – that made a connection with the New Zealand stories of WWI,” List MP Jono Naylor said.

“I was lucky enough to read Emma’s poem and I can see why she has received a prize for it. She did a great job! I’m sure her parents, her classmates, and the staff from Freyberg High School are pretty proud of her.

“I want to congratulate her and the other students on their outstanding efforts. I believe if our ANZAC veterans were alive today they would be proud and touched by these tributes.”

There were 18 entries awarded prizes out of 148 submitted. The entries reflected a huge amount of research, creativity and hard work, and honoured the service and sacrifice of New Zealanders who fought in WWI 100 years ago.
