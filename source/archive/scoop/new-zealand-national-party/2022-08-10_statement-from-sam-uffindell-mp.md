Statement From Sam Uffindell MP
===============================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

When I was a student at Otago I enjoyed a student lifestyle, which included drinking and, at times, smoking marijuana.

While in second year a number of flatmates fell out – and two of the flatmates left midway through the year.

I reject any accusation that I engaged in behaviour that was intimidatory or bullying. This simply did not happen.

While there is an investigation into these accusations I will not make further comment.
