How many Modern Apprentices fail Minister?

How many Modern Apprentices fail Minister?

Rather than make self-congratulatory statements in the House over the graduation of 3000 modern apprentices, the Labour Government should tell us just how many enrolments it has had in the scheme, says National Party Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.

“Last week the Government came out gloating about it’s revitalisation of trades training after the 3000th Modern Apprentice finished his training.

“That achievement would be warmly welcomed but for the fact we still don’t know how many other modern apprentices have enrolled in the scheme in the past seven years and never completed their training.

“Given the amount of money the Government is pouring into this scheme, including an additional $34 million in last year’s Budget, the measure of success should be completion rates, not total completion numbers.

“It is ridiculous for the Tertiary Education Minister to stand in the House patting himself on the back over completion numbers when his own staff have no way of knowing the total number of enrolments, and therefore the success rate or value for money of the Modern Apprentice scheme.

“This is classic Labour spin-doctoring as the Minister continues to fiddle the figures to suit.”
