Hon Amy Adams, MP for Selwyn

Queen’s Birthday has been and gone so we now have a few chilly months without public holidays to look forward to, although of course for families with children, the July school holidays are fast approaching.  
Rural Broadband Initiative significantly improves internet speeds in Selwyn  
I was pleased to see recent figures from Chorus which show that the average internet speed in Selwyn’s rural areas has more than doubled thanks to the Rural Broadband Initiative (RBI). According to Chorus, the average copper line connection speed has increased from 3.9 Megabits per second (Mbps) in November 2011 to 8.9 Mbps in April this year and some of the 3,360 broadband connections in the Selwyn RBI zones have even achieved speeds of up to 71.0 Mbps. That is an astonishing improvement when you consider that back in 2011, before the RBI was underway, the maximum connection speed was 8 Mbps.  
Unlike Ultrafast broadband in towns such as Lincoln and Rolleston, which is delivered via fibre, the RBI is delivered by copper phone lines which have been upgraded to provide significantly faster broadband.  
To date, upgrades to 41 out of 46 cabinets around Selwyn have been completed under the RBI. The five remaining upgrades and their timeframe for completion are as follows:  
• Windwhistle – due to be completed in August 2015  
• Greendale - due to be completed in September 2015  
• Bankside - due to be completed in October 2015  
• Southbridge - due to be completed in November 2015  
• Springfield – due to be completed in May 2016  
The map below shows the entire RBI coverage area in Selwyn once all of the upgrades are completed.
