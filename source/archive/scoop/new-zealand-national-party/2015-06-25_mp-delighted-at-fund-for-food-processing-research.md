The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has awarded funding of $16.65million over the next six years to transform New Zealand’s primary food production into added-value products.

The programme will be hosted by Massey University, with Professor Richard Archer as national science leader, and partner organisations are AgResearch, Plant and Food Research, the Riddet Institute, the University of Auckland and the University of Otago.

“This, once again, highlights Palmerston North as a food research centre,” says Jono Naylor MP.

“This is fantastic news for the Palmerston North research sector.

“It will increase the networks of FoodHQ and the Riddet Institute as they work with organisations around the country to improve the value-add of our products.

“Working across the country this programme will future highlight the work Palmerston North does in AgResearch.

“I am delighted to see Palmerston North continue to lead the way in AgResearch in New Zealand and look forward to seeing the success this programme brings.
