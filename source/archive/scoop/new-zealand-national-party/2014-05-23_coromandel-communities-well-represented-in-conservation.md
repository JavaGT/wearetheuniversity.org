Coromandel Communities Well Represented in Conservation
=======================================================

**Coromandel Communities Well Represented on Conservation Board**

Coromandel MP Scott Simpson is pleased our region’s communities are well represented on Waikato’s Conservation Board.

He made the comments after the Department of Conservation announced who’s got the nod for its regional boards.

Scott Simpson MP says “I want to congratulate the Coromandel locals who’ve been appointed, or reappointed; they are Arthur Hinds from Whenuakite, Kevin Robinson from Thames, David Taipari from Ngatea, and Joyce Birdsall from Tairua.”

He says “Coromandel is blessed with New Zealand’s finest natural surroundings. Our representatives’ local knowledge will directly benefit our communities. That’s because they’ll advise the New Zealand Conservation Authority and Department of Conservation about planning here.”

Scott Simpson MP says “This year, boards will be looking harder at promoting recreation opportunities and tourism on conservation land, and enhancing relationships with iwi/hapū.”
