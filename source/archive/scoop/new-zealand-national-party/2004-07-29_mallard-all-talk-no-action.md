Mallard all talk, no action

Trevor Mallard has absolutely no credibility on Treaty issues when he can't even sort out the problems in his own portfolio area of education, says National's Education spokesman, Bill English.

Six months ago Mr Mallard promised to remove ethnic weighting from the decile funding formula.

"But we are yet to see any action because he knows that schools up and down the country will be upset by the inevitable funding changes.

"The tertiary education sector is rife with treaty-ology. Industry training organisations have been ordered to sort out their treaty 'obligations' but why should the experts that train our plumbers and mechanics have to bow to political correctness?

"Trevor Mallard has shown no willingness and no capacity to push back the political correctness that he has encouraged in his own Ministry.

"He is all talk and no action," says Mr English.
