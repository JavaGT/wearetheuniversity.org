OECD gives Labour an ‘F’ for failure

Labour today got a fail mark from the OECD for its policies for early childhood and tertiary education, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.

The latest OECD report, released today, is strongly critical of the blow-out in low-value tertiary courses.

“The OECD says there is a ‘proliferation of courses that are of low quality and/or in subjects that have only remote career relevance’.

“National will clean up these dodgy courses and stop the rorts that have wasted hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.

“The OECD also targets Labour’s 20 hours’ free childcare policy, under which parents will have to take their children to a community-owned centre to qualify.

“Labour wants to stop parents using play centres and privately owned centres because it doesn’t like them.

“National will drop this policy because it discriminates against thousands of families who need convenient childcare regardless of who owns the building.

“Even the teacher unions can't bring themselves to support Labour’s education policies, if their weekend advertisements are anything to go by,” Mr English says.
