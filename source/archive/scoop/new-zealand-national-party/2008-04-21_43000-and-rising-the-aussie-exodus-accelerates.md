43,000 and rising - the Aussie exodus accelerates

The number of Kiwis voting with their feet by heading permanently to Australia is a damning indictment on Labour policies that are making it increasingly difficult for people to make ends meet, says National's Immigration spokesman, Lockwood Smith.

The latest immigration statistics, released today, show the number of people leaving for Australia rose 19% to 43,419 in the year to March 2008.

"In March alone 4,152 New Zealanders packed up and pulled out.

"Even when you balance the figures with those who arrived in New Zealand, the figures are staggering. The net loss is up 28% to 29,892.

"And these are just the Australian figures. The exodus from New Zealand to all parts of the world is now 78,841, up 12% on 2007.

"These are people fed up with a Labour Government that has mismanaged the economy, over-taxed people while gloating about its surplus, and delivered the highest interest rates in the developed world.

"These are our tradesman and our university graduates - the future of this country is fleeing in droves.

"Michael Cullen claims that 'we're better off without them'.

"That may well be the refrain he is hearing on election night."
