National selects Hamish Walker as Dunedin South candidate  

The National Party has selected Hamish Walker as its candidate for Dunedin South for the 2014 General Election.

“Dunedin South backed National’s return to Government in 2011 and National is making strong progress for Dunedin families,” said Regional Chair Ele Ludemann.

“Hamish will work hard to win the trust and support of Dunedin South communities. He will be a strong voice for Dunedin if elected on 20 September.”

Mr Walker is a born-and-bred Dunedinite. He attended John McGlashan College and holds a Diploma in Television and Film from Otago School of Media. His family ties to the city stretch over 160 years.

After completing his studies in Dunedin, he moved to Auckland, completed a degree in accountancy, and in 2012 started his own property management business, which is now being franchised.

Alongside his successful business career, Mr Walker has been a youth mentor for young people suffering Type One Diabetes, and lives with the condition himself. He is also a keen sportsman, and is a first class rugby referee who has refereed games around the world.

“Dunedin is my home and I am passionate about the city where I was born and grew up,” said Mr Walker.

“I’ve returned to Dunedin to run because I want Dunedin to be a place more people want to move to and have a family, a place where more students want to stay on when they finish their studies.

“I will be a strong and passionate voice in John Key’s National Party for the people of Dunedin South if elected in September.”
