ACC bill sees off another top New Zealander

National's Agriculture spokesman, David Carter, says it's not surprising that an ACC bill was the final clincher in galloping trainer Sheila Laxon's decision to move to Australia.

The leading trainer, who's leaving for Victoria, says a $20,000 bill from ACC last month for insurance for her staff helped tip the balance in making the move.

"This is yet another example of a high profile business person saying enough's enough. When is the Government going to learn that its anti-business stance is pushing our best offshore?" says Mr Carter.

"After baldly promising that the renationalisation of accident insurance wouldn't cost the agricultural sector any more, the Government's currently proposing a 22% increase in average motor vehicle levies, a 5-8% increase in ACC levies on farm employee wages and an around 30% increase in levies for self-employed farmers.

"This is dumping on a sector that's already facing tough times trying to absorb a nearly 20 per cent jump in farm input prices over the last three years.

"I wish Sheila Laxon every success in her move to Australia, but let's hope this doesn't open the floodgates to more and more of our talented business people taking their talents elsewhere," says Mr Carter.
