Labour out of touch on pregnant teens

"Steve Maharey is out of touch if he thinks heavily pregnant teenage girls want to waddle down a mainstream high school corridor in their third trimester of pregnancy," says National Party Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

In an answer to a Parliamentary Question about whether it's practical for pregnant teenagers to remain in mainstream schools attending classes up until the birth of their baby he answered; 'I do think it's practical for pregnant teenagers to remain in mainstream schools and attending classes up until the birth of their baby'.

Katherine Rich says she and Paula Bennett have visited many teen parent units, which are currently giving young women a second chance at education.

"It's clear that neither schools or the young women themselves think that staying at school right up to the birth of their babies is either 'practical' or appropriate.

"We have yet to meet one young woman who would have felt comfortable staying at her local school during the later stages of her pregnancy. Many cite schoolyard teasing, negative reactions from classmates and feeling awkward around ex-boyfriends as being the major reasons they didn't want to go back to their local school.

"I have also raised this issue with principals. While they understand the vital importance of keeping these young women engaged in some kind of learning, they worry about the messages being sent to other students by having noticeably pregnant young women in the school. In particular, they worry that some students might be sent the message that being a pregnant teenager is 'cool'.

"Rather than being 'practical' as the Minister would suggest, Principals also point out that they are not resourced for the additional case management required and oversight from teachers, deans and others.

"The Minister's ideological preference for mainstreaming heavily pregnant teenagers will come up against major opposition from parents, schools and importantly, the young women themselves.

"It's time he stopped hiding behind the present moratorium for teen parent units and explained exactly how his strategy for pregnant teens is going to work in schools.

"One thing is clear. If he is relying on his theory that pregnant teenagers will front up to mainstream high schools right up to the birth of their babies, he's going to ensure that more of those young women drop out altogether. "
