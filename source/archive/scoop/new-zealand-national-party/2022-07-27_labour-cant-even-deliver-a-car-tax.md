Labour Can’t Even Deliver A Car Tax
===================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The Vehicle Importers Association has pulled its support for the Government’s ‘Clean Car Programme’ because of significant failures with the programme's implementation, National’s Transport spokesperson Simeon Brown says.

“Michael Wood’s hastily drawn car tax policies have consistently failed since they were implemented in April.

“People are taxed when they shouldn’t be, they aren’t getting refunds when they should, and car importers and retailers are being made to look like it is their fault.

“You know things are bad when Labour can’t even deliver a new tax.

“The Vehicle Importers Association also highlighted that the tax on vehicles is not consistently applied, meaning different charges are applied to identical vehicles.

“National warned the Government that this rushed plan would lead to these types of problems, and today’s announcement by the Vehicle Importers Association has only proved us right.

“The ‘Clean Car Discount’ gives a rebate for expensive electric vehicles, while steep fees of thousands of dollars are imposed on other vehicles. It ends up punishing our farmers and tradies who need utes to do their jobs and contribute to our economy.

“The Government should also delay the ‘Clean Car Standard’ from 1 January, when it is currently due to be implemented, until they can assure the industry that it will actually work.

“If the Government wants to help reduce emissions from vehicles, they should work with the industry and not against them.

“So far, it just looks like Labour can’t even organise a car tax properly.”
