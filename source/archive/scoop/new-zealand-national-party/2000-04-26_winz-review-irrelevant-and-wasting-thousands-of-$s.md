WINZ review irrelevant and wasting thousands of dollars

Work and Income New Zealand Minister Steve Maharey today all but admitted that thousands of taxpayer dollars is currently being wasted on an independent review into WINZ because he has already made up his mind to split the department, says National's Work and Income Spokesperson Belinda Vernon.

The structure, culture and style of the department is currently being investigated through an independent review by former State Services Commissioner Don Hunn.

"It's clear from the Minister's comments in the Dominion today that the Hunn review is either irrelevant or designed to pave the way for major change that the Minister has already decided on.

"It is farcical to go through the motions of this independent review when the Minister has already made up his mind. It's a blatant waste of public money that could be better spent on practical ways of getting unemployed New Zealanders into work.

"This Government is making a habit of setting up reviews when it already knows the results they will generate. Alternatively it rubbishes the review if it doesn't come up with the result they want.

"The Minister seems to have forgotten what WINZ is for. It needs time to settle down so it can focus on the big picture - helping New Zealanders back into work - rather than fighting scrubfires set by political arsonists.

"It's about time Mr Maharey fronted up and told the public what his plans for WINZ are. Unemployed New Zealanders are sick and tired of needless change that doesn't bring them any closer to getting work - just gives them prettier forms to fill out," says Belinda Vernon.
