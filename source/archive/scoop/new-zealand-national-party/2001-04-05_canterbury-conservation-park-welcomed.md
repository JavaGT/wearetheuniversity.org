Canterbury Conservation Park Welcomed
=====================================

**Thursday, 5 April 2001, 12:41 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

National Conservation spokesperson Nick Smith today welcomed the proposal of a Torlesse Range conservation park in Canterbury.

"The Torlesse Range Conservation Park is a good idea who's time has come.

"The National Government has worked with the support of the Nature Heritage Fund through the 1990s to secure large tracts of land in the Torlesse Range for this very purpose.

"National will be supporting the proposal through the public submission process," Dr Smith said.
