Govt must fix RMA rather than pick favourites

Hon Nick Smith MP National Party Environment Spokesman

Govt must fix RMA rather than pick favourites

"The Government should fix the Resource Management Act for all rather than create sweetheart projects of Jim Anderton's choosing," says National's Environment spokesman Nick Smith.

He's commenting on suggestions that Cabinet will consider a new process in the next month, which would give Jim Anderton the ability to by-pass the RMA for infrastructure projects the Government deems worthy.

"A process of resource consents that has a Minister dishing out favours is wide open to abuse and corruption. The bureaucracy of the Resource Management Act needs to be fixed for all businesses both large and small - not just a select few.

"Jim Anderton's track record in picking favourites is less than impressive - just look at the spectacular failure of Sovereign Yachts in Auckland.

"He promised that New Zealand would benefit to the tune of $600 million in export earnings, while Helen Clark said the Sovereign Yachts project is like 'a dream come true'.

"Both of them were wrong.

"Then there's the example of Helen Clark's close friend Dr Ross Armstrong who was attempting to fast-track infrastructural projects during behind closed doors meetings with Michael Cullen.

"Dr Armstrong lost his job as allegations of a perceived conflict of interest swirled around the Government.

"Helen Clark's Government has a history of working with, rewarding and protecting those who it deems are friendly. It punishes those who it disagrees with.

"The only positive in this announcement is the Government is at last acknowledging that the Resource Management Act has serious problems. It also makes a mockery of claims by Marian Hobbs that the RMA does not need changing.

"The Government would do well to go back and pick up the sensible RMA reforms introduced to Parliament by Simon Upton in 1999, but rejected by Labour in 2000.

"National believes the Government should be taking an even hand to the Resource Management Act and fixing the process to make it easier for everyone, rather than a few chosen favourites," says Dr Smith.
