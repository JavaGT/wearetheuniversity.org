Hutt Valley encouraged to unlock its curious mind

  
Chris Bishop is encouraging Hutt Valley research institutes, iwi, community groups, educational organisations, and businesses to apply to the second round of the Unlocking Curious Minds contestable fund announced today by Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce.

Offering up to $2 million for successful projects, the fund supports innovative projects that will excite and engage young people. Stokes Valley school Koraunui Primary was the recipient of $20,000 in the initial funding round, and Mr Bishop says there are many opportunities for this funding in the Hutt Valley.

“Successful applications will help to achieve the vision of transforming the Hutt into “Technology Valley”. There is a real opportunity for the Hutt Valley to be a leader in the science and high-tech industries, so I am encouraging applications to the second round of funding announced today,” says Mr Bishop, the National list MP based in Hutt South.

“At Korauni Primary students made their own fossils and learnt about dinosaurs, volcanoes, earthquakes and New Zealand’s unique geological resources. With organisations like GNS Science based in the Hutt we can support positive, community-based teaching and learning for our young people.

“If you are an educator, researcher, community group or business with a passion for helping kids into science and innovation, I strongly encourage you to apply for this funding.”

The fund offers two levels of grants: up to $30,000 for local projects, and up to $150,000 for regional or national projects. Applications are sought from individuals and organisations.

The Unlocking Curious Minds programme is part of the Government’s strategic plan to encourage all New Zealanders to become engaged with science and technology. It ties in with the innovation and skills streams of the Business Growth Agenda, and the National Statement of Science Investment.
