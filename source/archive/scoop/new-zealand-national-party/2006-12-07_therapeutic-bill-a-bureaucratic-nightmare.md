Therapeutic Bill a bureaucratic nightmare
=========================================

Hon Tony Ryall  
National Party Health Spokesman

Therapeutic Bill a bureaucratic nightmare

National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall, is attacking Labour’s decision to push ahead with a trans-Tasman agency to regulate natural healthcare products.

Mr Ryall’s commenting after the tabling of the Therapeutic Products and Medicines Bill. National is opposing the Bill.

"We are not prepared to jeopardise the viability of hundreds of small businesses nor the choices of thousands of consumers. This regime will be costly, restrictive and is unnecessary.

"It's a move that's going to cost industry and consumers. The Australian natural health products industry is one of the most highly regulated in the world, and applying its rules here will only serve to increase the cost of products, reduce consumer choice and hurt many businesses.

"There should be regulation of natural health products but not this bureaucratic nightmare.

“The fact that the Labour Government has had to offer a 50% subsidy to garner parliamentary support proves this regime is too expensive."
