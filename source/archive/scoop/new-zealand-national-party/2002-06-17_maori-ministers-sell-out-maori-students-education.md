Maori Ministers sell-out Maori students education

"The inaction and silence of Maori Ministers Horomia, Turia and Lee on the current crisis in education show how willing they are to sell-out Maori student's education for their own political gain," says National's Spokesperson for Maori Affairs, Georgina te Heuheu.

"Maori youngsters are among the thousands of students whose education is being hampered by the teacher strikes.

"The Maori Ministers talk big about the importance of education, but when it suits them they simply "drop tools" and abandon these students. Their willingness to go out and campaign instead of trying to resolve this education crisis is nothing short of disgraceful.

"57,000 fifth formers face the prospect of missing out on any meaningful qualification this year, and that includes many Maori youngsters.

"The Maori Ministers have a greater responsibility to work to get teachers back in the classrooms. The Minister's inaction sends a message to Maori youngsters that education is not important.

"I think the Maori Ministers' silence on the education crisis tells us all that their talk about building Maori capacity has just been sloganeering for the last three years," said Ms Te Heuheu.
