Transpower overhead AC 400kV project unacceptable

Transpower's overhead AC 400kV project unacceptable

Transpower's announcement that it wants to use the western route through the Waikato to get extra power to Auckland using alternating current (AC) overlooks alternatives, says Lindsay Tisch, the National MP for Piako.

“Many options have been mooted but discounted, especially the direct current (DC) option.

“A high voltage direct current line could be used on existing lines or be

put underground,” Mr Tisch says.

“In Australia, the Murraylink underground high voltage direct current project over 180 kilometres was completed within 40 months compared with five to seven years for a high voltage alternating current overhead line similar to that proposed by Transpower.

"Research shows that generation is as important as transmission, but these options have not been explored.

“The Government last month instructed the Electricity Commission to look at other options and report back by June next year

"Transpower's proposal is a 'Band-Aid mentality' based on historical perceptions and not scientific technologies.

“New Zealand needs a strategic plan for energy to cover the next 50 years. We don't have that with Transpower's project," says Mr Tisch.
