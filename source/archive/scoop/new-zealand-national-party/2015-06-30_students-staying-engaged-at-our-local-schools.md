Students staying engaged at our local schools

  
List MP Jono Naylor says there has been a significant drop in the number of school students being suspended and expelled from schools in Palmerston North.

“Under National, kids are staying in school longer and getting better results,” Jono Naylor said.

“Around New Zealand students are staying engaged in our classrooms. Since 2008, the number of suspensions in state and state-integrated schools has dropped 38 per cent.

“Here in Palmerston North stand-downs have dropped 32.7 per cent since 2008, and expulsions have fallen 52.5 per cent.

“These figures show we have more kids staying focused on their education.

“National has worked hard to offer more options for students to keep them engaged in learning, such as Trades Academies and Partnership Schools.

“And we’re supporting our teachers and school leaders to lift student achievement by helping them to collaborate and work together to share best practice in Communities of Schools.

“The Positive Behaviour for Learning (PB4L) programme is also helping create a more inclusive and supportive environment for students who need a bit more support.

“National is focusing on improving performance in the schooling system so every child has the opportunity to succeed, as we know high-quality education provides the opportunity for any child from any background to get ahead and make the most of their life,” Jono said.
