Marketing ‘20 hours free’ is misleading

Marketing ‘20 hours free’ is misleading

“Labour should tell the public immediately how much they’re spending on marketing the ’20 hours free’ policy, when the programme itself is still the subject of sector consultation,” says National Party Associate Education spokeswoman (Early Childhood) Paula Bennett.

“Labour doesn’t even know how this programme will work or how many centres will opt in, yet it appears to be spending tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on marketing. Surely there are more pressing issues to spend scarce education money on?”

Paula Bennett has not yet received reports on the total spend for television advertising, but in answers to parliamentary questions the Education Minister has confirmed the ‘Free ECE Toolkit’ alone has cost $83,000 to produce.

“Most taxpayers would question $83,000 for a glossy kit that deliberately avoids answering the real concerns of the early childhood education sector.”

12,000 of the toolkits were produced. There are about 3,500 ECE centres nationwide.

“But the Minister should also reveal how much he’s pouring into television and other marketing initiatives. Providing information to the public about a new service is one thing, but so far Labour only has a slogan and there is no programme to deliver.”
