Labour’s winter of discontent starts tomorrow

Labour’s winter of discontent starts tomorrow

  
National’s Industrial Relations spokesman Wayne Mapp says thousands of Aucklanders will struggle to get to work or school tomorrow as a direct result of Labour’s unproductive industrial law changes.

His comments come as Stagecoach bus drivers across Auckland prepare to strike tomorrow. They have rejected a 12% pay rise, and are seeking an increase of 16%.

This follows a call by the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union for a 5% across-the-board pay increase.

“National predicted this kind of widespread union action would result from Labour’s new legislation which gives unions preferential treatment. National will remove that preference and bring sanity back to industrial law,” says Dr Mapp.

“If the unions were serious about boosting wage rates they would lobby Labour to bring down taxes and boost productivity in the workplace. This would give businesses and employers room to provide wage increases.”

National has pledged to reduce personal and corporate taxes.
