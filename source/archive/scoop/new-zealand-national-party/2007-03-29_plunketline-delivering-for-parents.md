PlunketLine delivering for parents

PlunketLine delivering for parents

National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Jo Goodhew is congratulating Plunket on the launch of its re-vamped PlunketLine telephone service.

“New Zealand families trust Plunket and PlunketLine as evidenced by the 55,000 calls being handled each year. Labour clearly doesn’t trust Plunket. Why else would it pull the plug on PlunketLine funding?”

Mrs Goodhew says the growing arrogance of the Labour Government is laid bare in the PlunketLine saga.

“Last year, 53,129 New Zealanders signed a petition expressing their support for PlunketLine, but Labour ignored them.

“A Parliamentary Select Committee recommended that PlunketLine be saved, but Labour ignored them.

“I wholeheartedly endorse Plunket’s ‘can do’ attitude and the fact that they have refused to turn their backs on the thousands upon thousands of Kiwi mums and dads who rely on the telephone advice.”

Mrs Goodhew sees the PlunketLine issue as another sign that Labour has totally lost touch.

“In Opposition, Helen Clark said PlunketLine would be expanded and supported by a Labour Government. She has broken that promise and left Plunket to fend for itself.

“It is yet another example of Labour’s mistrust of the non-government sector and its contempt for the deeply held views of parents.”
