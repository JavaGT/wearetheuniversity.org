Petition calls on Govt to fund children’s camps

There is still time for the Prime Minister to stop the Government’s closure of the Stand children’s health camps in light of an outpouring of community support, Children’s Spokesperson Alfred Ngaro says.

“Over one thousand people have reached out in an online petition calling on the Ardern-Peters Government to stop the closure of the Otaki and Otago children’s camps. The communities, the Mayors, the unions, and the children rallied to save Stand, but the Government hasn’t listened and has instead prioritised diplomats over children.

“These camps support some of the most vulnerable children and families who are dealing with serious physical and emotional issues. Often these camps provide the respite that they need so they can access the services to get back on the right track.

“Two camps – one at Roxburgh and the other at Otaki - are due to shut because of the Government’s decision to pull funding.

“This extraordinary prioritisation has left 63 people without jobs and 380 traumatised children without a specialised treatment facility.

“Stand needed just $3 million to keep these camps afloat. With a Government awash with cash, both the Prime Minister and Minister Tracey Martin should be able to make this happen.

“If children are at the heart of everything this Government does, they should listen to the children and who want these camps to stay open so they can still access the services they desperately need.”
