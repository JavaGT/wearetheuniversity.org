Police get a cheque and a new job

Police get a cheque and a new job

Police Minister George Hawkins should explain why former police officers can quit the police, receive thousands of dollars in PERF payouts, and then get back on to the police payroll, National's Police spokesman Tony Ryall said today.

"Is this what the Prime Minister meant when she promised a new standard in the public service?

"This stinks. How can the Police Minister justify a police officer leaving the police force, getting a big payout, and then joining the force again in a 'non-sworn' role?

"Reports that 18 former officers have 'perfed' and then been re-employed will shock the public. This is not how the PERF scheme should be used.

"If these people want to stay working for the police, they should request a transfer, not a cheque and a new job.

"Frontline police are still severely understaffed and under-resourced. Cops on the streets, dealing with the thugs pushing the violent crime rate through the roof, will be shaking the heads in disgust. And all the time Minister Hawkins says nothing," Mr Ryall said.
