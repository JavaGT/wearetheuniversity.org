Adrenaline stocks – when will Pharmac learn?

Adrenaline stocks – when will Pharmac learn?

News that Pharmac will de-list an alternative adrenaline from next month to rely on the original sole supplier - who was unable to supply this life-saving drug late last year - is extremely worrying, says National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Dr Jackie Blue.

“If it wasn’t for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca coming to Pharmac’s rescue and sourcing an alternative adrenaline in January, the situation would have become extremely dire in New Zealand hospitals.

“Adrenaline is used in emergency, life and death situations. It is crucial that supplies of this drug are guaranteed.

“But now because of Pharmac's unilateral decision, AstraZeneca’s alternative adrenaline will no longer be available as a back-up.

“Pharmac clearly hasn’t learnt the lessons of the past that drugs stocks can become vulnerable and effectiveness can become an issue when there is just one supplier.”

In 2005 Pharmac introduced a sole supply contract with a generic salbutamol inhaler, Salamol, replacing Ventolin, which had been the cornerstone of asthma treatment for decades.

“There was a huge uproar and Pharmac backed down on its decision after receiving hundreds of complaints about the effectiveness, taste and delivery problems with the new inhaler.

“Later that year Pharmac had to abandon its single purchaser deal for winter flu vaccines after concerns over its effectiveness.

“This year we’ve had pharmacies running out of calcium tablets taken to prevent osteoporosis in post menopausal women because its sole supplier had been unable to meet demand.

“But it’s a situation which we could see increasingly. In Pharmac’s drive to reduce costs, the offer of sole supply contracts becomes attractive for manufacturers who sufficiently reduce their price.

“Just when will Pharmac learn that cost must be weighed up with quality and surety of supply?”
