Will Labour give pie-warmers back to the workers?

Phil Heatley

MP for Whangarei

2 June 2000

Will Labour give pie-warmers back to the workers?

"313,000 new jobs may have been created over the past nine years - but that may have taken a toll on the warmth of worksite pastry-goods," says National's Whangarei MP Phil Heatley.

At a select committee hearing in Auckland today the Northern Amalgamated Workers Union made a submission complaining about the range of household appliances available on work-sites for construction workers.

Their chief gripe? "Fridges, pie warmers and heaters which were common prior to the ECA are today a wondrous sight to behold".

Those words came from union secretary Ray Bianchi - who was heavily involved in the Marsden Point project which was nearly crippled by strike action.

Whangarei MP Phil Heatley says "The Employment Relations Bill may end up costing tens of thousands of jobs and causing strike action to skyrocket. However it's reassuring to know that it could mean a boost in sales for our burgeoning Pie Warmer manufacturing sector."

"Except they'll probably be on strike - demanding waffle irons and foot spas," Mr Heatley added.
