Armistice Day a tribute to our heroes

Armistice Day is a fitting tribute to the many thousands of young New Zealanders who lost their lives serving our country, says National's Veterans' Affairs spokesman Simon Power.

"It is an honour to lay a wreath on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition at today's ceremony at the National War Memorial to mark the 85th anniversary of the end of World War 1.

"Like Anzac Day, Armistice Day has a place in the hearts of New Zealanders and it is important we honour the sacrifice made by so many," says Mr Power.
