'Wigram For Sale'
=================

National Party leader Bill English officially opened Alec Neill's campaign to win the seat of Wigram during a visit to the electorate today.

Mr English threw down the gauntlet to Jim Anderton when backing Alec Neill and his 'Electorate for Sale' campaign to win Wigram.

"Jim Anderton has been arrogant in the extreme in claiming that the electorate is his. Six months ago there was no thought that the Wigram electorate was up for sale. However, Alec Neill's bid must now be taken seriously.

"Alec Neill has honesty and integrity and is an experienced politician. Thousands of voters supported Jim Anderton when he left the Labour Party, but now that he is Deputy Prime Minister, with all the pay and the perks, it has become obvious that's all he ever wanted," Bill English said.

"As from today, war is declared over the right to represent Wigram," Alec Neill said in his opening address. "We intend to leave no stone unturned in our fight to win the electorate of Wigram. Mr Anderton will be nervous in the House, nervous in the electorate and nervous in his portfolios throughout the campaign.

"Jim Anderton talks of regional development, but at Pacifica Seafoods 400 new jobs would have been created for the people of Wigram if the policies of Jim Anderton's government had not stifled the proposed mussel farm development. The people of Wigram have a clear choice of candidate, I offer growth, jobs and environmental sustainability.

"This is in stark contrast to Mr Anderton and his governments policies," Alec Neill said.
