Healthcare by postcode

Healthcare by postcode

National's Health spokesman, Tony Ryall, has labelled today's Government health announcement as "healthcare by postcode".

He is commenting on an announcement today of increased funding for General Practices that charge very low fees in low-income areas.

"This is healthcare by postcode," says Mr Ryall.

"Under Labour, your address counts for more than how sick you are.

"Beneficiaries or low-income workers in one part of a city will get more government help than even more needy people in another part of the same city. That's totally unfair.

"The most pressing need in the health system is for more elective surgery. That's where National would put immediate emphasis. There are fewer elective operations today than six years ago but the population has grown and the need is great.

"Labour has totally overlooked the disconnect in its policy - they want more people to go to their GP when sick, but if they need an operation they can't get anywhere near a hospital.

"The thousands of Kiwis who have been culled from the waiting list need a break - regardless of their postcode," says Mr Ryall.
