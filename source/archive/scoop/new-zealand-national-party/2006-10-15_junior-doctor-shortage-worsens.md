Junior doctor shortage worsens

Junior doctor shortage worsens

Hospitals around the country are facing huge increases in the cost of locums as the shortage of junior doctors worsens, says National Party Health spokesman Tony Ryall.

"Not only is the country facing a GP shortage, there's now a very real risk that many of our hospitals will not have enough house surgeons,” says Mr Ryall.

He is commenting on reports that of expected crisis in junior doctor numbers at Canterbury hospitals, which has managers expecting 26 vacancies. Auckland is reported to have 45 vacancies.

Mr Ryall is also releasing information from the Ministry of Health, which shows DHBs are estimated to have paid more than $72 million last year for locum medical staff, including junior doctors.

"This is another health workforce failure by the Government. So much money has gone into the health system but we're getting fewer operations and having trouble keeping our younger doctors in the country.

"What's needed is a focus on recruitment and retention. New Zealand needs to lift doctor training numbers. But also we need to address why young doctors are leaving.

“Clearly, we could offer more competitive salaries if personal taxes were lower. And more respect and trust from central government would help.

A Canterbury DHB manager is reported as saying many of the vacancies will be filled by locums, who cost 50 to 100% more than a salaried doctor.

"The cost of temporary medical staff, or locums, increased by almost a quarter last year, to over $72 million. The cost is up almost 50% in two years. While that's not all junior doctors, it does tell you that there are considerable shortages around the country,” says Mr Ryall.

“Many ordinary people would wonder why some of this locum money isn't better spent on basic salaries.”
