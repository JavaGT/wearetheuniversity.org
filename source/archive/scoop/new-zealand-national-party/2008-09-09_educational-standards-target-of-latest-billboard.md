Educational standards target of latest billboard

The complacency with which Labour treats educational achievement has been targeted in National's latest billboard, says National Party Leader John Key.

Ten billboards are going up in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch.

\"One in five students leaves school without even basic NCEA qualifications," says Mr Key. "This is completely unacceptable."

"In order to ensure students finish school with a useful educational qualification, we must address the failure in their early school years.

"National has already announced that we will set national standards in reading, writing, and maths.

"We will assess all primary and intermediate school pupils against these standards.

"If a child is finding it hard learning how to read, write, and do maths, and the problem isn't addressed, they have no chance of leaving school in their teens with a qualification.

"That is robbing them of opportunities, and we owe it to our children to do something about this major issue.

"National is far more ambitious for our children, and will campaign on delivering them the brighter future they deserve.

"Since Monday last week National has launched a number of billboards on the issues we believe New Zealanders are concerned about.

"National will be resolutely focused on the issues that matter. I believe the public is ready for a fresh start from a new government."
