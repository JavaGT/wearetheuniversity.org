Wake Up And Smell The Facts Jim
===============================

**Thursday, 5 October 2000, 9:57 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Today's ad in the New Zealand Herald from ex-pat young New Zealanders is a wake up call to the Government from a generation lost, National Youth Affairs spokesperson Simon Power said today.

Hundreds of ex-pat young people have put their names and dollars to an advertisement expressing concern about New Zealand's current economic direction. They say the current environment discourages investment, hard work and job creation.

"It's about time the Government took a reality check. Our young people are not going to come flooding back home under this Government - they are leaving in droves. This ad reads like a memorial of lost New Zealanders.

"I am the only one out of ten of my university friends left in New Zealand. They refer to our 'pacific peso', high tax rates and industrial relations as reasons they don't want to return. They have no confidence in the Labour-Alliance Government.

"Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton and his friends need to realise that young people don't see any relevance in unions, they want to work hard, establish a good career and earn good money.

"Without exception, the people I talk to still call New Zealand home and want to come back to start a family one-day, but they are not prepared to return in the current environment.

"Young people are the future of New Zealand and we must give them a good reason to either stay here or return home once they have done their OE.

"Mr Anderton is just dreaming if he thinks young ex-pats are going to return to New Zealand while he and Labour are in Government and refusing to listen to their concerns," Simon Power said.
