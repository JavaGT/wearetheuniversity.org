Mallard should bow out of export education

Mallard should bow out of export education

National Asian Relationships Spokesperson Pansy Wong is calling for Trevor Mallard to step down from working in the export education area after his inability to provide leadership for the sector.

"Trevor Mallard should stand aside and let a Minister who'll give the area the dedication that it deserves a go. His bridge-building trip to China was a failure, he was even reported in the Chinese media as not wanting more students to come to New Zealand.

"This part of the education portfolio needs to be in the hands of someone who is committed to providing leadership to this sector, which has enjoyed spectacular growth and requires a robust monitoring and follow-up system," says Pansy Wong.

Pansy Wong was interviewed on Chinese National TV today in relation to the Chinese Government's demand for a list of quality private education providers. "I assured their large viewership that New Zealand does value and care for young Chinese studying here, thousands of miles from home. This is more than I can say for Trevor Mallard's reported incompetent comments," she said.

"We need a system of robust monitoring and follow-up in the export education sector - our fifth largest export earner at $17 billion dollars per annum. The lack of this system meant that early warning signs of failure at the Modern Age Institute, who failed to adhere to the Code of Pastoral Care, were not detected.

"Despite Labour's inaction we should remember that many institutions and organisations have worked together to find places for students affected by the closure of both the Modern Age and Carich institutions. This is a clear sign that many in the private education industry are acting maturely and responsibly," she said.
