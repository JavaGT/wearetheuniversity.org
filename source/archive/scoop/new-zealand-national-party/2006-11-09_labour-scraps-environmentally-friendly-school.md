Labour scraps environmentally friendly school

Labour scraps environmentally friendly school

National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says the Government has instructed a school board of trustees to remove the environmental features of its plans for a new school.

Clutha Valley School at Clydevale in South Otago has been instructed to remove high grade batts and double glazing from its plans, as well as solar heating, natural light roofing and an efficient boiler system.

Mr English says the school received these instructions the same week Helen Clark said she wanted to make New Zealand the most sustainable country in the world.

"Every other environmental policy Labour has launched has failed and clearly this one will too.

“Once again there is big gap between what Labour says and what it does,” says Mr English.
