NCEA Concerns Vindicated By Report
==================================

The Education Minister and Ministry of Education can take no comfort from the report of Professor Black, of the School of Education, King's College London, on the National Certificate of Educational Achievement, National's Education spokesperson Gerry Brownlee said today.

"The report refers to the NCEA as radical and ambitious and Professor Black says if it can succeed, New Zealand will have achieved something that hasn't been achieved anywhere else in the world.

"Professor Black's report, commissioned by the Ministry, vindicates National's objections to Mr Mallard's proposal for secondary school qualifications.

"The report questions the value and extent of assessment within the three broad grade categories.

"Since February of this year, National has questioned the validity of the proposed NCEA assessment.

"Professor Black calls into question the comparability of student results given the standard of moderation that will apply.

"National says that parents and students must have confidence in the comparability of results with other students and with other schools.

"The report strongly recommends the availability of significant resources to support an evolutionary introduction of the NCEA.

"If Mr Mallard is so determined to introduce the NCEA, he should at least hold back its introduction until both teachers and schools are ready for it and students and parents can have confidence in the quality of the qualification," Mr Brownlee said.
