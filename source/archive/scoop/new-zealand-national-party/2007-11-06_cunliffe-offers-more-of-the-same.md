Cunliffe offers more of the same
================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Tony Ryall MP  
National Party Health Spokesman  
6 November 2007

Cunliffe offers more of the same

The new Health Minister has shown no new ideas to deal with the problems confronting New Zealanders who use the public health system.

Given a chance in Parliament today to set out his ideas, Health Minister David Cunliffe offered no new priorities or solutions for the thousands waiting on hospital waiting lists and languishing in emergency departments.

“His solution is to meet and greet. But after eight years in office, New Zealanders expect more than a handshake and a caretaker Minister.

“Despite his billing as a rising star, it’s clear Mr Cunliffe is offering more of the same as his predecessor, Pete Hodgson – long delays, endless bureaucracy and poor value for money.”
