Families' grocery bills sky-rocket under Labour
===============================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Rt Hon Jenny Shipley Leader of the Opposition Thursday 7 September 2000

Families' grocery bills sky-rocket under Labour

Families' grocery bills are sky-rocketing under the Labour-Alliance Government, Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley said today.

"The Ann Hercus shopping basket, begun under Labour, shows her grocery list is a whopping $17 more expensive today than last October.

"The 42 items in the grocery trolley rang up a $115.84 bill at the supermarket checkout this week.

"Last October families paid just $97.37 for the same shopping list. This is the biggest increase recorded since we took over the Ann Hercus shopping basket in 1990.

"This Government has been hard on many New Zealanders, and families are feeling it in the hip pocket. The low New Zealand dollar is leading to huge cost increases on essential items like nappies, rice, peanut butter and sugar

"The extra Government-imposed costs are being passed on to families. Suppliers and supermarkets have been signalling price increases over recent months. Clearly New Zealand families are now paying the price for a Labour Government.

"Most families know they are having to find more each week for their groceries.

"This simple shopping test shows they are right.

"The Government talked a lot of rhetoric before the election about more for New Zealanders.

"There's no doubt that the Government is making New Zealanders pay more for day-to-day living.

"The Government's anti-business, anti-investment policies are having a flow-on effect by increasing the cost of doing business and contributing to the plummeting dollar, " Mrs Shipley said.
