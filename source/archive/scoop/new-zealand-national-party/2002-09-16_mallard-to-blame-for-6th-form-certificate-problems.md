Mallard to blame for Sixth Form Certificate problems

Dr Nick Smith - National Education Spokesperson

The education system is struggling to keep up with Trevor Mallard’s flip-flops over the NCEA, says National’s Education spokesperson Nick Smith.

“The uncertainty over NCEA is furthering the confusion in secondary education. After 12 months of industrial disruption the sector is craving for certainty.

“The Minister was first warned over a year ago about the problems with the NCEA, but he refused to listen and blundered on. Then a month ago he suddenly backtracked and announced Level 2 will now be ‘optional’.

“Only 10 weeks away from the end of the school year, it’s unbelievable that many students still don’t know what qualification they’ll be doing next year.

“It’s grossly unfair for students who were guinea pigs this year to be guinea pigs again next year. They only get one shot at school qualifications, which can have such a big impact on their future.

“National’s position has always been clear: don’t roll out Level 2 NCEA until the problems with Level 1 have been sorted.

“Students, parents and teachers are sick of Mallard’s dithering. He has made a mess of the teachers’ pay dispute, a mess of the NCEA implementation, and it’s doing irreparable damage to secondary education,” said Dr Smith.
