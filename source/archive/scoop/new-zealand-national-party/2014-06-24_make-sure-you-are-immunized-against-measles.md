Make Sure You Are Immunized Against Measles

With the school holidays coming up, Coromandel MP Scott Simpson is encouraging families to make sure they’re immunised against measles.

Scott Simpson MP says “With so many families travelling both to and from the Coromandel in the holidays, we need to ensure that people don’t get sick with the measles, or that they spread this contagious disease further.”

“Since December there have been 200 cases of measles; most of those have been children and young people in the Waikato,” he says.

Mr Simpson says ““Call your GP if you’re not sure your family is fully immunised. Don’t compromise your health in the holidays.”

Children are usually vaccinated at 15 months and 4 years of age. Anyone not vaccinated who is exposed to measles needs to stay home for at least two weeks to ensure the virus doesn't spread.

Anyone who suspects they may have measles should phone their GP or call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for advice. Call before seeing a doctor because measles is highly infectious, and people with measles can infect others in the waiting room.

Further information can be found at [www.health.govt.nz/measles](http://www.health.govt.nz/measles) or by calling 0800 IMMUNE.
