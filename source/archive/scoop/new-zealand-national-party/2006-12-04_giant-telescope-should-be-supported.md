Giant telescope should be supported

New Zealand must grasp the opportunity to support Australia and reap the awards of the world's largest telescope, says National's Science spokesman, Dr Paul Hutchison.

Australia is one of the countries short-listed to host 'The Square Kilometre Array,' a next-generation giant radio telescope.

"A successful bid by Australia could see two dishes located in New Zealand, a huge benefit for our scientists," says Dr Hutchinson.

The telescope will be 50 times more sensitive than the most powerful radio telescopes now in use and will be used to search for new planets as well as research the evolution of galaxies, cosmology, dark matter, energy and other phenomenon.

"This is a great opportunity for New Zealand scientists and academics to take advantage of modern technology never seen before. It's an investment we should be behind 100 percent."
