180% rise in foot patrols

**180% rise in foot patrols**

Coromandel MP Scott Simpson says a 180 per cent increase in police foot patrols across the Waikato over the last two years is preventing crime and making people feel safer in their homes and communities.

Crime in Eastern Waikato fell by 11.8 per cent in 2012/2013 when New Zealand reported its lowest crime levels in 30 years.

“Our focus has been on assisting our police to be an active, visible presence in our communities. Central to that support has been providing them with the tools to do that,” Mr Simpson said.

“Following last year’s rollout, frontline officers now have smartphones and tablets, which allow them to spend on average an extra 30 minutes per shift out of the station. Nationally, this is the equivalent of an additional 354 frontline staff, and is delivering over half a million additional frontline Police hours per year.”

As well as acknowledging the great work of our local officers, Mr Simpson also praised all those who support the work of the police across our Coromandel communities.

“I had the great privilege of spending some time with one of our Community Patrol groups recently. They are a huge asset to our local police, particularly in our smaller towns where they do tremendous work in terms of gathering and reporting information and monitoring the safety of people and property.”

“Driving down crime is not just about the actions of the police. We can all play a part by being vigilant in relation to our own security and that of our property. Reporting suspicious activity as soon as it occurs is also vital as it provides the best possible opportunity for police to prevent a crime occurring in the first place.”
