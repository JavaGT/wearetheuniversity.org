United Future again urged to stand up to Govt

United Future must put its money where its mouth is and back up its words with action, according to the National Party Transport spokesman Roger Sowry.

"Peter Dunne's Transport spokesman has accused the Government of 'taking Kiwis for a ride' with its transport policies.

"But it's Larry Baldock who's taking voters for a ride," Mr Sowry says.

"If United Future are so opposed to the Land Transport Amendment Bill I urge them (yet again) not to vote for it at the select committee stage.

"And if New Zealanders are to take their convictions seriously, then surely United Future is the only Party that can keep the Government honest," says Mr Sowry.

"If Mr Dunne's mob are so strongly opposed to Government initiatives, why is the Party still handing Labour its vote on issues of confidence and supply?

"The only possible answer is now that United Future's got its Family Commission, the Party's expected to rubber stamp everything else.

"United Future should honour its pre-election promises and stop driving the thousands of Kiwis who lent them their vote to despair," Mr Sowry says.
