Government wastes legal aid on Algerian case

The Ahmed Zaoui case raises the need to change the Immigration Act regarding whether suspect refugees can appeal a finding against them, especially in the post-September 11 era, says National's Foreign Affairs spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp.

"An appeal to the Refugee Status Appeals Authority is a waste of taxpayers' money when the decision is actually made on security grounds," he says.

"The Immigration Act provides for a security risk certificate to be issued. That certificate is subject to review by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Any sensible government would act on the report of the Inspector-General.

"There is no point in a hugely expensive five-week hearing in the Refugee Status Appeals Authority prior to the Inspector-General's report.

"The Government can't expect New Zealanders to accept that it is sensible in such circumstances to spend so much money on helping a person who is not even a New Zealand resident.

"It seems absurd that the Government allocates tens of thousands of dollars towards the legal aid process for a person who is suspected of terrorist activities to take a refugee appeal.

"Given that the ultimate decision will be made by the Inspector General of Security, there has been little point in going through a hugely expensive hearing process," Dr Mapp said.
