Minister shrugs over complete rejection of his fire reforms

Internal Affairs Minister Rick Barker appears not to give a damn that every single rural fire authority in the country has rejected his fire reforms out of hand, says National’s Internal Affairs spokeswoman, Sandra Goudie.

“What the Minister appears not to understand about consultation, is that it requires listening, not just presenting your own fait accompli”

At the 2007 Regional Rural Fire Committee Chairpersons’ Conference last month in Christchurch, Labour’s reforms of fire and rescue services were strongly rejected.

“This rejection was unanimous and came from the Chairpersons and Deputies of the eleven Regional Rural Fire Committees, the National Rural Fire Advisory Committee, and Rural Fire District representatives.

“For the Minister to blithely state that, if regions don’t like the idea of coming under the control of a new centrally-administered body, they can stick with the funding status quo, is disingenuous.

“He knows that councils struggle to fund rural fire units and, instead of offering them help, comes up with a grand takeover plan. Councils will save hundreds of thousands of dollars if they roll over and allow Wellington to run the show, but at what cost?

“Our rural volunteers are the backbone of this country’s fire fighting brigade. They are dedicated, hardworking and capable. Their local knowledge makes them invaluable.

“Even in the 2003 government briefing paper on a proposal to reform the sector, it was acknowledged that our network of fire fighters ranked extremely highly internationally.

“For Rick Barker to unilaterally dismiss the sector’s well-considered rejection of his grand plan is short-sighted and terribly, terribly dangerous.”
