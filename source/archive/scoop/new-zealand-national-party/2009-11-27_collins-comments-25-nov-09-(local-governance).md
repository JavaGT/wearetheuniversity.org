Collins Comments - 25 Nov '09 (Local Governance)
================================================

Local Governance

Recently announced ward, local board and boundary changes will ensure Papakura has a strong voice on the new Auckland Council.

The Local Government Commission has suggested dividing Auckland into 12 wards – eight with two councillors and four with one councillor.

Papakura is to be part of the greater Papakura-Manurewa ward with two councillors. Our district’s small population means it does not meet the fair representation requirement to be a standalone ward.

The Papakura-Manurewa ward will stretch from Drury’s Great South Road-Southern Motorway interchange to Puhinui Road, Manukau. It encompasses Hingaia, Pahurehure, Takanini and parts of Alfriston together with Manurewa East, Wattle Downs, Weymouth, Homai and Wiri.

I’m pleased to say the commission has recommended establishing a single Papakura board. This gives our district the opportunity to retain our local voice.

Nineteen local boards are proposed within Auckland with five to nine members each, totaling 126 board members. Each board must represent an area with 53,000 or more people – apart from the mandatory boards for Waiheke and Great Barrier Island communities.

Papakura, with a population of 44,000, is the only exception.

This is great news for our district – five elected board members will continue to represent Papakura’s interests in the Auckland Council decision-making process.

The Commission is also proposing changes to Auckland’s southern boundary. Former parts of Waikato will become part of greater Auckland including:

• Urban areas of Waiuku and Pukekohe and adjacent future growth areas  
• The adjacent area of Buckland  
• The area to the east of Pukekohe, north of Mill road

The Mangatawhiri and Mangatangi catchments will be included in the Waikato Region together with the part of Franklin District between the Mangatangi Stream catchment and the Firth of Thames.  
I encourage you to share your views about the proposals with the Commission. Residents have until 5pm on 11 December to make submissions:
