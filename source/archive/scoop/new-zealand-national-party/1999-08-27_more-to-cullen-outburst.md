More To Cullen Outburst
=======================

**Friday, 27 August 1999, 2:31 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Responding to Michael Cullen’s extraordinary outburst in Parliament yesterday, Ilam MP Gerry Brownlee said that he believed Doctor Cullen knows National’s industrial relations policy is right for New Zealand.

“His behaviour had much more to do with his frustration at knowing any Labour-led Government would have more than half its Caucus drawn from union ranks”, said Mr Brownlee.

“A quick perusal of the Labour list shows more than half those who would come into Parliament in a Labour win have been either Union organisers or executive members.

“What Dr Cullen knows is that his moderate position will not prevail if they should get to Government. His extreme sensitivity to that reality being pointed out by Hon Max Bradford lead to his reaching boiling point yesterday.

“The Council of Trade Unions have written a draconian bill signalling a return to union domination of New Zealand work places.

“It was drafted by Margaret Wilson, number three on Labour’s net list and acknowledged in the House recently by Di Yates to be Labour’s next Attorney General.

“Just watch how many of his colleagues do not support Dr Cullen’s moderate stance over the next few days.” said Mr Brownlee.

Mr Brownlee said that in the last year that unions ran the work place, workers in the Canterbury region arguably lost up to $10 million in wages over the year.

“Dr Cullen knows that economies don’t grow in that environment – unemployment does” said Gerry Brownlee.
