Member’s Bill To Notify Schools Of Sex Offenders Drawn
======================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Today my Member’s Bill that would require the Department of Corrections to notify schools of sex offenders placed in their local communities was drawn in Parliament, Waimakariri MP Matt Doocey says.

“My bill will ensure all schools within five kilometres, or the nearest school if there are none within the five kilometre area, will be notified of the placement of a sex offender.

“It will require the Department of Corrections to notify local schools 48 hours before the release of a sex offender into a community, or within 72 hours of housing the sex offender in a new residential address.

“I accept that some sex offenders will need to be managed in the community, but as a parent it’s outrageous that local schools are not informed of a sex offender’s placement in their community.

“I’ve also created a petition calling on the Department of Corrections to notify schools of sex offenders placed in their local communities, which has so far received over a thousand signatures.

“If you support this bill I encourage you to go to my website and sign this petition.

“By ensuring schools are aware of these situations, it gives them the ability to make informed decisions about what’s best for their students. I believe parents expect this.”
