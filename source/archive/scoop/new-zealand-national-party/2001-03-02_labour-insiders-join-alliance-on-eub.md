Labour Insiders Join Alliance On EUB
====================================

**Friday, 2 March 2001, 10:41 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Auckland University's Princes Street branch of the Labour party has joined the Alliance in conducting a campaign to force the Government to change its mind on the EUB, National's Youth Affairs spokesperson Simon Power revealed today.

Mr Power has released a letter from officials of the Princes Street branch of the Labour Party in which they express their 'great concern' about the Government's failure to act on the Emergency Unemployment Benefit.

"The Princes Street branch propose writing letters to the editor, calling talkback radio and lobbying MPs to get the Government to listen and reinstate the EUB.

"The Labour Party members expressed their disappointment that the Government has refused to consider or even debate the issue in the letter sent to all Labour MPs and some members of the branch.

"Not only is Labour subject to an organised campaign on the EUB by its coalition partner's parliamentary staffers but also they are being targeted by their own members.

"This is symptomatic of a Government torn apart by internecine fighting. Quite simply, the Government is at war with itself," Mr Power said.
