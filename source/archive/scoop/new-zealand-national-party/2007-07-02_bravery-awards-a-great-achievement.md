Bravery awards a great achievement

National Party Leader John Key is congratulating the four New Zealand soldiers today honoured for bravery, including the recipient of the Victoria Cross, Corporal Bill Apiata.

“Corporal Apiata showed immense bravery in a situation many of us couldn’t even imagine, by saving a colleague’s life under heavy fire. His actions have served us proud.

“Congratulations must also be given to the three other soldiers who have received gallantry awards.”

Mr Key says New Zealand’s role in Afghanistan was discussed several times during his visit to the US.

“Many of the officials I spoke to acknowledged the significant contribution New Zealand is making in Afghanistan.

“New Zealanders should be extremely proud of the role our defence personnel are playing on the world stage.”
