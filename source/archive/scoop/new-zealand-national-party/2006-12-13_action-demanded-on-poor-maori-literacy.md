Action demanded on poor Maori literacy

National Party Maori Affairs (Education) spokesman Tau Henare has demanded action from the Government after damning new literacy statistics showed poor outcomes for Maori.

The Student Outcome Overview 2001-2005 showed only 69% of Maori met Level 1 literacy requirements - compared to 84% of Europeans.

“This statistic is a damning indictment on a Labour-led Government that has had years to address issues of quality and standards.

“Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia and the Government are not doing nearly enough to ensure young Maori leave school with the right educational tools so they can participant meaningfully in the economy, rather than end up as beneficiaries.

“Parents demand quality and standards for their children, and the Minister and his Government must act now.”
