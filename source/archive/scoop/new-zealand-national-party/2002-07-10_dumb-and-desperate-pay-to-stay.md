Dumb And Desperate: Pay To Stay
===============================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

10 July 2002

“National had 9 years to introduce its “You Stay, We Pay” tertiary policy and didn’t do so for a simple reason – it is stupid,” says NZ First education spokesperson, Brian Donnelly.

“The policy would lead to a massive increase in student debt because it encourages those who don’t plan to go overseas to borrow to the maximum.

“It also will penalise the frugal, those who work part-time to minimise their loans because they will gain least from the pay back”

“This is vote catching policy from a desperate party which knows it will never have to implement it,” said Mr Donnelly.
