_Christmas is coming_

Christmas is coming but I have already had the best present ever as last week, as I was sworn in as Minister of Police and Minister of Corrections. I am so thrilled to be back in these portfolios as I have a great deal of respect for our Police and Corrections Officers and the very important work they do.

My heartfelt thanks to all of you who have sent messages and supported me throughout this year and indeed throughout my Parliamentary career so far.

I am sure it has been a busy time for all of us and contemplating some time out with family and friends is a happy prospect.

This time of year is a positive time for our retailers in Papakura and Takanini and I hope they enjoy great trading over the next few days.

In Papakura there have been many events that I have enjoyed attending- from the fun of the Santa Parade through the town centre, to Christmas Carols in the Park. Our local Board members led by Bill McEntee, the Town Centre Manager Tracy Shackleton and the Papakura Business Association have contributed much to make Papakura a more vibrant and successful place throughout this year. The inaugural Papakura Sports Awards and Elvis in the Park were a couple of highlights but these groups and individuals delivered on the usual events too.

I am very excited to see the progress being made on widening State Highway 1 from Papakura to Manukau and I am very keen to keep the importance of improving infrastructure in South Auckland in front of the Transport Minister, the Auckland Council and the Transport organisations into the New Year. I will also be delighted to be in a position to help and support our brave and dedicated members of the New Zealand Police and also the hard-working and dedicated officers and workers in our Corrections facilities.

_Helping Kiwis into new Homes_

_It is good to see that in its first year, the Government’s new $435 million KiwiSaver HomeStart scheme has helped over six thousand families including 700 in Auckland to buy their first home._

_In April this year, the Government doubled support for first home buyers through KiwiSaver HomeStart. Under it, couples can apply for grants of up to $10,000 for a deposit on an existing home, and up to $20,000 for a new-build._

_This is the most generous support for first home buyers in more than a generation. In Auckland alone there has been $2,808,000 in grants paid in the first seven months of the scheme._

_Nationwide, HomeStart is proving to be very popular with almost 6,300 applications approved._

_Buying a first home is a huge step and I am pleased to see so many young families are making the most of the support available._

_I would encourage all first-home buyers in Papakura to check whether they are eligible. Over the next five years, HomeStart is expected to help 90,000 people achieve their dream of home ownership. What better time to think and plan for a new home than over the holidays?_

_KiwiSaver HomeStart is part of the Government’s wider programme to improve housing supply and affordability. Housing Accords are freeing up more land faster and we have measures in place to control building material costs, rein in development contributions and compliance costs and improve productivity in the construction sector._

_The newest Special Housing Areas (SHAs) announced, Takanini Strategic SHA extension on Alfriston Road and the Mill Road SHA, are going to provide about 320 new affordable homes in future._

_Christmas is a time for Peace on Earth and that starts with our families, friends and our own communities. So be kind, be happy and be hopeful that the message of peace spreads to the troubled parts of the world.  
Best wishes,_

_Hon Judith Collins  
MP for Papakura_
