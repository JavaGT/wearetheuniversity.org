Government "announcement" just restores status quo

The Government's announcement to raise eligibility for community services card is nothing but a patch-up of its own bungle over eligibility for the card, says National's Work and Income spokesperson Belinda Vernon.

"The thousands of people the Government says will now be eligible for the card, were in fact scheduled to lose their card because of the Government's own policy to increase benefits.

"The 'announcement' just restores what they've always had. It's just a natural consequence of the Government's changes.

"The Minister of Social Services Steve Maharey is taking low income New Zealanders for fools. Today he is 'giving' them back something that his own policy was scheduled to take off them in the first place," says Ms Vernon.
