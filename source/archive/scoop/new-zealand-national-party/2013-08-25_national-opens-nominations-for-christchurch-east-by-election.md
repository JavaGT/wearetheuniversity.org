Media Statement         
   
**National opens nominations for Christchurch East By-election**  
   
Nominations for the National Party’s candidate to contest the upcoming Christchurch East By-election open tomorrow (Monday 26 August).  
   
National Party Canterbury Westland Regional Chair Roger Bridge says the Christchurch East seat has been held by Labour since 1922 and notes that a sitting Government has never won a by-election in a seat it does not hold.  
   
"But here in the Canterbury region the National-led Government has a good story to tell with its focus on the rebuild, a strong growing economy, and improving public services for our families."  
   
Mr Bridge says he expects a talented field of prospective candidates will put themselves forward for selection.   
   
“National has never held the seat, so we enter into this challenge with our eyes open.  But we will run a strong local campaign, founded on the firm belief that we have the best plan to improve the lives of Christchurch East locals and New Zealand as a whole."  
   
Mr Bridge says the National-led Government has provided unwavering support for Canterbury since the devastating earthquakes and the communities are beginning to see positive results as the rebuild gathers momentum.  
   
“We recognise history is not on our side, but never enter a contest aiming for second place.”  
   
Nominations close at 5pm on Wednesday 4 September and are welcome from National Party members.  The successful candidate is likely to be announced in the middle of September.
