**Media Release**

**Busy days planned before voting closes**

National’s Mt Roskill by-election candidate Parmjeet Parmar has a packed schedule for the last five days of the campaign, talking with voters about the local issues that matter.

“I am incredibly proud of the campaign we’ve run so far but it’s not over yet. We’ve got a busy week planned before Election Day on Saturday,” Dr Parmar says.

Mrs Parmar and her supporters will be focused on grassroots, local campaigning over the next few days.

“Our team will be out every morning waving election signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, visiting businesses and churches, and attending several community events,” Dr Parmar says.

“We’ve already knocked on almost every door in the electorate, delivered thousands of flyers and letters, put up hundreds of signs, visited many schools and hardworking local businesses, spoken with the ethnically diverse community groups, and enjoyed a lot of coffee from our great cafes.

“I’ve also been lucky to have had an immense amount of support from the Prime Minister and my colleagues who share my passion and commitment to giving Mt Roskill the strong local voice it deserves.

“This is a once in a generation opportunity to elect a National MP in the Mt Roskill electorate, one who shares your understanding of the importance of a strong economy, rewarding hard work, reducing crime, improving local transport, and investing in public services like health and education.

“The Mt Roskill by-election is so important because it’s about choosing an electorate MP who has the skills, local track record of experience and success in getting things done. I am the clear choice this election.”
