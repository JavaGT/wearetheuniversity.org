Labour Minister offends employers again

Max Bradford National Industrial Relations Spokesperson

Tuesday 3 October 2000

Labour Minister offends employers again

The Labour Minister has dropped herself in it with employers - once again," National's Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.

"This time it's over her proud defence of her and Government Ministers partying it up with the Council of Trade Unions to celebrate the implementation of the Employment Relations Act.

"Employers are surprised the Government hosted a union-only party at Parliament last night to celebrate the ERA.

"Margaret Wilson has added insult to injury in Parliament today by stating the function was for those who supported the legislation.

"And she made it even worse by admitting her Ministers and the Prime Minister led a rendition of the union anthem "Solidarity Forever".

"She even offered to get the Labour-Alliance team to sing it again in Parliament today.

"The Minister of Labour has again thumbed her nose at business.

"This Government has talked long and hard about a so-called charm offensive to business to try to get them to have some confidence in this Government's policies.

"Unfortunately Margaret Wilson's actions are big on offending and short on the charm."

Solidarity Forever

  
When the union's inspiration through the workers' blood shall run,  
There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the sun;  
Yet what force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one,  
But the union makes us strong.  
CHORUS:  
Solidarity forever,  
Solidarity forever,  
Solidarity forever,  
For the union makes us strong.  
Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite,  
Who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might?  
Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight?  
For the union makes us strong.

It is we who plowed the praries; built the cities where they trade;  
Dug the mines and built the workshops, endless miles of railroad  
laid;  
Now we stand outcast and starving midst the wonders we have made;  
But the union makes us strong.

All the world that's owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone.  
We have laid the wide foundations; built it skyward stone by stone.  
It is ours, not to slave in, but to master and to own.  
While the union makes us strong.

They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn,  
But without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn.  
We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn  
That the union makes us strong.

In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold,  
Greater than the might of armies, magnified a thousand-fold.  
We can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old  
For the union makes us strong.

ENDS
