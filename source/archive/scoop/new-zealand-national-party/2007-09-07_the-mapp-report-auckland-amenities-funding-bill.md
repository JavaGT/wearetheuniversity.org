Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Bill

Over the last month or so I have received a large amount of  
correspondence on the Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Bill. This  
Bill proposes that 11 regional facilities will get some of their funding  
from rates of the seven Territorial Local Authorities (TLAs) covering  
the Auckland region. The amenities are:

\* Auckland Festival Trust  
\* Auckland Philharmonia  
\* Auckland Regional Rescue Helicopter Trust  
\* Auckland Theatre Company Ltd  
\* Auckland Zoo  
\* Coastguard Northern Region Inc  
\* New Zealand National Maritime Museum Trust Board  
\* NBR New Zealand Opera Ltd  
\* Auckland Observatory and Planetarium Board  
\* Surf Life Saving Northern Region Inc  
\* WaterSafe Auckland Inc

Public support

They effectively come into two classes; those relating to the saving of lives, and cultural and arts entities. Public surveys were undertaken and it is clear that the life saving organisations have greatest ratepayer support.

How to fund regional amenities

National thought long and hard about this Bill. We know that the high level of rates throughout Auckland has been a major concern and, in fact, we have spoken out about the level of rates increases. But we also know that people expect that regional amenities, especially life saving organisations, will be properly supported. We have also been advocating greatly improved regional government, which we anticipate will have the mandate to properly fund regional amenities, including cultural amenities that are an inherent part of being an international city. For example, the Auckland Philharmonia quite clearly stands alongside the NZSO as one of two professional orchestras in the country.

Select Committee consideration

The Select Committee will have to carefully consider whether all 11 amenities reach the threshold by which they are entitled to a special charge on rates. The Select Committee also needs to consider whether the Auckland Regional Council would be the more appropriate rating entity, rather than the seven TLAs. It would be much simpler. It would also ensure that the TLAs will not freeze out their own local arts and cultural organisations in order to fund the regional entities.

Accountability to ratepayers

The Royal Commission will also need to pick up the whole issue. This Bill highlights the lack of cooperation between the TLAs when it comes to funding region-wide essential amenities. Whether the Royal Commission opts for the stronger Regional Council and three cities plan, or the one city plan, it is very clear that regional funding is required. But this can surely be done in a more simple fashion than by adding costly bureaucratic layers of an electoral college and a separate funding board.
