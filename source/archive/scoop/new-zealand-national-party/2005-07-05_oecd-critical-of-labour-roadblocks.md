OECD critical of Labour roadblocks

National Party Finance spokesman John Key says the results from the latest OECD review of New Zealand will be of little comfort to overtaxed workers.

"What this report shows is that we need better priority setting for Government spending, it says Labour has created disincentives to move from welfare into work, and it says tax cuts are affordable if spending is brought under control.

"It backs up what National has been saying all along.

"Furthermore, it says Labour has wasted money on low quality tertiary courses, it has introduced inflexible employment laws and it has failed to reform the RMA.

"It's far from comforting and there's certainly no room for Michael Cullen to be complacent," says Mr Key.
