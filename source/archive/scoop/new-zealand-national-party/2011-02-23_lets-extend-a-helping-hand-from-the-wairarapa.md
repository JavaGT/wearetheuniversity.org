PRESS RELEASE

JOHN HAYES  
NATIONAL MP FOR WAIRARAPA

23 February 2011

Let’s extend a helping hand from the Wairarapa to those affected by the Christchurch earthquake.

“Thousands of people in the Christchurch area have been badly affected by the latest Christchurch earthquake, and need a break,” said John Hayes MP.

“How about we in the Wairarapa and Central Hawkes Bay extend a hand of friendship and open our homes, batches, farm cottages and motels to those affected by this huge natural disaster. This would allow these shattered people a respite from the constant ground shaking”, said Hayes.

“If you would be prepared to help please phone my office using the toll free number 0800 2 HAYES (0800 2 42937) and let me know what it is that you are able to offer.”

“I will co-ordinate with the Ministry of Social Services to match families with what is available,” Hayes said.

Hayes said he felt sure the people of his electorate will support this action to help those whose lives have been shattered by this terrible event.

“None of us are immune to this sort of environmental disaster,” Hayes said
