National selects Alfred Ngaro as Te Atatu candidate

The National Party has announced that Alfred Ngaro will be its candidate for the Te Atatu electorate at the 2014 General Election.

Mr Ngaro was selected by a meeting of local party members tonight.

“Alfred has been tireless in representing Auckland’s diversity, ensuring that all communities have a strong voice in Government. His experience makes him an outstanding candidate, and he will be a great representative for Te Atatu if elected in September,” said Northern Regional Chair Andrew Hunt.

“National won the party vote here last time and we’ll be working hard to do it again by getting all our supporters in Te Atatu out to vote.”

“I also want to thank Tau Henare for his dedication to the electorate as a List MP over the past nine years."

Mr Ngaro said he was honoured to receive the nomination and was looking forward to the challenge ahead.

“It’s incredibly humbling to be chosen to contest the seat for National and Te Atatu’s communities,” said Mr Ngaro.

“Under John Key’s leadership, this National-led Government is delivering real opportunities for West Aucklanders.

“We’ve been focussed on bringing more jobs and better public services to the region, and I am committed to ensuring that Te Atatu has a strong local voice in National at the election.”
