Anderton Says Eat Up, Taxpayers Are Paying
==========================================

**Thursday, 1 June 2000, 5:07 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The trappings of power have gone to Jim Anderton's head with his comment that it was OK for the Ministry of Economic Development to lash out money for a meal for him at a flash restaurant, National MP John Luxton said today.

"But to make matters worse, Jim Anderton is now denying he ever made the comment, which was reported in the Waikato Times." (Attached)

The Government today denied leave to Mr Luxton to table in Parliament the report from the Waikato Times of 26 May.

"Mr Anderton appears to have misled Parliament with his denial.

"He denied that he made the reported comments at last week's graduation of Business Graduates from Waikato Polytechnic.

"I have spoken to the reporter concerned and he confirms that his notes report Mr Anderton as meeting a businessman at a restaurant that was more expensive than he normally eats at, and saying it did not matter as the Ministry was paying for it.

"Parliament deserves an apology from Mr Anderton. So do taxpayers for making the comment in the first place."
