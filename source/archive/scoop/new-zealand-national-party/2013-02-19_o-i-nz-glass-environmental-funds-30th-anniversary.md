**MP celebrates O-I NZ Glass Environmental Fund’s 30th Anniversary**

Maungakiekie MP, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, congratulates Owens-Illinois (O-I) New Zealand who is celebrating the O-I NZ Glass Environmental Fund’s 30th anniversary.

“This is a fantastic initiative from a local company that has provided almost $620,000 in study grants to over 400 schools across New Zealand,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“I encourage all students to seize this unique opportunity to carry out environmental studies that will benefit their local community and advance environmental sustainability.

“The fund will allocate $25,000 in grants this year.

The fund is supported by a committee including members of the Ministries of Environment, Education and Youth Development, which is responsible for reviewing applications based on a range of criteria.

Expressions of interest from all school levels from early childhood development to secondary schools are due 31 March 2013. Relevant criteria and category details can be found at [www.recycleglass.co.nz](http://www.recycleglass.co.nz/).
