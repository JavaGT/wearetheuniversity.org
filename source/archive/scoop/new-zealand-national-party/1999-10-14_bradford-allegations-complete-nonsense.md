Bradford allegations complete nonsense

  
“An allegation that Hon Max Bradford assaulted a Canterbury University student today is fallacious nonsense,” said Ilam MP Gerry Brownlee.

Mr Brownlee said the student who laid the complaint, deliberately stepped in front of the Minister and attempted to trip him up by standing on his foot. Mr Bradford then instinctively put his hand out to protect himself – as anyone would.

The Ilam MP said seconds later, the same student ran in front of Mr Bradford again, this time throwing himself to the ground, claiming he’d been assaulted.

“This particular student was in a highly agitated state. A few minutes before the incident with the Minister, the student had threatened to destroy all my election hoardings. He also threatened me with a violent act of a somewhat disgusting nature.”

Mr Brownlee said these incidents occurred while he, Hon Max Bradford, and Hon David Carter were leaving a meeting with the Association of University Staff.

“An earlier meeting with students, while spirited, had seen a fair and reasonable exchange of views from both sides.”

The Ilam MP said over the past three years he has always been available to meet with students on campus as much as possible

“And I will continue to be available in future, because while today’s incident was threatening and caused personal fear, the ring-leaders numbered less than 10 out of a campus of more than 12,000 students.

“It’s my sincere hope that the student who laid the complaint against the Minister, realises the precariousness of his situation, and re-thinks his course of action.

“Despite the threatening comments he made towards me I will not be laying any charges at this point,” said Mr Brownlee.
