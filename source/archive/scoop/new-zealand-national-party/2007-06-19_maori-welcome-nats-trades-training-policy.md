Maori welcome Nats trades training policy

Maori will be among the big winners from National's trades training policy, says National Party Maori Affairs spokesman, Tau Henare.

National Leader John Key announced the policy this week, which will include introducing school-based apprenticeships, addressing the technology teacher shortage by allowing qualified tradespeople to teach, raising the esteem in which trades training is held and encouraging off-site trades training.

"It is a huge indictment on the education system under Labour that a horrifying 53% of Maori boys leave school without even achieving NCEA Level One. These youngsters need better choices.

"While many Maori excel academically and become leaders in their fields, others need practical, hands-on learning to keep their interest up at school.

"This will give young Maori the chance to make school meaningful. Geometry becomes a lot more interesting if a student can see the practical application of it in a trade like building.

"National's policy is a hugely important one for young people who currently truant through the system in order to endure it.

"The Labour Government's policies see more than half of all Maori boys leaving school without the most basic qualification and running the risk of ending up as just another negative statistic - without even the basic reading and writing skills to start an apprenticeship.

"Bringing hands-on, practical skills back into the school curriculum will be a saviour for these students, and the trades training they complete will address the huge shortage of skilled workers that employers are crying out for.

"Maori, no matter what their politics, should be welcoming National's trades training policy with open arms."
