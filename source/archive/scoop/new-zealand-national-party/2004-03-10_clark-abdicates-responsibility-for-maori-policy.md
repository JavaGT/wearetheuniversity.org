Clark abdicates responsibility for Maori policy

Helen Clark abdicates responsibility for Maori policy

National Party Leader Don Brash says the next National Government would have to reconsider the terms of any inquiry launched by Labour into the state of New Zealand's race relations.

"From the way the Prime Minister is talking now, it seems inevitable she will try to bury this issue with an inquiry until after the next election.

"It's nothing but a stalling tactic from a desperate Government that's doing all it can to get the issue off the agenda.

"Helen Clark appears to be making up policy on the hoof now, suggesting that she would consider consulting the Opposition over the terms of reference for any such inquiry.

"After reflecting on that offer, I can only conclude that Helen Clark is cynically prepared to allow a royal commission to set her policy. National has a policy.

"Helen Clark should tell the public what she really thinks and let them decide - in a democracy that is called a general election.

"The people must be allowed to determine the future of race relations in New Zealand, not a few academics who have been hand picked by an ideologically driven Labour Government.

"Labour promised hundreds of inquiries while in Opposition and have launched scores more while in Government.

"Governments are elected to govern. Helen Clark should reflect on that," says Dr Brash.
