Future of social work programme must be assured

Future of social work programme must be assured

National’s Associate Welfare (CYF) spokeswoman, Anne Tolley, says the Government should mark National Social Workers’ Day by assuring that it won’t shut down Massey University’s degree programme in social work.

Mrs Tolley says she’s very concerned about reports that the university is considering closing its degree programme on social work at its Wellington campus.

“The loss of a university degree programme in this area would be a great loss for New Zealand,” she says.

“Social workers provide a vital service for families, and make an invaluable contribution to bettering the lives of at-risk children and young people.

“They are at the front-line of child protection and have responsibility for the country’s most vulnerable kids.

“Social workers have huge caseloads, and to support a quality service we must get more graduates on board.”

Mrs Tolley is welcoming celebrations around the country today in recognition of National Social Workers’ Day, and hopes the Government will use the opportunity to affirm its commitment to this special group of people.

“Back in 1996, Helen Clark told social workers ‘we want to give you the tools, the resources and the policies which will allow you to do your job’ (\*1).

‘Let’s see the Prime Minister put her money where her mouth is.”
