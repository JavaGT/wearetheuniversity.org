**Immigration policy supports economic growth**

Growing the economy and attracting the skilled migrants and investment capital New Zealand needs is the main focus of the National Party’s immigration policy, says Immigration Spokesman Jonathan Coleman.

Today's policy announcement builds on the immigration initiatives of the past three years which have been geared towards boosting economic growth.

"Our immigration policy will continue to attract migrants with the skills and capital to help grow the economy," Dr Coleman says.

"We are competing worldwide to recruit skilled and talented people and our aim is to ensure immigration policy is maximising the economic benefits for New Zealand.

"Attracting more investment into New Zealand through the business migration scheme is a key priority under National. The Government revamped the scheme in 2009 and to date it's attracted over $700 million in potential investment capital. We will continue to attract more business migrants who have the commercial nous and global networks to help Kiwi businesses.

"We have maintained New Zealand Residence Programme numbers and we also remain committed to accepting 750 refugees a year through the United Nations refugee programme."

Dr Coleman says immigration will continue its focus on supporting export education. Changes to student visas have strengthened the multi-billion dollar sector by allowing more people to study short-term courses.

Complementing the changes to policy over the past three years has been the turnaround in the performance of Immigration New Zealand (INZ).

"Three years ago INZ was in deep strife. Its processes needed an overhaul and performance had to improve. Now we have a department that has lifted its game to facilitate the entry of the skilled workers, foreign students, investors and tourists that our country needs," says Dr Coleman.
