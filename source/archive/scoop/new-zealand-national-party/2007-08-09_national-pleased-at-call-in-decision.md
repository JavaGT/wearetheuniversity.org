National pleased at call-in decision

It's pleasing that sense has prevailed and the Energy Minister has decided to call in the Waikato to Auckland electricity transmission line upgrade, says National Party Energy spokesman Gerry Brownlee.

"This decision alleviates the stress on the councils, which would have had to deal with the complex consent process.

"And the decision to have an independent Board of Inquiry still leaves room for individuals to express their views, while also recognising the crucial national interest of strengthening the grid."
