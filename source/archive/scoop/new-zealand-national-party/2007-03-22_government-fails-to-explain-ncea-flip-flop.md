Government fails to explain NCEA flip-flop

The Government has failed to explain why Education Minister Steve Maharey now looks keen on reporting failure on a student's NCEA record of learning when only a few months ago he was vehemently opposed to the concept, says National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

"We can only assume that Minister Maharey has had a Road to Damascus experience leading him to 'leaning toward' reporting 'not achieved' on a record of learning.

"It was only last September when he dismissed the idea out of hand, saying 'there is no place on such a list for the things that people have not yet attained or perhaps not even attempted'.

"Funnily enough this is not the top issue on the minds of those who have genuine concerns about NCEA not serving the needs of top students.

"The Minister is clearly trying to look as if he is doing something about NCEA, but it's nothing more than a cynical attempt to head-off major change.

"It is a tactical attempt to make a low-cost concession while ignoring all the major issues about NCEA's design.

"That's like trying to look sincere about fixing your neighbour's car by twiddling with the car radio when the real problems are with the engine."
