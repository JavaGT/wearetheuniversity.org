Why is Cullen protecting boy racers?

Why is Cullen protecting boy racers?

Despite widespread concern over the behaviour of boy racers, Michael Cullen continues to give a stay of execution to these louts, according to National Party MP Brian Connell.

"When I first sought leave of the House to debate this legislation as a matter of urgency, it was number 30 on the order paper.

"As a result of Dr Cullen's clear disinterest, it has now dropped to number 35," Mr Connell says.

"And it has been delayed to allow us to speed through such dazzling acts as the Radio New Zealand Amendment Bill," says Mr Connell.

"Perhaps Dr Cullen knows something the rest of the country doesn't, but I have not heard widespread community outrage over the activities of Radio New Zealand!

"Michael Cullen's displaying an arrogant disregard for the concerns of tens of thousands of New Zealanders who want to feel safe and secure, both in their houses and on the roads.

"He has totally misread the public pulse on this issue.

"I have had a deluge of public complaints from people who want this legislation passed as a matter of urgency," Mr Connell says.
