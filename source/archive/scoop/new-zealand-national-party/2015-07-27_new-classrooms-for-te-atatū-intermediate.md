**MP Alfred Ngaro**

**National List MP based in Te Atatu**

**New classrooms for Te Atatū Intermediate, Peninsula Primary School, and Henderson South School**

List MP Alfred Ngaro says more classrooms will help keep up with roll demand and population growth in our region, and replacement classrooms will provide improved, up-to-date infrastructure where needed.

“Te Atatū Intermediate (six) Peninsula Primary school (four) and Henderson South School (four) will have a total of 14 more classrooms and Henderson South School will have two replacement classrooms,” MP Alfred Ngaro said.

“The new classrooms will provide more modern learning spaces for more students. They will also provide more innovative and flexible teaching spaces, to support children to achieve in the classroom.”

Over the next 18 months, more than 230 new classrooms are on-track to be delivered across Auckland to help meet increasing rolls.

“Every year National has been in Government the education Budget has increased.

“From school property to our Investing in Educational Success initiative, we are focused on giving teachers and principals the tools and skills they need to create the best learning opportunities for all young New Zealanders,” Mr Ngaro said.
