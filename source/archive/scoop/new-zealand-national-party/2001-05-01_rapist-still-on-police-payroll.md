Rapist still on police payroll

The Police Commissioner has confirmed that police officer and convicted rapist Colin McLean will continue to be paid $1000 a week until his almost certain appeal is over, National's Police spokesman Tony Ryall said today.

"How many tens of thousands of dollars of scarce police funding will continue to be paid into this convicted rapist's bank account while his victim receives nothing?

"When asked in Parliament how much longer McLean will stay on the police payroll the Minister replied 'as long as it takes'.

"The police hierarchy have been expecting this conviction for at least 17 months. A swift dismissal following conviction on 3 April should have been planned. The hierarchy owe New Zealanders, and other police officers in particular, an explanation for this appalling situation.

"The chances of McLean receiving a PERF payment are nil. The Minister has missed the point. The Commissioner can dismiss McLean and he should have done so. Good faith bargaining doesn't apply to rapists," Mr Ryall said.
