**High quality health services a priority for National**

New Zealanders are receiving better, sooner, more convenient healthcare as a result of National’s strong economic and fiscal management, and a re-elected National Government will continue to make health a priority.

During a visit to CentralMed Health in Tauranga today, Health Spokesman Tony Ryall said National’s health policies reinforce the Party’s commitment to providing New Zealanders with high quality public health services.

“Good health is hugely important to New Zealand families. A strong public health service gives families peace of mind – knowing that the care they need will be there, when they need it,” says Mr Ryall.

“One of the benefits of building a strong economy is that the Government is able to invest in maintaining and improving our public services including the health sector.

“Even during tight financial times which have seen many countries freeze or reduce their health services, National has protected and grown our health service with average increases of around $500 million a year.

“We’ve focused on areas that really matter to New Zealand families and we’re making real progress – thousands more people are getting hip, knee and other elective operations, cancer patients are receiving their treatment sooner and people are being seen in emergency departments faster than ever before.

“Health services all over the world face the challenge of a growing and ageing population. Our plan is about better preparing our health system for these challenges.

“National is investing strongly in primary care, screening, early intervention and disease prevention to keep New Zealanders healthy. And we’re supporting people with long-term conditions to live independently in the community.

“New Zealanders want a health service that delivers results, not endless strategies and reviews which Labour is promising.”
