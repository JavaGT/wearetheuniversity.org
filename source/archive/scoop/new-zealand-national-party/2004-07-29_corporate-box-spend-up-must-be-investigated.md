Corporate box spend-up must be investigated

The Corrections Minister must order a full investigation into a corporate box spend-up by Tainui on staff from his department, says Dr Paul Hutchison, MP for Port Waikato.

In Parliament today, Dr Hutchison tabled invoices relating to the use of a corporate box at Westpac Stadium in Wellington by Tainui to entertain Corrections staff.

"I have already requested that the Auditor-General investigate the long litany of irregularities over consultation for Springhill Prison.

"Great doubt is now cast on the integrity of the department's dealings, and it is vital that they are thoroughly investigated by an independent agency, such as the Auditor-General.

"Taxpayers do not appreciate the possibility that public money used for prison consultation was spent by providers after they had received 'soft' contracts," says Dr Hutchison.

"It is also important for the integrity of the Waikato Raupatu Lands Trust that an independent agency investigate their dealings.

"I view it as vital that Tainui are able to go forward without the innuendos that have enshrouded them over this consultation. There are dedicated individuals whose names need clearing," says Dr Hutchison.
