Ōhāriu companies contributing to rapidly growing hi-tech sector

National List MP based in Ōhāriu Brett Hudson is congratulating two Ōhāriu companies listed in the annual TIN 100 report on the performance of New Zealand’s top hi-tech companies.

TIN top 100 company 4RF and TIN Next 100 company Magritek were both included in the report of New Zealand’s 200 leading hi-tech companies. TIN 200 companies have grown by 12 per cent in the past year, bringing in combined annual revenues of $9.4 billion.

“The TIN 100 report shows Wellington is the fastest growing region with a revenue growth of 15.3 per cent. I’m pleased to see Ōhāriu businesses contributing to this growth,” says Mr Hudson.

Ngauranga-based 4RF is a global company specialising in the design and manufacture of digital microwave radios. They were founded in 1998 by radio experts with years of experience in the telecommunications and microwave radio industry.

Newlands-based Magritek is an advanced technology company specialising in nuclear magnetic resonance technology. They export to customers all over the world and utilise technology and IP developed by research teams at Victoria University, Massey University and overseas institutions.

“It’s great to see Ōhāriu companies contributing to an impressive story of innovation, growth and exporting success in both Wellington and New Zealand,” says Mr Hudson.
