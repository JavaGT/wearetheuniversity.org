National's policy taskforce provokes debate

Taskforces launched by the National Party after the last election are provoking lively debate on some major policy issues, Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley said today.

"After our General Election defeat the President John Slater and I established three major policy taskforces - Seniors and Superannuation, Constitutional Issues, and Tertiary and Youth Policy.

The discussion documents on the first two topics can be viewed at www.national.org.nz.

"They were invited to explore, research and then recommend issues of interest to National and of importance to New Zealand for discussion.

"The taskforce on Constitutional Issues is currently being discussed by the party.

"Some of these issues are sensitive and challenging:- the future of the Monarchy in New Zealand, our electoral system and the future of Maori seats.

"They are also issues on the minds of many New Zealanders. National has always been willing to explore and lead on complex issues. Today is no exception, " Mrs Shipley said.

"The taskforce report is not policy. We are delighted that it will form the basis for discussion from which policy may emerge," Mrs Shipley and Mr Slater said.

"Members have been invited to endorse, amend, or reject the recommendations.

"We look forward to these issues being debated at our conferences, the first of which begins in Rotorua on April 27," they said.
