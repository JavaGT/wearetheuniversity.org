Education crisis must be sorted

New Zealand is facing an educational crisis with the victims being over a quarter of a million young people, says National Party Leader Bill English.

"As a parent I am angry and as political leader I am angry that no leadership has been shown at any stage to try and sort out the teachers industrial action.

"Helen Clark and Trevor Mallard created high expectations among teachers during the last election campaign. Students are being used as pawns while Labour fails to make any headway at all.

"As a young person you only get one chance and I am not surprised that students are now taking the situation into their own hands as their frustration must be enormous.

"The scenes of protesting students at schools nationwide is unprecedented and no wonder they feel let down. Clark and Trevor Mallard have dithered far too long.

"Labour clearly don't feel the alarm parents feel at the television scenes of students walking out of classrooms.

"Whatever Trevor Mallard thinks he wants to do to the PPTA, I say Labour should put the students first," says Mr English.
