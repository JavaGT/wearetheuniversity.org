Judith Collins

National Families Spokesperson

12th February 2004

Honesty needed on child welfare issues

Steve Maharey's latest academic speech on child welfare does nothing to accept or address the causes of child poverty and neglect, says National's Families spokesperson Judith Collins.

"The number one cause of child poverty in New Zealand is family break-up. Nowhere in his speech to the Commissioner for Children's Symposium does Mr Maharey acknowledge this.

"Instead the Minister waffles on about 'frameworks', 'nexus', 'blueprints', and expanding various bureaucracies. More and more money spent on reports is not going to help one single child though.

"New Zealand is not going to make any progress on child welfare issues if we are not honest enough to cut through political correctness. Steve Maharey is completely out of touch if he thinks that selective use of statistics can cover up these problems.

"Children need mothers and fathers. They need stability, love, education, discipline and health. The Minister seems unable to grasp these simple facts," said Ms Collins.
