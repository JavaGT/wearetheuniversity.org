Watch out for union-friendly 'experts'

National Industrial Relations spokesman 14 September 2004

Watch out for union-friendly 'experts'

National Party Industrial Relations spokesman Wayne Mapp is urging the media to check the credentials of their so-called 'experts' when they report on controversial employment law changes.

Dr Mapp is commenting in light of statements by Victoria University Associate Professor Gordon Anderson, who has accused the National Party of getting it wrong on the detail of union-friendly changes contained in the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill.

"In fact, it is the associate professor who has got it wrong," Dr Mapp says.

"He should read carefully clause 19 of the Bill inserting section 59A (1A) and (2), as reported back by the select committee. He obviously read the Bill before the amendments were made.

"It is now a breach of good faith if an employer agrees to terms which are the same as those reached in bargaining for a collective agreement, and which have the 'effect' of undermining the collective bargaining. 'Intention' is not necessary in this situation.

"It should be noted that in 2003, Associate Professor Anderson provided a substantial amount of advice to the Council of Trade Unions - in fact, guided their policy development for their submission to the ERA review - which resulted in them winning considerable concessions in this legislation.

"One could ask, then, whether it is surprising, given the union movement's declaration of war on National, that Associate Professor Anderson might hold those views.

"I'd urge reporters to be very careful about checking the credentials of so-called independent experts," says Dr Mapp.
