Action on illiteracy long overdue

  
Labour’s announcement of $9.7 million to fund a national assessment of adult literacy, numeracy and language is an admission National was right to criticise the failings of the education system under this Government, says National’s Tertiary Education spokesman, Paul Hutchison.

“More than 50% of young Maori students are leaving school without having achieved level 1 NCEA and it’s no wonder that polytechnics, ITOs and PTEs claim there is a pressing need for extra tuition in literacy, numeracy and language.

“Why has it taken so long to put this assessment tool in place when tertiary providers have long been saying there is such a big and continuing problem with adult literacy?

“It’s ironic that Michael Cullen is saying ‘supporting the development of adult literacy, numeracy and language skills are a priority for our Government’, when, after eight years of Labour, young people are still leaving school without basic skills.

“These are the people who have been struggling in the workforce, desperate for help. They would be right in feeling resentful that it has taken Labour eight years to deliver.”
