**Bishop congratulates local civil defence award winner**

Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley has congratulated Lower Hutt resident Professor David Johnston for receiving a silver Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) award last night in Wellington.

“I am delighted Professor Johnston has been recognised for his outstanding services to emergency management,” says Mr Bishop.

“David has made a significant contribution to emergency management over the past quarter of a century. He is consistently an outstanding contributor to our community and I am glad he has been awarded with this recognition.

“In a field which is increasingly relevant to our region, David was a key contributor to the third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in 2015 in Japan, and the follow-up New Zealand Symposium held in Wellington last year.”

The event saw three recipients from around New Zealand presented with a silver CDEM award.

“Along with the other recipients, Professor Johnston has served his country with superb skills and knowledge, and a genuine dedication to protect people’s lives and livelihoods,” says Mr Bishop.

“Emergency management is a cornerstone of New Zealand’s resilience to natural disasters. Last evening’s winners are a reflection of New Zealand’s strong community spirit, and the commitment and relationships that enable individuals across science, research and emergency management to work together to make a difference.”
