Minister unaware operations being cancelled

The Minister of Health has totally lost control of her portfolio when she doesn't know that district health boards are cutting surgical services as she told Parliament today, says National Health Spokesperson Dr Lynda Scott.

"Services are being rationed at many boards but there has never been any public debate about this. Cutting hernia and other operations was nowhere in Labour's manifesto, yet we are seeing this happening at several district health boards because they can't afford to provide the services.

"The Minister obviously doesn't know this is happening and even went as far as denying that operations are being cancelled it in Parliament today.

"The Waikato, Lakes and Northland District Health Boards have confirmed to us in written letters that they have stopped doing operations for hernias and other conditions.

"In the Waikato one man can't take a full-time job because he cannot get a hernia operation. This is unfair and leaves this man 'disabled' when he would be out in the workforce if we had a decent health system.

"It is appalling that the Minister will deny that these simple operations are not being performed, when frustrated patients are having their lives and livelihoods disrupted, and GPs are left at a loss on how to help their patients," Dr Scott said.
