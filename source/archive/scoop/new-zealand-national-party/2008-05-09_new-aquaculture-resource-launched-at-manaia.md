New aquaculture resource launched at Manaia

  
Māori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia launched a new aquaculture teaching resource for total immersion Māori schools with Coromandel’s Manaia School today..

The fact-sheet series Te Ahumoana Ā-mahi or Aquaculture in Action offer students an opportunity to learn more about aquaculture, in particular marine farming, in New Zealand. The lesson plans were developed for Years 7 and 8. The plans were created to assist teachers in helping students investigate and learn about aquaculture, as well as its impact on our economy and our environment.

“These fact-sheets introduce aquaculture to our tamariki and helps them to build an understanding of its role and impacts in the community, environment and economy”, Minister Horomia says. “They will learn about science and technology in their own home-setting”.

“Māori are already extensively involved in the aquaculture industry through successful Māori-owned companies, such as those in the Marlborough Sounds and the Coromandel region”.

“The participation of Māori in aquaculture figures prominently in both the industry and the government strategies for aquaculture development Iwi involvement will be critical in achieving the government vision of a $1 billion industry by 2025
