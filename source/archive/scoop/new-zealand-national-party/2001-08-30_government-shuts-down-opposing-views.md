Government shuts down opposing views

Labour MP David Benson-Pope has just scored an own goal in the House this afternoon, National's Defence spokesperson Max Bradford said today.

"His attempt to weave a web of intrigue between the Centre for Strategic Studies and the National Party is as ridiculous as it is unreal.

"In the process of trying to do this Mr Benson-Pope has simply proven that the Labour Party has a direct link to the Army campaign to destroy any academic institution that dares to challenge its view.

"The Government is in fact destroying the Centre for Strategic Studies by withdrawing funding. Because of this, the centre will have to close by the end of the year.

"The infamous Colonel Gordon papers stated in paragraph 13c that any view from academic institutions that did not reflect the army viewpoint should be publicly challenged.

"Dr Dickens, quite properly, has offered his advice to any organisation wishing to hear his views and it is acknowledged that he is a respected academic in international circles.

"But the real own goal for Mr Benson-Pope is that in an act of vindictive crushing of academic study that is not acceptable to the Labour Government as well as the Army, the Clark Government has withdrawn all funding from the Centre for Strategic Studies.

"On the other hand, the Army-funded Military Studies Institute at Massey continues to receive funding from the Army through the Defence Force," Mr Bradford said.
