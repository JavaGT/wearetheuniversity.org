No assessment on in-house DOC course
====================================

No assessment on in-house DOC course

National’s Conservation spokesman Simon Power is questioning the value of the Department of Conservation spending more than $600,000 on a five day marae-based course for employees that has no assessment.

That cost does not include the time of DOC employees who teach the course.

“It is not acceptable that so much taxpayer money is being spent on a five day marae-based course without any clear evidence that it is improving employee performance. "

The Te Pukenga Atawhai training programme aims to teach participants about Maori values, the Treaty of Waitangi, Maori systems and structures, and how to interact and communicate with Maori. It has been attended by almost all DOC staff.

Mr Power says taxpayers cannot currently be assured that the money is going to good use.

“Providing Maori education courses is not one of DOC's core services.

“DOC should focus its resources on its key function of managing and conserving natural and historic resources."
