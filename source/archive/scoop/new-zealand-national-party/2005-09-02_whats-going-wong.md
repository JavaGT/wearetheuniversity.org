What's Going wONg?

What’s really going on?

The public’s reaction to our tax cut package has been overwhelming. National’s tax calculator website has had over two million hits and opinion polls are showing that New Zealanders are sick and tired of Labour’s high taxation - they want their hard earned money to be put back in their pocket instead of the Government’s.

Under National, 85% of New Zealanders will be taxed at only 19% - this change will put hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars back in your wallet each year. Labour’s tax relief for families will only help a small percentage of taxpayers, whereas under National everyone will get a break.

Labour is obviously running scared in light of our policy, with recent appearances from Cullen showing him to be stressed and left, quite often, red in the face.

He isn’t the only Minister from Clark’s Government to be showing the strain. Last week Police Minister George Hawkins heralded statistics that show the lowest crime rate the country has had in 25 years. However a few days ago, frontline police made comments in the NZ Herald that even they don’t believe those statistics.

Here in Auckland City it was reported that crime had dropped by 11.56%, yet police officers from the region have said that criminals have admitted to carrying out crimes that had not been reported. In the NZ Herald, Police also said that in Hawkins’ own electorate, Manurewa (which is a high crime area), residents aren’t reporting crime because they aren’t insured. Even a couple of police officers admitted that they hadn’t reported that their cars had been broken into.

It has been interesting to note that apart from Hawkins’ press release on the crime stats, he has been silent in recent weeks when it comes to the Police - Justice Minister Phil Goff has been fronting for him at meetings. Clark’s obviously lost faith in a Minister who can’t control his portfolio and has sat back and watched the tragic 111-call situation unfold. It remains to be seen if his constituents still have faith in him.

Clark has also trodden on employers yet again this week with her indication that if re-elected, they may put meal breaks for workers into law. As National’s Employment spokesman, Wayne Mapp, has said, this is the ‘sort of heavy-handed, Helen- knows-best approach that you would expect out of Labour’.

New Zealand is a nation of small businesses, and since Labour has been in office they have had to deal with more compliance costs, more paperwork and the Employment Relations Amendment Act that encourages union militancy. Labour seems to think that it’s a privilege for businesses to operate and that employers can’t be trusted to treat their staff well.

National’s vision for New Zealand doesn’t include these archaic laws and attitudes.

Advance voting

I have fielded many enquiries as to how people can vote if they are going to overseas on polling day. There is a full list of places where you can vote before going overseas on www.elections.org.nz.

If you are overseas, or have children overseas, information on how to vote is also available on www.elections.org.nz. There are a number of options that are open to voters.
