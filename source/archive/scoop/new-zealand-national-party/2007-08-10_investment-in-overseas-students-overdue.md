Investment in overseas students overdue

Labour's announcement that it is finally ready to deal with the dramatic decline in the number of overseas students wanting to study in this country is long overdue, says National's Associate Education spokeswoman, Pansy Wong.

"Labour appears to have had a road to Damascus experience after running down international education over the past eight years.

"In 2004 there were 112,675 foreign fee-paying students, which slumped to 98,266 by 2005. A more than 10% drop in a single year cannot be ignored.

"What was a growing and lucrative foreign currency earner for New Zealand has suffered at the hands of Labour's inconsistent immigration and international education policies.

"For an industry that was touted as the 5th biggest export earner in New Zealand, worth 1.8 billion dollars, the $10 million announced today is a belated apology for getting it so wrong over the past eight years."
