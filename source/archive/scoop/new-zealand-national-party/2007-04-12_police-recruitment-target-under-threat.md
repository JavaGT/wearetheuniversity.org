Police recruitment target under threat

Police recruitment target under threat

The Labour-NZ First deal to increase the number of sworn police by 1,000 appears to be falling short in its first year, according to National’s Police spokesman, Chester Borrows.

Documents obtained by Mr Borrows reveal that the Police estimated they would need 732 recruits to graduate in 2006/07 to replace attrition and achieve a net increase of 326 for the year.

“However, these recruits needed to have started training by 19 February to graduate before the end of June, and there are only 684 who have either graduated already (480) or are in training (204).”

“That leaves the Police at least 48 short of their target, and those are 48 police officers who could make a real difference to some communities.

Documents also reveal that the Police expected to convince 50 former officers to rejoin during 2006/07, but by last month only 17 had been recruited.

“National is in favour of putting more police on the beat, but we have consistently questioned whether the gimmick of 1,000 extra cops was sustainable.

“Labour over-reached themselves in their rush to tie in NZ First and retain power at any cost, and now they are struggling to deliver on their promises.

“They never intended the 1,000 to be made up of all sworn staff until National called them on it late in 2005 and they had to hold crisis meetings with NZ First.

“After all, it was Helen Clark who said before the last election “Some political parties are promising thousands of new police. Such promises are simply not credible'. "
