School Cert and Bursary used to scale NCEA results

School Cert and Bursary used to scale NCEA results

Education Minister Steve Maharey has admitted that old School Certificate and Bursary results have been used to scale this year’s NCEA marks, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

"Education authorities have for years criticised School Certificate and Bursary as out of date and unfair,” says Mr English.

“Yet, in answers to Parliamentary questions the Minister of Education has revealed that old School Certificate and Bursary results have been used to scale this year’s NCEA marks.

“The answers showed that the old School Certificate and Bursary marks were used alongside analysis of past NCEA results and consultation with markers.

"This is the clearest indication yet that Labour are backtracking to the old scaling system.

“It is also a promising indication that Steve Maharey and the extremists in the education bureaucracy are losing the battle over NCEA.

“National will keep fighting to preserve standards and to make sure students get the benefit of fair and consistent assessment,” says Mr English.
