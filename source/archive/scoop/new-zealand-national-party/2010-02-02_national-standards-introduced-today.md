Media Statement  
National Standards introduced today

Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, MP for Maungakiekie, welcomed the introduction of National Standards this week, as primary and intermediate schools return after the summer break.

“This is a very exciting year for education. Our National Standards policy is a groundbreaking initiative, and a critical part of the Government’s plan to lift education standards across the country,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“National Standards will help the one in five students currently leaving school without the basic skills they need.”

From this year, primary and intermediate schools will report to parents twice a year in plain language on their child’s progress in reading, writing and maths.

“I’m delighted that for the first time, parents in Maungakiekie will get the information they want and deserve about their children’s progress.

“Children who are slipping behind will be identified, so teachers and parents can help them improve before it’s too late,” he says.

The Government is spending $36 million over four years to support schools which have identified students who need more support. There will also be $26 million to provide training and support for teachers, principals and boards of trustees to help with the implementation of National Standards.

“National Standards will be independently monitored and evaluated over the next three years to make sure we get it right,” Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga says.

“The National-led Government will continue to work hard this year alongside schools, parents and communities to make sure our children get the quality education they deserve.”
