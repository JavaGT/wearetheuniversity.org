Campaign Starts Before 'Broken Hearts Day'
==========================================

22 July 2001

National MP Tony Ryall says the Government's $300,000 campaign to inform New Zealanders about the implications of the Property (Relationships) Amendment Act is completely inadequate.

Radio New Zealand reported that a $300,000 advertising campaign for the new legislation starts today.

"The Labour Government spent over $1.2 million on publicity for the Employment Relations Act.

"The Property (Relationships) Act affects 236,000 New Zealanders in de facto relationships and hundreds of thousands in marriages and the Government is spending miles less than on the ERA.

"Part of the legislation comes into effect in less than two weeks, on 1 August, when people can start contracting out. The full impact of the legislation comes into force on 1 February 2002. A $300,000 campaign starting today is pathetic.

"The Government is abdicating its responsibility to inform public about this legislation. Originally only $60,000 had been budgeted and the extra money only came out because of National's criticism.

"The Government is running a half-hearted campaign because it didn't want to do it in the first place.

"31 January 2002 will be 'broken hearts day' when couples all over New Zealand end their relationships to avoid being caught by the new legislation," Mr Ryall said.
