**Local scholarship award winners recognised at Parliament**

The 2014 New Zealand Scholarship Awards have just been presented and Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga was excited to be there as top students were recognised and celebrated for their achievements.

“I am thrilled to see students Jonathan Hart and Rahul Sod from Auckland Grammar School gain the honour of being named two of only 10 Premier Scholars with honours in a number of subject areas between them,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.

“This is out of almost 8000 students who participated in New Zealand Scholarship exams last year.

“As an Auckland Grammar Old Boy I was particularly proud to see these boys honoured for their outstanding academic achievements. All the award winners should feel extremely proud of what they have achieved. A scholarship is wonderful recognition of hard work.

“These scholarships will provide financial support to students over the next three years to continue studying at a higher level. It means there will be no financial barrier which could stop these talented students from going on to achieve even more success.

“I believe education is the best base for success in the working world and I am glad to be here among so many students who already recognise the value of their education and who are working hard for it.

“National believes ensuring every child gets a good education is one of the most important things we can do to raise living standards, and build a more competitive and productive economy,” Mr Lotu-Iiga says.
