More needed than Govt panic over ERB

The Government needs more than a fit of panic to sort out the problems in the Employment Relations Bill, Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.

"For the past two months Government MPs have been told the Bill is unworkable, costly and too academic, but have refused to listen.

"It's hard to take seriously that they've had a sudden change of heart.

"In the past few days all we have had is the Government scurrying around trying to allay fears.

"There are no clear signs there will be meaningful change. In fact all we have is the Minister of Labour saying she will clarify the intentions in the Bill.

"If the Government wants to show it's serious about listening to the public's view of the Employment Relations Bill is must heed Jenny Shipley's call to go back to the drawing board completely."
