Minister should listen to NCEA concerns

National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich is concerned about NCEA's ability to motivate and extend the country's top academic students.

According to media reports New Zealand's third largest secondary school, Avondale College, is the latest school to consider introducing the Cambridge exam system.

"The number of schools that have now opted for Cambridge or IB is a clear indication that the current system is not working well enough," says Mrs Rich.

"When mid-decile schools are saying that they've given up waiting for positive change to NCEA and are seriously considering alternatives, the Minister should finally admit that he has a problem on his hands.

"Thinking that this problem will go away isn't going to work.

"The Labour Government has ignored previous concerns thinking that alternative exams would be only offered by a handful of independent or high-decile schools.

"If the Minister continues to ignore ongoing concerns about NCEA then more schools will opt for alternative exams and the long term health of NCEA will be further undermined."

Mrs Rich is meeting with a group of Auckland principals today specifically to discuss the issue.

"The Minister needs to admit that changes have to be made so the needs of our top students better served."
