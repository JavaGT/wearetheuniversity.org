Labour has botched school property
==================================

Anne Tolley MP  
National Party Education Spokeswoman

3 November 2008

Labour has botched school property

"Chris Carter should get out and visit more schools," says National Party Education spokeswoman Anne Tolley in response to the Minister's ridiculous defence of Labour's failure to upgrade school property.

"Mr Carter can't have been to many schools if he thinks Labour's school property programme is adequate. There are parents and teachers up and down New Zealand who will disagree with him."

Mrs Tolley is commenting on Chris Carter's claim that the half-a-billion-dollar school property boost announced by John Key is 'me too' and unnecessary.

"Shame on you Mr Carter. You know you're misleading New Zealanders."

Mrs Tolley says Upper Hutt, where the National Party Leader made the commitment to school property, is a good example of Labour's failure.

"For years Labour has promised these schools more money for structural issues - yet they've been fighting with the Ministry and have got nothing for this.

"That's why Upper Hutt College and Fergusson Intermediate have felt the need to write to the Minister directly in the past week pleading for more money."

Mrs Tolley would welcome any Labour policy for education, but unfortunately apart from the odd ad hoc announcement, the party's policy web page says: 'Labour's detailed policy for the next parliamentary term and beyond will be released closer to the election'.

"Mr Carter had better get a wriggle on.

"The opening of the books revealed Labour hasn't made the funding commitments needed to keep up with future school property needs, with a funding hole of at least $429 million over the next three years.

"If Labour's now saying they have budgeted for the shortfall, Mr Carter should explain where the money is coming from, along with the funding for Labour's 30 or so other promises made since the PREFU."
