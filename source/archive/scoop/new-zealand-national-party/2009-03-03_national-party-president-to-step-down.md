National Party President to Step Down

  
National Party President Judy Kirk has today confirmed she will step down from the position of President at the National Party’s Annual Conference in August.

“The Party is in great shape and well positioned for the future,” says Mrs Kirk.

“When I was elected President in 2002 the Party was facing very challenging times. But with the success at the 2008 General Election, I feel I have met all of my objectives in the role and that it is an appropriate time for me to step aside.

“I am very proud of my time as President and all that the Party has achieved over the last seven years, culminating in the election of the John Key National-led Government last November. I am absolutely confident that our Prime Minister and his cabinet will do a tremendous job for New Zealand.

“The many changes we made to the Party’s organisational structure in 2003 have positioned the Party well for ongoing electoral success in the current MMP environment.

“I am pleased to have been able to substantially grow the membership base again and particularly proud to have introduced the Candidates’ College. This has produced some very high calibre MPs, especially the 2005 and 2008 intake of new MPs. They are set to make a substantial contribution to New Zealand society for years to come.

“I acknowledge the unwavering support and encouragement from our Prime Minister John Key, former leaders Dr Don Brash and Hon Bill English, and all members of the National Party Caucus over my time as President.

“It has been a privilege to be President of the National Party. I would like to thank the Board, former Board members and all Party members for their support and their tireless hard work for the National Party.”
