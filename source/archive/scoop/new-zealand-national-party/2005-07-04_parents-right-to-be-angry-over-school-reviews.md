Parents right to be angry over school reviews

Parents right to be angry over school reviews

National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the people of Invercargill and Timaru have every right to be angry about a new report on school reviews.

The report published by the New Zealand School Trustees Association shows large-scale school mergers could affect children's education for up to four years.

"Both cities had their schools turned upside down by large-scale savage school closures. Parents were always suspicious that the changes would badly affect their children's education. The report proves they were right," says Mr English.

"The official line is that everything is hunky dory, and that was repeated by Ministry of Education officials today.

"But this report lifts the lid on what is really going on.

"Trevor Mallard and the Labour Party should answer to parents for this, not hide behind civil servants who care even less about families in Invercargill and Timaru than Labour does.

"Labour's school reviews reward good schools by closing them down and disrupting large numbers of students.

"National wants standards, choice and excellence in education, and Labour-style school reviews get in the way of those things," says Mr English.
