Australian jobs fairs to recruit skilled Kiwis for NZ

A re-elected National Government will set up job fairs for New Zealand employers in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, to recruit skilled Kiwis to contribute to New Zealand’s economic growth.

National’s Economic Development Spokesman, Steven Joyce, and Immigration Spokesman Michael Woodhouse, say there is now a real need to boost the supply of skilled workers in many areas of the New Zealand economy, and Kiwis returning from Australia will form part of the answer.

“These areas include the construction trades, engineering, manufacturing and ICT,” Mr Joyce says. "More people are needed, not only for the Canterbury rebuild, but also around the country.

“In Auckland there’s a big lift in construction, and there has been recent strong growth around the country in the manufacturing and ICT industries.

“Employers are telling us they are keen to participate in a concerted recruitment drive for skilled staff down the eastern seaboard of Australia, to complement our skills training efforts here in New Zealand,” Mr Joyce says.

"In 2008 we promised to reverse the flood of New Zealanders leaving, and we’ve done that. Net migration from New Zealand to Australia has been virtually zero over the last four months, as fewer Kiwis leave, and more return home.

“With a lower unemployment rate than Australia and a higher employment rate, now is the time to show more expat Kiwis some of the great opportunities there are here in New Zealand, and recruit some into our growing companies back home," Mr Joyce says.

Mr Woodhouse says National's wider immigration policy will continue to ensure that immigration supports our economy, helps create jobs and contributes to higher wages for New Zealanders.

As well as quickly setting up the new Australian Job Fairs, National will:

• Promote immigration policies that support economic growth and jobs.

• Move visa applications online through the Immigration Online service.

• Establish a joint trans-Tasman visitor visa for next year's Cricket World Cup.

• Keep reducing over-stayer numbers and combat people smuggling.

• Continue to improve outcomes for refugees.

“Immigration helps to build a stronger economy and create jobs by encouraging innovation, deepening our links with international markets and providing the skills and capital we need for growth,” says Mr Woodhouse.

“Good immigration policy underpins our tourism, export education, horticulture and viticulture sectors, as well as supplying the skills needed to rebuild Canterbury.

“National will continue to promote sensible immigration policies that support economic growth and job opportunities for all New Zealanders,” Mr Woodhouse says.
