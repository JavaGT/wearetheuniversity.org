Project Protector – taking on water

Delays to the Navy’s new multi role vessel may be acceptable to the Labour Government, but who’s going to pay to fix it, asks National’s Defence spokesman, Wayne Mapp.

Canterbury, one of seven new ships to be built under Project Protector, is now over five months behind schedule.

“The ship arrived in Melbourne in September last year for what was to have been the final fit out before delivery, which was originally scheduled for December 06,” says Dr Mapp.

According to media reports the ship will now sail to Indonesia to undergo dry dock repairs.

TV3 reported that the ship’s rudder had been malfunctioning and that it also had cracks in the bow door.

“Just a day after National warned the cost of the project would soon be escalating, media reports estimate repairs to the ship could run into tens of millions of dollars,” says Dr Mapp.

“The Defence Minister has been quick to say the delays don’t matter, but has kept quiet on who will end up footing the bill.

“Is this a case of Kiwi taxpayers having to pick up the tab for another Defence budget blowout?

“$500 million has been set aside for this project.  How much more will we sink into it?

“Mr Goff also needs to come clean on references by the Premier of Victoria to an ‘accident to one of the ships’.

“The Minister must also fess up on what’s delaying Project Protector’s other six vessels.  Can we expect them to be sitting in an Indonesian dry dock next?”
