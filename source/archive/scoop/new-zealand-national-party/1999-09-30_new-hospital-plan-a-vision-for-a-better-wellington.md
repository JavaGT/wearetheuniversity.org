New Hospital Plan a Vision for a better Wellington
==================================================

**Thursday, 30 September 1999, 3:38 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

“The decision to place the tertiary hospital at the Newtown site with secondary hospitals at the Hutt and Kenepuru gives Wellington people a clear vision of the future for Wellington” said National MP Annabel Young today.

“There is a great affection for the Newtown site but the decision today is based on sound logic and not just emotion. We need to ensure that Wellingtonians have good access to medical services. We also need to ensure that the hospitals deliver safe and effective treatment. The spread of secondary hospital services will also ensure that we have viable access to hospitals if there is a disaster such as an earthquake.”
