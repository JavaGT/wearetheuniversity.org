Maurice Williamson National Tertiary Education Spokesperson

What's gone wrong with TEAC?

The sudden, immediate resignation of Tertiary Education Advisory Commission Chair Norman Kingsbury raises more questions than Steve Maharey's statement answers, National's Tertiary Education spokesperson Maurice Williamson said today.

"Dr Kingsbury was only appointed in April. How can things be in 'good order' after a term of about eight months? How exactly is Dr Kingsbury's resignation timely? If he was not intending to stick with the job for very long why was he appointed in the first place? What were the terms of his departure?

"Little progress has been evident since the Commission was established in April. Is Dr Kingsbury's resignation symptomatic of a resourcing issue? Did the Associate Minister ever have any intention of TEAC being an effective body or did he just not like the advice he was given?

"Was there agreement amongst members about the direction the Commission wanted to take or were there irreconcilable differences in views?

"Mr Maharey needs to front up and tell New Zealanders what's gone wrong with TEAC.

"Hopefully whatever was behind the resignation of Dr Kingsbury after only eight months in the job will be addressed by Mr Maharey before a new Chair is appointed," Mr Williamson said.
