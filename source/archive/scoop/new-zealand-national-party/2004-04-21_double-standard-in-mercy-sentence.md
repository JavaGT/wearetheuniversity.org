Double standard in mercy sentence

National Party Family spokeswoman Judith Collins says the 'mercy' shown to a Pakistani sex offender contrasts starkly with the treatment meted out to a young Sri Lankan girl - who's deportation case sparked national outrage.

"Why should this Pakistani student escape a criminal conviction because of the consequences he might face in his home country - when the Sri Lankan girl received no such consideration.

"The court has said that one reason behind the ruling was that the student may be 'ostracised by his family' on his return to Pakistan.

"Compare that with the treatment of the young Sri Lankan girl. Ahead of her deportation reports suggested she too was at risk of being shunned by her family.

"New Zealand must be careful to treat these cases with consistency and compassion where appropriate," says Ms Collins.
