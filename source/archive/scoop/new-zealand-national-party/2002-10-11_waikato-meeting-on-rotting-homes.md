National MPs are holding a public meeting on the rotting homes crisis in Hamilton this Sunday.

National MP Lindsay Tisch said Waikato people had been contacting National’s website and others had contacted MPs’ with concerns over rotting homes and worries about their loss of equity.

“Leaky buildings are a big problem in the Waikato, with much development in Hamilton in particular in recent years. Many people, from young couples starting out to retiring people, are heartbroken at what they’ve discovered about their home.

“Those affected need to get together and have input into the best way to deal with these problems and how to prevent this continuing to happen,” Mr Tisch said. Hundreds of people have turned out to four other public meetings staged by National around the country in recent weeks.

National sought for the second time this week an amendment to the Construction Contracts Bill, so that a Weathertightness Tribunal could be established to identify liability for homeowners. The Government did not support the proposal.

National Housing spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp said it was also important that the Building Code be changed to prevent leaky homes syndrome in the future.

“National has proposed straight forward solutions to this problem and we are determined to find the answers for current people affected and others building in the future,” he said.

Sunday’s meeting is at 2pm at the Celebrating Age Centre, 30 Victoria Street, Hamilton.
