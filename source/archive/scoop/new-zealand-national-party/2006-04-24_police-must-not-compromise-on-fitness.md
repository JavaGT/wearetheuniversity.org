Police must not compromise on fitness

National Party Law & Order spokesman Simon Power says the Police must not compromise on the quality of recruits just so it can fill the Government’s recruiting quota.

He is commenting on a report that the Police are considering lowering the pre-entry fitness standards of recruits.

“There is no way we should be lowering our standards. Only the best will do.

“New Zealand is renowned for having one of the best police forces in the world, and one of the toughest physical standards, and we must not change that.

“The public expects that the 1,000 extra police promised by this Government will be of the same fitness and standard as present police.

“There must be no compromise on quality.

“The Government needs to consider its own role in the recruitment process considering reports today that for every 100 people who call the 0800 recruitment line only one makes it to Police College,” says Mr Power.
