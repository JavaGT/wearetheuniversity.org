Collins Comments – December

Doesn’t time fly when you’re busy? Recently the Government marked its first year in office, and what a year it’s been.

Before the election we promised to be a Government that got things done. We’ve lived up to that promise across all portfolios, but particularly law and order.

Over the past year we have gone under the bonnet of the justice system to ensure the Police are better able to tackle crime, and that the justice system service the victims of crime, not the criminals.

We funded an extra **300 Police in Counties-Manukau** by the end of 2010, of which 165 are already at the front lines.

We gave Police new crime fighting tools, such as **tasers**, and introduced 11 new pieces of legislation giving Police greater powers to tackle New Zealand’s most hardened criminals.

We also passed law that will allow the vehicles of the worst **repeat illegal street racers** to be seized and destroyed.

A lot has been happening locally, too.

On 1 July Police started a **Youth Action Team** in Counties-Manukau south to target the worst offenders and steer them away from a life of crime.

The **Cops in Schools** programme was also extended to Rosehill College and Papakura High School and continues to build respect for the law by having a visible Police presence in the school grounds.

In November, Police launched **Public Safety Teams** to gather information on criminals and be visibly present in and around the Papakura business district at peak times. Officers spend one afternoon each fortnight carrying out checkpoints, beat patrols and proactive patrols in crime hot spots.

**It was a great privilege to open Takanini’s** new Police station this month. The project is a great example of how Police and the community can work together to reduce crime. The new station sends a strong signal that the community is serious about making Takanini a safer and better place to live.

Few things deter crime like a healthy Police presence. As the local MP I fully support a permanent Police base in Takanini beyond the initial three years.

Last weekend I joined an 80-strong **Police team blitz** in Counties Manukau to apprehend drunk drivers. Some 16,000 cars were stopped and more than 230 offenders will now face excess breath alcohol charges in court. I commend the Police on their ongoing efforts and commitment to keeping our roads safe.

I enjoyed attending the **No. 4 Squadron Air Training Corps parade** at the Ardmore Airfield on the weekend. It was a great opportunity to celebrate the achievements our young flight cadets – and the drill display was fantastic! Congratulations to you all.

**Finally, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.** I trust you will all have a wonderful holiday break. Relax and enjoy spending time with family and friends. Thank you for your support during 2009 – I look forward to seeing you in and around the district next year.

Hon Judith Collins  
MP for Papakura
