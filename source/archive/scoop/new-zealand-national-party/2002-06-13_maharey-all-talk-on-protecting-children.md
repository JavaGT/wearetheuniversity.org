Maharey All Talk On Protecting Children
=======================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

"The release of the Children's Agenda shows that Social Services Minister Steve Maharey is guilty of child neglect on a massive scale," says National's Social Services spokesman Bob Simcock.

"After three years of talk about his Children's Agenda all Steve Maharey has delivered is another list of waffle."

Mr Simcock says this is yet another stunning example of the 'Maharey Principle'.

"We have children being killed by adults who should be caring for them and all he wants to do is increase the opportunity for people to participate in Government decisions.

"Many children are already casualties by the time they enter school and all this Minister wants is to improve local government planning.

"We have thousands of children being physically and sexually abused every year. Children are dying in CYPS care and still the Minister has done nothing."

Mr Simcock says Steve Maharey has made great claims about wanting to end child poverty, but has no idea or credible plan for achieving this.

"Around 30 per cent of families in New Zealand - and therefore 30 per cent of our country's children - live in poverty today. This is happening right now under Steve Maharey's watch.

"This Children's Agenda is a sham. There is no allocation for it in the Budget and it has not even been mentioned in the Prime Minister's list of priorities for a future Labour Government," Mr Simcock concluded.
