Labour experiences double educational epiphany

For nine years Labour has been told that NCEA was majorly flawed and truancy rates were out of control, yet it is only months before an election that it has chosen to do something about both of these issues, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.

“Less than a year ago, former Education Minister Steve Maharey said ‘NCEA is a world-class qualifications system which challenges students, recognises their achievement, and is proven to prepare students well for university.’

“Just last month Education Minister Chris Carter said ‘NCEA has been recognised by domestic and international educationalists, business, and parents as a modern, well-researched assessment system that is preparing young New Zealanders well for the 21st century.’

“And then today they announce NCEA will be subjected to the biggest review since it was introduced in 2002.

“This is just weeks after ICT groups joined other employers in claiming the qualification was failing to equip students for work.

“And, in the second epiphany in quick succession, Labour finally decided there is something wrong when up to 30,000 students are wagging school for at least one day in any school week, and has declared it will reduce that by 20%.

“No one thinks for a minute that these two educational epiphanies are anything more than last minute attempts to appease schools so frustrated with Labour’s policies that they are boycotting its latest bureaucratic burden, Schools Plus.

“Teachers, parents, and students are not that gullible.”
