Chris Carter confirms $95,000 state house income

Chris Carter confirms $95,000 state house income

National Party Housing spokesman Phil Heatley is pleased Chris Carter has finally moved to correct figures which show how much Housing New Zealand tenants are earning.

“Chris Carter initially tried to hose down this story by telling reporters that the figure he provided showing a household income of $113,000 after tax was wrong. Only on Thursday, after question time, did he move to correct his Department’s three-week-old mistake.

“Mr Carter’s new, corrected answers show the highest after-tax income of a HNZ household is only a few thousand shy of that earlier figure, at nearly $95,000.”

Mr Heatley says the top five after-tax household incomes of HNZ tenants are $94, 938, $84,968, $82, 240, $80,588 and $78, 520.

“Fair-minded New Zealanders have no problem helping those who are struggling to make ends meet, but that goodwill is likely to evaporate if Labour doesn’t put the checks in place to make sure taxpayer money is being spent wisely.”

“Unfortunately, many of the thousands on the HNZ waiting list will be waiting in vain. Labour has already said it has no policy to move people from state houses ‘when they get to a certain income’.”

“Labour should focus on moving those who are able to look after themselves into their own homes, and free up Housing New Zealand properties for people in genuine need.”

Mr Heatley says the Minister has refused to answer questions on gross incomes on the basis that ‘this would require a significant commitment of resources which I do not consider warranted’.

Statistics New Zealand reported in June that the average annual gross income for a household is $65,520 per year.

Question: What is the total household income of each of the top five income Housing New Zealand tenant households for each neighbourhood unit as reported to Housing New Zealand?

Portfolio: Housing  
Minister: Hon Chris Carter  
Date Lodged:22/02/2006

Answer Text: Housing New Zealand Corporation has supplied the attached table from its records showing the declared total net weekly assessable income for each of the top five income earning households in each neighbourhood unit.

The table shows the combined total net income as at 23 March 2006 of all those household members who have signed the tenancy agreement and their respective partners. More than one income per household may have been declared.

I have included in the table the original data previously advised to Member with the reasons for a change to the data where a change to the net weekly assessable income for the household has been made.

Twenty-five of these households were housed prior to the introduction of the Social Allocation System (SAS), one was a former Auckland City Council tenant who transferred with the purchase of the Council’s housing by the Corporation, and two were housed under SAS. Both tenants housed under SAS were on a low income when housed and have since improved their circumstances.

There are three families within the 25 housed prior to SAS who have since been transferred between Corporation properties after the introduction of SAS, two because of overcrowding and one because of redevelopment work. One of the three is a family group with four incomes.

Current tenants who have not completed an income-related rent record are not included in the table.

Review of income-related rents in PQ910 as at 23 March 2006

Notes: (1) IRR type shows whether the change was through an "Annual" income review or a tenanant applying for because of a change of circumstances "COC"  
(2) Where a tenant has not re-applied for an income-related rent there is no assessable income and they will therefore be on a market rent  
Conclusions: (1) Three income-related rent applications had data entry errors by HNZC  
(2) One income-related rent application had incorrect information provided  
(3) One income-related rent application had incorrect information provided by the applicant and a data entry error by HNZC  
(4) Thirty-eight of the 120 income related-rent applications have changed since PQ910 was asked either through change of tenant circumstance applications or annual income-related rent reviews.
