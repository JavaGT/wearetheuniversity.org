Goff hiding the truth on youth crime figures

Claims by Justice Minister, Phil Goff, that youth crime figures are dropping are a misleading attempt to cover up what's really happening with youth offending, says National's Justice spokesman, Wayne Mapp.

"The fact is Youth Court work has tripled in the last decade as police prosecute teenagers in record numbers for serious violence offences.

"Add to this the thousands of children too young for Youth Court who are breaking the law and the enormity of the problem hits home.

"Figures obtained by National show that police apprehended children aged 13 and under in 51,927 criminal investigations in the last four years. Burglary numbers for this age group went from 1506 in 1997 to 1903 in 2000. Apprehensions for drug offences climbed 62 percent. Violent crime reached a high of 1154 offences.

"It is irresponsible of Phil Goff to claim the Government is getting on top of this problem. The fact that he admits he's reviewing the powers of the Family and Youth Courts proves he's looking for change," says Dr Mapp.
