**Collins Comments June 20**

It’s always a privilege to meet with our district’s young people when I’m back in the electorate.

This week I was fortunate enough to visit **The Gardens Childcare Centre** on Hill Road - it was wonderful to see the great work that Micha Brown and her staff are doing with our children.

This Government is committed to providing all early childhood students with equal opportunity to succeed.

I’m delighted to say we’re investing **$9.5 million** to build eight new early childhood education services in South and East Auckland – including $1 million to establish a new Maori bilingual centre with fifty child places in **Randwick Park**, Manurewa.

This is great news for our electorate. The new centre will give some of our district’s most vulnerable children the benefits of a quality early childhood education before they start school.

I enjoyed visiting pupils in Rooms 9 and 27 at **Randwick Park School** recently as they settled into their classrooms in the school’s new learning facility. I was particularly impressed by the students’ creativity in writing and producing their very own community radio station – well done to you all!

I also enjoyed speaking to students at **Rosehill Intermediate School** about the benefits of long-term goal setting. Encouraging our students to persevere with their goals is key to helping them achieve academic, cultural and sporting success.

I'd like to acknowledge our district's talented teaching and support staff - especially those who welcomed me this week - as they continue to inspire and educate our children.

Our electorate is home to some fantastic young people and I look forward to following their future successes.

**Hon Judith Collins  
**MP for Papakura
