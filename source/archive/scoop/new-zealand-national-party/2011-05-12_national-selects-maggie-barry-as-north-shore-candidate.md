National Selects Maggie Barry as North Shore Candidate

National Party North Shore Electorate Chair Lorraine Campbell is pleased to announce that Maggie Barry will be the Party's North Shore candidate for the upcoming General Election.

\"The level of interest in this selection underscores the enthusi­asm within the Party in election year. I want to thank everyone who has taken part in the process."

"As an electorate, we pay tribute to Defence Minister Wayne Mapp for his service to our community and wish him well for his future endeavours.

"The National Party values the support we receive from the North Shore and we are delighted to have Maggie as our candidate to contest the November 26 election.

Barry says she is looking forward to the opportunity of fighting for the privilege to represent the people of North Shore.

"Despite the North Shore historically being a strong National seat, I plan to campaign hard to earn the trust and respect of this community.

"For our community, this election is about maintaining the North Shore's strong, consistent voice in the National Gov­ernment.

"As I have travelled around this electorate I sense the community understands National's plan to grow the economy, to start living within our means as a country, deliver enduring jobs, and build the critical infrastructure to future proof New Zealand and our region.

"As we emerge from the recession, and the disaster that has hit Canterbury, it has become even more impor­tant for our Government to make sensible spending decisions so future generations of Kiwis aren't left with a legacy of debt.

"I believe that John Key's reliable and proven leadership is critically important for our country's future and will be doing my utmost to insure it continues."

Barry's entry into politics follows a thirty-year career in broadcasting, best known for her television roles on One News and Maggie's Garden Show.

As a Chair of the New Zealand Book Council, Patron of Hospice New Zealand, and Member of the Institute of Directors until 2010, Barry's candidacy for the North Shore Seat adds to a history of service to the community and business stretching as long as her broadcasting career.

Barry is mother to teenager Jo and enjoys the strong support of her partner Grant Kerr. Barry has vouched to move into the electorate if elected.

"The family and I would be very proud to call the North Shore home.

Ends
