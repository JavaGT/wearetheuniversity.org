Attack on Dr Newman 'disgraceful distraction'

Attack on Dr Newman 'disgraceful distraction'

National Party Welfare spokeswoman Katherine Rich is accusing Tariana Turia of a disgraceful distraction and says she should 'play the ball not the person.'

She's responding to a 'childish and pathetic' attack by the Associate Minister in charge of Child Youth and Family on ACT's Dr Muriel Newman.

"Instead of concentrating on the appalling unallocated case list, social worker recruitment and retention problems, Mrs Turia has unleashed a stream of abuse," says Mrs Rich.

"She should be focussing on rising notifications and CYF's growing difficulty in protecting the nation's most vulnerable children - instead she's accused Dr Newman of using them as 'pawns' in a political game.

"Our children are our future and they deserve a Minister that concentrates on the real issues instead of infantile name-calling.

"And it is Dr Newman to you Mrs Turia... not Muriel," Mrs Rich says.

"She has a Batchelor of Science in Mathematics and a Doctorate in Maths Education, not to mention the 20 years she spent working in both secondary and tertiary education both here and in the US.

"She deserves to be recognised for her achievements," says Mrs Rich.

"Feminists in the Labour Party will cringe at Mrs Turia using the despicable technique of trying to diminish Dr Newman's standing by referring to her by her christian name.

"Mrs Turia is achieving absolutely nothing by spending her days taking cheap shots at the valid concerns being raised by Dr Newman," Mrs Rich says.
