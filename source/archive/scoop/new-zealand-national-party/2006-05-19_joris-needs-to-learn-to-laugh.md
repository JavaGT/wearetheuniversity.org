Dr Wayne Mapp MP  
National Party Political Correctness Spokesman

Joris needs to learn to laugh

National Party Political Correctness spokesman Wayne Mapp says the Race Relations Commissioner needs to work on his sense of humour and respect freedom of speech.

“To take student magazines to task for poking fun at Chairman Mao is really a little extreme. On that basis, newspaper cartoonists and political satirists would breach his standards on a daily basis.”

Reports today say Joris De Bres believes the publication of Chairman Mao’s image is discriminatory. ‘Now is not the best time to be exercising your sense of humour,’ Mr De Bres is quoted as saying.

“Far from being discriminatory, this is a jibe aimed at one of the great communist dictators of the 20th century.

“Is Joris De Bres now saying such dictators should be immune from any political comment?” asks Dr Mapp.
