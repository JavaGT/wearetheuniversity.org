Recognising Maungakiekie’s volunteers  

National MP Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga has welcomed Volunteer Week 2015 by acknowledging the hard work of thousands of volunteers in Maungakiekie.

“It is outstanding that these locals give their time, skills and resources to help improve our community,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“As MP for Maungakiekie I am grateful for the contribution our volunteers make.

“Volunteers freely donate their time and energy supporting a range of non-profit institutions including youth organisations, social services, sports clubs, charities and many others.

“We are fortunate to have many excellent voluntary organisations in Maungakiekie including Community Patrols of New Zealand which works to reduce crime and build safer communities.

“The Community Patrols in Ellerslie, Onehunga and Panmure are a fine example of local volunteers making a real difference by monitoring our communities and reporting any suspicious activity to police. It is proven that that in areas where Community Patrols are at work there is less crime and as an active volunteer I have seen first-hand that it works,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

National Volunteer Week 2015 runs from 21 – 27 June with the theme ‘there is a place for you to volunteer’.

National supports volunteers with $12.5 million through the Community Organisation Grants scheme, $1.5 million for community-led development, and $502,000 through the Support for Volunteering Fund available every year.
