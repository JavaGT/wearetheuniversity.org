**Growing stronger, more vibrant Pacific communities**

National’s Pacific Affairs policy outlines the next steps in our plan to build stronger and more vibrant Pacific communities, says National Party Pacific Affairs Spokeswoman Hon Georgina te Heuheu.

“National is committed to building a brighter future for families in New Zealand’s many Pacific communities,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

In six years’ time Pacific people will make up almost 10 per cent of New Zealand’s population, and a significant proportion of the workforce.

“The success of our growing Pacific communities is vital to New Zealand’s future success as a country.

“That’s why National has been working hard to build better public services and to create more real jobs for Pacific people. We have made steady progress for Pacific families, particularly in education, health and housing, but there is still more to do.”

Mrs te Heuheu says that if re-elected, National will continue to improve education and training outcomes for Pacific students by increasing their participation in early childhood education, continuing our focus on literacy and numeracy, and increasing trades training.

“In Budget 2010 we provided $91.8 million for extra ECE places for Pacific, Maori and low-income families.

“In addition to this, we’ve funded 141 Pasifika education centres over two years, introduced National Standards, boosted trades and industry training, and provided 2500 extra Youth Guarantee places,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

National will also continue to support improved health services for Pacific communities through the public health system and health targets.

“We’re focused on improving child health, reducing obesity and smoking, and improving access to the health services Pacific families rely on,” says Mrs te Heuheu.

“We’re also making sure Pacific people live in warmer, drier and healthier homes and will work closely with social housing providers, including Pacific island churches and NGOs to increase social housing.”

Mrs te Heuheu says it is also important that Pacific people have pride in their heritage, and confidence in their future.

“That's why National is committed to supporting Pacific languages and promoting Pacific cultures.

"Ensuring Pacific people are strong contributors to a growing economy and cohesive society is a priority for National.”
