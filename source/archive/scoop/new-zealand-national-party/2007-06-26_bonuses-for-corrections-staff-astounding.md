Bonuses for Corrections staff astounding

National Party Justice & Corrections spokesman Simon Power is questioning how the Government can justify $1.7 million in bonuses for Corrections staff.

\"This is a department that the Minister, Damien O'Connor, claims is 'on notice' to improve its performance, yet these bonuses tell a different story."

Figures obtained by Mr Power reveal that in addition to the $1,745,194 paid to staff in the year to 30 May for performance in the 2005/06 year, at least one staff member received an individual payment of $20,520.

"This is a department that over the past 18 months has overseen prison construction budget blowouts, the Graeme Burton debacle, the death of Liam Ashley, staff corruption, riots - the list goes on and on and on.

"Paying some people in that environment a $20,000 bonus is simply astounding, and Damien O'Connor should explain very clearly to taxpayers how this has come about, rather than simply avoid answering the question, as he did in the House today.

"Taxpayers deserve an answer."

Mr Power is concerned that one of the criteria for bonuses was that 'all performance competencies have been met'.

"Surely that's the least someone should do to keep their job, rather than something that's considered above and beyond the call of duty."

He also points to the contrast between Corrections' alleged superior performance and the high staff turnover figures he revealed last week.

"Something isn't right with a department that loses a quarter of its head office staff but gives thousands in bonuses to the rest."
