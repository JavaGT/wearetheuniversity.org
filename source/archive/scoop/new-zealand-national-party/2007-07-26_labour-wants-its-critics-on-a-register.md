Labour wants its critics on a register

National Party Deputy Leader Bill English says Labour's plans for electoral reform include a provision that would force its critics to register with the Government if they plan to spend more than $5000 criticising any aspect of Government policy during the whole of election year.

\"It is yet another manifestation of the paranoia that has become entrenched in Helen Clark's third term."

Mr English says $5000 would only be enough to cover one mail drop in a small New Zealand town.

"For example, the full page advertisements placed in national newspapers by teacher unions today would wipe out half of their total allowable spend in election year.

"There would be riots on the forecourt at Parliament if National told unions they would be banned from placing any more than two advertisements in newspapers during election year."

Mr English says the changes being proposed by Labour are anti-democratic and tilt the playing field in the Labour Government's favour.

"While everyone else won't be allowed to spend any more than a few thousand dollars, Labour will be free to use multi-million dollar departmental advertising budgets to promote Government policies."

Mr English says Labour should have consulted widely before introducing legislation that satisfies no one.

"Labour's kicked all of the hard decisions about tougher enforcement and sanctions past the next election. Labour's changing the rules to suit itself, and equipping no one to police them."
