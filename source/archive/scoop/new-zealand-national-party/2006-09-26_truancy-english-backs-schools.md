Truancy: English backs schools

The Government should push for more truancy prosecutions rather than spending all its time and resources on flash new ideas like text messages for parents, says National Party Education spokesman, Bill English.

He is commenting on the Government’s decision to abandon a pilot programme that notified parents by email or text message when their children weren’t at school - because most parents ignored the messages.

Mr English says more prosecutions for truancy is the best way to drive home the message that parents have a legal responsibility to ensure their children are at school.

“Teachers and truancy officers work hard to get students to school, but ultimately it has to be the responsibility of their parents.

“But all too often the parents of persistent truants face no consequences.

“The best thing the Government can do is support boards of trustees to take a tough line on irresponsible parents.”
