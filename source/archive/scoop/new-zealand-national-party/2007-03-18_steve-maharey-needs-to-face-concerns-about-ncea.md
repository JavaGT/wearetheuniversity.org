Steve Maharey needs to face concerns about NCEA

While the Education Minister refuses to think there is a problem with NCEA, concerns about the qualification grow louder and show no sign of dissipating, says National’s Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.

  
“The debate is approaching a crisis point.

“If Steve Maharey continues to ignore schools’ concerns about NCEA, then he runs the risk of a domino effect throughout the country as other schools opt to implement alternatives to NCEA.

“New Zealand must have a strong, well-respected national qualification. We are not there yet with NCEA in its present form.

“If the Minister refuses to accept legitimate criticisms of NCEA, our country runs the risk of developing of a two-tier exam system for kiwi students.

  
“When more mid-decile state schools like Avondale College start to offer alternatives to NCEA, it will have a ripple effect across secondary school education.

  
“The Minister is dreaming when he continues to say nothing is wrong and that schools offering alternative exams are not showing a lack of faith in NCEA.

  
“If schools are so happy about NCEA then why are mid-decile state schools starting to look for alternatives? It’s not for frivolous fun.

  
“The Minister kids himself that alternative exams are just an issue for the top decile and independent schools. The increased numbers of school representatives from across the decile range attending Cambridge conferences and meetings won’t be just be there to window-shop.

  
“Steve Maharey has a public relations debacle on his hands and so far his only strategy is to say a problem doesn’t exist.”
