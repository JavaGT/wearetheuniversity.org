Chaos and conflict continues in health sector

Chaos and conflict continues in health sector

It is hardly surprising that providers of aged care have been driven to seek a judicial review, given the chaos and conflict within the health sector, says National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Jo Goodhew.

"Labour has pushed the providers of residential aged care too far this time. It should come as no surprise that providers will seek a judicial review of their contract with DHBs, given the adversarial nature of health sector negotiations and the strings that have been attached to funding from the Budget.

"Aged-care providers have assured the Government that they will pass on all of the funding to their staff and have agreed to audits to ensure compliance, but the Government wants even more control than that. New clauses that include requirements for collective agreements above and beyond that required in the Employment Relations Act should be of concern to all employers.

"I'm not sure what the Government doesn't understand about the providers undertaking to pass on all the money. Why would they want to further interfere in the running of these businesses?

"It is time the Government realised that the adversarial approach they are adopting with all health sector negotiations is creating problems for thousands of patients and employees.

"First, breast cancer patients decided a judicial review was their only option, now it is aged-care providers. Pharmacists' negotiations have also broken down. Will they be the next to head to court?"
