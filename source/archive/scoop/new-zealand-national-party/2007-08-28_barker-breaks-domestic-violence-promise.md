Barker breaks domestic violence promise

Barker breaks domestic violence promise

National Party Associate Justice spokeswoman Kate Wilkinson says a promise from Courts Minister Rick Barker to investigate a worrying trend in protection orders has been ignored for the past 13 months.

In July 2006, when I asked questions of Rick Barker in Parliament about the alarming decline in court protection orders, he told me 'I will certainly investigate it'.

\"So why is it, 13 months after he made that promise to Parliament, things have got worse, not better, for women and children who seek the shelter of a protection order?"

Ms Wilkinson says obstacles such as a difficulty in accessing lawyers and gaining legal advice are making it harder for women to apply for, and obtain protection orders through the courts.

"Unfortunately this concerning trend has been evident for some time now, in stark contrast to the increase in reported domestic violence incidents.

"All the while, Women's Refuges have been saying that more and more women are giving up on protection orders because they can't find a lawyer and can't face the prospect of representing themselves in court.

"So I found it surprising that the Labour Government so warmly endorsed Waikato University research laying out the failures of the current system.

"They've known about this for yonks, but sat on their hands 'til this report.

"Thirteen months later, it is now time for the Minister to update us on how his investigation is going and whether he's any further along the track to fixing the problem."

Kate Wilkinson: How can he be confident in the legal aid system, when the Blenheim women's refuge advised that due to a shortage of lawyers doing legal aid work: "If the respondent wishes to oppose the protection order, our client then has to speak on her own behalf in court. Many of our women find that too difficult to contemplate and simply withdraw from the process."; do those difficulties explain why there is a reduction in the number of protection orders made, despite an increase in reported family violence?

**Hon RICK BARKER:** That does not explain the reduction in the number of protection orders. The member has raised a matter with which I am not familiar, and I will certainly investigate it.
