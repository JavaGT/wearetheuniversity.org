Budget announcements great news for Hunua residents

Last week’s Budget announcements are great news for local residents, says Andrew Bayly, the National party candidate for Hunua.

“We have around 20,000 local families who will be better off through cuts to ACC levies, and free doctor visits for children aged 13 and under will mean a better, healthier younger generation in our region,” Mr Bayly says.

“The children and families package will provide even more support for early childhood education for the 5,000 Under-5s that are our area’s future.

“Extending paid parental leave is another feature of the Budget, which will have a positive impact on our families. I am delighted that this National-led government is also focussing on tertiary education, with almost $80 million being put into reducing costs for tertiary courses in science and agriculture.

“My vision for our electorate is ‘Growing Hunua, Stronger Local Communities’, and this Budget goes a long way towards growing our district,” Mr Bayly says.

“Transport to and from Auckland gets a boost, thanks to a $375 million interest-free loan which has been dedicated to improving our local roading networks.”

Mr Bayly says other Budget announcements will mean benefits for locals from every part of the electorate.

“Whether you are from Beachlands, Clevedon, Pukekohe, Clarks Beach, Waiuku or  
anywhere in between, the announcement that ACC is on track to cut levy costs, potentially offering big savings for close to 20,000 local families.

“Our rural landscape is close to my heart, and it is great news that there will be $25 million in funding to invest in research and monitoring and preventative measure for Kauri dieback, along with $20 million for freshwater management, including helping communities with wetland creation.

“The Franklin region has a large number of wetland areas and has been at the forefront of riparian planting. Kauri dieback is a significant issue – three different trees in the Wattle Bay area have been identified as carrying the pathogen, and although the Hunua Ranges so far appear to be disease-free, this funding is vitally important for the region.”

Mr Bayly says his vision of ‘Growing Hunua’ is underpinned by five key strategies: making sure Hunua’s voice is heard loud and strong at Auckland Council; ensuring our region, and our communities, get the infrastructure we need; having access to good health services, provided locally; promoting our growers, farmers and the equine industry; and creating an environment where our businesses can flourish to create local jobs.

“What makes our region is strong communities, communities that are self-supporting but that also provide support to each other. Last week’s Budget delivered for New Zealand – and it delivers for Hunua.”
