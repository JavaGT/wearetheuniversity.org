Govt should let parents see secret website

Govt should let parents see secret website

  
The Government should allow parents access to information comparing schools that is currently kept secret, says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

He was commenting on an initiative by Auckland’s Avondale College, which is providing real-time internet access for parents to a wide range of student information, including absenteeism and lateness.

“At last, a school has been brave enough to break the culture of secrecy in our education system.

“The Government should follow suit by providing access to the little-known Schoolsmart website.

“Currently only accessible to school principals, the website compares school finances and other factors such as teacher turnover and student achievement.

“For too long the Government has regarded an informed parent as a dangerous parent. The Government’s paranoid that parents might use information to compare schools.

“In fact parents who are well informed will be more interested and responsible about their child’s education. Parents have a right to know how their child and their school are progressing. Avondale College has shown almost any information can be available to parents at any time.

“I look forward to an explanation from Education Minister Steve Maharey as to why the Government wants to hide information from parents when this school is able to make it readily available.”
