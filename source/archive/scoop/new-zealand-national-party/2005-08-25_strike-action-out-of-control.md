Wayne Mapp MP National Party Industrial Relations Spokesman

Strike action out of control

National's Industrial Relations spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says Labour's union-friendly employment relations law has caused strike action to become out of control.

"Labour has given unions too much power, and consequently they are using and abusing it," says Dr Mapp.

This week's strike action includes:

\* Dominion Breweries workers  
\* Mental health workers  
\* Nurse Maude staff in Canterbury  
\* Fuji-Xerox photocopier technicians  
\* Fairfax community newspapers in Wellington  
\* Clinical psychologists in Wellington

"National warned this could happen under the new industrial laws passed last year, and it has come to pass.

"Maybe it's time the unions woke up to the fact that under Labour there is no extra money for most working New Zealanders.

"That is why National's tax package is so important. Virtually all New Zealanders will get a substantial tax cut - and the incentive to get ahead. Most workers get to keep more than $4 out of every $5. Under Labour, one dollar in three is spent by the rapacious nature of the state.

"Only National will deliver what these workers are striking for. And only National will restore balance into workplace relationships so that New Zealanders won't be at the mercy of strikes, week in and week out," says Dr Mapp.
