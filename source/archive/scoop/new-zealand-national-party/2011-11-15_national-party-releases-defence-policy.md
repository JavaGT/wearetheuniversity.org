National Party releases Defence policy
======================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

**National Party releases Defence policy**

An incoming National Government will give our armed forces certainty by implementing the Defence White Paper and the Defence Capability Plan, says National Party Defence spokesman Dr Wayne Mapp.

“Our Defence Force is vital to help protect the country, conduct and lead missions with key allies in the South Pacific, and to enable New Zealand to become a stronger partner in regional and international security.

“Over the past three years the National Government has given the Defence Force direction and a long-term strategy.

“National has completed the Defence Review, released the Defence White paper, ensured the Defence Force is ready and available to help New Zealanders in time of need - like during the Canterbury earthquakes, supported our Pacific neighbours, supported our service people in Afghanistan and other places, and strengthened our relationships with our friends and partners,” says Dr Mapp.

“An incoming National Government will implement the White Paper and Defence Capability Plan initiatives, the cost of which will be met within existing baselines or by reprioritising existing spending.”

National will:

• Integrate existing units and assets into a joint amphibious task force at the core of the NZDF by 2015  
• Increase the effectiveness of training for our Air Force pilots, with advanced pilot training and a new advanced trainer aircraft  
• Replace the Army’s ageing truck fleet  
• Upgrade and replace individual weapons  
• Replace the HMNZS Endeavour  
• Change the Defence Act to allow efficiency reforms in defence bureaucracy  
• Support local industry.

“National will also keep to our timetable to withdraw the Provincial Reconstruction Team from Bamyan province in Afghanistan by 2014,” says Dr Mapp. “The PRT’s role in providing a secure environment for development to occur in the province has been vital.

“The PRT’s presence until 2014 will ensure that the Afghan Government has the support it needs.

“The work of the SAS in Kabul has also been vital to ensuring the local Afghan security forces are up to the task of looking after their own security. The SAS are due to return to New Zealand in March 2012.”
