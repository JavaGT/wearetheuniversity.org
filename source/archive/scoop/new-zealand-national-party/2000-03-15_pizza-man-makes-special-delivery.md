Pizza man makes special delivery
================================

The plight of small businesses was brought to Parliament Steps today with Opposition Leader Jenny Shipley receiving a “pizza box petition” opposing the renationalisation of ACC from Wellington Businessman Steve Chapman.

“It is a myth that only big business has benefited from the reforms. Many small businesses have made considerable savings as a result of competition in ACC.

“Mr Chapman’s business, Red Tomatoes Pizzeria, is a prime example of the savings small businesses have made under the new ACC regime. His business is now saving $1200 - $1500 a year on ACC premiums.

“Mr Chapman is just one of hundreds of small businesses who feel strongly enough about this to take a petition to Parliament.

“These small businesses join the thousands of other charities, church groups and big businesses that are making considerable savings as a result of the ACC reforms. The Government must listen to them.

“This 2469 signature petition comes on top of an overwhelming 1228 submissions to the ACC select committee – the majority of which were opposed to the Government’s renationalisation plans.

“The ACC Bill is back in the House this week. National will be debating hard to amend some of the worst features of it. Our amendments will reflect the views of submitters to the select committee, and the huge concerns from businesses and charitable groups in the community,” Mrs Shipley said.
