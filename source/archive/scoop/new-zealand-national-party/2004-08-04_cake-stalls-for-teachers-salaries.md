Cake stalls for teachers’ salaries

Schools up and down the country are fundraising to pay the salaries of thousands of teachers, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.

Official figures obtained by Mr English show that 3797 teachers, or 8% of all teachers, are paid for out of their schools’ resources, rather than through the Government salary system.

“These 3797 teachers are not included in the staffing formula. Schools have full flexibility in how these teachers are used to meet local needs,” says Mr English.

“The government staffing formula doesn’t meet schools’ needs and school communities are willing to raise funds so they can make their own decisions about staff.”

Mr English says the central control of staffing is a myth.

“Schools are overriding detailed bureaucratic formulae to do what’s best for their students.

“Higher decile schools tend to cover the costs through fees from international students, informal fees, and fundraising, while lower decile schools are able to use their more generous operations grants as well fundraising.

“Schools are determined to make the right decisions for their pupils even if they have to run cake stalls to pay for teachers,” says Mr English
