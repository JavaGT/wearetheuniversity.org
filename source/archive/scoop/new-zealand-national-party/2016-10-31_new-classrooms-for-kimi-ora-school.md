New classrooms for Kimi Ora School

Lower Hutt’s Kimi Ora School will get three new classrooms, says National List MP Chris Bishop.

The Kimi Ora project is part of a $2.1 million investment in six classrooms at schools in Wellington and Kapiti. The announcement was made yesterday by Minister of Education Hekia Parata.

“Giving Kimi Ora School more capacity with another three classrooms will help the school accommodate its roll growth,” says Mr Bishop, the National List MP based in Hutt South.

“This government is investing in education infrastructure. We’ve increased the overall education budget and targeted support to at-risk students, and we’re supporting schools to work together to raise achievement through communities of learning,” Mr Bishop said.

“This investment is part of a second round of investments in new classrooms under Budget 2016, which provides $882.5 million for school property, including 480 new classrooms to meet roll growth.

“The first round of investments announced 14 new classrooms in the greater Wellington region. These ongoing announcements demonstrate National’s continuing commitment to Hutt kids’ education.
