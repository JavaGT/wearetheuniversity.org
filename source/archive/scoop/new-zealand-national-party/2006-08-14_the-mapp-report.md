The Mapp Report

Save the games for the playground

Integrity comes in many forms; honouring your commitments, observing public trust, respecting our institutions.

The last few weeks have shown just how far Labour and its allies are willing to go to hold onto power, regardless of the cost to integrity.

Pledge card looting  
Labour’s pledge card was paid for by taxpayers at a cost of $446,000. This was a blatant breach of the rules. The police found a prima facie case of breaches of electoral law against Heather Simpson, the Prime Minister Chief of Staff. The Auditor General has now found that many politicians were in breach of the rules. How you handle these issues is a measure of integrity.

National has paid back $10,588. Why doesn’t Labour do the right thing and pay back the $446,000 that it owes?

Philip Field saga  
The whole Philip Field saga shows how Labour is prepared to tolerate corruptions. They know what Philip Field did was wrong, that he exploited vulnerable people for his own gains – painting three houses in New Zealand and tiling a very large house with 400m2 of tiles (that’s an awful lot of tiles). This work was worth many thousands of dollars.

Labour has consistently blocked the Privileges Committee of Parliament from examining the conduct of Mr Field, leaving Parliament and the people with no remedy. More importantly, it shows how Labour will put up with corruption to keep itself in power.

Mud slinging  
Of course, Labour tried to muddy the waters by comparing a beer offered to me by constituents with immigration issues to the painting of three houses and tiling of another. I guess to Labour politicians a couple of beers and extensive work to several houses is clearly exactly the same!

Finger faux pas  
And through all of this, there was the spectacle of Ron Mark, New Zealand First MP and reliable poodle for the labour party, giving the finger in Parliament. This must be a first in our Parliament. Only after several points of order did the Speaker even act, and this was only “to withdraw and apologise”. Hopefully the publicity will have reinforced to Mr Mark that at least some sort of minimal rules of conduct should apply in Parliament.

Stopping the downward slide  
It is hardly surprising that people have a negative perception of Politicians. Corruption goes unpunished. The government defiantly refuses to pay back money it looted from the public purse to steal the election. Mr Mark thinks boorish behaviour is okay in Parliament.

National will keep the pressure on. Integrity matters. The public deserve a government that will actually obey the law, and uphold standards. The only answer is National!
