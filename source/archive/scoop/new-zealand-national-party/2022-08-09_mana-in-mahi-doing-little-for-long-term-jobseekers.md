Mana In Mahi Doing Little For Long-term Jobseekers
==================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

New figures reveal that Mana in Mahi is doing little to reduce long-term benefit dependency among young people, National’s Social Development and Employment spokesperson Louise Upston says.

“The number of 18 to 24-year-olds on the Jobseeker benefit for more than one year has almost doubled under Labour.

“It makes no sense that more young people are stuck on the Jobseeker benefit long-term when businesses are crying out for workers. Currently, more than 13,000 18 to 24-year-olds have spent longer than one year on the Jobseeker benefit.

“In response, the Prime Minister claimed that Mana in Mahi was supporting young people on a benefit - a claim that is clearly contradicted by new data provided to National.

"The data shows that Mana in Mahi has supported an annual average of 178 people into work who have spent longer than one year on a benefit.

"The fact that Labour’s programme is only helping 178 of the 13,000 young people every year proves that the Prime Minister’s claims are disingenuous at best and misleading at worst.

“In fact, almost half of Mana in Mahi participants were not on any benefit when they began their placement.

“Instead of delivering more spin, it is time Labour started delivering for our most at-risk young New Zealanders.

“National’s approach will bring in community-based providers who will have job coaches to identify any barriers preventing young Jobseekers from getting a job, develop an individualised job plan for each Jobseeker, provide encouragement and apply a reward/sanction approach where warranted.

“National’s Welfare that Works policy will increase support to thousands of young people that Labour has abandoned.”
