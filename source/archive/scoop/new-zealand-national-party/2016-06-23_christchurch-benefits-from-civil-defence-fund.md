Christchurch benefits from civil defence fund

Environment Canterbury is one of the successful applicants to receive funding through the 2016 Resilience Fund.

“I am delighted Environment Canterbury has been recognised for their outstanding work to enhance Canterbury’s resilience to civil emergency hazards,” says Nuk Korako, National List MP based in the Port Hills.

Environment Canterbury received $85,000 for the Paleo-Tsunami project. This project aims to bring together all known information about paleo-tsunamis both nationally and internationally to help configure, design, and implement an online database.

“It’s important to recognise that some of the best work towards enhancing New Zealand’s resilience is happening in our regions. That’s why this National-led Government is supporting communities to continue this great work, and share their skills and knowledge across the country.

“Environment Canterbury will be able to use this funding to help identify and understand risks we face in Canterbury and how to respond to and recover from emergencies.

“I’m thrilled to celebrate the work being done in our region to keep New Zealanders safe and look forward to seeing the progress made as a result of this funding,” says Mr Korako.

Eight groups across New Zealand received a share of the $889,000 fund, which is distributed annually by The Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management.

Today’s announcement follows last month’s $6.2 million Budget boost for the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management.
