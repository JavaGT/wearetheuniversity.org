Labour sitting on another time bomb

"The unreleased Auditor General's report into Te Wananga o Aotearoa is another political time bomb for Labour," says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

The Auditor- General's inquiries into the wananga began in September last year.

"Despite a year in the making, this report is yet to see the light of day.

"Like Treasury's student loan costings, this report is likely to contain information that is extremely damaging to Labour. It's no wonder that its release has been delayed.

"Trevor Mallard has also yet to make good on his promise that he would make a decision about replacing Te Wananga o Aotearoa's council with a commissioner 'before the election'.

"In case Mr Mallard is not aware, the election is on Saturday. I expect to hear from him before then," says Mr English.
