### News Worthy - 1 October 2004

**Political correctness - Round 2**

Every Government has its brand. This Government will be remembered for its political correctness. The illustrations are legion Here is Round 2.

\- December 2003: Human Rights Commission discussion paper criticises the highly successful Modern Apprentices scheme because of its gender imbalance. The report fails to mention that many trades are traditionally unappealing to women.

\- August 2004: Payout of $1200 to convicted killer and rapist, Andrew Ronald McMillan, for "hurt feelings". Christchurch Prison refused to let McMillan see the full text of a letter of complaint about him. After going through a process with the Privacy Commission to obtain more of the text, McMillan then took a case to the Human Rights Review Tribunal to gain compensation for his 'hurt feelings'. They awarded him $1200.

\- September 2003: Lincoln University scientist Jon Hickford has his funding into footrot in sheep canned because "the outcomes for Maori need to be better targeted." It is all the result of the Foundation for Research Science and Technology - the Government body which dispenses science funding - now requiring all projects to be signed off by a Maori Reference Group.

The Foundation has funded previous work by Dr Hickford, a senior lecturer in genetics, into using gene markers to breed sheep with a natural resistance to footrot - a disease which costs the agricultural sector about $20 million a year in lost production. But now all applications for funding are vetted for evidence of collaboration with, and outcomes for, Maori.

Trade Union MPs in Parliament It is an interesting statistic that at least 24 members of the Labour Government are former trade unionists. Scarcely a surprise that the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill 2003 which has been reported back to Parliament substantially seeks to strengthen union powers.

Epsom school revenue National has recently secured detailed information about the sources of revenue for state (and integrated) schools in Epsom. The figures cover 16 schools in our district.

Parents and communities contributed $11.9 million towards the cost of their children's education - this amounts to 56% of the total operational revenue available to the schools in the Epsom area.

Hot justice topic The Labour Government seems politically unable to confront the problems of parole and the issue of compensation for prisoners.

\- John Taylor was on parole from a 'life' sentence when he drugged and raped a 75-year-old woman in a Housing Corporation complex he had been put in. He had 76 previous convictions, including attempted rape and manslaughter.

\- Danny Wayne had a 25-year history of offending, including two convictions for sexual abduction, when he tied up and raped a woman. He was sentenced to 10 years but can apply for parole after five years.

\- The Government ignored an offer by National to secure cross-party support for urgent legislation to prevent prisoners being awarded compensation.

Under National, people like John Taylor will not be out in the community to commit their crimes because parole will be abolished.

Our policy is clear - parole is an experiment that is not working and we will abolish it. Offenders like Taylor should serve their full sentence, full stop. The same goes for Danny Wayne. He should not be allowed to apply for parole. If he deserves 10 years, then that is what he should serve.
