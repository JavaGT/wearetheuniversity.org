Two years to go down the road!

David Carter National MP

Two years to go down the road!

National MP David Carter is astounded that after two years of mucking around over the site for the Christchurch youth justice centre, the Government has gone full circle and ended up only a few kilometres down the road.

"The Labour Government has caused massive delays in building the new youth justice centre. Social Services Minister Steve Maharey has mucked the people of Christchurch around over the closure of Kingslea and put the community through the wringer by changing its mind on the site for the new facility - first Mandeville now Runners Road," Mr Carter said.

"Two years after National decided on a location for the youth justice facility, near Paparua Prison, the Labour Government has chosen yet another site and the community consultation process will start all over again. The delay for young people that are being housed in inappropriate facilities is unacceptable.

"We need to get young people out of adult jails and in a facility of their own. If Labour had stuck with National's decision Canterbury would now have adequate facilities for holding young offenders. Instead, after two years of mucking around by the Minister, a new facility might be built a few kilometres down the road - if he doesn't change his mind again," Mr Carter said.
