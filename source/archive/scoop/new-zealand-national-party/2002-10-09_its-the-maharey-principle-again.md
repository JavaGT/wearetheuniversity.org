It's the Maharey Principle again

National Tertiary Education Spokesperson

It's the Maharey Principle again

The Minister of Tertiary Education Steve Maharey's spin on student debt totally contradicts what he said while in opposition, says National's Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power.

"In 1996 an outraged Mr Maharey put out a press release calling the student loan scheme "an out of control monster".

"He also said that "Students and former students are now in debt to the Government to the tune of $1.6 billion and the Government, in a mix of naivety and stupidity, thinks of that debt as an asset."

"This year's annual report on student debt shows that debt has grown from $2.9 billion to $4.7 billion under his stewardship, and it still refers to debt as an asset.

"Labour also promised to lower fees to $1000 and bring in universal allowances.

"Now that he has been the Minister for three years he has had plenty of time to make changes.

"Or is this another example of the Maharey Principle - just something you say while in opposition?" said Mr Power.
