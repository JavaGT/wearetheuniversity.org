Christchurch meeting on leaky buildings

National MPs are organising a public meeting in Christchurch on Sunday for Canterbury people affected by the leaky building disaster.

National MP David Carter says many Canterbury people had been contacting National MPs with concerns over leaky buildings, poor design and workmanship, and worries about their loss of equity.

"Leaky buildings is not just an Auckland problem. Many homes in Canterbury are affected and these people are heartbroken.

"People need to get together and have input into the best way to deal with these problems and how to prevent this continuing to happen in the future.

Experts will address the meeting and the public will have the opportunity to ask questions. The meeting will also propose an action plan to deal with the issue.

National Housing Spokesperson Wayne Mapp said people affected needed some direction as to what could be done.

"Local Government New Zealand has made some suggestions as to how this disaster can be addressed. It is time the Minister put his mind to the same thoughts instead of just sending people to their lawyers," Dr Mapp said. Mr Carter said the venue and time of the Christchurch meeting would be advised later this week.
