Further Govt meddling for small investors

David Carter National Party Housing Spokesman

5 November 2004

Further Govt meddling for small investors

"Thousands of Kiwis, who the Government describe as small-time DIY landlords, are set to be hit by further Government meddling, says National's Housing spokesman David Carter.

He is responding to reports that the Government is suggesting ranking properties on their suitability for rent, and banning some from being rented altogether.

Mr Carter says all this proposal will do is prop-up an ever-growing housing bureaucracy, unnecessarily costing taxpayers thousands of dollars, and ultimately raising the costs of renting for many low-income New Zealanders.

"How will this help the more than 12,000 people on Housing New Zealand's waiting lists?

"For many landlords their rental property is their retirement fund. If their rental property is left empty because of Government ratings, and interest rates continue to rise, they maybe forced to sell.

"This won't help the provision of rental accommodation for low-income people.

"It's up to potential tenants to decide what house they want to call home," says Mr Carter.
