Bishop welcomes new classroom for Maungaraki School

MP Chris Bishop today joined Associate Education Minister Tim Macindoe to announce a new classroom for Maungaraki School.

“I’m really pleased to see the school get an extra classroom. It’s been growing quickly as its reputation as an outstanding school spreads through the area, so seeing it get room to take even more local kids is fantastic,” said Mr Bishop, the National List MP based in Hutt South.

“I met with the principal and board chair quite recently to talk about the school’s need for expansion, so I’m very pleased to see the plan put into action so quickly.”

The new classroom will cost around $500,000 and is expected to be ready for the beginning of the 2019 school year.

“Maungaraki is a really great school. I’ve spent lots of time up here since being elected and I really enjoy my visits, whether it’s to talk to students about the school’s innovative learning environments, MCing the school gala, or meeting with parents and school staff,” Mr Bishop said.
