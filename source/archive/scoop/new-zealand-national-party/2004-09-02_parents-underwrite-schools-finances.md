Parents underwrite schools' finances

Hon Bill English - National Education Spokesman

Parents underwrite schools' finances

Parents and communities deserve credit for underwriting the finances of schools by hundreds of millions of dollars each year, says National's Education spokesman, Bill English.

Figures obtained by Mr English for every school in the country show that schools raised $473 million through their own methods in 2002.

The top five earners are as follows:

\* Fees $ 89m \* Donations $101m \* Fundraising $ 85m \* Overseas students $ 89m \* Trading sales $ 84m

"But despite the best efforts of parents and communities, more than 900 schools ended the 2003 year in the red," he says.

"The Minister claims that school funding has been increased but the contribution of parents and communities to that increase far outweighs that of the Government.

"Parents and communities must be congratulated for carrying the burden of a relentless rounds of raffle tickets and grant applications.

"I salute their commitment to standards of excellence in public education" says Mr English.
