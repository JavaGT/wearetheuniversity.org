Maurice Williamson

National Tertiary Education Spokesperson

7th July 2002

Read the policy again

"The New Zealand Universities Students Association (NZUSA) need to get their facts right on National's Tertiary education policy," says National's spokesman Maurice Williamson.

"National will increase investment in tertiary education, not reduce it.

"The student loan write-off policy is not bonding - students are totally free to go on an OE. What the policy does is give people an incentive to stay and invest in New Zealand.

"The policy does not discriminate against women. Women and men who take time out from the workforce to have children are eligible for the write-off, as long as they aren't on a benefit.

"Labour's vague promises to tinker with allowances only benefit a few, whereas National's policy benefits all students, beginning with those who graduate in 2002. This write-off policy will make a huge dent in debt for all students, and NZUSA shouldn't be afraid to admit this.

"Would NZUSA prefer that students are left to pay off their full amount of debt themselves? I doubt it," said Mr Williamson.
