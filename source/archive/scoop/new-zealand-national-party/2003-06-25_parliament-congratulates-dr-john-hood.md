Parliament congratulates Dr John Hood

National MP Pansy Wong successfully sought congratulations from Parliament today to Dr John Hood for his appointment to the position of Vice Chancellor of Oxford University. Mrs Wong said Dr Hood's outstanding achievement deserved the congratulations and best wishes of the House because he was the first outsider to hold this position in the University's 900-year history.

"Dr Hood has made a considerable contribution to New Zealand in both business and academia, particularly through his current role as Vice Chancellor of Auckland University and as a result of his chairmanship of the Knowledge Wave Conference.

"Through this conference he has prompted a national dialogue on the future direction of our country. It is appropriate that Parliament recognises that Dr Hood is a New Zealander who shows a real passion for and commitment to his country, and wishes him well," she said.

MPs passed Pansy Wong's notice of motion unanimously at the beginning of question time. "This demonstrates the large amount of respect Dr Hood has gained," she said.
