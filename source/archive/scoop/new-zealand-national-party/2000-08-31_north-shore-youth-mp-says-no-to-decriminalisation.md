North Shore Youth MP Says No To Decriminalisation
=================================================

North Shore MP, Wayne Mapp congratulated Gilbert Goldie-Anderson, of Takapuna Grammar School, on his outstanding contribution to the Youth Parliament, which concluded in Parliament this week.

“Gilbert’s anti-decriminalisation speech was highly regarded, by Parliament MP’s, as being among the most eloquent and compelling contributions on the issue. His forthright condemnation of the decriminalisation issue was undoubtedly an important influence on the result, said Dr Mapp.

“Decriminalisation of cannabis was the biggest issue that was facing the Youth Parliament. Their resounding “NO” vote (69-47) showed that, not only North Shore Youth, but also the youth of New Zealand have shown a responsible attitude to this issue. The result fully supported the leadership shown by North Shore School principals in opposing the decriminalisation of marijuana.

“Contrary to the assertion by Green MP, Nandor Tanczos, that MP’s selected their own candidates and therefore were not a true representation of New Zealand Youth, North Shore’s Youth MP was selected democratically. Each school held their own election with the final candidates being interviewed by a selection panel made up of staff representatives from each school and myself, said Dr Mapp.

“Gilbert researched his “electorate” by visiting each college on the North Shore and spoke to his “constituents” to gauge their opinions on various issues. He was extremely thorough and I was very impressed he took the job so seriously by going to such lengths. He was not only truly representing the feelings of North Shore’s youth but ensured that their message was taken to Parliament.

“Young people are very important in the political process and the National Government set up Youth Parliament in 1994 as a way of giving New Zealand’s youth a taste of political life and a voice in parliament,” Dr Mapp said,

“The decriminalisation issue should now be taken off the political agenda. New Zealand youth have sent a very clear message that they don’t want cannabis in their future. Members of Parliament would be foolish to ignore their message.
