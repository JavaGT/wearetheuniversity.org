Students at risk from lame duck leadership

Students at risk from lame duck leadership

National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says NCEA students are at risk of another debacle because of lame duck leadership in the NZQA and the Ministry of Education.

“NZQA Chief Executive Karen van Rooyen was targeted early on by Prime Minister Helen Clark, and the reports issued last week now make her sacking inevitable,” says Mr English.

“The reports also make it clear that Ministry of Education boss Howard Fancy was equally responsible for the mess, with worse to come when the final report on NCEA comes out.

“With more than one hundred thousand students sitting NCEA this year, we can't afford this sort of lame duck leadership.

“NCEA needs a major change if the 2005 results are going to have any integrity.

“Unfortunately, both these civil servants are now too preoccupied with keeping their jobs, or organising golden handshakes.

“Their senior management are preoccupied with the next report on NCEA, due in two months time, which will be even more damning than the scholarship review.

“The Government must move decisively to end the leadership crisis in its public agencies, and replace both chief executives. That’s the least Trevor Mallard can do for the students he abandoned to the incompetence and arrogance of the NZQA and the Ministry of Education,” says Mr English.
