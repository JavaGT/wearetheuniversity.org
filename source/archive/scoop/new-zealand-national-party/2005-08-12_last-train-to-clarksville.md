Last train to Clarksville

This song was a US Chart topper by the Monkees in 1966. The Prime Minister has led a life seemingly beyond the reach of the law. The illustrations include:

\* In 1999 the Prime Minister provided a painting to a charity which was not her work although she signed it as such. On 5 July 2002, the New Zealand Police issued a press release which read in part: "The Solicitor General has reviewed the police inquiry and concurs... that a prima facie case is able to made against Ms Clark for the offence of forgery"

\* Five police officers and a civilian officer are on trial on driving charges arising from a Prime Ministerial motorcade between Waimate South Canterbury and Christchurch on 17 July last year.

The Prime Minister has asserted "that she was too busy working in the car to take notice of the driving by the motorcade" on a journey that was 205 kilometres.

Not so, says a police witness. Rather it was the case that she was aware of what was happening around her "and appeared to be enjoying the ride".

The court heard evidence that the motorcade was travelling up to speeds of 172 kilometres per hour. (for the non-metrically minded 160 kilometres is nearly 100 miles per hour)

The case has been adjourned for a decision next week.

Eastern Corridor and bouncing dead cats

With typical colour former Mayor John Banks told a suburban newspaper last month that the revival of proposals to build the eastern highway across Hobson Bay would be as pointless as "bouncing dead cats".

He is right. The proposal was dumped by the Auckland City Council and that Council with Manukau City has since began a year-long study with Transit New Zealand and the Auckland Regional Transport Authority to consider new roads and public transport services in the eastern suburbs. That study does not include a highway link across Hobson Bay.

National is committed to the completion of the strategic roading network in Auckland. Clearly there is room for debate as to what in fact is strategic and what is not. The balance of opinion - Auckland City Council, Auckland Regional Transport Authority, Transit New Zealand - is that the eastern corridor fails to make the cut.

It is not scheduled as a Transit state highway project.

I have referred to the eastern corridor project in earlier issues of this newsletter, see for example newsletters 3 and 10.

The proposal has a long history. It sat on the district planning map as a possible route and the Auckland City Council gave an undertaking when the current district plan became operative that the route designation process would start afresh. On 16 December 2004 the Council resolved to abandon the route.

Immigration

There is a widespread view that in recent years there have seen substantial migrant flows from Asian countries in fact the true position is that the greatest percentage of new settlers have come from the United Kingdom. The figures for the 2004 year are: 25.26% UK 23.74% Asean/North Asia 17.17% Australia 5.48% Pacific Island 5.79% North America 5.41% Indian Sub continent 5.87% Europe excluding UK 5.87% Other The key points of National's policy are:

„h A focus on skilled immigrants and giving greater recognition to those with proven work experience.  
„h  
„h \* Immigrants will have to satisfy a good conduct requirement for four years before they can qualify for permanent residence. Those who break the criminal law will be sent home immediately. \* Immigrants will not be able to qualify for welfare benefits for four years. \* People sponsoring family to come to New Zealand will have to prove they can support them for the four-year benefit stand-down period. \* The refugee quotas will be cut to the United Nations approved quota of 750, and savings will be reallocated to help refugees improve their English. \* Business immigrants will have to create at least two permanent full-time jobs for non-family members. \* The Immigration Service and the Citizenship Office will be merged.
