Housing New Zealand is failing tenants

Shonky building maintenance is putting Housing New Zealand tenants at risk, says National's Housing spokesman David Carter.

Mr Carter says he's appalled at the case of a Christchurch woman who fell through rotting floorboards in her state house, despite repeatedly asking Housing New Zealand to carry out repairs.

"Even worse, HNZ thought it could get away with a cheap repair job to the Christchurch property, telling a contractor to "just do what has to be done" even though he knew a lot more work was needed," says Mr Carter.

"The law doesn't allow a private landlord to get away with this. Why should the state?

"For the thousands and thousands of New Zealanders desperately waiting for a state house, the last thing they deserve is a rundown roof over their head.

"As housing waiting lists grow longer and longer, the Government has to sort out this mess," says David Carter.
