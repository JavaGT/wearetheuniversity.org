Gavan Herlihy National MP for Otago

Hodgson the absentee Minister

Otago MP Gavan Herlihy says it is "despicable" that the Minister Responsible for Timberlands West Coast Limited, has yet to visit the company after a year in the job.

Under questioning at today's meeting of the Primary Production Select Committee, the Chair of Timberlands, Warren Young, revealed that Pete Hodgson has yet to make a visit to the company.

"It is both an insult and an abrogation of duty that the Minister has failed to take an interest in a company that is so vital to the future of the West Coast.

"The Government's decision to axe the sustainable harvesting of West Coast beech trees, and its moves on rimu harvesting have left Timberlands West Coast facing some major challenges in the next few years.

"It is totally unacceptable that the Minister hasn't shown his support for the company by paying Timberlands the courtesy of a visit," Mr Herlihy said today.
