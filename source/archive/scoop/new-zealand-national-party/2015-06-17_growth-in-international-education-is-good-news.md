**Growth in International education is good news for Palmerston North**

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce recently announced that the number of international students enrolled to study in New Zealand grew 13 per cent last year.

Full time enrolment figures for 2014 shows 110,198 international studies studied in New Zealand, 13,091 more than in 2013. Palmerston North had 3,186 enrolled international students in 2014.

“This is great for Palmerston North” says Jono Naylor.

“Palmerston North is a world class education city and international students play an important role in connecting us to the world,” says Naylor.

“As a city, we need to capitalise on this increase.

“We should continue to promote ourselves as a great place to come and study.

“International education is a very competitive market and Palmerston North needs to ensure it promotes itself in the fields we excel in such as Food Technology and the Sciences.

“We should be celebrating the fact that many international students choose Palmerston North as a place to come and live and learn.

“International students add to our city’s vibrancy and culture,” says Naylor.
