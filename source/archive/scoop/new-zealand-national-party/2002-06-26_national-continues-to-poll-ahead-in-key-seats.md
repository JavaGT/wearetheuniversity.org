National continues to poll ahead in key seats

National Party Leader Bill English isn't at all surprised by the Waikato Times latest poll which shows Nationals Sandra Goudie moving further ahead in the key seat of Coromandel.

"Sandra now has opened up a clear lead with Greens leader Jeanette Fitzsimons slipping to third place and this confirms what we see happening electorate by electorate around the country in key seats.

"In what commentators themselves have labelled as marginal seats polling shows National is in front. In Kaikoura Nationals Linda Scott has an significant lead over Labour, Gavin Herlihey leads over Labour in Otago, as does Simon Power in Rangitikei and Phil Heatley in Whangarei.

"I have been travelling the length and breadth of New Zealand over the last few weeks and have been heartened by the warm response I have received from all sectors, young and old.

"People like what I am saying. They like the idea that I am prepared to tackle the tough issues facing New Zealand like resolving the crisis facing education, getting tough with the criminals, creating more growth in the economy and solving Treaty claims.

"This election is about where New Zealand wants to go over the next 10 years. New Zealanders can either stick with the kind of left wing politics that is destroying our education system or it can get on the front foot under my leadership to a future where all benefit," says Mr English .
