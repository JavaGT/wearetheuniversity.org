Bali explosion blows out theories on benign environment

Richard Worth - National Defence Spokesperson

The tragic deaths of so many innocent civilians at such a popular New Zealand tourist destination as Kuta Beach in Bali blows out the Government's theories that we live in a benign environment, says National's defence spokesman Richard Worth.

"Fundamentalist Muslim movements in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand are disturbingly active in association with al-Qaeda.

"This latest incident underlines that it is time for a fundamental rethink of our country's defence policies and attitudes.

"The Government was correct in signing up to contribute to the international war in terrorism. Perhaps this latest incident at a resort area regularly visited by thousands of New Zealanders each year will bring home to it that the time is right to review both our defence policies and our approach to defence alliances.

"At the very least we should be looking at the fundamental causes of the rift between ourselves and Australia on Southeast Asian and Pacific strategic issues.

"We must be better equipped to work with our friends in the event that such incidents as that at Bali contribute to a pattern of rising instability in southeast Asia," said Mr Worth.
