Van Rooyen's resignation won't fix NCEA

National's Education spokesman, Bill English, says Karen Van Rooyen's resignation will make no difference to the 130,000 students sitting NCEA this year.

"Ms Van Rooyen was targeted early by Helen Clark as the necessary victim to take the heat off her favourite minister, Trevor Mallard.

"Despite today's resignation, nothing has changed which will save secondary school students from unfair assessment. Mr Mallard still says there is no problem with the NCEA and that its critics are idiots.

"Our top young scholars are left paying the price for that arrogance and incompetence.

"Labour Ministers have shown no consideration for the aspirations of thousands of young New Zealanders who worked hard towards achieving our premier academic award, only to find themselves the victims of the mess that NCEA has become.

"Now that he has no bureaucrats left to lean on, Mr Mallard should see the writing on the wall and resign.

"NCEA will only be fixed by a change of government," says Mr English.
