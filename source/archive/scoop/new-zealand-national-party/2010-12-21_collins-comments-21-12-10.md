Collins Comments 21.12.10
=========================

**Collins Comments**  
The **Christmas** season is finally upon us.

This time of year gives great opportunity to get together with our loved ones, recharge the batteries for year ahead and reflect on a job well done over the past 12 months.

2010 has been another busy and productive year across all portfolios.

I’m sure you’ll agree that our **New Zealand Police** have been put to the test – particularly over the past few months.

We especially acknowledge the important role our Police have played in both the **Canterbury Earthquake** recovery and the hugely challenging **Pike River** coal mine search and recovery operation.

Our officers and emergency teams have shown exceptional leadership, professionalism and humanity under the most trying of circumstances.

**Counties-Manukau** welcomed its 300th extra officer into the district and the crime statistics levelled off and showed a small drop thanks to the fantastic efforts of our men and women in blue.

2010 was also very busy year for **Corrections.** The Department is in great shape and should be commended for the thoroughly professional way in which it manages offenders and for its hard work helping offenders turn their lives around.

I’m sure the next 12 months will be just as busy as contract management is put in place at ACRP/Mt Eden Prison, the **smoking ban** takes effect on July 1 and **new uniforms** are issued throughout the country.

While we look forward to celebrating Christmas this year, we remember those friends and colleagues that are no longer with us. We especially remember the friends, family and colleagues of Corrections Officer **Jason Palmer** who was tragically killed while on duty in May.

I also encourage you to spare a thought for the Police and Corrections staff who will be working through the holiday season to protect us.

The terrible attack on Senior Constable **Bruce Mellor** recently highlights the significant challenges our officers face every day in the bid to keep us safe.

They do a terrific job, and I extend a special Christmas greeting to them and the hope that they stay safe and well.

It has been a pleasure and a privilege to be the **MP for Papakura** in 2010.

I’ve had the opportunity to meet many of you and attend many extraordinary events in the electorate this year. I would like to thank you for your warm hospitality and for your support.

To you all - a very **Merry Christmas**, and a safe and happy New Year.

Drive safely, and God bless.

  
**Hon Judith Collins  
**MP for Papakura

  
ENDS
