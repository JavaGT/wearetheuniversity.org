**Wellington schools receive funding for Asian languages**

National List MP based in Wellington Central, Paul Foster-Bell, says it’s important for our next generation to be able to communicate and work in different languages as our international and trading links grow – particularly within the Asia-Pacific region.

“Wellington High School and South Wellington Intermediate are part of a group of schools who have been given a total of $90,146 to enable more classes in Japanese and Mandarin as part of the Asian Language Learning in Schools fund,” Foster-Bell said.

“Our local schools are among 22 groups of 129 schools which have received funding from the first round of the $10 million contestable fund over three years. The aim of the fund is to increase the provision of Asian languages in our schools.

“It’s great to see our local schools will be working together to enhance the way their students learn and develop their language skills.

“We are a trading nation, so it’s important our future workforce have the opportunity to learn another language and understand another culture.

“There are also strong cognitive benefits to learning a second language,” Foster-Bell said.

The programmes will begin next year. Applications for the second funding round are now open, schools have until 25 September to register their interest.
