Govt must deliver for Jade Stadium

The National Party’s Christchurch MPs say they will push to secure Government funding for the redevelopment of Jade Stadium to ensure the South Island shares in the benefits of Rugby World Cup 2011.

The Christchurch City Council’s venue management company, Vbase, is seeking support from MPs to secure $20 million from the Government’s World Cup budget to cover a funding shortfall for the redevelopment of Jade Stadium.

“We are looking forward to discussions with Bryan Pearson of Vbase.

“We know that 40% of the New Zealand economy is dependent on service industries, and much of that is based around tourism.

“Christchurch is the second biggest city in the country and is part of a dynamic province that can provide a unique experience for visitors to the World Cup.

“Stadiums are part of the infrastructure that drives tourism.

“We expect a Rugby World Cup semi-final in Christchurch and we deserve a $20 million contribution from the Government’s World Cup budget – an investment that pales in comparison to the money that is being spent in Auckland.

“The Labour Government has deep pockets and is prepared to scratch any itch from the North Island, but not so keen to do anything below Cook Strait.

“Christchurch, Canterbury and the South Island deserve a share in the bounty of the World Cup.”
