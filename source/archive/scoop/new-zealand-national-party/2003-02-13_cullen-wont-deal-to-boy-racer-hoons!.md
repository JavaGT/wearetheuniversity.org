Cullen won't deal to boy racer hoons!

National MP Brian Connell's accusing the Government of displaying a reckless disregard for the concerns of tens of thousands of New Zealanders after putting the brakes on laws to deal with boy racers.

Mr Connell's making the comments after Michael Cullen objected to the Land Transport (Street and Illegal Drag Racing) Amendment Bill 2002 being brought forward to become the second bill for Parliament to debate in this session.

"As a result of his foot-dragging, it will have to wait for the passage of approximately thirty other bills," says Mr Connell.

"Included in these supposedly more urgent items are such time wasters as the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra Bill and the Television New Zealand Bill.

"Both in my constituency and during my time on the Law and Order Select Committee, I have heard submissions and complaints regarding the behaviour of these street louts," he says.

"There's a growing segment of our community living in fear as a result of boy racers and their aggressive behaviour.

"Make no mistake - we will see more deaths on the roads unless Dr Cullen is prepared to give our authorities the tools they need!

"Making such urgent legislation wait until after Helen Clark redefines the symphony orchestra appears nothing short of criminal negligence," says Mr Connell.

"The Government's showing a total disregard towards the thousands of Kiwis who want our police and our councils to deal with these thugs. "Until they get the new powers, many in our communities will continue to feel threatened," Mr Connell says.
