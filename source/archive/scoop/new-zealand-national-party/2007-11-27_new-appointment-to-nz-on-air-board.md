New appointment to NZ On Air board

Broadcasting Minister Trevor Mallard today announced the appointment of Michael Glading as a new member of the NZ On Air board.

Michael Glading has had a 30-year music management career with Sony Music, is chair of the Play It Strange Trust (assisting school students with song writing) and was chair and president of the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) for nine years.

"Michael’s experience in the music industry and governance will bring a wealth of expertise to the Board. He will be especially valuable in helping with decisions over strategies and allocations for NZ On Air’s music funding," Trevor Mallard said.

Mr Glading’s appointment is for three years, commencing on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 December 2010.

Trevor Mallard also announced the appointment of sitting member, Edie Moke, as deputy chair of the board. He acknowledged the contribution of Judy Callingham, the outgoing deputy chair, who has completed two terms on the board.

"Judy’s wide ranging experience in the television industry and institutional knowledge going back 40 years made her an invaluable board member during her time with NZ On Air. Judy brought a unique perspective and skills which were very much appreciated, and I would like to thank her for her work," Trevor Mallard said.

NZ On Air is established pursuant to section 35 of the Broadcasting Act 1989 to reflect and develop New Zealand identity and culture by promoting programmes about New Zealand and New Zealand interests and by promoting Māori language and culture.

Its funding requirements are also intended to ensure that the coverage of television and radio broadcasting reaches as many New Zealand communities, and people of diverse gender, ethnicity, religious and ethical beliefs, and other interests as possible.
