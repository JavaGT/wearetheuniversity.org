Time to come clean on NCEA

It's time to come clean about the significant problems with the NCEA and get on with fixing them so students, parents and employers can have confidence in qualifications, says National's Education spokesman, Bill English.

His comments follow the resignation of Alison Annan, principal of Cambridge High School.

Her resignation came out of a threat by the NZQA to withdraw their accreditation from the school after it was proven that 'credit-cramming' was common practice.

"The problems at Cambridge High School were at the extreme end of the scale but are indicative of wider problems with the NCEA," says Mr English.

"The NZQA have finally accepted that their system allows credit-cramming and unreliable assessment. Now they must follow through so that every secondary school in the country understands they won't get away with letting their students down by churning out credits with little or no educational value.

"NZQA's actions today confirm that the qualification is in desperate need of a shake-up.

"National will support any measures that ensure our students receive quality qualifications," says Mr English.
