More disruption for thousands of patients

Further strikes beginning today by radiographers are leading to calls for limits to be placed on the rights of health unions to strike, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.

He is commenting as radiographers at seven DHBs begin another round of industrial action.

A Canterbury DHB board member has called for public health workers around the country to be deemed providers of essential services and therefore not be allowed to take industrial action.

“This is an indication that Labour’s left-wing industrial legislation is wreaking untold havoc in the health sector,”says Mr Ryall.

“The public have simply run out of tolerance –industrial action in health is nearing a 10-year high.

“Health Minister Pete Hodgson must step in. His refusal to have any involvement in the negotiation process has contributed to this continued industrial action and disruption for thousands of patients around the country.

“I congratulate the Canterbury DHB board member who has spoken out about the effect these strikes are having on patients.”

The industrial action will affect Lakes, Bay of Plenty, Tairawhiti, Hutt Valley, Canterbury, Otago and Southland DHBs.
