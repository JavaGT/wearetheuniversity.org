Cullen's arrogance, loss of decorum

6 October 1999  
PRESS RELEASE:

Otago MP Gavan Herlihy says that West Coasters cannot but feel totally appalled at the reception afforded the deputation from the deep south yesterday.

"Dr Cullen's arrogance and loss of decorum is totally abhorrent and should not be tolerated from any MP, let alone one who aspires to be the Treasurer. One can only but feel empathy for my neighbouring MP Damien O'Connor who has been left "whitebating with a windsock" on the logging issue," said Mr Herlihy.

"The West Coasters came in good faith to talk about the effect of Labour's policies on their region", said Mr Herlihy. "They did not deserve to be treated with total contempt. It is totally indefensible that the Labour party is prepared to sacrifice the regional West Coast vote by pandering to the "liberal left" urban vote. Labour is acting on emotion not fact. The continuing sustainable use of our South Island high country could be the next target of the Labour/Alliance bloc," concluded Mr Herlihy.
