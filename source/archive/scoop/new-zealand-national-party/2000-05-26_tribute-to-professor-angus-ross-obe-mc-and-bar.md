Tribute to Professor Angus Ross OBE, MC and Bar

"Professor Angus Ross embodied the best qualities of a New Zealander," said Katherine Rich, MP.

"His service as an educator, as a scholar and as a soldier were outstanding.

A born and bred Otago man, Professor Ross' life was one of dedication to Otago University. He was mentor to generations of students.

As an historian he was a specialist on New Zealand's relations with the pacific nations. His classic texts remain as relevant today as when they were published.

He lived his remarkable life as a Dunedin citizen, except for war service and study at Cambridge University, UK. His contribution to the city and university of over 70 years is incalculable.

An exceptional feature of his life is that he participated in history with the utmost distinction both as a soldier and as an historian."

"Dunedin and New Zealand have lost an outstanding man," said Ms Rich.
