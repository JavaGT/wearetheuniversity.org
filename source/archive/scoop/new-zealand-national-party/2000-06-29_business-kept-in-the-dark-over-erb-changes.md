Business Kept In The Dark Over ERB Changes
==========================================

**Thursday, 29 June 2000, 3:15 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

"The thousands of people who made submissions for change to the Employment Relations Bill have been left in limbo by the Government," Opposition Industrial Relations spokesperson Max Bradford said today.

"Most of the small businesses, contractors, self employed remain in the dark over the changes to the legislation.

"National has tried in the select committee to get the changes made public to help alleviate the huge uncertainty that has developed around the law change.

"But that move has been blocked.

"We have also called for the changes to be re-opened for submission and input, but the Government has turned a deaf ear.

"We are heading for a situation where employers and employees will have dumped on them new employment legislation which is different from what they expected at election time and potentially different to what went to the select committee.

"The Government's so-called consultation and commitment to listen to business is just all talk.

"We believe it is incumbent on the select committee to at least let major submissioners know what the changes are to get the law right - we do it with tax law - so why can't we do it in this case?"
