Oscar Bonanza For New Zealand
=============================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

New Zealand's huge representation at the Academy Awards is a tribute to talented Kiwis, says National Leader Bill English.

"13 Nominations for The Fellowship of the Ring, and nominations for Kiwi director Andrew Adamson and Russell Crowe, reflects how much New Zealanders are respected amongst the film industry worldwide.

"Peter Jackson embodies the values New Zealanders admire - modesty, innovation, ingenuity, and sheer hard work. He has the kind of leadership that gets the best out of all who work around him, and fully deserves all the accolades he is receiving.

"It is a pleasure to see many of these people who worked with Jackson, who never would have thought of themselves as Oscar material getting the recognition they deserve. There are thousands of New Zealanders who contributed in some way to this movie, and they have been recognised by these nominations.

"It's particularly great to see the team at Weta recognised for their behind the scenes work."

Mr English says he received some insider gossip on the success of The Lord of the Rings before it was released.

"My kids loved the movie and convinced me it was going to be huge."
