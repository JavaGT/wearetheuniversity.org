Local MP Receives Residents’ State Highway Safety Submission

A group of Gordonton Residents are determined to make their village safer for residents and visitors alike.

In a brief ceremony this morning Tim van de Molen, Member of Parliament for Waikato, met with residents, Waikato District Deputy Mayor Dynes Fulton, Gordonton School Principal David McNair, John Riddell – Chairman of the Gordonton District Committee and Karen Boyt – Manager NZTA, to officially take receipt of the submission.

Gordonton Village is situated north of Hamilton City, sitting on State Highway 1B through to Taupiri. The village has flourished, is a popular stop for visitors, and with just under 1,500 permanent residents, the roads are busy. At the Waikato District Council’s last actual count, the Annual Average Daily Traffic (ADT) at the Gordonton shops was 700 vehicles, with numbers in excess of 7,000 per day sweeping in and out of State Highway 1B (south).

The submission, backed by 168 signatures, outlines key concerns around pedestrian safety – the parents and thirty-two children who twice daily cross State Highway 1B to Gordonton Primary School and Rainbows Early Childhood Centre, necessitating a safe crossing zone. The construction of a footpath running from State Highway 1B running past the EastWest Missionary College to Rainbows Early Childhood Centre is also a priority. The petition also touches on road maintenance and road noise concerns, and a plea to lower the speed limit through the main village from the current 70km/h limit.

Mr van de Molen was pleased to receive the submission, “Gordonton Village has developed significantly, and we are seeing a steady population growth in the north of Hamilton. With that growth, there comes the need for increased public safety infrastructure – as such, I welcome a review of pedestrian safety in Gordonton. In receiving this submission, I am happy to convey the Gordonton community’s message to central Government.”

As Parliament’s House sits for four weeks prior to Christmas, Mr van de Molen will pass a copy of the submission to the Minister of Transport, Hon Phil Twyford for his consideration and response.
