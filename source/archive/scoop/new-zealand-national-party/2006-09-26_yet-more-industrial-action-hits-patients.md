Yet more industrial action hits patients

Patients around the country will suffer from yet more industrial action caused by Health Minister Pete Hodgson’s neglect of the health system, says National’s Health spokesman, Tony Ryall.

Radiation therapists at six DHBs will today begin two weeks of rolling industrial action in support of a cost-of-living increase.

“Minister Hodgson is spending far too much time defending the beleaguered Helen Clark and not enough on his own health portfolio, which is at risk of collapse.

“The cancellation of overtime by radiation therapists will have an impact in many parts of the country by pushing out the waiting times for treatment by maybe up to two weeks, according to some sources.

“Cancer is a frightening disease and any extra delay will cause more anguish for patients.

“I wish Mr Hodgson would put as much effort into protecting these people as he is protecting Helen Clark.”

The six affected DHBs are: Auckland, Waikato, MidCentral, Capital and Coast, Canterbury and Otago.
