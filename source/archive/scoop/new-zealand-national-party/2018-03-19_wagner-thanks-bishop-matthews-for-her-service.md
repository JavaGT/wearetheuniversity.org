Wagner thanks Bishop Matthews for her service

National’s Greater Christchurch Regeneration spokesperson Nicky Wagner has expressed her thanks to Bishop Victoria Matthews for her service to Christchurch, following news of her intention to step down.

“I was somewhat surprised this afternoon when Bishop Matthews told me of her decision to step down on May 1st, and I want to both wish her well for the future and thank her for her service to Christchurch.

“Over the past ten years she has been a steadfast and devoted bishop for Canterbury’s Anglicans and shown a true commitment and love to those she serves.

“I worked particularly closely with the Bishop last year on the reinstatement of the Cathedral, and I really appreciated the time and energy she put into those discussions. We met regularly, and always had thoughtful, productive discussions that were focussed on finding solutions.

“As the Minister for Greater Christchurch Regeneration at the time, the Bishop and I worked together to reach a decision on the future of the Christ Church Cathedral. It was agreed that the Cathedral be reinstated and this project is now underway.

“I thank her for the years of hard work through challenging times, and the leadership she has shown, and I wish all the best for the future,” Mrs Wagner says.
