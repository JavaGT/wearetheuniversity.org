Welcome to the real world Minister Wilson

Tony Steel  
MP Hamilton East

11 May 2000

  
Welcome to the real world Minister Wilson

“The Minister of Labour’s academic approach might have stood her in good stead on the Waikato University campus, but she’s quickly learning it is letting her down in the real world,” Hamilton East MP, Tony Steel said today.

“Margaret Wilson is being told from other lawyers, experts, recruitment consultants and individual contractors that the Employment Relations Bill spells disaster for independent contractors.

“Everyone except the Minister says the Bill will turn these contractors into employees.

“That means more costs for businesses that will be forced to put contractors on the permanent payroll as employees with all the hassle that brings. The Bill also penalises the contractor who in the past has chosen to be self employed.

“The Law Society is very clear in its view. Its legal experts state that Clause six of the Bill ‘will cover almost all independent contractors even those who are truly independent and are in business on their own account’.

“Margaret Wilson continues to reject this highly professional and respected advice.

“The Employment Relations Bill has come in for strong criticism for being too academic and unworkable in day-to-day New Zealand life.

“It’s been drafted and presented by a very academic Minister. Employers and New Zealanders look set to pay the price of the Minister’s refusal to listen and accept she is wrong.”
