Collins Comments  
3 March 2009

**The Government’s 100 days of action** are over and I’m delighted to say that all 27 of our promises were delivered on time. But there won’t be any slowing of the pace. There’s still a lot of work to be done, including new legislation to tackle gangs.

It has been a busy and exciting few weeks for me. Over the past few weeks I have travelled from Whangarei in the North to Dunedin in the South and met some fantastic people along the way.

Most say they’re happy with how we’re doing. It is a privilege that the public has put so much faith in us to keep working hard for New Zealand and to continue keeping our promises.

**Voluntary bonding scheme to help communities and graduates** Too many of our towns struggle to find nurses for their hospitals, teachers for their schools, and vets to treat sick farm animals. Why? Because many young Kiwis see the size of their student loans and – all too often – look overseas to repay them. We simply can’t afford to keep losing them. That’s why, last week we launched a voluntary bonding scheme. This offers student loan write-offs and cash incentives to graduates in much-needed professions who work in hard-to-staff communities or specialties for three to five years. It delivers on our election promises to encourage doctors, midwives, nurses, teachers, and veterinarians to stay in New Zealand.

**Grand openings** In recent weeks has been my pleasure to open a new police station at Whangarei and the second stage of the impressive new police hub in Manukau. Both buildings were a tribute to those involved in their planning and construction. Last week I was invited to a different kind of opening – the new administration block at Conifer Grove Primary School. This is a fabulous building, which integrates perfectly with the existing block. The result is quite stunning and is testament to the hard work the Board of Trustees and everyone involved. Well done!

**A community that cares** It’s great to see a community that cares. The Randwick Park Residents group was formed only last November, but the signs are already there that the community is getting right behind it. I attended their meeting on Sunday which organisers said was the biggest yet. Police from Manurewa attended and were able to update the residents on how issues are being handled as well as take feedback away with them.  
**Support a great cause** On Saturday 14 March, Randwick Park School is holding its huge fund-raising gala from 4pm to 7:30pm at the School, 66 Riverton Drive, Randwick. This will be a great event, and I would urge everyone to get along and show their support.
