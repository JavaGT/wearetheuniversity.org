What’s happened to the Minister for CRI’s?
==========================================

Dr Paul Hutchison MP  
National Party Science Spokesman

4 November 2007

What’s happened to the Minister for CRI’s?

Prime Minister Helen Clark must explain what she meant by ‘tidying things up’ when she said the ‘Minister for Crown Research Institutes (CRI’s) would be subsumed’, says National Party Science spokesman Paul Hutchison.

Dr Hutchison says that over the years, the Minister of CRI’s has also been the Minister for Science, Research & Technology, or that different Ministers have held the responsive portfolios.

“There has been concern that there is a conflict of interest between the policy making, funding bodies, MORST and FRST, and the providers/private research institutions, universities and the CRI’s.

“In recent years, CRI’s such as Industrial Research Ltd have not performed well, and it is vital to clarify who the responsible Minister is.

“The CRI’s are very important in supporting industry, carrying out public good science, and helping drive productivity and economic growth.

“It is unacceptable that Labour suddenly announces that the responsible Minister has been ‘subsumed’ without explanation.”
