National selects Paul Foster-Bell as Wellington Central candidate  

The National Party has announced List MP and former diplomat Paul Foster-Bell will be its candidate for the Wellington Central electorate at the 2014 General Election.

Mr Foster-Bell was selected by a meeting of local party members tonight.

“Paul was an outstanding candidate in 2011 and has made an excellent contribution as a List MP based in Wellington and the Hutt Valley for the past ten months. I congratulate him on his selection,” said Lower North Island Regional Chair Malcolm Plimmer.

Mr Foster-Bell says he is delighted to have been selected again in Wellington Central, and is looking forward to the challenge ahead.

“I’m deeply honoured to be selected as National’s candidate for Wellington Central and look forward to taking National’s positive message to the electorate, seeking to further increase our party vote here in particular,” said Mr Foster-Bell.

“National is delivering real progress for Wellingtonians. I’ve been proud to support the Government’s work to improve our region’s transport networks, fund landmark projects such as the National War Memorial, invest in a cleaner environment, and deliver significant improvements in healthcare and education.

“I will be working hard to ensure Wellington Central retains a strong voice in  
John Key’s National Party.”
