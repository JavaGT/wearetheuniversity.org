Clark tries to confuse public on election rort

Helen Clark should tell New Zealanders when Labour is going to pay back its election overspending instead of trying to confuse the public, says National Leader Don Brash.

"Helen Clark still hasn't even answered the basic question of how much was identified by the Auditor-General as being unlawful spending," says Dr Brash.

"Today on Newstalk ZB she made the ridiculous claim that this was all a 'National Party beat-up' and 'lies'.

"Helen Clark has to explain why misappropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money is a 'beat-up'.

"The last time she used the beat-up accusation was against the NZ Herald for pursuing the leaky homes saga. In her desperation to shut the election spending issue down, she's again turned to that language.

"But two opinion polls -in the Herald last week and on Saturday on TV3 - show an overwhelming majority of voters want Labour to pay back the taxpayer money it stole to win the last election.

"These polls blow apart Helen Clark's claim that this is just a 'Wellington beltway' issue.

"She also told Newstalk ZB that the Auditor-General had not yet asked Labour to pay the money back.

"Does that comment show that she's prepared to pay the money back if the final report of the Auditor-General shows Labour acted unlawfully?

"If the Auditor-General does maintain that stance in his final report, as we expect, then he should take the hint she gave today and give her the moral guidance she so obviously needs.

"Until she moves and orders the money be repaid, her Government can have no moral authority to seek repayment of money from any taxpayer or beneficiary."
