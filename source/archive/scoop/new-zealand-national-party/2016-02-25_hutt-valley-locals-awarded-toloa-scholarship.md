Hutt Valley locals awarded Toloa Scholarship

National List MP based in Hutt South Chris Bishop has congratulated Zoe So’otago and Melissa Kupa, both of Lower Hutt, on each winning a Toloa Scholarship.

The scholarship, worth $25,000 over three years, is directly aimed to encourage more Pacific students into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects.

“Zoe and Melissa should be proud of this wonderful achievement,” Mr Bishop said.

“There was a high level of interest in this year’s Toloa Scholarships, and the calibre of applicants was equally impressive.

“New Zealand needs high-achieving STEM students like Zoe and Melissa to move up the ranks and take their places as our future industry leaders and problem solvers.

“I wish both Zoe and Melissa all the best for future endeavours and studies,” Mr Bishop said.

Four Toloa Scholarships were awarded nationwide. Open to first-year undergraduate and postgraduate Pacific students studying STEM-related papers, the scholarships ensure recipients also receive mentoring and an industry internship.
