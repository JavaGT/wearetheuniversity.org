**Bishop welcomes Wellington international student growth**

Chris Bishop, National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, is praising new statistics showing growth in international student numbers in the Wellington Region. Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce today announced that international student enrolments in Wellington are up 8 per cent from January to August when compared with the same period in 2014.

The International Education Snapshot report shows 485 additional enrolments from January-August in Wellington, with a total of 6,407 international students in Wellington over that period.

“The Hutt Valley and the wider Wellington Region welcomes international students with open arms. Export education is a significant way of keeping New Zealand connected with the international community,” says Mr Bishop.

International education is New Zealand’s fifth largest export industry. It contributes an estimated $2.85 billion to the economy annually and supports more than 30,000 jobs.

“It’s great to see the region reflect the national trend and continue growth. International students who come here to study add vibrancy and diversity to New Zealand, as well as attracting investment from Government and creating jobs in the region,” says Mr Bishop.

“This growth follows the record number of international students enrolled at the Wellington Institute of Technology (WelTec) this year. Students who study in New Zealand create significant international connections that last long after graduation.

“As an open, outward-looking nation we must continue efforts to forge trading relationships and market New Zealand to the world. These international students are important ambassadors for New Zealand in an increasingly inter-connected world.”
