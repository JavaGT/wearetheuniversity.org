University Strike Shows Folly Of Fee Freeze

Today's strike by Otago University staff is indicative of the problems caused by the Government's fee freeze blackmail, says National's Tertiary Education Spokesperson Simon Power.

"Otago University is caught between a rock and a hard place.

"The Government's fees freeze means the University is stuck with a fixed amount of funding for next year. The flexibility they once had to raise extra money through fees is gone.

"Meanwhile, their staff are pushing for more pay - money the University simply can't find anymore.

"All three stakeholders in tertiary education - the universities, staff, and students - are now suffering because of the Government's financial straitjacket.

"The whole situation highlights the problems this Government has forced onto the sector. The continued loss of flexibility and independence for Tertiary Institutions is eroding their ability to provide the best education possible," said Mr Power.
