Identity of 'M. Ferguson' to remain a mystery

Identity of 'M. Ferguson' to remain a mystery

National Party Agriculture spokesman David Carter says the identity of the prankster who caused a foot and mouth scare on Waiheke Island in 2005 is set to remain a mystery.

\"Unless new information comes to light, police are closing the file on the identity of Palmerston North's 'M. Ferguson', who caused the scare by writing a letter to the Prime Minister's office. It was widely thought to have been a student prank."

Mr Carter is taking the opportunity to remind New Zealanders that this sort of ill-judged hoax can have serious impacts on our economy.

"I sincerely hope that we never see any repeat of this behaviour.

"It's disappointing that those behind the prank did not have the courage to come forward at the time.

"They should have owned up to put farmers' minds at ease, and to save the taxpayer a good deal of money which could have been devoted to far more productive use."
