How are we making cycling safer for New Zealanders?
===================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

**Hon Simon Bridges, Minister of Transport**

This week I was delighted to announce a further 41 urban cycleways projects across New Zealand will be funded through our $333 million urban cycleways programme.

Alongside projects in the main metropolitan centres, the programme also includes projects in several provincial centres including Whangarei, Hamilton, Tauranga/Western Bay, Rotorua, Gisborne, Hastings/Napier, New Plymouth, Wanganui, Palmerston North, Blenheim, Nelson and Dunedin.

This week’s announcement is in addition to the 13 urban cycleways projects announced in January, bringing the total number of projects being undertaken to 54.

This programme will make cycling a safer, more attractive transport choice for thousands of people around the country.

These urban cycleways are in addition to the New Zealand Cycle Trail project, which has seen more than 2,500km of tracks built so far all around New Zealand, and is helping to attract more tourists, create jobs, and boost economic growth in the regions.
