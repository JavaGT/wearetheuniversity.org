John Key MP  
National Party Leader

Key wishes Katherine Rich well

National Party Leader John Key today wished Katherine Rich well following her announcement that she will not seek re-selection as an MP at the next election.

“I greatly regret losing such a talented member of the National Party Caucus,” says Mr Key.

“However, I understand and accept Katherine’s reasons for her decision and I wish her well for the future.

“Although she will stay on until the election, Katherine is a big loss. Given her talents, I hope that she will contribute in some way to public life in the future.

“The education portfolio will be taken over by Anne Tolley, who will move to 10th spot on the front bench from 16th and relinquish her role as Chief Whip. She will retain her Associate Welfare (CYFS) portfolio.

“I have a great deal of confidence in Anne’s abilities. She has proven herself since the time she re-entered Parliament in 2005.

“I’m sure she will do a good job in the education portfolio, an area I am giving priority to in the run-up to the election.

“Associate Education Spokesman Allan Peachey, a former Principal of Rangitoto College, will be promoted to Deputy Education Spokesman.

“Caucus this morning confirmed Nathan Guy as the new Chief Whip, and Chris Tremain as the new Junior Whip.”
