Meeting with Greens disappoints

Meeting with Greens disappoints

It is disappointing that the Greens have declined to move on the anti-smacking bill in a way that gives good New Zealand parents confidence they won’t be criminalised by the legislation, says National Party Leader John Key.

He is commenting after a cordial 45 minute meeting this morning with Green MP Sue Bradford on her bill.

“This was a genuine attempt to find a resolution,” says Mr Key.

“National came to the table with a compromise on its previous position, which would have left the bill’s purpose clause unaltered but provided guidance to the authorities so that light smacking of a ‘minor and inconsequential’ nature would not have resulted in prosecution.

“That is the outcome I think all good parents want.

“Unfortunately, Sue Bradford was clear that she did not want to see any movement in that direction.

“I’m deeply disappointed at the unwillingness of the Greens to compromise in any way, and I’m very frustrated for the hundreds of thousands of New Zealand parents who deserve better.

“Good parents want to have confidence that they won’t be criminalised by this legislation, but by passing the bill as it currently stands, Parliament won’t be providing that confidence.”
