**Chris Bishop - Focus on science prepares Lower Hutt for high-tech future**

  
National Party Hutt South candidate Chris Bishop today applauded the Hutt City Council for its commitment to increase the number of young people taking up science and technology study.

The Council-led study aims to understand what support local secondary schools need to enhance their science teaching and ensure students stick with their science subjects. Results are expected in July.

“Hutt City’s desire to boost the number of local students pursuing science careers fits well with the National-led government’s record investment in science,” says Mr Bishop.

“In fact, by 2016 the overall government investment in science and innovation is expected to reach $1.5 billion.

“National has increased the funding available through programmes like the National Science Challenges, the Marsden Fund, and the development of the Callaghan Innovation based right here in Lower Hutt.

“Additionally, students who keep up with their science education will be given the chance to gain real world experience through the government’s new Callaghan Innovation’s R&D Student Grants scheme.”

About to open for its round, the scheme funds innovative businesses to hire tertiary students for internships and work experience. 270 places are available over the next 12 months.

“Engaging and supporting students to choose science careers is vital to give high-tech business in the Hutt the skilled people they need to develop new products and grow their business.

“I encourage our local high-tech firms to apply for these grants to advance their R&D programmes and support local students.”
