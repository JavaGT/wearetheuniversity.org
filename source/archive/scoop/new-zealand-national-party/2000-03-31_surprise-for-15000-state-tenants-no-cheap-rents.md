Surprise For 15,000 State Tenants - No Cheap Rents
==================================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Thousands of state house tenants are about to find out that they won't qualify when Labour introduces income-related rents, National's Housing spokesman Tony Ryall said today.

"State house tenants have been swindled by the fine print of Labour's election pledge. Ask any state house tenant - they'll tell you they thought they would get income-related rents under Labour.

"Officials' work now confirms that Labour's pledge to introduce rents to 25% of income will only apply to around 45,000 people on benefit level incomes.

"That means around 15,000 state house tenants, most of whom would consider themselves on low incomes, will get nothing.

"Thousands of tenants will feel short changed because suddenly they now discover Labour's big pledge has all these qualifications around it.

"We always knew Labour's policy would be unfair to the 267,000 low income private renters and home owners. But 15,000 state house tenants will be staggered to find out they'll get nothing.

"State house tenants have got their hopes up. Now Mr Gosche is invoking the fine print. The clever election words are catching up with Labour," says Mr Ryall.
