MPs petition to protect all Northland children

**MPs petition Govt to protect all Northland children from Meningitis**

MP for Whangarei Dr Shane Reti and MP for Northland Matt King have launched a petition challenging the Government to vaccinate all Northlanders under 20 years of age to protect against the Meningitis outbreak.

“The petition seeks public support to vaccinate the 5-12 year olds who are ineligible for the Government funded vaccination campaign,” Dr Reti says.

“Meningitis doesn’t ask their age. It is woeful that the Government avoided expert advice that recommended that all others under 20 years of age should be vaccinated in this campaign, not just the limited age groups that were chosen.

“The Government says the reason for the limited vaccination campaign is because there are not enough vaccines but thousands have been sold through GP vaccine suppliers in Auckland. As a GP, I can buy dozens online right now.”

“Many concerned parents are paying up to $140 to have their children vaccinated because they are outside of the campaign age group. However, many parents simply cannot afford that,” Mr King says.

“We are encouraging Northland parents to sign our online petition which we will then present to Parliament when it returns next month to urge the Government to extend the campaign. The petition is available [here](https://shanereti.national.org.nz/protect_northland_children).”
