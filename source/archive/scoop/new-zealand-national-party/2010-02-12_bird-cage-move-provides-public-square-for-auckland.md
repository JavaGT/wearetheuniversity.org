**Bird Cage Move Provides Public Square For Central Auckland**

I am delighted by the New Zealand Transport Agency’s (NZTA) decision to invest in shifting the historical Bird Cage close to its original position. This will provide a key public space for the people of Central Auckland.

Six months ago I was approached by some key people in the community who wanted me to advocate for the shifting of the Bird Cage to provide a key public space, and better heritage and urban design outcomes.

This issue was first raised at the designation resource consent hearing in 2006 by Richard Reid. There has been wide community and local government support for this to happen and it is great that we can deliver this for the community.

I advocated strongly in an effort to make this happen, however this shift is the product of NZTA, the Victoria Park Alliance, and the community all working together to find a solution.

I am also pleased that the $2.5 million cost of this move has been able to come from the existing budget.

I believe that good urban design is a crucial part of Auckland’s future, and the outcome today is a good example of this.

Public spaces in Central Auckland are precious, and to be able to deliver another great space is good news for the people of Central Auckland.

This square provides a western gateway to the CBD and it starts to structure Central Auckland to very sound urban design principles.

I look forward to seeing the designs that Boffa Miskell Architects come up with for this public square.
