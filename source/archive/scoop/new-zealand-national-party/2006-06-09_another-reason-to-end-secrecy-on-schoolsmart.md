Another reason to end secrecy on SchoolSmart

National Party Education spokesman Bill English says the controversy that has erupted around an unofficial 'rate-my-teachers' website is yet another reason why Labour should free up the SchoolSmart website.

\"If the unions are concerned about inaccurate, defamatory information being spread about teachers, then Labour should deal with that by putting all the facts on the table."

Mr English has been spearheading a long running campaign for Labour to make more statistical information available to parents so they can make informed choices about their children's education.

"The information on the SchoolSmart site is available to principals throughout the country, but Labour doesn't trust parents enough to offer them the same sort of access to reliable data.

"Teacher unions should lobby Labour to make SchoolSmart more widely available, so parents and students don't have to rely on internet gossip," says Mr English.
