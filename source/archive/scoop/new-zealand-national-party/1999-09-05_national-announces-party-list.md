National Announces Party List
=============================

Sunday 5 September 1999 Press Release

National Party President John Slater and Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said today they were delighted to announce the National Party List for the 1999 General Election.

"We are very proud of the people who are seeking the opportunity to represent National in the Parliament.

"Our List represents a group of talented people who have wide experience and represent a good balance of gender and ethnicity. The List presents good regional coverage throughout the country.

"The top 20 shows the depth of talent in the National Party with a number of well established MPs and rapidly rising stars.

"Some new faces appear on the List including Anne Tolley (No 20), Katherine Rich (No 23), Mark Thomas (No 28), Phil Raffills (No 29), Kerry Prendergast (No 30), Martin Poulsen (No 31) and David Steele (No 39).

"This year the Party is presenting an open list where a number of electorate MPs in strong National seats and some new candidates in strong National seats are standing as constituency-only candidates for strategic reasons.

"Increasingly, some seats are developing a special character where the number of list and constituency candidates requires a strategic approach.

"The likely reduction in the number of MPs after the General Election as a result of the referendum to reduce the number of Parliamentarians to below 100 and our determination to remain a strong electorate-based party has led us to adopt this position.

"Several seats have strong list candidates from other parties in their electorates and we believe running an electorate only approach in these seats will bring National electoral advantages.

"We are confident this strategy will maximise our electoral effectiveness during this electoral campaign.

"National has a strong team, is well organised and looks forward to the election campaign where New Zealanders can choose the people and the party that can bring them prosperity and success in the future.

"National is determined to be that party," Mr Slater and Mrs Shipley said.

The complete National Party List is attached. ENDS
