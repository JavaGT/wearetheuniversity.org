Night classes can be saved

Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen should step in and save the traditional school night class, says National's Education spokesman, Bill English.

He is commenting on reports that half a dozen schools have abandoned night classes because of the bureaucracy involved in running them, and many more are considering following suit.

"Labour have destroyed night classes with ridiculous bureaucracy and gobbledygook about national strategy.

"School night classes have been a cornerstone of community education for decades, providing opportunities for learning and companionship for thousands of people. The system has been cheap and flexible.

"It's not too late for Dr Cullen to step in and save them.

"This mess is the handiwork of Steve Maharey and Trevor Mallard. If Dr Cullen undid their stupid policy, not only would he save night classes, he would also show is at least willing to unravel the rest of their tertiary education disaster," says Mr English.

"The demise of night classes is bad for schools, for communities and for thousands of people who use them to learn something new. Dr Cullen cannot let this disaster happen."
