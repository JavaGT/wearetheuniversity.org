Waverley teachers babysit empty classrooms

Waverley teachers babysit empty classrooms

Forcing teachers from Waverley High School to turn up and sit in empty classrooms is ridiculous, and the Education Minister must act on what has become a farcical situation, says National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich.

Waverley High School has been banned from carrying out student assessments by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority because of concerns over results cheating.

At a meeting last night, teachers at the school were told they would still be required to turn up each day despite the possibility of having no students to teach.

“This Waverley saga is turning into a bizarre 1930’s-style work programme where people turn up to do nothing.

“The situation is demoralising for teachers, demoralising for students and utterly frustrating for the parents involved.

“Action could have been taken at this school much earlier and now we are left with a ridiculous situation where teachers are told to turn up regardless of classrooms being empty.

“The Waverley debacle also highlights the Labour-led Government’s double standards.

“The Prime Minister has been happy to have one of her own MPs off on gardening leave for eight months, but is demanding Waverley teachers turn up to work to stare into empty classrooms.

“It is time Education Minister Steve Maharey took responsibility for Waverley, made some decisions and allowed the community a chance move on.”
