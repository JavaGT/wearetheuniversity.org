John Key's Campaign Blog: 05 November

Campaign Blog: 05 November

Yesterday I spent time campaigning in Tauranga and Rotorua, and released our action plan for the first 100 days of government.  
   
While my opponents have been busy desperately trying to dig dirt, I've continued to be focused on the issues that matter to New Zealanders.  
   
In Tauranga I announced that a National-led government will build the Tauranga Central Corridor roading project for a cost $100 million.  
   
Moving on to Rotorua, I released National's plans for its first 100 days in office should we win the election.  
   
Our action plan covers four main areas - the economy, law & order, education and health.  National is ready to deliver a fresh approach.  
   
Our policies are fully costed and funded.  
   
One more thing: if Labour spent less time digging dirt and more time on the issues that matter, then we would not be facing a decade of deficits.  
   
There are big challenges ahead for New Zealand.  
   
They don't involve secret tapes or sending party presidents to Australia to ring back thousands of pages of documents to scour for dirt on your political opponents.  
   
Those challenges are in the core areas kiwis care about - the ones I've just listed.  
   
Today I am in Auckland, and tonight I will attend the second TVNZ debate.
