Pharmac can't hide on Herceptin

National Party Associate Health spokeswoman Jackie Blue is urging Pharmac to make a quick decision on funding of Herceptin for early stage breast cancer, in light of new evidence published today in the Lancet medical journal.

\"This is the evidence that the New Zealand authorities say they have been waiting for. Every week that passes is a lost opportunity for those who could benefit from taking this drug. And for those funding Herceptin themselves, every week that passes is another financial mountain to climb."

Dr Blue, a former breast physician, says 23 OECD countries have funded Herceptin on the same evidence that Pharmac has been sitting on for the past year.

"The findings published in Lancet demolish Pharmac's argument once and for all."

But Dr Blue says there are worrying comments in the Lancet Editorial that Pharmac could be looking at cheaper options.

There are suggestions that Pharmac is hoping a nine-week course of Herceptin used in the FinHer trial could be as effective as a 12-month course.

"I sincerely hope that Pharmac is not seriously considering that Kiwi women should be guinea pigs for an unproven regime.

"The FinHer trial had only a couple hundred women and the results weren't statistically significant. That's in complete contrast to the large scale HERA trials which involved thousands of women.

"If money is really at the heart of this issue, I strongly welcome National Leader John Key's call for Labour to signal that funds are available if required. Pharmac's run out of excuses," says Dr Blue.
