Correspondence School inquiry called for

Correspondence School inquiry called for

The National Party has written to the Education and Science Select Committee calling for an inquiry into the present and future role of the Correspondence School, which continues to be under attack in what is the fourth restructure in 10 years.

National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich says, “We’ve waited patiently for officials and the Minister to explain the exact reasons for the current restructure, but all that’s been offered are vague statements that a regional service is necessary to improve achievement levels for at-risk students.

“No evidence has been presented to show that new proposals to regionalise the school’s structure will make one iota of difference to students.

“In fact, there are strong arguments that such changes could be to the detriment of students, the quality of education delivered, staff retention, and students’ access to some subjects.

“The cumulative negative effect of a series of restructures on the school, the staff, the students, and the quality of the service is of great concern.

“An announcement is expected soon of another round of redundancies, with at least 20 positions expected to go. I am calling for a moratorium on any further restructuring or staff losses until the Education and Science Select Committee has a chance to assess the school’s future.

“Answers to written parliamentary questions show that the Minister has all but washed his hands of staff redundancies, saying ‘I have no ministerial responsibility for redundancies at The Correspondence School. As with all schools, these internal personnel mattersare the responsibility of the school’s Board of Trustees.’

“While a series of Ministers and leaders of the school have lurched from one restructure to another, there has been scant public debate or discussion about what the role of the Correspondence School can or should be in the 21st century.

“In the absence of leadership from the Minister, the select committee can play an important role in investigating this issue.”
