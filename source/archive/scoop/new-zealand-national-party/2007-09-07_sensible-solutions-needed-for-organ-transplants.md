Sensible solutions needed for organ transplant problem

National’s Associate Health spokeswoman, Dr Jackie Blue, says the Labour Government should be exploring sensible and practical solutions to address the nationwide organ donor shortage.

She is referring to the case of Wellington woman Angela Murton who urgently needs a kidney transplant but instead, faces red tape, chronic ill-health, dialysis, and months on a waiting list.

Dr Blue, who has a bill in front of Parliament’s Health Select Committee that proposes a national organ donor register to boost the number of organs, says Angela is one of the lucky ones.

“Her husband is willing to donate a kidney but Wellington Hospital only performs one transplant per month from a live donor.

“Angela has been told the hospital has no more capacity and there is no certainty around when she will receive her operation.

“To stabilise her condition, she faces a pre-surgery catheter, two weeks off work, and months of being house-bound, attached to a machine.

“The personal cost to her is incalculable. The financial cost to the hospital will run into tens of thousands of dollars - far more than the cost of a one-off transplant.

“Angela says Wellington Hospital should, while waiting for additional theatres to be built, consider using private hospitals or look at using its own theatres more efficiently.

“The New Zealand Kidney Foundation is calling for a national programme to be established so transplant operations and theatre capacity are co-ordinated nationally.

“These are very sensible solutions. What will it take for this Labour Government to act?
