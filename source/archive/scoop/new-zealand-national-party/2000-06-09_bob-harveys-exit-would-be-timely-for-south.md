Bob Harvey's exit would be timely for South
===========================================

**Friday, 9 June 2000, 2:41 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

Reports that the Prime Minister is pushing Labour President Bob Harvey not to stand for re-election are good news for South Islanders, says Canterbury National MP David Carter.

"I think Bob Harvey's latest display of anti South Island sentiment has finally been his undoing.

"Obviously Helen Clark has realised she can't rely on Auckland alone for support, in the wake of her minority Government's diminishing support and a dramatic slump in business confidence.

"Bob has not helped her situation by alienating South Islanders with comments such as 'We don't necessarily like anything about the South Island. We don't care much about it'.

"This is not the sort of comment anyone would expect to hear from the boss of one of the governing parties. But maybe we shouldn't be too surprised, as Mr Harvey has long been an embarrassment to Labour, with other crass actions such as allegedly 'down-trouing' at a member of the public.

"Even an arrogant Labour Government cannot afford to ignore South Islanders . Maybe with Bob Harvey gone the South can start to be recognised as part of New Zealand again," said David Carter.
