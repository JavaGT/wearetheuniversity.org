Get your cheque book out for roaming rights

Taxpayers and ratepayers will continue to pay for Labour’s right to roam plans, despite yesterday’s backdown says National’s Agriculture spokesman David Carter.

“Taxpayers have already coughed up $400,000 for the Walking Access Panel to decide the status quo goes.

“This is just the start. We can expect to be shelling out a lot more money in years to come.

“One of the few recommendations the Panel did make, was to map all existing paper roads.

“To be done accurately this will take a huge amount of time and thousands of dollars.

“The reality is that local councils will be forced to carry the burden and the Rural Affairs Minister should come clean and tell ratepayers how much this is going to cost.

“While Labour has backed down on its initial right to roam plans this saga is by no means over.”
