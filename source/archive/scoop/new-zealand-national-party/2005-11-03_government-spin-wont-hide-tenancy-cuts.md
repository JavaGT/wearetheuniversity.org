Government spin won’t hide tenancy cuts

National's Building spokesman, Nick Smith, says Labour cannot hide its cuts to provincial tenancy services with spin and half-truths

“The Department of Building and Housing cannot claim it is enhancing services when it is cutting staff in Whangarei, Tauranga, Rotorua, Napier, Palmerston North, Blenheim, Nelson, Timaru and Dunedin," says Dr Smith.

“For example, while the department claims it will enhance services in Picton, Blenheim and Kaikoura, it also says the office in Blenheim will be closed and there are no other staff in the region.

“The idea that tenancy services can be delivered by an 0800 service from the main centres shows the department is completely out of touch with the sort of problems faced by tenants and landlords.

“It is disgraceful that new Minister Clayton Cosgrove refuses to comment on this issue when it affects tens of thousands of landlords and tenants.

“It is time Mr Cosgrove stopped hiding under the skirts of his chief executive and explained these cuts to the people and communities that are affected,” says Dr Smith.
