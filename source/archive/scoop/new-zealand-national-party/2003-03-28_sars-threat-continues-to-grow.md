SARS threat continues to grow

National is calling for an assurance that New Zealand will follow World Health Organisation recommendation to screen air passengers and other travellers from areas significantly affected by the deadly SARS virus.

The disease has killed over 50 people and infected more than a thousand worldwide.

National Health Spokesperson Dr Lynda Scott said it was important that New Zealand checked incoming passengers weren't posing a risk of bringing the virus into the country.

"I have raised this in Parliament and wasn't given a satisfactory answer from the Minister of Health, who seemed to think it was impossible to screen for symptoms of SARS and laughed at the idea.

"What is the Ministry of Health doing to respond to the World Health Organisation recommendation on screening. Passengers entering the country from the specific areas where SARS has broken out need to be screened. We must do all we can to stop this virus coming here and, as the World Health Organisation suggests, our Government should take the question of passenger screening seriously," Dr Scott said.
