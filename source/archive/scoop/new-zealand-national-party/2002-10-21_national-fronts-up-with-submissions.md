National fronts up with submissions

National fronts up with submissions

National has today delivered close to 100 submissions to the Government Administration select committee inquiry looking into the rotting homes crisis.

Submissions to the inquiry into the weathertightness of buildings, which will investigate concerns raised in the Building Industry Authority report, close today.

National’s Housing spokesperson, Wayne Mapp, says the large number of submissions posted on National’s http:// [http://www.leakyhomes.co.nz](http://www.leakyhomes.co.nz) website proves that many affected homeowners are looking to National for help in pursuing the issue.

“George Hawkins’ statement last week that he’d received only 15 letters from affected homeowners is in stark contrast to the pile of submissions we delivered to the select committee clerk this afternoon.

“The plain fact is that home ownership is a big part of the New Zealand way of life and this crisis is affecting tens of thousands of people.

“These people are looking to the Government for action, but all they’ve seen so far is George Hawkins playing a desperate game of catch-up. He talks of the Government being solution-focussed, but the only answers he’s come up with so far are the ones supplied by National,” says Dr Mapp.
