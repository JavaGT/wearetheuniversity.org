NZQA computer sell-off raises privacy issues

NZQA computer sell-off raises privacy issues

The sale of dozens of New Zealand Qualifications Authority computers on Trade Me, allegedly by an NZQA employee, could pose serious confidentiality issues, says National's Education spokeswoman, Katherine Rich.

The Authority disposed of surplus computers to staff, despite Government organisations being encouraged to recycle PCs and donate them to needy schools.

"I want the Education Minister to assure Kiwis that these computers are not still holding confidential files. NZQA deals with a wide range of confidential information - anything from student records to sensitive planning documents. Even if documents have been deleted, experts say they can be easily restored by anyone with the correct software.

"Steve Maharey needs to specify what means were used to permanently erase information on these computers before they were on-sold. Everyone who deals with NZQA deserves assurances that potentially confidential information is not floating around the country at risk of being exposed.

"The Minister should also require NZQA to do the right thing and distribute surplus computer equipment through the various organisations that refurbish old computers for schools and community groups. NZQA plays a key role in the education sector. It's a bad look that the Authority is one of the few education-oriented organisations that refuses to recycle computers into needy schools.

"NZQA has not only acted shabbily by not donating the computers to needy schools but has potentially put confidential information at risk."
