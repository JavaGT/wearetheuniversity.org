Govt short-changing of NCEA to cost parents

Govt short-changing of NCEA to cost parents and students

"Students and parents are the losers in the latest announcements associated with the new school qualification system, the NCEA," says Opposition Education Spokesperson Nick Smith.

"Students are the losers in the Wellington region where an additional hour a week is to be taken off by teachers for training for the NCEA. This is a 4% reduction in teaching time and can only come at the expense of the quality of education for students.

"Parents are the losers in that the Government announced by stealth of Friday that examination fees are to skyrocket from $83 to $150. Parents are being asked to pay more for less and should revolt.

"The underlying issue is that the Government is under-resourcing the implementation of the new qualification system. This was the unanimous view of the Education Select Committee and these extra costs and reduced teaching times are the inevitable consequence.

"The new qualification is too costly and bureaucratic and needs to be refined so that our teachers can spend more time teaching and less time assessing. If the Government is going to stick with the NCEA unchanged it needs to put the necessary resources in to make it work," said Dr Smith.
