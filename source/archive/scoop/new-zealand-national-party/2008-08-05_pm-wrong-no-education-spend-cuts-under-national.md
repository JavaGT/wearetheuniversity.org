PM wrong – No cuts to education spend under National

Helen Clark is making mischief by suggesting National will cut education spending to fund tax cuts says National’s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.

“Even the Prime Minister admits she was just guessing when she made the comment.

“I can tell you categorically that National will not cut spending to education.

“We are committed to increasing education funding at the same rate that Labour has budgeted for, and we will work to see more of that spent on schools and less on bureaucracy.

“This is pure scaremongering from Labour.

“Helen Clark is desperately plucking theories out of the air when she suggests National will put more of the funding burden on to students and families.

“Let me say it again. National will not cut spending to education.

“I can not make it any clearer than that.”
