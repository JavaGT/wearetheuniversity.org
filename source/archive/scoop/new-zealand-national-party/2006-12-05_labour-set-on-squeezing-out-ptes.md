Labour set on squeezing out PTEs

Labour is continuing to squeeze out Private Training Establishments (PTE) after approving student subsidy funding for only 8 out of 43 providers, says National’s Associate Education spokesman, Colin King.

Earlier this year Labour announced that some PTE students would no longer be eligible for student loans or allowances.

The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) gave 43 PTEs permission to apply for student subsidy funding. Only eight have been approved.

“The PTEs were told of TEC’s decision on 29 November and given just four days to seek a procedural review. Some providers are still waiting to receive the reasons behind TEC’s decisions.

”Basic natural justice requirements, such as giving reasons for a decision and a reasonable chance to respond, are being ignored.

“This just goes to show Labour’s policy has been an ideologically driven exercise aimed at getting rid of private providers,” said Mr King.
