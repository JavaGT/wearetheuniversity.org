20 Questions Cullen Must Answer

National's Finance spokesman David Carter is challenging Michael Cullen to provide real answers on how Labour intends enhancing New Zealand's future economic prospects.

Mr Carter has issued Dr Cullen a list of 20 questions asking for Labour's proposals to increase growth.

"Dr Cullen is always quick to give smug, glib answers on totally irrelevant issues. However, he's been far less forthcoming in explaining just how Labour will achieve anything near the 4 per cent growth our economy needs to get ahead.

"The reality is that for the past two years the Labour/Alliance Government has ridden on the back of a low dollar, favourable climatic conditions and high commodity prices and has no plans for taking New Zealand forward.

"All the economic indicators point to a sharp decline in our economic outlook, with the latest forecasts predicting annual growth to fall to 2 per cent in the next year. While Dr Cullen makes all the right noises about increasing growth, his rhetoric is simply not matched by any plan of action."

Mr Carter says unlike Labour, National has a serious and substantial economic plan, which is focused on increasing New Zealand's long-term, sustainable growth rate.

"Today's Business New Zealand survey confirms that National's economic framework will be far better for growth than Labour's.

"I challenge Dr Cullen to answer each of these important questions," Mr Carter says.
