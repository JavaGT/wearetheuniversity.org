Govt must commit to urgent action over killer highway

National MP Paul Hutchison is calling on the Government to pull its head out of the sand and commit to a plan to four-lane the state highway between Pokeno and Thames.

“Yesterday’s serious bus crash involving three vehicles would almost certainly have been prevented if the road was four-laned.

“Over the past few years, this killer highway has claimed 40 lives and has been the site of countless serious accidents.

“The road has been described by locals as a ‘gauntlet of death’, yet Labour continues to ignore their pleas to upgrade it.”

Dr Hutchison says despite numerous letters to Transit, successive Labour Ministers of Transport and a petition by local people to Parliament, the Labour Government has failed to ensure New Zealand’s most dangerous state highway is made safer.

“This is a Third World road in the new millennium. It is an unacceptable disgrace.

“The least the Government can do is commit to a four-lane highway between Pokeno and Thames.

“All the Labour Government has done is a series of patch-up jobs on the road. The area around Maramarua won’t be done for 15 years and the major portion of the highway has no commitment plan.

“This work must be fast-tracked or there will be more preventable deaths.”

ENDS
