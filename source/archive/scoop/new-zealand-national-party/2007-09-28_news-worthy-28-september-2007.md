News Worthy

28 September 2007 - No. 126

  
Allegations of mendacity

Last week the Speaker ruled that the use of the phrase "tell the truth" was unparliamentary. The consequence is that those who use the phrase will be asked to withdraw the comment and apologise.

Some would say that would akin to being "slapped on the wrist with a wet bus ticket".

The Standing Orders of Parliament specifically prohibit imputations of improper motives against a member, offensive references to a member's private affairs and all personal reflections.

It is a clear personal reflection to accuse another member of lying or attempting to deliberately mislead the House. Accusing a member of lying is a mode of expression that has been consistently ruled out of order.

A glance through the amalgamated index of hansard (which records the Parliamentary debates) for 2006 contains multiple references to unparliamentary language including phrases such as "lie like troopers", "lied to the House", "lying little turd", "pathological bully, liar and pervert".

"Tell the truth" has now been added to the list. An allegation of mendacity would still seem permissible.

  
The grandees of Auckland

So said a speaker in the debate on the recently introduced Auckland Regional Amenities Funding Bill.

The Bill proposes that some eleven entities receive regional funding through a levy imposed on the constituent local authorities - Auckland City, Franklin District, Manukau City, North Shore City, Papakura District, Rodney District and Waitakere City.

There is precedent for that course - the Auckland Museum and MOTAT are funded on a levy basis.

An interesting starting point is that if Auckland were one city like Brisbane (which has a comparable population) the issue would not spark discontent.

A number of questions arise about the Bill. Leave aside whether regional amenities should be funded regionally for reasons of equity. Here are some other questions:

\* Who should be on the list of beneficiaries - that proposed list currently includes NZ Opera Ltd and the Auckland Observatory and Planetarium Trust Board. Should Kapa Haka organisations be included?

\* Is a levy the best mechanism? Other possibilities range from borrowing by local authorities which generally have strong balance sheets to simply raising funds by rate.

\* Should the contributing catchments be necessarily defined by local authority boundaries? The southern part of Franklin for example has a greater affinity with the Waikato than the Auckland region.

The Bill has now been refereed to the Local Government & Environment Select Committee and submissions will be sought.
