National Party Candidate College to be launched

The National Party is tomorrow launching a Candidate College, designed to identify and prepare potential National Party MPs.

"The Candidate College will greatly assist people to prepare themselves for selection," says National Party President Judy Kirk.

"Enrolment in the College gives people interested in becoming candidates an opportunity to participate in training days and to receive valuable mentoring prior to seeking selection.

"It is an exciting initiative that promises to ensure high quality candidates are always available for election campaigns," says Mrs Kirk.

The Candidate College is one of the programmes that arose out of National's strategic review that was completed earlier this year. The launch of the College will take place at 5.30pm tomorrow evening in the Party's Parliament Caucus Room.
