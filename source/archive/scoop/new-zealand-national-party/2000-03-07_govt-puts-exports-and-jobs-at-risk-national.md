Govt Policy Puts $82.7 Million Exports And 12,000 Jobs At Risk

Thousands of jobs in regional New Zealand are at-risk from Labour's forestry policies according to the Furniture Association of New Zealand. National is calling on the Government to rethink its policies opposed to sustainable forestry on the West Coast.

"Our furniture exports rose 29% to $82.7 million last year. The Furniture Association is doubtful whether it can sustain that growth, or even survive because of Labour's policy on sustainable logging of West Coast rimu.

"New Zealand is a world leader in sustainable logging practices. The monitoring and management of the forest ensured it was environmentally sound and had the support of many industry experts.

"The Government should be focussed on creating sustainable jobs through a sustainable industry rather than creating artificial jobs by using taxpayers money for regional investment," Mr Ryall said.
