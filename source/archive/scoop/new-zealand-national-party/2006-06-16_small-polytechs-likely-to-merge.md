Small polytechs likely to merge

Small polytechs likely to merge

Tertiary Education Minister Michael Cullen today signalled that small polytechs are likely to be merged as they face continued financial uncertainty, says National's Education spokesman, Bill English.

Dr Cullen was responding to questioning at select committee about the Government's expectation that up to 15 polytechnics will get into financial trouble in the next 12 months.

"Dr Cullen said the possibility of polytechs merging remains an 'open question' and he is more concerned about provision of learning than about the institutions,” says Mr English.

“This is a sure sign he is looking seriously at mergers where smaller polytechs get into trouble.

"Unfortunately, Dr Cullen quoted Wanganui as an example of a merger, but that has been a disaster, both for the polytech and for Wanganui.

"The merger of Wanganui Polytech and UCOL in Palmerston North in 2001 has brought none of the expected financial benefits, and now student numbers are dropping."

New Zealand's smallest polytechs are Telford, Aoraki (Timaru), Northland, (Whangarei) Tairawhiti (Gisborne), NMIT (Nelson and Marlborough), Bay of Plenty (Tauranga), Waiariki (Rotorua), EIT (Hawke's Bay) Tai Poutini (South Westland), Whitireia (Porirua) and SIT (Invercargill).
