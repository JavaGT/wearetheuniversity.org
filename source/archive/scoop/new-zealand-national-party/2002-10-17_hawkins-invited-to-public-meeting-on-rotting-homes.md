Hawkins invited to public meeting on rotting homes

National Housing Spokesperson Dr Wayne Mapp says it is time Internal Affairs Minister George Hawkins took the issue of rotting homes seriously.

“Not only has Mr Hawkins mislead Parliament about when he first knew about this issue, he is playing down its significance by claiming only a handful of homes are affected. Today he told Parliament he does not know the scale of the problem.

“If Mr Hawkins took the issue seriously he would know the large scale of this problem. Hundreds of people have turned out to National’s public meetings and thousands have contacted our website.

“I invite Mr Hawkins to our eighth public meeting on Monday evening in the North Shore. The Minister says the Government is solution-focussed about this issue. In light of that, I have written to him today inviting him to come along and speak to the meeting.

“The meetings we are holding, where experts address the public, have been very successful in airing peoples’ concerns and discussing solutions. The Minister would better understand how big this problem really is if he came and talked to the people affected,” Dr Mapp said.

The meeting will be held at the Baptist Church Auditorium in Dodson Ave, Milford at 7.30pm, Monday 21 October.
