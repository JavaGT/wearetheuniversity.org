For immediate release

National Youth Vice President joins student protest

Canterbury University Students took to the streets today to demonstrate against mounting student debt.

"I joined over 2000 of my fellow students marching through Christchurch protesting over the massive increase in student debt," National's Youth Vice President Grant Tyrrell stated.

"Students are feeling betrayed by this government. Labour promised to attack student debt but instead debt has exploded. It is now running at over $5 billion - an increase of over $2 billion dollars in less than three years.

"Students are rightfully sceptical about Labour promises this election and were outraged that neither Helen Clark or Steve Mahery could be bothered turning up.

"Bill English by contrast fronted up and National's You Stay We Pay scheme was well received. Under a National-led government graduates will get 10% of their student loans written off for the first five years that they work in New Zealand. This will be a tangible saving of thousands of dollars and years of repayment time for most students.

"National is the only party fronting up to students - on July 27 a vote for National is a vote for a better future," Grant Tyrrell concluded.
