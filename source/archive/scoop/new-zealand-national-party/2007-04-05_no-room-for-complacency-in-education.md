No room for complacency in education

No room for complacency in education

National Party Education spokeswoman Katherine Rich is urging principals to take some time over the long weekend and actually read John Key's speech about lifting standards in primary school education.

\"I'm startled by the number of principals who are reacting to hearsay and misinformation being spread by National's political opponents. I challenge those critics to actually read the speech and engage in an informed debate."

The National Party has already rejected claims that its policies are a precursor to a new mass testing regime, or would lead to the publication of league tables.

"These have been the main criticisms. But the claims are unfounded, and in some cases just misleading."

Mrs Rich says National plans to let schools choose from a range of existing assessment tools, but then to use that information to develop national standards.

"All the parents I speak to are crying out for better information about how their child is doing at school. We need to confront and address failure earlier. Secondary schools shouldn't be left to pick up the pieces."

Mrs Rich says the recent Education Review Office report reveals that too many schools are not effectively using the data they're collecting. National also refuses to be complacent about figures that show one in five students is not succeeding at school.

"I've been following some of the comments in recent days. Alarmingly, one report today says 'principals were happy with the present primary education system and saw no need to change it'.

"I worry for our kids when those who educate them believe that failing one in five students is acceptable.

"John Key has set his sights higher than that. Our children deserve no less."
