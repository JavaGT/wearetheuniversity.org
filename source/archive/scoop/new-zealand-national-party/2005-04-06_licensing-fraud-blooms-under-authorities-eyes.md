Licensing fraud blooms under authorities' watchful eyes

National's Asian Relationships spokeswoman, Pansy Wong, confirmed today in Parliament that advertisements promoting driving scams are still appearing in ethnic newspapers.

"I find it shocking that these illegal advertisements are still appearing almost two months after Land Transport New Zealand claimed that it began investigating this issue," says Mrs Wong.

"Today I tabled a letter containing examples of overseas students offering driving lessons and selling international driver licences, and interpreters helping students cheat on their theory tests.

"Concerns about these practices have been raised by the letter writers - a group of registered driving instructors - with Land Transport New Zealand, the New Zealand Immigration Service and the Police since 2003.

"I have forwarded this letter, which contains the details of individual offenders, widespread problems in the licensing system and proposed solutions, to the Minister for Transport Safety, Immigration and the Police for them to follow up.

"For the safety of all New Zealanders, immediate action needs to be taken, and the authorities need to uphold the law, and make sure the people behind that the scams are apprehended," says Mrs Wong.
