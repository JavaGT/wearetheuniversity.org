Perhaps Labour needs reminding

National Party Families spokeswoman Judith Collins has released a series of quotes in a bid to \"remind the Labour Government what they used to say about golden handshakes."

She is commenting on the secret pay-out given to Families Commission chief executive Claire Austin, who worked at the commission for only three months.

"I'm not prepared to wait until the annual report. Why can't Steve Maharey come clean with the public now?

"If Helen Clark was consistent she would be calling for Rajen Prasad's head, especially given her comments on the settlement with former TVNZ newsreader John Hawkesby," says Ms Collins.

"The public was septic about golden handshakes as am I," - Helen Clark Nelson Mail Oct 06, 2001.

On the out of court settlement with John Yelash where details were kept secret "the confidentiality clauses drawn up by Miss Clark's lawyers are so tight that the parties cannot even confirm the existence of a settlement," - The Dominion 11 May 2001.

"In principle we don't like golden handshakes,"- Helen Clark The Dominion August 08, 2000.
