Carter clanger reveals Schools Plus is years away

  
Education Minister Chris Carter has let slip that Labour’s much heralded Schools Plus initiative will not be implemented for at least a further three years, says National’s Education spokeswoman, Anne Tolley.

Schools and teacher unions are boycotting the new policy, which will see the school leaving age raised from 16 to 18, because they say they are already under-funded.

“In the Education and Science Select Committee this morning, Chris Carter, under intense pressure, admitted that the policy would not be fully implemented until at least 2011.

“When Chris Carter announced this policy in February he said ‘Schools Plus will result in more students participating in education or workplace training, and more students gaining higher qualifications.’

“This is clearly policy on the hoof and so typical of Labour’s paper shuffling. They make a big announcement; then follow it with years of consultation and no discernible action.

“It’s so far in the future that nearly all students at high school now will be long gone by the time his policy even kicks off, if indeed it ever does.

“Yesterday in the House, he refused to say when Schools Plus would start. Today’s revelation proves he knew it was at least three years away but he was not prepared to admit it.”
