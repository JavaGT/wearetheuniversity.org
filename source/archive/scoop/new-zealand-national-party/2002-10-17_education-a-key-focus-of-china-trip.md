Education a key focus of China trip

Hon Bill English - National Party Leader

National Party Leader Bill English is looking forward to his first ever trip to China when he flies out this Friday. He has been invited by the Chinese Government to lead a delegation of 14 people, including National MP Pansy Wong, scientists and business people.

Mr English will visit Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing and during this time will be received by a top Chinese leader Mr Wei Jianxing.

“I will be discussing a number of issues, such as Chinese visitors and overseas students to New Zealand, says Mr English.

“I am particularly looking forward to celebrating the 30-year anniversary of diplomatic relations between New Zealand and China, which is a major milestone.

“It will be good to speak to those involved in the education sector about overseas students coming to New Zealand, and I am looking forward to giving a key address to parents, teachers and students at one particular school.

“Also I am keen to expand my knowledge of the joint ventures between New Zealand and China and I am honoured to have been asked to lay the foundation stone for a joint health research technology park situated in Nantong, near Shanghai,” says Mr English.

Mr English’s wife, Mary, will accompany him on the seven-day visit to China and included in the delegation is Professor Yi Huia Gao, who is joint owner of the health research technology park.
