CTU wants tax change now

"Labour has faced an embarrassing attack from within on the issue of tax threshold changes," says National Party Finance spokesman John Key.

"Even the Labour Party's staunchest allies, the Council of Trade Unions, is secretly telling Michael Cullen to bring forward his miserly tax threshold tinkering from 2008 to next year."

The revelations are contained in secret briefing papers obtained by the National Party.

"The CTU's previous opposition to National's programme for tax relief has been laid bare as nothing more than blind ideology. Secretly, they think Dr Cullen's got it wrong.

"The Labour Government has been a profligate spender of taxpayer money, with little or no oversight in many cases. It has presided over nine interest rate rises in the past two years.

"The excesses have also been confirmed in Treasury papers which highlight poor quality spending decisions and point to a productivity collapse in the public sector.

"Unfortunately for workers, Dr Cullen has spent the bank on Labour's bizarre collection of election policies, including a massive transfer of wealth from taxpayers to students through its 'no interest' loans policy," says Mr Key.
