Give teachers tools to deal with problem students

Teachers need more options for dealing with badly behaved students says National Party Education spokesman Bill English.

He is commenting on reports from teachers today that they are now routinely dealing with violence in secondary school classrooms.

“The philosophy of inclusion dictates every student has to be in the classroom all the time, but it simply doesn’t work when student behaviour becomes extremely disruptive.

“Our society can't, and shouldn’t, expect teachers to deal with threatening knife wielding students.”

Mr English says research has shown that bad behaviour is the main reason teachers leave the profession early and disruptive behaviour in the classroom has been shown to have a negative impact on their classmates’ learning.

“Every school has to set standards for behaviour, but when that behaviour becomes extreme, schools need more options for dealing with problem students.

“Teachers deserve support from a community which takes responsibility for social issues and delivers teachers better tools for dealing with badly behaved students,” says Mr English.
