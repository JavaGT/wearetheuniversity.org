Hutchison to take Labour to task over health

National's new Health spokesman, Paul Hutchison, says he looks forward to taking Labour to task over its inefficient and overly bureaucratic health system.

National's leader, Don Brash, today named Dr Hutchison as Health spokesman, taking over from Judith Collins, who moves into the Welfare portfolio.

"Labour has increased health spending by over $3 billion since 1999 and yet tens of thousands of New Zealanders are unable to get the healthcare they need, or even get on a waiting list," says Dr Hutchison.

"It is vital that every scarce health dollar is put to best use and National is determined to restore the financial disciplines necessary and to weed out the inefficiencies.

"National is also committed to ensuring there is choice, and that the private sector is used widely, with health contracts awarded based on best quality and price.

"I am particularly interested in ensuring there is emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention, with programmes integrated into life-long education," says Dr Hutchison.

As a former specialist obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr Hutchison says he regards it as fundamental that children's health is focused on as a national priority.
