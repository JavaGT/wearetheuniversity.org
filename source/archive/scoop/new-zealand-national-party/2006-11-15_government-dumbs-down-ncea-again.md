Government dumbs down NCEA – again

National’s Education spokesman, Bill English, says the Labour Government has dropped an NCEA measure essential to ensuring students are motivated and successful.

His comments follow schools receiving official notification that the grade point average has been dropped.

Mr English says this measure summarised all NCEA grades for each student into one percentage-type figure.

“NZQA was always against the grade point average because it was too much like a solid mark.

“Parents and employers want some kind of summary information that tells them what the long list of individual standards adds up to. Abolishing the GPA is a step backwards at a time when the wider community wants more quality information about student achievement and NCEA, not less information.

“Labour should have retained the GPA. For motivated students who complete all their exams it is a relevant summary of their achievement.

“It’s time for the Government to accept that it’s parents and students who should determine how NCEA is reported, not a Government dedicated to mediocrity,” says Mr English.
