Stunning about-face on loan costings

National Party Finance spokesman John Key says "Labour has changed its story" on the costings for its student loan policy.

On August 03, the New Zealand Herald reported the following: 'Helen Clark and Dr Cullen confirmed the Treasury would not be costing the policy because it was Labour Party and not Government policy'.

And last night Helen Clark repeated that on the Leaders debate - 'we don't ask Treasury for permission for our policies'.

"Yet today, Dr Cullen claims the loans scheme was costed, twice, although he won't release the papers.

"Why not, Dr Cullen?

"If the numbers stack up, Dr Cullen should have no difficulty releasing those costings for proper public scrutiny. He should also have no difficulty waving the usual waiting time for Official Information.

"His refusal to do so poses more questions, especially in light of yesterday's home equity scheme announcement, which was launched without any supporting paperwork.

"The public of New Zealand deserve to know whether Dr Cullen and Labour are writing cheques using taxpayer money, without considering the longer term consequences for our economy," says Mr Key.
