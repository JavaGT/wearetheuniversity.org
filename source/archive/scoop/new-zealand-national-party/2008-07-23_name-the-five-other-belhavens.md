Name the five other ‘Belhavens’
===============================

National Party Associate Health Spokeswoman

Name the five other ‘Belhavens’

The National Party is calling for spot checks of resthomes and a major review of auditing following the Health Minister’s alarming comments that there are as many as five homes in the same league as Auckland’s Belhaven.

“Many thousands of New Zealanders rely on safe elder-care facilities. David Cunliffe should release the names of the five other resthomes he knows about so families can know their seniors are in good hands,” says National’s Associate Health spokeswoman Jo Goodhew.

She is commenting after reports in The Press this week suggested there were five other resthomes which fell into the Belhaven category, where a resident was gagged.

“Why is Mr Cunliffe trying to protect the reputations of operators he knows to be of poor quality? By hiding their identities, he is casting a shadow across the entire sector.

“The National Party supports spot checks on resthomes, and a comprehensive review of the auditing process.

“Why hasn’t the Minister opted to follow National’s lead on this? Random spot checks would send a strong message to resthome operators that to stay open they have to maintain standards 100 per cent of the time.

“Given that Labour’s had nine years to do something about it, Mr Cunliffe should be up front about the dodgy operators and tell the public what he’s doing to ensure the safety and health of our senior citizens.”
