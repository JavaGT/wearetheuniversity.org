Labour will have to shrink Grammar zone

  
National's Education spokesman, Bill English, says Steve Maharey will have to shrink the Auckland Grammar zone if he is to make good on Labour's promise that all kids can attend their local school.

He is commenting on reports that Auckland Grammar has started turning students away as it has reached its capacity.

Labour's school zoning policy requires schools to accept enrolments from all students resident in their zone.

"With Auckland Grammar bursting at the seems Steve Maharey clearly cannot honour that policy,” says Mr English.

"He is left with no option but to remove some streets from the exclusive zone so the school can accommodate all the students in the smaller zone.

"Families who have paid top dollar for houses in the Auckland Grammar zone, expecting their kids to get into the school, will not to be happy to find Labour is now planning on taking that entitlement away," says Mr English.
