Party Pills Petition Goes Nationwide

Otago MP Jacqui Dean is confident a petition seeking legislative changes surrounding the sale and marketing of party pills revised will soon exceed 5000 signatures.

“What started out as a petition launched in Oamaru has now gone nationwide attracting widespread support from people from all walks of life.

“Their feedback strengthens my resolve to see changes made quickly in this area before buying party pills at a local dairy becomes as acceptable as buying an ice cream,” she said.

Around 4,200 signatures have been collected from as fair a field as Southland and the Coromandel. Mrs Dean is also due to speak at public meeting in Balclutha this week with colleague and Clutha-Southland MP Bill English following community concerns over the sale of party pills.

“It defies all logic that we are creating an environment that enables young people, children in some cases, to buy and use drugs we know so little about.

“What’s worse is these drugs are often cleverly marketed to young people as a precursor to much harder and more insidious forms of recreational drug taking,” Mrs Dean said.

Over recent months Mrs Dean has met with representatives from a range of organisations with an interest in the sale of party pills. This includes Social Tonics NZ, the Foundation for Alcohol and Drug Education and the NZ Drug Foundation.

Mrs Dean will present a petition to Parliament early next month seeking a review of the classification of party pills and for the review to encompass the health, psychological, social and community safety impacts of those substances.
