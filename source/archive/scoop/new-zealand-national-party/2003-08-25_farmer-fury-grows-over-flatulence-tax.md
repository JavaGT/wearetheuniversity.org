Farmer fury grows over flatulence tax

National Leader Bill English says the Government has badly underestimated the growing anger of farmers over the ridiculous 'flatulence tax'.

"I haven't seen this sort of outcry from farmers since SMPs were abolished in 1985," says Mr English, who addressed a rally protesting against the tax in Invercargill yesterday.

"A big rally in Hamilton on Friday, a thousand people on the march in Invercargill yesterday - this is real anger," says Mr English.

"The rural sector's had enough of a government that has cruised on agriculture's strong performance of the last four years - and repaid it by burdening it with rising costs, taxation and regulation.

"Farmers are already bearing the brunt of many of Labour's 18 new taxes - and this stupid flatulence tax won't be the last."

Mr English told the rally that National would repeal the tax.

"Invercargill MP Mark Peck's failed attempt to capture the crowd yesterday shows farmers are no longer prepared to pay for Labour's ideological extravagance.

"And clearly other political parties support this stand, with a show of unity of centre-right parties at the rally, including United Future.

"The anger shown by farmers at these meetings around the country draws a parallel with the rising anger of ratepayers over unnecessary and punitive taxes.

"Our message to farmers is to keep saying no to this ridiculous tax - Helen Clark will buckle.

"Just like Margaret Thatcher's unpopular Poll Tax - in the end, she buckled," says Mr English.
