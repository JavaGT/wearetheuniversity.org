End of an era for Air Force Museum?

National's Defence spokesman, Dr Wayne Mapp wants to know what's being done to keep the Ohakea Air Force museum open and running.

The museum is due to shut its doors on April 15.

"Locals have poured thousands of dollars into the museum and donated treasured pieces of memorabilia. Now the items on display are being boxed up and sent to Christchurch for storage.

"Many locals also fear that a garden memorial for fallen airmen will be paved over.

"The museum is rich in history. The building itself is one of the few surviving pre-war wooden mess halls.

"The Prime Minister has placed emphasis on New Zealand's military history in the past. Has her Ministry of Culture and Heritage been approached about the Ohakea Museum?

"The role of the Air Force base and its links to the wider community is a key part of the region's heritage - so what's being done to attempt to keep it open?"
