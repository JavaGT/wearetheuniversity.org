National selects Nuk Korako as Port Hills candidate

  
The National Party has selected local businessman and iwi leader Nuk Korako as its Port Hills candidate for the 2014 General Election.

Mr Korako was selected by a meeting of local party members this evening.

“The Port Hills electorate changed significantly in the recent boundary changes. Nuk has the genuine links to communities across Christchurch and the electorate to be a strong voice for Port Hills,” said Regional Chair Roger Bridge.

“We’re excited to have a candidate of Nuk’s calibre in Port Hills and will be running a strong campaign for the seat.”

Mr Korako said he was proud to earn National’s nomination and is looking forward to the campaign.

“Christchurch communities and whanau have been through a lot since 2010, but National has stood by Canterbury at every stage of the rebuild,” said Mr Korako.

“Southern Christchurch is experiencing strong growth and many unique challenges. I want to give communities across the seat a strong voice in John Key’s National Party as we rebuild our city.”

Mr Korako is of Ngai Tahu descent. He is married to Chris and is a father of four sons.

He balances the running of his own tourism consultancy with a range of community and iwi commitments.

Mr Korako currently sits on the Board of Cholmonderley Children’s Home and the Cholmonderley New Building Komiti, and sits on the Banks Peninsula Environmental Trust, Te Ihutai Ahuwhenua Trust, and the Torotoroa Trust.

His tribal commitments include the Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu Board (Tribal Governance Arm) and the Ngai Tahu Holdings Corporation Board (Tribal Commercial Arm).
