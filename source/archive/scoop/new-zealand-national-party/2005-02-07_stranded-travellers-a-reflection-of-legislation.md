Stranded travellers a harsh reflection of legislation

National's Industrial Relations spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says a stop-work meeting by Stagecoach bus drivers in Auckland, leaving thousands of people stranded, is a harsh reflection of Labour's industrial relations legislation.

"Stop-work meetings and strike action cost our essential services, and our economy, millions of dollars each year," says Dr Mapp.

"Auckland commuters now know first-hand of the disruptions and loss of productivity that occur when unions decide to stop work."

Almost 33,000 commuters were affected by the meeting, with only a small number of non-union drivers to take up the slack.

"For this country's biggest city, and the hub of the economy, the effect of strike action would be even worse," says Dr Mapp.

"Constant strike action is exactly the kind of thing that Labour's industrial relations legislation will deliver, and it will come at great cost to the economy.

"The legislation also means that employers and workers are virtually powerless, while unions decide the terms of negotiation."

Dr Mapp says National will strip out the monopoly powers of the unions under the Employment Relations Act and remove the 'us' versus 'them' nature of industrial law.
