Minister urged to save museum

National’s Defence spokesman, Wayne Mapp, says the one-month stay of execution given to the Ohakea Air Force museum, must be used wisely.

The museum, which houses important Air Force memorabilia, was due to be closed on Saturday due to uncertainty over the site it is on, but the public outcry has caused a re-think.

“It’s a pity the board hasn’t consulted the community before now, but they must do so in the next month.

“And it’s well past time the Minister of Culture and Heritage got involved.

“Where has Judith Tizard been while this historical collection is being boxed up?

“It’s her job to preserve such treasures so all New Zealanders can access them.

“The Minister should be meeting the local mayors to find a solution that will allow the collection to stay in the region.”

“Locals have spent thousands of dollars on the museum and donated much of the collection; therefore it is only right that such a valuable historical treasure remain with the people whose efforts made it possible.”
