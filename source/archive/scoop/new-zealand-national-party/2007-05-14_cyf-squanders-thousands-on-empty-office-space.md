CYF squanders thousands on empty office space

The Minister for Child, Youth and Family needs to explain why her Government is wasting scarce resources leasing a whole floor of vacant offices in Dunedin's Philip Laing House, says National MP Katherine Rich. "Monthly lease payments for the empty offices are estimated to be $11,000 per month and there is still no confirmed date for the space to be used.

"CYF has been leasing these since November last year - that's an estimated $70,000 that could have been much better spent. "Our local Child, Youth and Family team works hard to provide services for our children in need. What's needed is support for Dunedin's social workers at the front line, not money wasted on flash offices that no one's using.

"Ruth Dyson needs to front up with an explanation of how this squandering of taxpayers money is addressing our nation's appalling child abuse record and resource issues here in Dunedin."
