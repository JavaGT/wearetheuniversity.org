New graduate school to boost Hutt ICT sector

  
National List MP based in the Hutt Valley Chris Bishop is applauding the announcement of a new Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Graduate School hosted by the Wellington Institute of Technology (WelTec) along with Victoria University and Whitireia.

“This successful collaborative proposal for an ICT Graduate School will support the Hutt and the wider Wellington region’s connectivity to our burgeoning ICT sector,” says the National List MP.

“ICT is a big part of the Hutt’s future as the home of ‘Technology Valley’. Over 3,900 people across more than 825 Lower Hutt businesses are employed full-time in the high-tech sector, and the sector generates $473 million in GDP already.

“The new ICT Grad School will work with local technology businesses to provide industry focused education. This will equip graduate with the technical skills sought by businesses.

“It will provide a vital link between our fast-moving hi-tech industries and tertiary education providers, providing a pipeline of graduates with the skills and research capacity to ensure Hutt ICT companies thrive.

The Wellington ICT Graduate School will join the Auckland and Christchurch Schools that were announced in July to deliver more of the skilled ICT graduates that New Zealand needs.

“The Government has committed $28.6 million over four years for the development and delivery of three ICT Graduate School, including one based in the Wellington region.

Mr Bishop says the new ICT Grad School is a big boost for the concept of “Technology Valley’ – where science, technology and high value manufacturing drive economic growth, new jobs and higher wages for Hutt residents.
