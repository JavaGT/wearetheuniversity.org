Adequacy of Central Otago flood package remains to be seen

Otago MP Gavan Herlihy says he's pleased the Government has delivered in part on the process for dealing with the Central Otago floods started by the previous National Government.

"The previous Government appointed and funded Flood Solutions Co-ordinator Alex Adams following the disastrous November 1999 flood.

"However, the community's decision as to whether what's been announced today is an adequate package will depend on next week's announcement by the Regional Development Minister on the amenities and commercial enhancement parts of the Flood Remedial Package - estimated, after extensive work by the Central Otago District Council to total just over $6M.

"I acknowledge the contribution of Contact Energy Limited, which undoubtedly had a role to play in the funding package. Their responsible attitude should go some way to repairing the dysfunctional relationship between the Alexandra community and Contact Energy which has existed since the 1994 flood.

"It is less than clear in the new Deed signed between Government and Contact Energy Limited, whether there is any local representation or input into the "Oversight Committee" set up by the two funding bodies. It is imperative that the Alexandra community has some input into the implementation phase of the package.

"One hopes that next week's announcement by Mr Anderton when he visits Alexandra, will be a positive one in order that the Alexandra community may rebuild confidence in their town and put behind them the memories of last year's disastrous flood," Mr Herlihy said.
