What is the Government planning for Waikato DHB?

What is the Government planning for Waikato DHB?

The Government needs to provide clarity on its plan for rural health and communicate with Waikato DHB to ensure that they can prepare for any possible future advances in their medical school bid, MP for Waikato Tim van de Molen says.

“The previous National Government had committed to establishing a School of Rural Medicine within the next three years, however, this Government has been completely silent on the matter,” Mr van de Molen says.

“Waikato DHB have had no correspondence from the Minister with regard to their medical school bid and the plans are languishing at the bottom of the pile, preventing the DHB from planning for the future.

“The Health Minister needs to provide certainty around Waikato DHBs ambition to establish a rural school of medicine that will train much-needed GPs for rural areas.

“We know that there is a shortage of rural GPs and that this will continue to worsen over the next 10 years as current GPs retire. A third medical school focusing on rural training is vital and will inject much-needed support into rural health.

“National had a plan to respond to this issue but the Government is avoiding it after spending its time and money on free tertiary education and issues like medicinal marijuana.

“The Minister has not visited the DHB at all and is kicking the can down the road on this issue. It’s time for him to walk the talk and ensure that those living in rural areas have access to better healthcare.”
