Inquiry into Lyttleton marina disaster
======================================

**Sunday, 15 October 2000, 3:44 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand National Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_National_Party)**

The inquiry launched by the Banks Peninsula District Council into the disintegration of the Lyttleton marina is a great start but needs to be widened to include the finding of safe marina facilities for recreational boaties," National List MP for Banks Peninsula David Carter said today.

"The devastation of Thursday's storm has not only wrecked the marina, but also the confidence of recreational boaties in Canterbury's ability to provide adequate facilities in our province.

"The terms of reference of the inquiry must be widened to include the identification of a safe location for a marina so this sort of disaster doesn't happen again.

"To date, the Lyttleton Port Company and its controlling shareholder, Christchurch City Council, have shunted too much responsibility for marina facilities onto the Banks Peninsula District Council. They will have to get involved in the identification of a safe facility servicing the region of Canterbury.

"There is also a role for Central Government that can't be ignored.

"Some attention must now be given to recreational issues. The situation in Lyttleton is unique. It may require a compromise between the vested interests of commercial port activity and recreational usage.

"While the marina disaster was heartbreaking for the boat owners, it has served as a wake-up call for the port company and both local and central government.

"Something positive can come out of this and I want to work with everyone involved to ensure recreational boaties have the facilities they need in our province," Mr Carter said.
