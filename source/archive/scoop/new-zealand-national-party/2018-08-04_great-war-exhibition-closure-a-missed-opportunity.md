Great War Exhibition closure a missed opportunity
=================================================

The closure of the Great War Exhibition is very sad news and a missed opportunity to build on our national site of remembrance, National’s spokesperson for Arts, Culture and Heritage Nicky Wagner and National List MP based in Wellington Nicola Willis say.

“The exhibition, including the recent ‘Quinn’s Post Trench’ exhibit, is an honest account of New Zealand’s role in First World War with real, confronting, human stories being shared,” Ms Wagner says.

“It gives an amazing insight into a conflict that played a major role in the shaping of our nation as well as the modern world as we know it.

“While the original lease agreement with Massey was set to expire, there was an opportunity to extend the exhibit and look to add in more displays on New Zealand’s role in other conflicts and peacekeeping efforts since 1919.

“But we have missed that opportunity and now the fate of the exhibition seems to be sealed.”

“This is a loss for Wellington. The exhibition is a unique tourist attraction and was made possible by the goodwill of many. It seems a waste of effort and resource to end it so soon,” Ms Willis says.

“With about four months remaining, we must make sure as many Kiwis as possible make a visit to this site and experience the exhibition while it is still open.

“It is a credit to its creators and the philanthropists such as Sir Peter Jackson who donated personal items, professional services and money to make it possible. Sometimes I feel we have been a bit ungrateful for their contributions.”

The Great War Exhibit will close on 2 December 2018, and is located in the former Dominion Museum Building in Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington.
