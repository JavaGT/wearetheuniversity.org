National: getting Auckland moving

**National: getting Auckland moving**

The National Party will continue to build on its track record of delivering promptly on the transport projects needed to get our largest city moving – socially and economically.

Transport spokesman Steven Joyce says Auckland ’s future economic growth relies on continuing investment in road and rail.

“National is investing more than a billion dollars each year on road and rail in Auckland – creating more jobs and higher incomes,” he says.

”Already we have funded and finished the Victoria Park Tunnel – which will get rid of one the cities worst bottlenecks. After decades of debate about the Waterview Connection we have finally provided certainty on how that vital project will proceed and we’re doing it for about half the price of Labour’s proposed route.

“In terms of rail we have completed train station upgrades and double-tracking of the Western Line, and started the $500 million upgrade and electrification of Auckland ’s rail network. We’ve also done a deal with Auckland City which means rail users will get 50% more new electric trains than originally planned.

“National has increased the capacity of state highways and commuter rail. Our increased investment will boost economic growth and productivity over the next four or five years, and achieve a step change in the way Aucklanders get around their city.

“By improving access to the CBD, the airport, the port and our regional economies, we will make it easier for Aucklanders to get to work and easier for Auckland ’s products to get to markets both here and around the world.”

“Beyond the current range of projects, National will commit to further investment in transport in Auckland where projects have sound businesses cases that clearly show they will reduce congestion and encourage economic growth.”

By contrast, Labour are saying they would:

• Reverse hypothecation, meaning fuel tax will be diverted to pay for non-roading related projects.  
• Abandon motorway improvements, increasing congestion and slowing the economy.  
• Add on expensive regional transport charges.

  
Mr Joyce says Auckland simply cannot afford Labour’s poorly thought out transport plans.
