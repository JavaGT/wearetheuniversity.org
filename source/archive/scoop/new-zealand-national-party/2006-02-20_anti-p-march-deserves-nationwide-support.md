Anti-P march deserves nationwide support

National Party MP for Port Waikato Paul Hutchison says the anti-P march from Pukekohe, in his electorate, to Parliament should receive nationwide support and attention.

“The organisers of the campaign, some of whom have had family members suffer from P addiction, should be congratulated for bringing increased attention to a problem that affects every sector of our society,” says Dr Hutchison, who is also National’s spokesman for Policy on Children.

“As a former obstetrician, I have seen the frightening results this drug can have on young mothers and their children.

“The best way to fight the P scourge is for all sectors of the community to unite and rally behind those educating against it and those enforcing the law.

“One marcher told me of her son’s addiction, which began at the age of just 13. Pure methamphetamine is highly addictive and is associated with bizarre and unpredictable behaviour.”

Dr Hutchison says he will join numerous MPs in welcoming the hïkoi to Wellington and marching to Parliament on February 23.
