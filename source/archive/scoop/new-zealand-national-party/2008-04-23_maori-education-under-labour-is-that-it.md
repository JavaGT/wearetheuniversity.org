Maori education under Labour - is that it?

Maori education under Labour - is that it?

Labour's just released Maori Education Strategy Ka Hikitia is just another example of the empty rhetoric that has littered their nine year record in this area says National's Maori Affairs spokesman (Education and TPK), Tau Henare.

"This document is a joke.

"With 46% of Maori boys and 42% of Maori girls leaving school without even the most basic qualification, the Ministry of Education produces a document that says, 'The Ministry is strengthening its approach to using evidence to make decisions'.

"The evidence has been staring Labour in the face for nine years. Its plans, reports, proposals, and strategies have only contributed to the growing bureaucracy at the Ministry - but done nothing for the kids who need help.

"National's policy is crystal clear. Literacy and numeracy will be a priority for every child, and students who decide they do not want to go on to university will be offered hands-on trade training while they are at school.

"Labour has a record of dismal failure in Maori education. They have conducted talkfest after talkfest while 30,000 kids wag school every week.

"National is ambitious for Maori youth. We do not find it acceptable that only two out of three Maori kids take part in any pre-school education and almost half leave school without the skills to succeed.

"Young Maori don't need more reports, they need action."
