**Maungakiekie MP Welcomes Inquiry into Pacific Languages**

MP for Maungakiekie, Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga, welcomes news that the Education and Science select Committee will investigate the current frame works that support Pacific Language in early childhood education.

“ I look forward to the consideration of the role and contribution that the Government, the private sector, and the community and voluntary sector can make in early childhood education, to improve the prevalence and quality of Pacific language in New Zealand,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

In examining this question, the terms of reference are to:

\- consider any transitional effects from non-compulsory to compulsory sector education, and the implications of this on academic achievement and links with the Pacific education plan

\- consider the overall framework for resourcing Pacific languages in early childhood education including local and international evidence of best practice

\- consider the outcomes that are currently achieved based on the present resourcing of Pasifika early childhood services

\- consider whether there are enough partnerships and opportunities for Government, the private sector, and the community and voluntary sector to collaborate in the early childhood education sector to improve the prevalence and quality of Pacific languages

\- consider whether there are sufficient mechanisms to inform the early childhood education system, using research and feedback on the current uptake and quality of Pacific languages in Pasifika early childhood services

\- consider any pathways to address the findings and recommendations of this inquiry.

“I encourage anyone with an interest in Pasifika education to make a submission before Monday, 25 June 2012,” says Mr Lotu-Iiga.

“For assistance in making a submission, please contact my office on 09 622 0300.
