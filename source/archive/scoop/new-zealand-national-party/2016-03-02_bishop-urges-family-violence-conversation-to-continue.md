**Bishop urges family violence conversation to continue**

Chris Bishop is encouraged by today’s release of the submissions received during a public consultation about the Government’s review of family violence laws. Mr Bishop, the National List MP based in the Hutt Valley, says he is pleased that New Zealanders and Hutt locals are supporting the Government’s call for new and bold ways to address family violence.

“Clearly this is an issue of great importance to the Hutt Valley. Last year, strong attendance at my public meeting with Minister Adams and a thorough question and answer session indicated to me that our community cares strongly about this and is prepared to make bold changes to address family violence,” Mr Bishop says.

“We need a thorough and robust debate on the issue of family violence. This is a serious issue for the Hutt Valley and something that I’m passionate about helping to address. For that reason I’m welcoming the broad support of the ideas for potential change contained in the summary of submissions.

“We need to have this national conversation around how we deal with family violence for the sake of our families and communities. Too many of our children, partners and loved ones are becoming entrenched in a cycle of family violence and we must have an honest conversation about how to address this issue.

“The legal framework being reviewed underpins how agencies, organisations and institutions respond to victims and perpetrators. If we are able to achieve significant reform in this area we have the potential to change the lives of thousands of New Zealanders.”

The discussion document garnered a strong response, with almost 500 detailed submissions received from individuals, groups and organisations. Decisions about specific proposals for law changes will be announced in upcoming months, with a view to introducing a Bill later in the year.

The summary of submissions is available at [https://consultations.justice.govt.nz/policy/family-violence-law](https://consultations.justice.govt.nz/policy/family-violence-law)
