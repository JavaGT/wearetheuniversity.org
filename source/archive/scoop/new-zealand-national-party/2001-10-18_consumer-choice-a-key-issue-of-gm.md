Consumer choice a key issue of GM

National supports the right of consumers to have a choice on genetic modification but the Government is putting that very choice at risk, says National's Consumer Affairs spokesperson, Marie Hasler.

"If the Government allows itself to be swayed by the Greens' implacable stance on a so-called GE Free New Zealand, consumers will miss out on access to new medicines and technologies which can improve our health and our economy.

"It is vital that the Government considers carefully its response to the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification and doesn't allow itself to be compromised by coalition politics.

"National acknowledges the right of consumer choice and the importance of food labelling. The Royal Commission's recommendations provide the framework for this.

"But the Greens don't want choice. Their absolute opposition will see New Zealand turned into a biotechnology backwater, putting thousands of jobs and the viability of our key primary industries at risk," said Ms Hasler.
