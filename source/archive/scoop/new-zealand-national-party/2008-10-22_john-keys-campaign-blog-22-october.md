John Key's Campaign Blog: 22 October

Campaign Blog: 22 October

I had another busy day on the campaign trail yesterday in Hamilton and Auckland.

Following our announcement on the Waikato Expressway in Hamilton, I got out and about in Papatoetoe and Botany. The reaction was heartening.

Not everybody was saying they would vote National of course, but many people were, and I got a fair hearing wherever I went.

A particular issue raised with me consistently by people I met in both areas was law and order.

This is a huge concern for many members of the public I speak to, and yesterday was no exception.

On Monday I announced National's plan to boost frontline police numbers in south Auckland by 300. And since late last year we've also announced policies on parole, policing tools, victims, gangs and the drug ‘P', and youth justice.

Like the economy, I believe law and order is one of the core issues of this election campaign. Security is top of mind for many, many people.

Last night I got a great reception at a public meeting organised by the party at the Pukekohe Town Hall, which was attended by more than 600 people.

Unsurprisingly, there were a number of questions on law and order.

I will have more to say on that issue today when I visit New Plymouth to campaign there.

  
John Key
