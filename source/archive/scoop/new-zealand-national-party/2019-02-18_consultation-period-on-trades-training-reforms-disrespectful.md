Consultation period on trades training reforms disrespectful

Consultation on trades training reforms shows a lack of respect to our communities, National’s Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Spokesperson Shane Reti says.

“The Government has already decided what will happen at the conclusion of the short six week consultation period. The Tomorrow’s Schools consultation is nearly three times longer,” Dr Reti says.

“Already the consultation time is ticking away and yet the face to face community engagement dates are still to be announced, the online survey is not up and the telephone response line is only answering Monday to Friday 9am – 5pm when apprentices are working.

“With 1000 jobs on the line and massive upheaval, at least the Minister could show some respect to the industry. I challenge Education Minister Chris Hipkins to fix this and extend the consultation period by a further six weeks.

“Clearly Mr Hipkins has become encouraged by micro credentials and he now thinks micro consultation is also a good idea. It is not.”
