Violent crime gets worse under Labour

The 2006 crime statistics show the Labour-NZ First Government continues to preside over ever-worsening crime figures, and particularly violent crime, says National's Justice spokesman, Simon Power.

"The Government crows about how it is on top of crime, but in 2006 it increased by 4.1%.

"But most disturbingly, violent crime has continued the upward trend evident since this Government was elected."

Violent crime increased 5% over 2005, with kidnapping and abduction up 30%, robbery 27%, grievous assaults 7.3%, and serious assaults 6.7%.

Since 2000, violent crime has risen by 22%, from 41,573 to 50,731 offences, with kidnapping and abduction up 65%, robbery 57%, grievous assaults 51%, and serious assaults up 25%.

"These figures show a very alarming increase in the intensity of violence across the community, with 10 of the 12 police districts recording increases.

"This is all about crimes against people, and this Government is not delivering safer communities.

"It is clear from these figures that crime is now much nastier, and this is a major concern.

"Labour can use all the excuses they want, but the fact of the matter is that crime - and particularly violent and sex crimes - have risen steadily under them.

"The Government should also be very concerned at increases in crime in places like Counties-Manukau (up 10.5%), Waikato (9.5%), Central (7.4%), Eastern 7%), Waitemata (5.8%).

"With overall crime up in 9 of the 12 police districts, it is clear the problems are not restricted to one or two areas.

"These figures are an indictment on Labour's crime prevention strategies and make a joke of claims they are on top of the problem."

The statistics also show:

\* Sex crimes are up 7.7%, sexual attacks up 13.6%.

\* Burglaries up 6.1%, dishonesty 60%, receiving stolen goods 31%

\* Drugs and anti-social offences up 6%, with busts for new drugs ('P') up 19%.
