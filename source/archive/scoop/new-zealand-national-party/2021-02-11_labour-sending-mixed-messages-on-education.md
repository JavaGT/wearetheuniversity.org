“On the one hand, Associate Education Minister Jan Tinetti says the re-announced curriculum review will focus on ‘wellbeing, identities, language and culture’.

“Well, which is it? Are we going to focus on wellbeing, identities, language and culture; or do we recognise that we need to do something to turn around our capability in maths – the foundation of so many fields of endeavour?

“National suggests a more basic proposition: making sure children are at school.
