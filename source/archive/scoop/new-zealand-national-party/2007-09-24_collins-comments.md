Collins Comments

24 September 2007

At the next election, the Clevedon electorate will cease to exist. This week we will find out exactly what changes will occur and I will send out information to constituents regarding the electorate that they will be part of for the next two elections. Until the next election, I will remain the Member of Parliament for Clevedon.

It appears that the Clevedon electorate will be split into 3, with around 40% forming part of a Howick electorate, another 40% forming part of a Papakura electorate and the balance being part of Hunua which will include Pukekohe and Clevedon village.

From my point of view, the worst thing about these changes is the fact that the Clevedon electorate team will be split and that I will not be able to continue to represent all of the current Clevedon electorate after the next election. I’ll certainly expect to stand in one of the seats created, but unfortunately I can’t be in three places at once!

I’ve been door knocking with the Clevedon electorate team and it has been interesting to find so many people raising with me the debacle surrounding Ahmed Zaoui. People have expressed concern as to how this matter has come to cost New Zealand taxpayers more than $2.6million through no fault of taxpayers.

There is a suspicion expressed that New Zealand is seen as a soft touch and that Mr Zaoui’s decision to come to New Zealand as opposed to remaining Malaysia should be addressed. Every week my office receives immigration requests from people who have stuck by the rules, who have shown that they have skills of value to New Zealand and who want to be New Zealanders. I welcome sensible immigration and if I can assist, I do. I wonder now if I’d be better placed to suggest that they become a media celebrity and rip up their passport.

It will come as a shock to many constituents that according to government figures, 68% of beneficiaries are in debt to Work and Income. This is in addition to the debts owed to finance companies and others. I’ve recently met with budget advisors who have given me examples of beneficiaries with young children, and tens of thousands of debt for car loans, whiteware, student loans and living expenses. Budget advisors often get involved well after the debt has become unmanageable and usually at the insistence of foodbanks. Three years ago, beneficiary debt to Work and Income was 49%. Now it is 68%. I’ll be asking the Minister for his suggestions on how this issue can be addressed and what steps can be taken to prevent more beneficiary families getting into unsustainable debt.
