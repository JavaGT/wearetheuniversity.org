International students need juicier carrot

Labour's latest attempts to woo international students will not do enough to improve New Zealand's attractiveness as a study destination, says National's International Education spokeswoman, Pansy Wong.

"In 2002/03 some 115,201 foreign fee-paying students came to New Zealand and the sector was worth $2.1 billion. During 2006/07 only 90,995 students chose New Zealand as a study destination, resulting in the worth of the sector dropping to $1.29 billion.

"What had been a booming industry for New Zealand has suffered at the hands of Labour's hamfisted approach to this sector and its inconsistent immigration and international education policies.

"These latest policy changes are nothing more than a belated acknowledgement of the value of international students beyond their economic worth.

"International students provide valuable networks and opportunities for our students to study and work alongside different cultures.

"Beyond more money for promotion, and changes to the student visa policy, there need to be improvements to broadband access and pastoral care, which were highlighted in a recent survey on New Zealand's appeal as a study destination."
