**12 November 2009 Media Statement  
Funding Boost for Local School**

Onehunga High School is receiving a $1,051,241 funding boost to build new classrooms and facilities says MP for Maungakiekie Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga.

This funding is part of a $29.8 million boost for new buildings at 27 schools across the country.

“National is committed to investing in our schools,” he says.  
“These new buildings will really help Onehunga High School meet roll growth and provide better facilities for local students.

“I have spoken to the Onehunga School Principal Ms Deidre Shea and she is delighted about the extra funding. The school has two medium-to-long-term building projects and this funding will ensure one of them goes ahead.

“Nationwide, this funding follows a $41 million property funding boost to eighty-one schools earlier this year as part of our infrastructure package.

“We are delivering on our commitment to improve school property. This funding is a win-win for local schools and local parents”.
