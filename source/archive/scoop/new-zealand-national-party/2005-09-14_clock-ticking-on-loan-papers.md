Clock ticking on loan papers

National Party Finance spokesman John Key says Michael Cullen should tell New Zealanders if he has any intention of releasing all the background papers on Labour's student loan policy before the election.

\"Will Dr Cullen do the right thing before the election?"

Mr Key is referring to a National Party request for the full costings and all the background material done on Labour's student loan policy.

An earlier official information request was declined and the Ombudsman is now progressing an urgent investigation into the reasons behind Dr Cullen's decision to withhold the papers.

"First, Labour said there were no costings. Then there were.

"Then Labour said it wasn't Government policy, then it appeared on taxpayer-funded pledge cards.

"Labour said it would cost only between $100 million and $300 million, then they shouted down the experts who said the costing was far too light.

"Labour's last-minute student loan policy sets all the wrong incentives. It encourages students to borrow the maximum and repay the minimum.

"National is eager to make sure Dr Cullen tables the paperwork before the election so voters can make an informed choice," says Mr Key.
