Business picks up tab for failing education system

The National Party is voicing its concern over a Government initiative that leaves business picking up more of the tab for industry training.

"It's a sad indictment on our compulsory education sector that business is now expected to take up the slack in the training of our young," says the National Party Tertiary Education spokesman Simon Power.

He's commenting on the Government's pre-budget announcement of an $800,000 industry-training package.

"It's disappointing that businesses can no longer expect school leavers to have the basic numeracy and literacy skills needed to be successful in any work-place.

"However, the National Party is pleased that its initiatives of the 90's are being continued by the Labour Government," says Mr Power. "But it's important the industry training initiatives are properly resourced and deliver what was promised.

"The National Party's concerned that too many of this Government's programmes are not being monitored or subjected to adequate checks and balances," Mr Power says.

"The real shame is that with this Government's anti-business policies, there's likely to be fewer industries for these trainees to join.

"The electricity crisis, OSH laws, the RMA, the Holidays Act and the Kyoto protocol are all taking a toll on New Zealand business, which is in the throes of a confidence slump.

"The latest trade figures also make grim reading.

"Without an environment that allows industry to prosper, success in industry training will be more difficult," Mr Power says.
