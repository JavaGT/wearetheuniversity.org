**Jono Naylor praises local schools for working together for kids**

St James School, St Peter’s College, St Mary’s School and Our Lady of Lourdes School are part of a group of six schools who will be working together with Rangitikei counterparts as part of the Palmerston North Catholic Community of Learning.

Freyberg High, Hokowhitu, Milson, Roslyn, Russell Street and Terrance End are part of a group of nine schools who will be working together with Rangitikei counterparts as part of the Freyberg Community of Learning.

“It is pleasing to see two Community of Learnings set up in Palmerston North,” says Naylor.

“This will see the two Communities of Learning work for their respective communities and students.

“This means local kids in Palmerston North will benefit from shared teaching practices and expertise, with teachers working alongside each other on goals to help improve educational outcomes in the classroom,” Naylor said.

“I’m proud our schools realise that together they can achieve even more for our kids.”

“Across the country, 793 schools have now committed to working together to raise student achievement – this will impact on nearly 250,000 Kiwi kids.

“This is about a third of New Zealand students who will now benefit from their schools sharing expertise and resources,” Naylor said.

These school communities are funded through the Government’s $359 million Investing in Educational Success initiative. Evidence shows quality of education and school leadership are the two most important factors in a child’s education, so the Government is supporting those areas.

“The communities will work together on challenges they identify for their children, such as maths, or science, or reading.

“National is focusing on improving performance in the schooling system to ensure every child has the opportunity to succeed,” Naylor said.
