NZQA downplays facilitator role

  
NZQA’s attempts to downplay the role of assessment facilitators in the setting of NCEA exams are disingenuous, says National’s Education spokesman, Bill English.

Mr English has released information that shows NZQA exams are overseen by people who may know nothing about the subject.

“NZQA have confirmed that assessment facilitators do not have specialist subject expertise and have attempted to downplay the significance of their role,” says Mr English.

But according to official NZQA documents National Assessment Facilitators are responsible for the following tasks:

Training all exam writers

Attending meetings with examiners and material developers to plan examinations and confirm assessment specifications

Checking and critiquing exam material in the subject they are responsible for

Considering and actioning all reports from independent checkers and ensuring that all their comments have been addressed

Approving the final exam paper

“The fact that the same facilitator is responsible for biology and economics, and another is responsible for agriculture and art history is simply alarming.

“NZQA owes New Zealand students and teachers a better explanation than they have offered so far,” says Mr English.
