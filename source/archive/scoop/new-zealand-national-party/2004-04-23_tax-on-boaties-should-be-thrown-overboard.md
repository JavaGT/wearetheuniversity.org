Tax on boaties should be thrown overboard

If the proposed registration tax on boaties by Environment Waikato goes ahead it will open the floodgates for regional councils around the country to tax boaties unnecessarily, says National's Fisheries spokesman, Phil Heatley.

Environment Waikato is proposing a registration levy on boaties who use the area's main waterways in Coromandel, Waikato, Taupo and King Country. And those caught with an unregistered boat will be liable for a $100 fine.

Mr Heatley says the new tax is nothing more than a money-making ploy that will net Environment Waikato almost $1 million.

"It says the tax is needed to battle criminal activity on the area's waterways, and for water safety education.

"But police and fisheries officers have responsibility for crime, and the Government is already involved in funding water safety education.

"This tax proposal deserves to be thrown overboard," says Mr Heatley.
