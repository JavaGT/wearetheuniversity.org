Extra-Curricular Ban May Do Lasting Damage To Secondary Education

Moves by secondary teachers to pull out of extra-curricular activities over their pay dispute will spell disaster for many school teams and clubs, says National's Education spokesperson, Nick Smith.

"This bitter, protracted row is now impacting on all areas of school life. Not only have students lost many days of education, but some teachers are pulling support for sport and cultural programmes outside normal school hours.

"These programmes are the heart and soul of a school's character. The ban on teacher activity outside of normal 9 to 5 hours is wrecking many school debating, sporting and music activities.

"The real risk of this dispute is that once withdrawn, this teacher support may not be reinstated. This happened in Britain, once teachers discovered they could enjoy weekends and evenings free of school sport and cultural commitments.

"Education Minister, Trevor Mallard, has conceded that the teachers' industrial action is now seriously impacting on students and their qualifications.

"As the Minister for Sport, Fitness and Leisure, he needs reminding of the serious impact this dispute could have on New Zealand's future sporting and cultural success," says Dr Smith.
