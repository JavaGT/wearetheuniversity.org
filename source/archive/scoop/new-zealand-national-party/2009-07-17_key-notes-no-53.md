**Key Notes No.53**

[Watch my latest video diary here](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-8449.link).

**STRENGTHENING TIES WITH THE PACIFIC**  
We had a busy but successful trip to [Tonga](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-8451.link), [Samoa](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-8452.link), Niue, and [the Cook Islands](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-8453.link) last week - and our delegation had some very useful meetings with government and business leaders in the region.

Beyond the formal events, one of the highlights was a visit to Poutasi Village in Samoa.

More than 240 people from Poutasi have taken part in our Regional Seasonal Employment scheme over the past two years. The scheme has given young people from the village an opportunity to work in Hawke's Bay picking and thinning apples in the busy season.

They are really appreciative of the income this work brings them, and are investing in the development of their community.

The locals put on a show for our delegation. They fed us fresh coconuts and breadfruit while we watched a fantastic performance by children in the church hall. Then the New Zealand boys from Prestige Dance Crew did a brilliant routine in reply. It was a great visit, a fun show, and a real sign of how our ties with the region benefit New Zealanders and the people of the Pacific.

**LIFTING OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE**  
On Wednesday I made [an important speech about our economic objectives](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-8454.link).

I pointed out that we can't magic this recession away, but we can protect New Zealand from its sharpest edges, and that's been our focus over the past eight months.

We've maintained entitlements to income support and boosted spending on frontline services in education, health, and justice. We've also kept government debt from skyrocketing, which would have only pushed up interest rates and cost jobs in the longer term.

We aren't out of the woods yet, but there are some signs that we may start emerging from the recession soon.

In the meantime, the Government is working on three longer-term objectives to boost economic growth:  
\- Increasing New Zealand's productivity growth.  
\- Maintaining high levels of employment.  
\- Reducing New Zealand's vulnerability to adverse events.

New Zealand has many economic advantages. We are experts at food production. We are close to the emerging centres of growth in Asia. Tourists want to come here and see our beautiful scenery. And ultra-fast broadband is a breakthrough technology that will give our firms the ability to reach customers around the world.

But to make the most of these opportunities we need an environment where the private sector can thrive. We are working on six main policy drivers to help create that environment and lift our economic performance over the longer term. These are:

1\. Regulatory reform  
2\. Investment in infrastructure  
3\. Better public services  
4\. Education and skills  
5\. Innovation and business assistance  
6\. A world-class tax system  
[Read about these policy drivers and comment on my speech here](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-8455.link).

**GETTING AUCKLAND MOVING AGAIN**

Boosting infrastructure investment is one area where we are making real progress.

On Monday I was in Auckland for the announcement of the successful tenderer for the [Victoria Park Tunnel project](http://www.vadmin.co.nz/vadmin/emstracking/131-8456.link). Earlier this year, National identified the Victoria Park bottleneck - State Highway 1 just south of the Auckland Harbour Bridge - as one of seven roads of national significance.

The project is expected to start later this year, cost $340 million to build, and create about 300 jobs. It will boost motorway capacity in the area from two lanes in each direction to three lanes northbound (in a new tunnel under Victoria Park) and four lanes southbound (on the existing Victoria Park Viaduct). It will also unlock the benefits of nearby motorway improvements.

The Victoria Park project is one of the first to benefit from our decision to boost funding for state highway construction by $1 billion over the next three years.

**FROM THE DIARY**  
I was in Christchurch on Wednesday. The children at the Plunket Centre in Addington gave me expert advice on how to improve my drawing skills. I also met with a group of school principals and visited the Linwood Community Link.

I had a lively time in Invercargill yesterday among the earthquake aftershocks. It's a great relief that there doesn't seem to be any major damage.

Today I'm in Hawke's Bay looking around the Heinz-Wattie's factory and catching up with the locals.

Parliament is sitting again next week. I'll be back in the House before heading to Auckland to inspect progress at the New Lynn train station and to announce the Prime Minister's Social Heroes Awards.

Best wishes,

John Key  
**Prime Minister**
