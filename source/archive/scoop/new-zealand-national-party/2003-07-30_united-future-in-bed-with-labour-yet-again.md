United Future in bed with Labour yet again

United Future in bed with Labour yet again

The National Party is accusing United Future of sacrificing democracy in favour of its political allegiance with Labour.

"It's already hard to spot any difference between Peter Dunne and the Government, United's decision today to support retrospective legislation on the Harry Duynhoven case confirms that opinion," says National Party Deputy Leader Roger Sowry.

"As National Party Leader Bill English pointed out yesterday, the arguments for a retrospective law change to protect the MP are unconvincing, they're also unprincipled and unconstitutional "Despite claims to the contrary, this is not an archaic law which hasn't been changed in 150 years.

"There have been seven amendments to the Electoral Act since 1993, including one just last year.

"Mr Duynhoven's situation is no different from the thousands of New Zealanders who get caught 'unintentionally' speeding every day," Mr Sowry says.

"Those law breakers have to live with the consequences of their actions and Labour (with United Future's support) cannot put one of its own MPs above the law.

"The National Party does not want to spend taxpayer money on a New Plymouth by-election, but this is an issue of principle that rises above any inconvenience," Mr Sowry says.
