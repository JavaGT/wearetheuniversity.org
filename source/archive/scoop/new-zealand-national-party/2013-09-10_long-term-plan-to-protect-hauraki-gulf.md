**Long-term plan to protect Hauraki Gulf**

Coromandel MP Scott Simpson has welcomed the launch the Hauraki Gulf Marine Spatial Planning process which will help shape the future of the Gulf over the next 30 years.

“The health of the Hauraki Gulf is of huge concern to all of us here in Coromandel with many livelihoods directly affected by it. Recent studies have shown we need to improve how we manage the marine environment in the Gulf, and all stakeholders need to be part of that effort,” said Mr Simpson.

The parties to the new Hauraki Gulf Spatial Plan are the Department of Conservation, Ministry for Primary Industries, Auckland Council, Waikato Regional Council, Hauraki Gulf Forum, and tangata whenua representatives. The planning process will involve the partners producing a discussion document for public submissions next year, with the aim of having the plan finalised in 2015.

$1.8 million from central and local government has been budgeted to the support the development of the plan.

“The growth of Auckland means the Hauraki Gulf is now New Zealand’s busiest coastal space. So it is appropriate that this will be the location of New Zealand’s first spatial plan in the marine and coastal environment,” said Mr Simpson.

“This marine planning initiative is consistent with the Government’s Bluegreen agenda of increasing our focus on marine conservation and taking a more collaborative approach to resolving conservation challenges.”
