=================================

Professor Rajesh Chandra moves on

The University of the South Pacific advises that Professor Rajesh Chandra has resigned from his position as Deputy Vice-Chancellor at USP effective 18 March, 2005. Professor Chandra departs for a period of leave before assuming his position as Vice-Chancellor with the newly established university in Fiji.

This outcome will avoid the obvious conflict of interest that will arise as a result of him heading the university while remaining an employee of USP.

The Chancellor, Dr Langi Kavaliku, expressed his good wishes and thanks to Professor Chandra for his long and committed service at USP. Professor Anthony Tarr, Vice-Chancellor at USP, joined the Chancellor in passing on best wishes for the future.

Dr Esther Williams will assume the position of Acting Deputy Vice-Chancellor.

ENDS
