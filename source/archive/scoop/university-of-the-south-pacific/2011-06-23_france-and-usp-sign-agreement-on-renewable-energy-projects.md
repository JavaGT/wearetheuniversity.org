**Government of France and USP sign agreement on Renewable Energy Projects**

June 23, 2011 - The signing of a Financial Convention between the Government of France and the University of the South Pacific was held at the Laucala Campus on 21 June, 2011.

The agreement, which formalises France’s commitment towards funding support for the 2010-2011 Renewable Energy and Sustainable Development projects at USP, was signed by the French Ambassador to the Republic of Fiji, His Excellency, Mr Gilles Montagnier and USP’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Learning, Teaching and Student Services), Professor Susan Kelly.

The two projects funded by the French Government involve replacing kerosene/benzene with solar lights in selected village communities and the development of a wind-solar hybrid renewable energy system for the USP student ‘_Fales’_.

During the signing, Professor Kelly thanked the Government of France for its generous support and assistance for the projects and stated that USP has a good relationship with France.

“These projects will strengthen the capacity of USP to advance in clean energy technologies and contribute to the sustainable development choices of its member countries,” she stated.

Professor Kelly said that the University looks forward to implementing the two projects and also welcomes any future opportunity to work closely with the French Government through its Embassy in Fiji on projects or programmes that will benefit the region.

Highlighting the need to move to renewable energy in the future, Professor Kelly said that it is becoming economically unviable for Pacific Islands Countries (PICs) to continue to use fossil fuels.

She applauded France’s support and commitment towards research in the areas of marine bio-diversity, environment, art, culture, sustainable development and renewable energy in the region.

In his address, H.E. Mr Montagnier said that USP, as a regional academic institution, continues to play a major role in the cooperation between France, the French Pacific territories and PICs.

He explained that the signing of the grant agreement is intended “to strengthen our cooperation and relations, in order to work for the development of the South Pacific.”

The Ambassador pointed out that the development of renewable energies remains a challenge in Fiji and the whole region.

“We hope, by initiating this project, to develop the knowledge and the training capacities of USP, as well as empowering rural communities and developing the use of solar lighting in Fiji and the neighbouring states,” he added.

The projects will be coordinated by Dr Atul Raturi, Head of the School of Engineering and Physics at USP.
