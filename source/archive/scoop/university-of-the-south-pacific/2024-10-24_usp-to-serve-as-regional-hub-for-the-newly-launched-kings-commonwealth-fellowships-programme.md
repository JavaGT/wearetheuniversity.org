The King’s Commonwealth Fellowship Programme (KCFP) was launched this afternoon in the presence of His Majesty, King Charles III in Samoa on the margins of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).

The KCFP is a pioneering and ambitious interdisciplinary initiative designed to create transformative, long-term impact across the Caribbean and Pacific regions.

It will be delivered in partnership with the Association of the Commonwealth Universities (ACU) members, with The University of South Pacific and University of West Indies serving as regional hubs, and other local and Commonwealth partners such as the Commonwealth Local Government Forum.

The programme aims to build capacity in critical areas such as education, health, and disaster resilience engineering. It will also provide local authorities and civil service teams with practical tools and knowledge to foster long-term resilience through a comprehensive approach to intersecting development challenges.

By creating a distinguished network of "King’s Fellows," the programme will facilitate partnerships, knowledge sharing, and collaborative problem-solving among Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

USP’s Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Pal Ahluwalia, co-hosted the launch ceremony alongside staff and approximately 50 students representing USP’s member countries.

Professor Ahluwalia said the launch of the KCFP is a significant milestone in capacity building and advancing access to education across SIDS.

“This is an exciting and remarkable initiative by His Majesty King Charles III, and USP is delighted to be a regional hub and key partner with ACU and the University of the West Indies to implement the KCFP,” said Professor Ahluwalia.

“The programme has the potential to cultivate a highly skilled workforce, which is crucial for driving innovation, economic diversification, and sustainable development in SIDS.”

Professor Ahluwalia also expressed his gratitude to the ACU for bringing the KCFP to fruition.

The KCFP will be implemented under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, which has transformed the lives of over 38,000 individuals since its inception by Commonwealth education ministers in 1959.
