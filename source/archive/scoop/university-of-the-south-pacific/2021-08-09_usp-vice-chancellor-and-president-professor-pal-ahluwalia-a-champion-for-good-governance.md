The University of the South Pacific’s (USP) newly re-appointed Vice-Chancellor and President (VC&P), Professor Pal Ahluwalia, looks forward to instilling stability and ensuring that the University adheres to principles of good governance.

He resumed office today, Monday, 9 August, 2021 for an initial 3-year term. He is currently based at the Nauru Campus awaiting travel to Samoa. Professor Ahluwalia thanked God, the President of Nauru, the Government of Nauru, the USP Council and staff and students for their unwavering support for him and his wife during the last few months.

Professor Ahluwalia was re-elected to this position by the USP Council who agreed to offer him a new contract following its meeting on 2 June, 2021.

“It has been a challenging time for the University, but I’m proud to have a team that has been vigorous in managing the University and ensuring that our students and staff interests remain paramount. They’ve done great work during my absence,” Professor Ahluwalia said.

His plans and vision remain unchanged and he will continue to steer the University to become a world-class institution through ‘Shaping Pacific Futures’.

“USP is deeply connected to the Pacific, its communities, alumni, staff, and students, and I look forward to forging stronger relationships with everyone. With everyone’s support and building on the University’s mission and values, we can lift this University to become among the best in the world. Having been based in Nauru for the past six months, I have had first-hand experience of regional campuses and am better positioned than ever to elevate the standards of our regional campuses” Professor Ahluwalia added.
