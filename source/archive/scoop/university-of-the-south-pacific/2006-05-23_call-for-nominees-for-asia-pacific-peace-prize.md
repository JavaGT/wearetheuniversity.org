The conference which will be held at USP in Suva from June 26 to 30, is titled ‘Mediating Cultures in the Pacific and Asia’ and will include five days of workshops and presentations that explore the diverse ways mediation takes place throughout varying social and legal systems in the Asia Pacific region.

Practitioners from around the world and from a broad range of sectors will present their expertise with various mediation methodologies. A major focus of conference workshops will be to build the capacity of Pacific Island countries to mediate in a wide variety of settings including governmental institutions, courts, businesses, non-government organizations, schools, and communities.

Conference participation will build the ever-growing network of practitioners, academics, researchers, policy makers, members of judiciaries, elected officials and students interested in expanding their understanding of alternative dispute resolution principles, practice and implementation.
