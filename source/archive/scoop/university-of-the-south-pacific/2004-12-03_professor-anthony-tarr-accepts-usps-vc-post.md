Professor Anthony Tarr Accepts USP's VC Post

Professor Anthony A. Tarr accepts post of  
Vice-Chancellor of the University of the South Pacific

The University of the South Pacific confirmed today that Professor Anthony A. Tarr, will be the University's next Vice-Chancellor and will formally take up the position at the end of May 2005.

As reported earlier, Professor Tarr, who is widely recognised for his achievements as a senior university executive, is also an internationally acclaimed legal scholar. His expertise was sought by the Fiji Government in the 1990s, when he served initially as Law Commissioner and then later as Chairman of the Fiji Law Reform Commission.

The appointment comes at a time of particular challenge for the University as it adopts the recommendations and goals of the USP Futures Report, which provides a roadmap for the next 15 years. The report however, also presents the University with extraordinary opportunities, which the University Council is confident that Professor Tarr, with his balance of international, academic, university and corporate management experience as well as visionary flair, will be able to maximise.

In confirming Dr. Tarr's acceptance, Dr. S. Langi Kavaliku reiterated his deep respect for the integrity of the appointment process of Council and its outcome.

"Obviously, with the number of outstanding applicants, the final decision was a challenging one to make,'' he said.

"In my very long association with the University, which began at USP's very inception, I have come to value the collective wisdom of those who serve on Council and their ability to navigate their way through complex issues. Now that the selection process has come to a conclusion, I would like to express, on behalf of the University Council, our sincere gratitude to the Acting Vice Chancellor Professor Rajesh Chandra for his contributions to USP.

"I have no doubt that with his usual commitment and dedication, Professor Chandra will ensure that the University management makes a seamless transition over the coming months. I would also like to thank the many other outstanding candidates who invested their time and energy and engaged in the selection process at various stages.

"We must now focus on the challenges that lie ahead and we look forward to Professor Tarr's arrival.

"As stakeholders, we will fully support Professor Tarr as he leads the University to serve the region and its peoples and to enhance its standing in the international arena. Indeed, the platform for success can only be built from the sense of ownership and partnership that must be promoted amongst all of us, the stakeholders, as well as our time-tested and deep commitment to put aside differences to work together as a cohesive team for the greater good of all."
