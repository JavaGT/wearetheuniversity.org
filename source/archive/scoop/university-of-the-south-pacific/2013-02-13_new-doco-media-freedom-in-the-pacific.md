SUVA (_University of the South Pacific / Pacific Media Watch_): A new video, _Media Freedom in the Pacific_, has been produced by the University of the South Pacific journalism programme.

Commissioned and funded by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), the half-hour documentary shows interviews with many editors, journalists and media educators from around the region conducted at the Second Pacific Media Summit at Pacific Harbour, Fiji, last March.

The interviews on the issues of media freedom and freedom of information in the South Pacific were carried out to mark UNESCO World Press Freedom Day on 3 May 2012.

A preview of the documentary, initiated by the Pacific Freedom Forum, was shown at the Media and Democracy in the South Pacific conference in Suva last September.

Directed and produced by US television journalist Don Pollock, many of the interviews were conducted by Magalie Tingal of Radio Djiido in New Caledonia and the narrator is USP's Radio Pasifik manager Semi Francis.
