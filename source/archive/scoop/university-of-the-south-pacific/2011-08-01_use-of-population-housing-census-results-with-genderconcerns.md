**Dissemination and Use of Population and Housing Census Results with Gender Concern Workshop**

The sub-regional training on the _‘Dissemination and Use of Population and Housing Census Results with Gender Concern’_ which was conducted jointly by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the University of the South Pacific (USP) was held from 25 - 29 July, 2011 in Suva, Fiji.

This is part of the assistance provided by the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific (SIAP-ESCAP), UNFPA Asia-Pacific Regional Office and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan towards countries in the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen their capabilities in conducting the 2010 round of population and housing census.

The workshop is one of the many courses/workshops at the national, sub-regional and regional levels for training government officials/statisticians in the collection, analysis and dissemination of high quality and timely census data with gender concern.

In his remarks at the opening of the workshop, Professor Biman Chand Prasad, Dean of the Faculty of Business and Economics (FBE) welcomed the participants to USP and said that the University is “pleased” to host the workshop.

He stated that the University through FBE is working with UNFPA to improve capacity in the area of official statistics and population issues by developing appropriate credit courses and short-term training courses for public sector officials working in national statistical offices and ministries of planning and finance in the region.

The workshop, which was hosted at the Japan-Pacific ICT Centre at USP, was aimed at strengthening the capability of government officials on the dissemination and use of the 2010 round of population and housing census data for policy making.

Highlighting the importance of the workshop, Professor Prasad said that it provides an opportunity for participants to learn and exchange national experiences in using census results for developing national and sub-national level plans, monitoring MDGs and gender mainstreaming.

According to Professor Prasad, the training is intended for managers of the 2010 round of population and housing census at the bureau/department of national statistical agencies, senior officials of civil population registration offices, as well as heads of departments/divisions of the ministries of health and finance who develop national and sub-national plans, set goals, monitor and evaluate the progress in achieving these goals.

The workshop was attended by participants from Fiji, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Timor Leste.
