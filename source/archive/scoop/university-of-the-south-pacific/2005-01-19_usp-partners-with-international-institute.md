USP partners with International Institute for Software

Technology to improve opportunities for software development in the South Pacific

In an ongoing effort to improve the opportunities for software development in the Pacific region the Department of Mathematics and Computing Science at the University of the South Pacific (USP) in co-operation with the International Institute for Software

Technology (IIST) at the United Nations University (UNU) in Macao,will host a special two-week course on the Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering (RAISE) from 7 to 18 February 2005.

The Acting Director of IIST Mr Chris George will run this course which will be held at the Department of Mathematics and Computing Science at USP's Laucala Campus in Suva, Fiji.

Apart from students regularly enrolled, the course is also open to computing science graduates or those in this field with experience in large software development projects.

The department has recently been able to improve its staffing situation quite substantially. It has introduced its new Information Systems curriculum and has since started reviewing its CS curriculum. Hosting the IIST RAISE course at USP is the first activity in a planned long-term collaboration between the two institutions.

The mission of UNU-IIST is to help developing countries strengthen their education and research in computing science and their ability to produce software.

It works with universities, research institutes, and various public and private sector institutions. IIST's activities focus on supporting curriculum development in computing science and software engineering, staff training for the teaching of relevant courses, joint research projects and actual joint software development projects, including the development of a set of tools for the RAISE Specification Language.
