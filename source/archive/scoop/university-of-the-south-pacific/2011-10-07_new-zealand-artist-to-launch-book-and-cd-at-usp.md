**New Zealand artist to launch book and CD at USP**

Mr Daren Kamali, a New Zealand-based performance poet, musician and writer will be launching his bilingual book and CD called _‘Tales, Poems and Songs from the Underwater World’_ in Fiji at the Oceania Centre for Arts, Culture and Pacific Studies, USP.

The launch of the book and CD, which are in both English and Fijian, is being proudly sponsored by the Oceania Centre for Arts, Culture and Pacific Studies and the School of Language, Arts and Media at the University of the South Pacific.

The launch will be held on 11 October 2011, at the Oceania Gallery Space, USP in Suva with Mr Kamali performing a selection of pieces from the book and CD live. Additional entertainment will be provided by the Newsounds Oceania band and a variety of local poets, musicians and singers.

Originally from Fiji, Mr Kamali has been residing in New Zealand since 1992. He is currently pursuing a Diploma in Creative Writing from the Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT).

Since 2004, Mr Kamali has been a creative arts facilitator, a mentor in poetry and has conducted numerous music workshops in New Zealand.

Mr Kamali describes writing as a vehicle that provides a powerful ability for a person to express himself and generations before him, transferring writings from the page to the stage.

He has performed in New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tahiti, Tonga, Rarotonga and Palau since 1999 with a vision to take Pacific poetry to the international front.

Mr Kamali is the co-founder of the ‘The South Auckland Poets Collective’ in New Zealand. He fuses songs and poetry with music creating chants, melodies, rhymes and harmonies. Most of his work are inspired by life experiences and influenced by his upbringing in Fiji and New Zealand. He draws from the strength of his Fijian roots, culture, spirituality, thoughts, feelings, emotions, people, places and time.

Mr Kamali has also launched his bilingual book and CD in New Zealand earlier this year.
