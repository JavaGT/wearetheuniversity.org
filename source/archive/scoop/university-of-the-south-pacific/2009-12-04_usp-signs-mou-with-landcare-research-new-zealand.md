USP signs MOU with Landcare Research New Zealand

The Vice-chancellor of The University of the South Pacific, Professor Rajesh Chandra, and Dr Phil Cowan, Science Leader of Landcare Research New Zealand on December 2, 2009, signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the two organisations to support science collaboration and to develop a high-level science-based strategic partnership. Landcare Research, which has ongoing collaboration with USP, is New Zealand’s leading terrestrial environmental research and consultancy organisation, with extensive resources, capacity and experience in international development projects. It focuses on sustainable land management practices including economic, social and cultural impacts of resource use and sustaining and restoring biodiversity. Dr Cowan said they believe that Landcare Research’s focus fits well with USP’s purpose “…the maintenance, advancement and dissemination of knowledge by teaching, consultancy and research and otherwise, and for the provision of appropriate levels of education and training responsive to the well-being and needs of the communities in the South Pacific….” and the university’s objective to promote ‘consultancy and research’.

Landcare Research has more than 30 years experience working with peers in the Pacific to deliver a range of services such as scientific research, surveys, training and consultancy in many areas of resource management to effect outcomes for sustainable development and conservation. Collaboration with USP has been increased through projects such as the current NZAID Government Agencies Fund project in which they are developing and sharing capacity in the botanical collections and databases in the South Pacific Regional Herbarium in the Faculty of Science and Technology.

Through the partnership, Landcare Research will contribute to the scientific values and objectives of USP, based on their New Zealand experience and wider international collaborations. Given USP’s acknowledged scientific expertise, Landcare Research sees the partnership as strengthening the effectiveness and relevance of its own scientific activities in the region.

Professor Chandra stressed that “This partnership with Landcare Research will be mutually beneficial and is part of USP’s Strategic Plan’s objectives to increase research and applied policy work. The USP looks forward to a productive and expanding future working relationship with Landcare Research”.
