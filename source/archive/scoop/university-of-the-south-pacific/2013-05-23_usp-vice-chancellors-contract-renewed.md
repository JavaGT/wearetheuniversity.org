**USP Vice-chancellor’s Contract Renewed**

USP Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Rajesh Chandra

At its 76th Meeting in Nuku’alofa, Tonga from 15 to 16 May, 2013, the USP Council unanimously agreed to renew the current Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of the South Pacific, Professor Rajesh Chandra’s contract for a further term of four years.

This would give him in effect the 10 year maximum period under the provisions of the _2009 Handbook on Appointments made by Council._

The Council at its November 2012 meeting had set up a Joint Committee of Council and Senate to review the performance of the Vice-Chancellor and to make a recommendation on renewal of contract. The Joint Committee was chaired by the Deputy Chair of Council, Ms Fekitamoeloa ‘Utoikamanu and included 3 members of Council and 2 members of the Senate.

USP’s Pro-Chancellor and Chair of Council, Mr Ikbal Jannif reiterated the clear and transparent process by which the Vice Chancellor’s contract was renewed. He also confirmed the Council’s confidence in the Vice Chancellor’s re-appointment, to continue at the helm of the University.

The Pro Chancellor said that Professor Chandra’s re-appointment will ensure that the objectives of the Strategic Plan 2013 – 2018 will be implemented in the most effective way- on its way to achieving excellence by USP’s 50th anniversary.

The Vice-Chancellor’s new term begins from mid- 2014.
