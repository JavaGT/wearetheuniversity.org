=====================================================

14th February, 2012

The opportunity to begin University life - well-informed - is being offered by USP staff this week.  
The University of the South Pacific’s Laucala Campus has organised an Orientation programme for new students – from Fiji and around the region who are commencing their studies and career development in 2012.

The week-long ‘O Week’ programme started on Monday, February 13, with orientation and a welcome of the over 1,000 new students to the College of Foundation Studies (CFS).  
The Faculty of Business and Economics (FBE) had its orientation session on Tuesday, while the Faculty of Arts, Law and Education (FALE), and the Faculty of Science, Technology and Environment (FSTE) will have their sessions on 15th and 16th of February, respectively.  
The faculties welcome their students and provide valuable course advice from Tuesday to Thursday and there is an Official Welcome for all, with entertainment and activities, on Friday.

On Monday, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Learning, Teaching and Student Services), Professor Susan Kelly welcomed the new CFS students to USP. In her message, Professor Kelly focused on students ‘valuing their time’, working hard, maintaining a balance in their lives and always being honest and ethical.

She noted the sacrifices that parents and guardians are making, and how everyone is looking to these new USP students to be the leaders of their communities in future.

Professor Kelly encouraged students to ask a lot of questions, seek help if they are confused or struggling, reach out to make friends and help others.

Many parents who were present at the orientation as well as students later said that they appreciated DVC Kelly’s timely words of advice and encouragement.

After the opening address, the Acting Director of CFS, Ms Susan Sela took the students through the important details of the programme. This included: students getting their timetable in order, collecting a study planner and getting tips on how to use it, familiarising themselves with their course materials and the process of submitting assignments, MOODLE use and further academic group tours.

Ms Sela stressed that CFS is working hard to ensure that its students continue to improve academically and that they grow and mature: ready for success at degree level.  
Throughout O Week, students will be provided with advice on courses, support services, as well as information on online and distance learning.

To make the O Week experience even more enjoyable and exciting, students will also be given guided Laucala Campus tours and free bus tours of the Suva City. Free food and entertainment are also available at the various booths set up at the University.
