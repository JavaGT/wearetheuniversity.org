Taskforce Report Calls for Greater Collaboration
================================================

**Thursday, 4 March 2010, 1:56 pm**  
**Press Release: [NZVCC](https://info.scoop.co.nz/NZVCC)**

**CRI Taskforce Report Calls for Greater Collaboration**

Universities welcome the release of the CRI Taskforce Report today which recognises the value that the CRIs and the universities already deliver and provides recommendations to increase their important contributions to the country.

Professor Sir David Skegg, Chair of the NZVCC’s Research Committee, says that the recommendations to require CRIs to use a portion of their core funding to form collaborative partnerships and for Government to include funding to support inter-institutional collaborative research are particularly good news for the country.

“Universities are the largest research organisations in New Zealand. Increased collaboration between CRIs, universities and private research providers will ensure that the best outcomes are achieved and will help to maintain the capability of the country’s science system,” Professor Skegg says.

“The universities were pleased with the comprehensive consultation process undertaken by the CRI Taskforce in preparing this report and look forward to being closely involved during the implementation of the report’s recommendations.”
