Students Oppose Library Closure
===============================

MEDIA RELEASE – Otago University Medical Students’ Association  
15 JULY 2014 – For immediate release

**Students Oppose Library Closure**

Elizabeth Berryman, President of the Otago University Medical Students’ Association, is today condemning the closure of the only dedicated library and study space for health professional students.

“This decision jeopardises the ranking of the University of Otago as a world class medical education institution. We feel that this decision undermines the ability of the school to provide quality medical graduates that will be serving the health needs of New Zealanders in the near future.”

A source told us a survey was recently conducted by the Health Sciences Library which showed 1000 students use the library every day.

“We have been informed that the library will be reallocated for research purposes without the provision of alternative space in the health sciences precinct.”

“Medical students are charged substantially higher fees and the services they are provided are being decreased. With this latest decision our members are starting to wonder where their money is going.”

The Association is willing to work with the University on finding a suitable alternative within the health precinct.

“After approaching the University we are yet to have any official statements from them, and if this closure was to occur we recommend with the strongest terms they reconsider this decision without substantial consultation with students.”

Otago Physiotherapy Students’ Association President Florence Loader fully supports the retention of the Health Sciences Library.

“The existing study spaces are already packed when the exam period starts and studying in cold flats is unproductive for most students”, said Loader.

The New Zealand Association of Pharmacy Students’ Otago President Kirsten Allen also opposes the closure of the Health Sciences Library.

Allen said, “It will greatly disadvantage the 450 Pharmacy students who regularly use the Library”
