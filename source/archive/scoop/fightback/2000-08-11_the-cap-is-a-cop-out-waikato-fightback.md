BAND AID ON A FLESH WOUND-

  
The Cap is a Cop Out- Waikato Fightback

"The Cap is not enough! it's fees we have to stuff!"...

Around forty supporters of Fightback Waikato stormed the University Council meeting in B Block last Wednesday, to show their opposition to high tuition fees and inadequate government funding of tertiary education. Government is currently offering a 2.3% increase in funding to Waikato if they freeze fees for 2001, which Council voted to reluctantly accept. Shane Volger from staff union SFWU raised fears that the funding would not be enough to stop staff cutbacks, course closures or fee increases further down the line, echoing Fightback's concerns that Labour are putting a band aid on a flesh wound. The protest forced Council to lobby other Universities to campaign in unison for increased funding for next year, instead of being individually isolated and forced to accept government offers.

114 staff are being fired at Massey Uni in Palmerston North, because of inadequate funding. Victoria in Wellington faces $8 million in course closures, staff lay offs and cutbacks. Some institutions are threatening to double fees in 2002 to make up for this year's losses- the fee freeze was a once off offer, with no plans for next year.

We need a huge increase in funding NOW to stop the market driven crisis in education. Fightback wants to see tuition fees abolished, and tertiary education established as a right for all, as it is in Ireland, Germany and many other countries. Sadly, the new Labour government are offering little- join the alternative and fight for universal student living allowances, an end to student debt and expensive fees. Fightback!
