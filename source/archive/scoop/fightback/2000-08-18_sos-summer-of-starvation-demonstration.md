**Press Release: [Fightback](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Fightback)**

SOS: Summer of Starvation demonstration  
organised by Fightback Waikato

Starting at 2pm, Friday 25th August  
Beginning at Victoria Street branch of WINZ  
soup kitchen / cardboard city/ sleepover in Garden Place

  
Labour and the Alliance have joined National and Act in voting down Green MP Sue Bradford's bill that would have had the Emergency Unemployment Benifit (EUB) available to all students during the upcoming summer holidays. Under the current scheme, if you cannot prove absolute perental poverty and are under the age of 25, you can expect no assistance from the government in paying for accomodation, food and other basic necessities. For the majority of students, those who do not qualify for the EUB, this is terrible news. Many will be forced to rely on foodbanks, loans and charity to survive. Don't let this happen again. we demand immediate reinstatement of the EUB.

S.O.S.- stop the Summer of Starvation

Demonstrate this Friday!
