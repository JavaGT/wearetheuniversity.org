The Battle of Seattle comes to Hamilton
=======================================

**Monday, 17 April 2000, 9:50 am**  
**Press Release: [Fightback](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Fightback)**

MAY THE FIRST BE WITH YOU  
The Battle of Seattle comes to Hamilton!

The coalition of forces that brought about the Battle of Seattle against the World Trade Organisation last November are mobilising again this Mayday. Trade unionists, ecologists, NGOS, campaigners and socialists are uniting to make our opposition to the global economic status quo heard. And here in Hamilton, we're keen to lead the first Mayday 2000 protest in the world!

Living down in Frankton, we dwell underneath the shadow of the huge Kentucky Fried Chicken bucket. Aesthetically, it is monstrous, and it dominates the skyline like some kind of Stalinist monolith! The company is non union, pays low wages and exploits young workers. In addition its menu of hot bones and grease is indicative of all that is horrible with mutinational culture.

"The Bucket is a local symbol of a global economic system that on Mayday, hundreds of thousands of people around the world are protesting against, and rejecting. Millions of people die of hunger every year in the Third World, yet their governments pay back billions to the Western banks and corporations. The same companies exploit workers here in the West, and that is why we protest on May Day" said Joe Carolan of the Socialist Workers Organisation.

Join the Bucket F\*\*kit! Picket. 12 midday, Mayday, KFC bucket, Frankton, Hamilton.
