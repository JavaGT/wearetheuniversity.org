======================================================

**Press Release: [Fightback](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Fightback)**

**CHCH Fightback Reading Group: How To Make a Revolution**

\"Revolutionary socialists have been accused for many years of wanting to overthrow the US government by force and violence. When they accuse us of this, what they are really trying to do is to imply that we want to abolish capitalism with a minority, that we want to force the will of the minority on the majority. The opposite is the truth. We believe we can win a majority of the people in this country to support a change in the system. It will be necessary to make a revolution precisely because the ruling powers will not peacefully accept a majority rule which wants a basic change."

Ben Peterson will be facilitating a study of one half of a piece by Peter Camejo, available here: www.marxists.org/archive/camejo/1969/howtomakearevolution.htm

Event is open to anyone and will be wrapped up by 6.30pm

5pm, Monday 7th July
