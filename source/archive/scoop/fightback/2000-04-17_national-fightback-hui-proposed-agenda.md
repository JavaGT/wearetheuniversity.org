Proposed Agenda for the Hui in Ham

1\. PRESPECTIVES SESSION-Where are we at in the campaign for National occupations for free education?

A national analysis of the state of the struggle. Overall evaluation of the first round of occupations and actions.

a. at every campus except Canterbury, the movement is in a better position than it was at the beginning of the year.

b. There are strong signs of a high level of passive support for the national objectives on all campuses (thousands of names on petitions) however

c. active participation is much lower...Police brutality...Craccum....Right wing execs but mostly

d. Illusions in reformism, the "Honeymood period" of the Labour government.

2\. Analysis of the most successful actions- Waikato and Victoria What can be learned from the experiences of building and organising on these campuses

3\. Brief reports from other campuses Increase understanding and national networking and allow the development of new activists as speakers...AUT, MIT, Waikato Polytech etc.

4\. Reconfirmation of the Wellington Hui goals (The 10 point programme)
