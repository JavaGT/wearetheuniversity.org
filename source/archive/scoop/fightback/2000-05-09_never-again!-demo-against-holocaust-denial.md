"Never Again!" Demo Against Holocaust Denial

"Never Again!" Demonstration Against Holocaust Denial

Assembling In Front Of The Banks, University Of Waikato Campus 1pm Thursday 11th May

The recently formed Anti Racist Movement is to take action this Thursday, with a demonstration against Holocaust Denial on the University of Waikato Campus. Huge concern exists on campus amongst both staff and students that management is taking a hands off approach against Doctorate student Frans Kupka, whom the NZ Jewish Community has condemned as an active holocaust denier.

The Anti Racist Movement is supported by the Waikato Students Union, the Socialist Workers Organisation, the Waikato Jewish Association, the Alliance, the Fightback! campaign for Free education, concerned ethnic groups on campus and the local Trade Union movement. Speakers from the trade unions, the gay, disabled and Jewish communities will join Coucillor Dave McPherson of the Alliance, Joe Carolan of the SWO and Pita Cammock of the WSU in condemning the University of Waikato's deliberance on this matter, and it is expected that the demonstration will take the message to Vice Chancellor Brian Gould in person.

"We want to show VC Gould that there is zero tolerance for racism and Holocaust Denial on this campus. The recent Irving libel trial should have made it apparent that the odious practice of Holocaust Denial is not only academically and socially unacceptable, but that it hurts and insults the survivors, and the relatives of those murdered in the Holocaust. We are determined that Kupka will not get the academic credibility he craves, and will resist at every stage attempts by this University to grant him his Phd.
