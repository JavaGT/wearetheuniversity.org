MayDay Protest- first in a day of Global Action
===============================================

MayDay Protest- first in a day of Global Action

The Bucket? F\*\*k it! Picket

High noon, May 1st 2000

The World's first MayDay action of the New Millenium happens in New Zealand, with a protest against the huge KFC bucket in the North Island city of Hamilton. Towering over the skyline of the Frankton working class estate, it is the largest KFC bucket in the Pacific, and symbolises everything that is rotten with Capitalism. Low wages, long hours, no union, a menu ofhot bones and grease, antibiotic pumped chickens treated cruelly in battery farms, millions of dollars in Multinational profit syphoned away from the community. All that and no sense of aesthetics! "If this was Russia, people would rip that monolith down!".

Join Hamilton's finest in sending out a clear message this Mayday-

featuring Crackers the Corporate Crime Fighting Chicken-

Q: Why did that chicken cross the road?

A: Because it's time to Kick the Bucket, Capitalism!

The picket will be demanding-

1\. Unionisation of the low paid by the Unions of NZ.

2\. A minimum wage of $12.

3\. The Restoration of the Right to Strike, denied under National's Employment Contact Act, still not restored by Labour's Employment Relations Act.

4\. The removal of the KFC bucket eyesore that dominates Frankton's skyline.
