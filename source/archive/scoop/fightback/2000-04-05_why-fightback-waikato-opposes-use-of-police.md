Why Fightback Waikato Opposes Use Of Police Against Students On Campus

Here are some media articles on the controversial policing methods used in Auckland. Sue Bradford from the Green Party raised our concerns in Parliament about these. After all, this is New Zealand, not Tianamen square!

The "Nose Hold" grip http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=125589

Arrests of protestors for "Obstructing footpath" http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=125496  

Police used against Student Occupation http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=15947

Contrasted by the Peaceful approach to Protest in Hamilton http://www.nzherald.co.nz/storydisplay.cfm?storyID=127795

Our occupation was peaceful, without violence or damage to property. People do not have police watching over them in their workplace. We will hold the Vice Chancellor Brian Gould to his promise that he will not use police against peaceful student protests in the future.
