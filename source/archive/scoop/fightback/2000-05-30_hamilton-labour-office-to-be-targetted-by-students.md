PRESS RELEASE

Hamilton Labour Offices to be targetted by students

Fightback, the campaign for Free Education who led the occupation at the University of Waikato in March, has called a demonstration outside Labour party MPs offices in Hamilton this Wednesday, May 31st at 12.30pm.

"The majority of Labour MPs benifitted from Free Education themselves during their student days, and they didn't enter the workforce with $30,000 debts when they got their degrees. We will be burning our loans statements outside Labour offices, and call on Labour MPs to abolish tuition fees, cancel student debts and sack Christine Rankin.

This should be the last year of the failed WINZ loans scheme- we need a Universal Student Living Allowance now. A huge amount of damage has been done to NZ public services in the last 16 years of free market extremism, with education and health the main sufferers. Labour started this in 84, they can undo the damage they've done now. They can expect no easy ride from students in Hamilton".
