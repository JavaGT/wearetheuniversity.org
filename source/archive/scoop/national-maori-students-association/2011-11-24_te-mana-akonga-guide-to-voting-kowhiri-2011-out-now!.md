**Te Mana Akonga Guide to Voting Kowhiri 2011 OUT NOW!**

“Political campaigning for this year’s General Election has been hard, fast and rushed following the end to the Rugby World Cup 2011. Households around the country barely have time to gather their thoughts on who they may consider to vote for this Saturday, because every possible brand space is soaked in promises and pictures from political parties declares Jacqualene Poutu, Tumuaki Te Mana Ākonga ( National Māori Tertiary Students Association)”.

“For those that would like to take a moment out from the political banter can and should read the Te Mana Ākonga Māori Student Guide to Voting Kōwhiri 2011 says Poutu”

“This voting guide is a dedication to one of our Rangatira Robbie Downes who we are grateful to have been given the opportunity to work with over the years. Moe mai ra e te tungāne says Poutu”.

“The aim of this guide is to elucidate current barriers faced by Māori Tertiary Students and their whānau and a glimpse at what political parties are prepared to do about it says Poutu”.

“Topics covered include: Te Tiriti o Waitangi, Māori Student Representation, increasing achievement for Māori Students, Jobs, keeping students in Aotearoa, Tertiary access and participation for High School students, changes to the Student Loan Scheme and various other policies of interest continues Poutu”.

“Check it out! Our guide will be available online and we aim to target māori students (current, past and potential) at high school and tertiary as well as their respective whānau. This guide is functional, relevant and representative for supporting the needs of māori learners and therefore the advancement of Whānau, Hapū and Iwi Development concludes Poutu”.
