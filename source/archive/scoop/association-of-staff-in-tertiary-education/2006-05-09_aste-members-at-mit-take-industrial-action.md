ASTE Members at Manukau Institute of Technology take Industrial Action

Irena Brorens, Assistant Secretary in Auckland for ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa, said today that ASTE members at MIT had voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action. “This is the first time in over 10 years that members at MIT have taken industrial action,” Ms Brorens said. “This shows the depth of their feeling at the inadequacy of the employer’s offer”.

The union has made a salary claim of 4.0% over a 12-month term. Ms Brorens said that the management offer of 1.5% and 2.3% staggered over an 18-month term is far too low. “At a time when the CPI is 3.3% and with petrol prices predicted to rise to over $2.00 a litre, our members want a real salary increase,” she said.

She went on to say that ASTE members have worked hard over a number of years which has helped MIT to achieve the substantial reserves it has. “It is our members’ view that it is now time to invest in staff who are the greatest resource of the Institution”.
