Union acknowledges death of Monte Ohia

ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa acknowledges the passing of a great Māori leader, Rereamoamo Monte Ohia, a tall totara tree who has fallen and who was not only a renowned educationalist, but also a whanau oriented person with strong beliefs.

Tangi Tipene, National President said “Our union mourns the passing of such a great man. We recognise his contribution to Māori education in the tertiary sector and other areas of education. Monte was a previous head of the Bay of Plenty Polytechnic Māori school as well as the executive director at the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology where he had held that role since December 2005. Monte worked with Māori staff and members of our union in both institutions and we are proud to have been affiliated with him. His strength, knowledge, guidance and wisdom will be sorely missed by Māori in our sector. We wish his family and friends the very best in healing the space left by such a great rangatira”.

Kaumātua Dr Huirangi Waikerepuru commented today saying “Kua maringi nga roimata ki runga te papa i te hinga atu o te Totara nui o te wao nui a Tane. Takoto, takoto e te Rangatira e Monte, haere, haere, haere.”
