Merger Talks Underway

Members of the National Executives of the two staff unions at polytechnics and institutes of technology and wananga met for two days last week in Rotorua to progress plans for the amalgamation of the two unions. National Presidents Shelley Weir and Lloyd Woods said today “A merged union will provide opportunities to increase our influence in the tertiary education sector. This will mean better representation for our members and it will give us greater strength overall in increased unity”. They also said that the new union would have over six thousand members with the potential for many more.

Dr Te Huirangi Waikerepuru and Conrad Herewini, kai tuhono for both unions went on to say “Whakapuputia te kakaho e kore e whati – binding the kakaho together gives us greater strength”.
