Academic Staff at NorthTec Support Colleagues

The National Secretary of ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa Sharn Riggs said today that academic staff members at NorthTec were in full support of the action their allied staff colleagues were taking today to try to get a settlement of their collective agreement. Ms Riggs said, “Our members fully understand and support their allied staff colleagues in this action to achieve a pay settlement that is fair and reasonable”. She continued by saying “They have tried to do this through the process of negotiation but now it is time to make the wider community aware of the legitimacy of their claims”.
