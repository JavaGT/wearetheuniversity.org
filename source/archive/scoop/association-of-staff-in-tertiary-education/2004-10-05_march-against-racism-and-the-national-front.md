March Against Racism And The National Front

Call For Members to March Against Racism and the National Front.

The Association of Staff in Tertiary Education (ASTE) unanimously endorsed the march against racism and the National Front at its annual conference in Wellington last week.

" As a result I call on all ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa members in the Wellington area who can possibly do so to join the march on the 23rd of October to show that New Zealand citizens do not support racism and the National Front" Lloyd Woods, the President of ASTE, said today in Wellington.

Mr Woods added, "We can not accept the so called philosophy of the National Front and racism within our country and we must be prepared to show it. We applaud those organising this anti-racism march and wish to show our support. We encourage any person living within the Wellington district to join in and show the world that we reject racism".
