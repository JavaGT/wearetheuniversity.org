ASTE Members at CPIT to take Strike Action

“Academic staff who are members of ASTE have voted overwhelmingly in favour of taking strike action at Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology in order to receive a fair salary offer.” Mike Dawson, Field Officer and Advocate of ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa, said today in Christchurch. “Despite many months of talking, the parties have not been able to close the gap between the needs of its academic staff and what is being offered by their employer.” he added.

Mike Dawson went on to say “A further offer was made following our member’s decision to take strike action, but it was simply not enough. The employer’s offer of 2% for 2005, 3% for 2006, and 1% for a proportion of 2007, was thoroughly rejected by ASTE members, who voted unanimously to take ongoing strike action.” “With inflation running at 2.8% from the June 2004 quarter to the June 2005 quarter, CPIT’s offer was nowhere near members’ expectations of what constitutes a fair pay rise.” Mr Dawson said.

Mr Dawson confirmed that while CPIT has had both internal and external problems to contend with these were not of the teaching staffs making and that staff do not see a raid on their salaries as a solution to these problems. “In fact” Mr Dawson added “all of the Polytechnics are subject to the same funding regime and yet, with the exception of one semi bankrupt Institution (who also offered 2%), they have had no hesitation in doing better. Strike action will continue until a more realistic, reasonable and acceptable offer is made by CPIT management.”

Mr Dawson noted that it was time that the staff were rewarded for their endeavours while getting a salary increase that also reflected increases in the wider community. “We must be able attract the best nurses, teachers, trades people, and other people to the tertiary institutions. If our salaries continue to fall behind we will not only lose more of our existing staff back to industry but we will continue to have recruitment and morale issues. We are asking for no more than a fair deal.” Mr Dawson concluded.
