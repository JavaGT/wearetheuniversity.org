ASTE says “get over it!”

ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa members at Unitec New Zealand have advised Unitec management that they are totally opposed to any further expenditure relating to University status. “In fact” the National President, Lloyd Woods, said today “our members passed a resolution at a meeting last Friday that stated ‘We demand that Unitec suspend all expenditure directed towards achieving university status’. This is not surprising given the current threat to many jobs at the institution”.

ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa neither supported nor opposed the origional application because staff feelings varied. Mr Woods said “there is now very strong feedback that John Webster and his Council should accept the decision, take it on the chin and get over it especially given that the institution is looking at institution wide reviews of expenditure in every other area”.

UNITEC has held a reputation for excellent provision of a wide range of programmes from certificate to degree level for many years but a further waste of ‘learner dollars’ puts that reputation at risk. Woods added. “Further legal action whilst no doubt being seen as petulant will more importantly only exacerbate the confusion and turmoil that is being experienced currently by staff.

Funds should be used to ensure recruitment and retention of quality staff to maintain the quality and scope of programmes expected at a leading Institute of Technology.
