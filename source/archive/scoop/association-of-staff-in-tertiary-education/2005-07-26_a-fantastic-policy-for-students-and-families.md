A “fantastic” policy for students and families
==============================================

A “fantastic” policy for students and their families!

The National President of the Association of Staff in Tertiary Education Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa, Lloyd Woods today congratulated the government and the Labour Party on a carefully considered, straightforward and far reaching policy proposal for addressing student debt.

Mr Woods, commenting on the release of Labour’s ‘Student Support’ policy said that the policy, the next step in Labour’s strategy to ensure that tertiary education is affordable, is a an excellent indication of what is seen as important by this government.

“People have forgotten that during the 90’s fees went up every year and student debt rose accordingly. They seem to have also forgotten that the Labour led government has reduced fees relevant to inflation since taking office through the fee freeze and fee maxima. They also changed student loan rules. All of these were significant in reducing debt but pale into insignificance compared to the policy released today” Mr Woods said.

He added “ Labour promised to lower the cost burden for students. Today they have done so for current and past students, working or not working. Simply put this is fantastic news for students and those with loans but also for Mums and Dads, Grandparents, and extended family. Well done Helen Clark and Trevor Mallard – and thanks!”
