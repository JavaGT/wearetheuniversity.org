Union Launches Campaign on Fixed Term Appointments

Sharn Riggs the National Secretary of ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa said today that the union was launching a campaign on the use of fixed term appointments in tertiary education institutions. “For too long employers have used fixed term appointments to hide shoddy employment practices. Changes to the Employment Relations Amendment Act with regard to the use of fixed term appointments mean that employers now have to be very clear about the purpose of a fixed term appointment and the reasons for its end,” she said.

“We have had situations where our members have been on fixed term agreements that have been rolled over four, five and six times with no genuine reason for the fixed term appointment or as to why the job shouldn’t be permanent. This is not acceptable and needs to change,” she said.

Ms Riggs went on to say that the union’s field officers would be working with members doing an audit of fixed term appointments to make sure that they comply with the Act. She finished by saying, “We have also written to our employers advising them of this campaign. We know that many of them are undertaking their own audits so between us we should be able to ensure that staff are employed appropriately and in accordance with the law. This could result in a number of our members finally having permanent employment status”.
