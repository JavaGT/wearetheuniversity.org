New Tertiary Minister Welcomed By ASTE

ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa welcomes and congratulates the new Minister of Tertiary, Peter Hodgson his new role and look forward to working with the minister in the future. “We found Minister Cullen an excellent advocate for tertiary and will be sad to see him step out of this role but see no difference with the way in which Mr Hodgson works. Mr Cullen has worked with a great deal of integrity in an area where people are always quick to offer criticisms but no solutions” says Tangi Tipene ASTEs’ National President. Tangi goes on to say that, “We look forward to working with the new minister and building a positive relationship with him. He brings a background of education and a wealth of knowledge and experience across all facets of politics to the role has which will add depth to this role.”

ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa also congratulates the new Associate Minister Maryan Street and welcomes her into this new role. “We are sure Maryan will be able to bring a new dimension into this role as a woman who has extensive experience in education and her obvious good sense and abilities in other areas such as health, industrial relations, women’s issues and Treaty settlements. In fact Maryan is a fantastic addition to the Labour Party’s cabinet”, says Tangi.

We are also pleased to see Chris Carter as the new Minister of Education and congratulate him. Taking over the reins from Steve Maharey who has done a sterling job as the Minister of Education and in the past the Minister of Tertiary.
