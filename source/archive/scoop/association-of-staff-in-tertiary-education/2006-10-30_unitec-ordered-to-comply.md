Unitec Ordered to Comply

  
The Employment Relations Authority issued two compliance orders today against one of the country’s largest polytechnics. Association of Staff in Tertiary Education National Legal Officer, Mike Dawson said that today’s decision confirmed the need for employers to consult appropriately with unions and their members in a formal structured manner when they are looking to make structural and staffing changes to their organisations.

He said, “Today’s decision highlights the fact that employers are not a law unto themselves. They need to comply with the terms of the collective agreements that they are bound by, and most importantly they need to understand that reasonable timeframes for consultation, talking with and listening to staff and their representatives in a timely manner will result in better decisions for everyone”.

Mr Dawson continued by saying that he hoped that the Authority’s decision would mean that Unitec’s proposals could now be properly considered by staff. He concluded saying “We hope that this outcome will mean that any future proposals by Unitec management will be dealt with through proper processes and in full consultation with ASTE members through their union”.
