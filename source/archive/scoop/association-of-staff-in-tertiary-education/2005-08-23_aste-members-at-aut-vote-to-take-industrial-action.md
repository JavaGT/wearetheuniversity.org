ASTE Members at AUT Vote to take Industrial Action

Irena Brorens, Assistant Secretary in Auckland for ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa, said today that ASTE members at the Auckland University of Technology had voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action to improve the Vice Chancellor’s salary offer of 3.5% and 3.5% over two years. Union members are claiming 6.5% and 6.5% over the same period. “It’s not acceptable ”, said Ms Brorens “that our members are falling further and further behind the rest of the university sector in terms of salaries”.

She went on to say that AUT management needed to step up to the mark on the salaries issue if they were to compete nationally and internationally in the market for academics. “Our members are qualified, competent professionals who will not sit by and subsidise the university’s activities by accepting pay increases that barely keep pace with inflation”.

Ms Brorens said that withdrawal of goodwill will commence tomorrow and unless there is a significantly improved offer from AUT, strike action will begin next week.
