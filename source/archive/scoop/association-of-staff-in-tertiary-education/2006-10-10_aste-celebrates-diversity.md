Association of Staff in Tertiary Education Celebrates Diversity

At its Annual Conference last week ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa delegates resolved to develop a national network for those who identify as queer to assist in the development of a policy for union members.

Lloyd Woods, National President said today, “This network has an important task in the development of a suitable policy. The policy will not just relate to ASTE members, but should also give direction on how tertiary teachers can ensure that classrooms, lecture theatres and workshops are safe places for students regardless of their sexual orientation. This work is part of our role as a professional association in making sure every student has the best possible learning environment”.
