Further Industrial action at Manukau Institute of Technology

Irena Brorens, Assistant Secretary in Auckland for ASTE Te Hau Takitini o Aotearoa, said today that ASTE members at MIT are taking further industrial action today as the employer has made no change to their offer.

ASTE members are still pursuing a salary claim of 4.0% over a 12-month term.

Ms Brorens said, “ASTE members are on strike between 1-3pm today. Many classes at MIT have been cancelled as a result”.
