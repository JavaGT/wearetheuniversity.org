Workers Party demands lifting of authoritarian University flag-burning trespass

Victoria University have placed a trespass notice on Joel Cosgrove (Workers Party member) for his burning of the New Zealand flag today in opposition to New Zealand’s ongoing jingoism surrounding its imperialistic foreign policy.

“Joel poses no danger to anyone at Victoria University except those who take offence at anyone challenging the status quo. Victoria University stifles debate and political expression” says Phillip Fergusson (Workers Party National Organiser).

“I’ve said quite clearly to the University that burning the flag was a political act and that I had made my point, they want to punish that by barring me from the Student Union Building” States Cosgrove

“This means I can’t attend meetings I was supposed to speak at or host my regular Friday student radio show.” Explains Cosgrove.

“Although three people took part in burning the flag only Joel has been attacked by VUW so far, this is a clear attempt to shut down debate and intimidate activists, VUW are targeting Joel as an ex-student president for that reason.” Says Whitmore

The Workers Party calls for the immediate lifting of the trespasses notice and an end to all attempts to stifle freedom of expression.
