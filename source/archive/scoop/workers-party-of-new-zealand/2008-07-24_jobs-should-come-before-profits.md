Jobs Should Come Before Profits
===============================

**Press Release: [Workers Party of New Zealand](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Workers_Party_of_New_Zealand)**

Jobs Should Come Before Profits

As the recession bites, workers are again carrying the heaviest burden.  
The layoffs just announced at Silver Fern Farms' Belfast plant are  
another sign that the current parties have nothing left to offer  
workers. ﻿The Workers Party thinks jobs for all should come before  
profits for private companies and supports action by workers to keep  
their jobs, including occupations of workplaces threatened with closure.  
As a first step, the Workers Party of New Zealand will abolish GST  
because it is a regressive tax that hits workers particularly hard.

We are launching our Christchurch Electoral campaign at 7pm on Monday  
July 28th. The campaign launch will be held in the WEA at 59 Gloucester  
St.

The Workers Party is standing two candidates in Christchurch  
electorates: secondary school teacher and former meat worker Paul  
Hopkinson in Christchurch East and retail worker and student Byron Clark  
in Christchurch Central. We also have candidates standing in Auckland  
and Wellington. If elected, WP candidates have pledged to use their  
parliamentary resources to support workers' struggles and campaigns.  
Workers Party policy is that candidates accept a skilled worker's wage  
for themselves. The remainder of the inflated MP's remuneration will  
contribute to a fund to support such struggles.

The Workers Party is a party of workers, for workers. We are campaigning  
for the complete freedom of movement for workers through a policy of  
open borders, and for freedom from all anti-democratic laws such as the  
Terrorism Suppression Act, the Electoral Finance Act and the current  
Bill to amend the Immigration Act. The Workers Party stands for jobs for  
all, a shorter working week and no restriction on the right to strike.  
The Workers Party also aims for a workers' republic.

The Workers' Party intends to be registered on the party list, giving  
every voter in the country the opportunity to vote for a party that  
stands firmly for workers.
