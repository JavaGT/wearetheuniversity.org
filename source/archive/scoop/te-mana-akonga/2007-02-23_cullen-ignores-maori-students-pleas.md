Cullen Ignores Maori Students Pleas

As the academic year re-begins, Maori tertiary students nationwide are devastated at the response of the Minister of Tertiary Education, Michael Cullen, to their Manaaki Tonu Te Tauira: Maori Development through Tertiary Education campaign. In August 2006 up to 500 Maori students and supporters marched to Parliament to present the government with submissions from themselves and other Maori students from all over the country. Despite a positive reception from Maori MP's on the day, Cullen’s response to the submissions is a huge disappointment.

"The Manaaki Tonu Te Tauira submissions outlined four specific issues; the formulation of a Maori perspective on quality and relevance, the reinforcement of the Treaty in tertiary education, the need to continue support funding such as the Special Supplementary Grant, and the need to continue funding assistance to Maori students, such as Manaaki Tauira" says Victor Manawatu, Kaituhono of Te Mana Akonga, the National Maori Tertiary Students' Association. "His one page response did not address any of the four issues. He has completely ignored us".

The Manaaki Tonu Te Tauira campaign was developed by Maori tertiary students in response to the changes undergoing in the tertiary sector. Most importantly, it addressed the cutting of the Manaaki Tauira grant, which over 9000 Maori students per year have received to assist them with the costs of study. Currently Maori students are under-represented in the degree and postgraduate level of study, where income earnings equivalent to non-Maori begin to be made.

"Manaaki Tauira was essential in getting Maori students to the level of study we need to be. And these reforms hail students needs as at the centre of the changes" says Manawatu, "however Cullen has taken no notice of the information we provided. He has clearly not even read our submission. Is he the Minister for Tertiary Education, or isn’t he? Don’t we deserve to be listened to, like anyone else?"

In light of Cullen’s unsatisfactory response, Te Mana Akonga will now be starting a petition to present to parliament, so that the matter may go to a Parliamentary Select Committee. "Cullen gives us no choice" says Manawatu.

"The issue of Manaaki Tauira will not go away. Our futures are at stake. We cannot afford to let this happen. The government will be hearing more from us".
