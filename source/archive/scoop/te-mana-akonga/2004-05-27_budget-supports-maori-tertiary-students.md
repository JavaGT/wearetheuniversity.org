Budget supports Maori tertiary students

Budget supports Maori tertiary students

  
“Maori students are welcoming the extension of student allowances to more students from low to middle income families,” said Dr. Helen Potter, Kaituhono of Te Mana Akonga.

“The budget will go some way to addressing the massive amounts of student debt that Maori students and Maori communities are faced with”

“While increased participation of Maori students is positive, it has led to an unprecedented level of Maori student debt,” said Dr. Potter.

“This debt is a disgrace when you consider that it is around four times the total paid out in Treaty settlements to date”.

“No Maori student should be forced to borrow from the harsh student loan scheme to live while studying. More than this, borrowing to learn te reo is a clear breach of the Treaty of Waitangi, as it is a taonga guaranteed protection”.

“This budget has to be just the beginning for improving the situation for Maori students. Maori students call on the government to introduce a living allowance for all students and to cut student fees – starting with Maori learning te reo”.

Te Mana Akonga is looking forward to working with government agencies to make further improvements to student support.
