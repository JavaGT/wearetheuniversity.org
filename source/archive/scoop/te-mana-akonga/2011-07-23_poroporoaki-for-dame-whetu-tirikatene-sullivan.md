Poroporoaki for Dame Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan

Māori students are saddened by the passing of Dame Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan ONZ and pay tribute to the significant legacy she has left in education and society.

“She helped form the New Zealand Federation of Māori Students and was elected as its first president, she campaigned to get more Māori students into universities and to have Māori language courses available at tertiary level,” says Jacqualene Poutu, Tumuaki (President) of Te Mana Akonga (the National Māori Tertiary Students’ Association).

“We are greatly indebted to the legacy she has left, and work that she has done to advance the interests of Māori, first as a Māori student representative and leader, and as a Member of Parliament for Te Tai Tonga electorate.”

“She actively advocated for the promotion of te reo Māori and equitable representation for Māori people.” says Miss Poutu

“It has been said that her door was always open to Tauira Māori, and they felt confident in accessing her support and manaaki. She was well regarded by rangatahi as a warm and compassionate person.”

“Te Mana Ākonga sends their aroha to the whanau pani, and would like to elucidate that her legacy will live on in the mahi she has supported and developed within Te Tai Tonga, the education sector and Te Ao Māori”

Nō reira e te rangatira, haere atu rā ki te pūtahitanga o Rehua, moe mai rā i tō moenga roa.
