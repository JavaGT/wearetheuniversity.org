Media Statement

Absolutely Positively for Student Choice

Vic Uni Young Nats absolutely positively welcome the Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill which allows for voluntary student membership.

"Students ought to have the same rights and freedoms as every other New Zealander, we should be able to decide whether or not we join a union” says Christian Lambert, Chair of Vic Uni Young Nats.

“Critics are misrepresenting the facts, claiming that the current situation is fair as students can elect to withdraw from the union. However exemptions are rarely granted and the few that do receive no refund.”

“Membership needs to be an opt-in choice, not an-opt out alternative. It’s that simple.”

“We’ve been disappointed to see comments from NZUSA, claiming that ‘students are not bothered by the issue’. This sort of message unfairly characterises young people as apathetic. It says that we’re not bothered about our right and freedoms.“

“The Vic Uni Young Nats call on all MPs to vote for this bill through the first reading. We encourage others to join us in calling for this bill to be passed so that all students can enjoy the same freedom of association other New Zealanders do.”

"Students will welcome the chance for choice.”
