USU Students' Association host fourth Kids' Day Out

March 10, 2009

They're said to have more energy than Huntly Power Station.

And on Saturday, March 27 The Funky Monkeys, New Zealand's own musical supergroup for kids, will bring that energy to Kids' Day Out.

The family fun day is hosted by USU Students' Association at Unitec and will start at 11am.

The Funky Monkeys - New Zealand's super group for kids will be there performing their hit song and dance routines.

Old MacDonald's farm lets children get up close to a range of animals like sheep, rabbits, goats and ponies.

There will also be face painters, balloon sculptors, story tellers, and bouncy castles.

Around a quarter of Unitec students have dependents, which is why USU Students' Association at Unitec decided to establish the event two years ago.

USU Students' Association at Unitec president, Pete Hodkinson says it's important that the students' association caters to all age groups of students at Unitec:

"Not all of our students are necessarily young and keen for a pub crawl. Kids' Day Out gives our students, with kids, the opportunity to have a fun, social day out with their peers and families. Plus, it's not just for the kids- it's a fun, chilled out day. I went along last year, and I've got to say, it was pretty entertaining," he says.

Kids' Day Out will be held at the Henderson Primary School fields, corner of Great North Road and Edsel Street, just a two minute walk from Unitec's Waitakere Campus.

Entry is free.
