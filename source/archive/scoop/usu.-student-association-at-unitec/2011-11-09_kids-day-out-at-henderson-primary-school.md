**Kids’ Day Out at Henderson Primary School**

November 9, 2011

They’re amazingly talented, have a knack for singing and dancing, and pride themselves on making kids want to learn!

And on Saturday, November 19th _The Polkadots_, New Zealand’s own musical phenomenon for kids, will bring that talent to Kids’ Day Out.

The family fun day is hosted by USU Students’ Association at Unitec and will run from 11am-3pm.

_The Polkadots_ - New Zealand’s educational entertainers will be there performing their great song and dance routines.

There will also be an array of face painters, clowns, magicians, rides and bouncy castles.

Around a quarter of Unitec students have dependents, which is why USU Students’ Association at Unitec decided to establish the event four years ago.

USU Students’ Association at Unitec president, Pete Hodkinson says it’s important that the students’ association caters to all age groups of students at Unitec:

"In particular, it's about acknowledging and supporting the fact that not all Unitec students are 18 and keen on things like parties and pub crawls. Kids’ Day Out is a whanau and community friendly day of fun and games for all ages to enjoy. As a matter of fact, it's not just for the kids, I've been along and had a great time!" he says.

Kids’ Day Out will be held at the Henderson Primary School fields, corner of Great North Road and Edsel Street, just a two minute walk from Unitec's Waitakere Campus.

Entry is free.
