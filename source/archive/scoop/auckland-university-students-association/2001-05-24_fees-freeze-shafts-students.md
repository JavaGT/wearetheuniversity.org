“Students are in a no win situation under the Government Fees deal rumoured to be in tomorrow’s budget,” said Auckland University Students Association President, Kane Stanford.

“The Fees Deal was supposed to be a one off option for last year but the Government seems to be content to continue a legacy of underfunding universities and increasing tuition fees just like it’s predecessors,” said Stanford.

“If the Universities takes the fees deal, students face larger classes, fewer library resources, and less investment in plant and equipment. If the Universities do not take the fee offer, then Auckland University students face fee rises of between $400 and $2500. This a completely unacceptable situation.”

“If the Government is truly committed to New Zealand becoming a knowledge society, then it should ensure that high quality, low cost education is available to every New Zealander,” concluded Mr Stanford.
