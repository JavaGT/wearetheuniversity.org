AUSA President Clarifies Craccum Independence

The President of the Auckland University Students Association, Mr Ross Burns, today clarified the status of Craccum magazine as an independent publication. “While the magazine is published by the association, its content is completely the domain of the editors, and AUSA has no input to this process. Since the early 1980s, the editors of the magazine have been elected directly by students. This is unique to Auckland University, as all other Students Associations employ a staff member to fill this role, and as such have a greater degree of control. AUSA does not see the product before publication”, said Mr Burns today, in response to inquiries.

In response to student concerns, AUSA yesterday withdrew this week’s edition, pending legal advice on some of the content. ”AUSA must take a number of issues into account before deciding our next course of action ” said Mr Burns.
