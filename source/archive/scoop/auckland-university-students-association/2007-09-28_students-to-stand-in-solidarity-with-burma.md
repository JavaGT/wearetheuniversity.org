Auckland students to stand in solidarity with Burma

Auckland students welcome recent uprisings against Burma’s military dictatorship, and stand in solidarity with their Burmese counterparts.

AUSA urges all students to come to the Burma Solidarity rally in Aotea Square this Saturday 2pm to show their support and solidarity for the people of Burma, as they rise up against an oppressive and brutal military regime.

“The Burmese people are striving towards the rights and freedoms of speech, association, and movement that students in New Zealand take for granted,” said AUSA acting President Bethanie Maples.

In Burma, students have been one group in society prepared to speak out against the oppressive regime.

AUSA clubs have hosted speakers and events related to Burma. There is a Burma Support group on campus as well.

“We also urge the New Zealand government to join the global chorus of concern and use whatever means it has available to put further pressure on the Burmese junta,” said David Do, AUSA Education Vice President.

“We are also concerned at increasing reports of police and military crackdowns on these peaceful protests. We hope this situation will be resolved through the removal of the military government by peaceful means.”
