Auckland students concerned over negotiation breakdown

University of Auckland students today expressed concern over the breakdown in negotiations between the University unions and Vice Chancellors in Christchurch and the possibility of prolonged industrial action. Auckland University Student’s Association President Greg Langton said he was worried about the effects on students of any ongoing strikes during Semester Two. “The Union has indicated that their first day of national action is likely to be July 20, three days into the new semester”, he said. “Obviously we’re anxious about how that will affect students, particularly if it signals the beginning of a long period of instability”

Mr. Langton called on both parties to show good faith and commit themselves to negotiations, to ensure a fair solution was reached as early as possible. “The earlier negotiations resume, the earlier strikes end and the earlier students can get on with what they’re here to do – learn” he said.

AUSA Education Vice President Xavier Goldie said that students support the staff and Unions in their work to achieve fair pay, but were becoming increasingly concerned that they were being stuck in the middle. “These are our teachers and educators who do a fantastic job, so of course we support them in their fight to get paid their worth” he said, “we just hope that both sides continue to recognise that students are the ones ultimately affected by disrupted classes”.

Mr. Goldie added that the Union had indicated they were keenly aware of the effects of industrial action on students, and acknowledged that their actions so far had been implemented in a way that minimised the impact on students’ academic outcomes.
