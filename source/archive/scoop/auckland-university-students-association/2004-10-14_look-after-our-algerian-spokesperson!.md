‘Look after our Algerian Spokesperson!’ demand students

The Auckland University Students’ Association is deeply concerned that their new Algerian spokesperson Ahmed Zaoui is not being treated fairly.

“We are deeply concerned that the government is appealing the human rights of our honorary Algerian Spokesperson.” Said AUSA Pesident Kate Sutton today.

“The Students at the University of Auckland have accepted Mr Zaoui into our community and we feel that his human rights should be taken into account when he is being investigated.” Sutton continued. “The students at the University by voting to make Zaoui our spokesperson were sending a clear message to Government – Freedom or a fair trial.”

Mr Zaoui is entitled to make statements on behalf of the students at the University of Auckland regarding Algerian Affairs.

ENDS
