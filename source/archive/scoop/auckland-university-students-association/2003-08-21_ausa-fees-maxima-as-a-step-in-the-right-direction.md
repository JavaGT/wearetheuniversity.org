AUSA Welcomes The Fees Maxima As A Step In The Right Direction

The Auckland University Students Association today applauded the new fees maxima that will see Auckland University fees capped for the next three years.

AUSA policy has always been free education but they welcome the maxima as a step in the right direction.

Education Vice President Kate Sutton said, \"I am pleased with the governments decision to make access to education a priority rather than the Universities profit making approach." She went on to say " Auckland Students do very well out of the maxima as we pay the highest fees in the county."

Auckland University has signaled that it will approach the TEC for exemptions to the maxmia and AUSA is committed to fighting against this so that education is accessible to all.
