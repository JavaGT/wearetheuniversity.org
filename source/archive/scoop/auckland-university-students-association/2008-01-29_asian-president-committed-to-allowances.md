Asian president committed to allowances

As the University of Auckland celebrates its Jubilee in 2008, the Auckland University Students’ Association has also hit a landmark of its own.

2008 President David Do is AUSA’s first president of Asian descent, the first in the Association’s 117-year history.

“I’m passionate about serving students, and I’m proud to take on this important role. I’ll be working as hard as I can to serve students,” says David Do.

David comes into the role of President with considerable experience in the Association executive. He was Welfare Officer from late 2004 to 2006, running the foodbank and financial assistance scheme. As 2007 Education Vice President he was closely involved in fighting the University of Auckland’s moves to eliminate open entry.

One of AUSA’s key priorities for 2008 is campaigning to increase access to student allowances.

“Students should not be forced to borrow to live because their parents are ‘too rich’ or because they’re under 25. I think that’s wrong – students should be properly supported while they are studying,” says David Do.

“The facts are clear about skyrocketing student debt, and students are angry about this continued lack of proper support. We saw this clearly from the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations conference in Wellington this past weekend.”

AUSA is fully committed to the nationwide campaign for living allowances for all students.
