Slippery Steve Shafts Students Over Summer
==========================================

**Press Release: [Auckland University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association)**

“The Associate Minister of Education (Tertiary) obviously thinks that students are stupid, if he thinks that students will believe his claims that the Labour Government has made their situation in summer any better than under National” said Auckland University Students’ Association Education Vice-President, Stephanie Thompson, today.

“The Minister seems to think that by increasing the numbers of students on the exceptional circumstances benefit, he has made up for National’s ‘mean spirited attack’ on students. However this is not the case,” said Ms Thompson.

“While the Minister should be congratulated for improving the processing of benefits, the question remains over why the majority of students, who do not qualify for allowances, are able to access money to live on through student loans scheme during term time and then are supposed to rely on the financial ability and goodwill of their parents to support them during summer should they not find a job,” said Ms Thompson.

“Students like any other group in society deserve a safety net, however the Minister is happy for nearly 75% of Auckland University students to fall through the gaps during the summer, which is not something the Government should be delivering for students at all,” concluded Ms Thompson.
