“Hippy fear factor” to heighten environ awareness
=================================================

“Hippy fear factor” to heighten environmental awareness.

The Auckland University Students Association Eco-Fest ends today with “Hippy Fear factor” at one o’clock in the University of Auckland quad.

“We are sculling spirillina, chaining a hippy to a tree and sculling beer and then recycling the cans.” Said AUSA Environmental Affairs Officer Chris Currie “It is a light-hearted end to three days of serious environmental education for students” he continued.

Wednesday is International Car free day and many lobby and interest groups are gathering in the quad to provide information to students on Peak oil and climate change.

“The Ecodome in the quad has been an amazing success. Greenpeace are playing videos on a reorder that is totally solar and wind powered, it’s amazing to see the future in the middle of the University.”

ECOFEST ends today with Cornerstone Roots and International Observer playing at shadows.
