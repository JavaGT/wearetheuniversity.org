Students welcome bail for Algerian Affairs Spokesperson

The Auckland University Students Association is happy to hear of the release on bail of their Algerian spokesperson. “Its two years too late but we are still pleased for Mr Zaoui” Said AUSA President Kate Sutton “We look forward to Mr Zaoui addressing students with issues regarding Algerian affairs”

“The Zaoui case has highlighted a real lapse in New Zealand’s capacity to deal with refugees and the Students Association have always advocated for Freedom or a fair trial for Mr Zaoui.” Ahmed Zaoui was elected as the Algerian Spokesperson for the AUSA earlier in the year by a general meeting of over 200 students.
