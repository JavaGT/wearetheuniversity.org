‘Til Debt Do Us Part

As part of the winter orientation events, the Auckland University Students’ Association will be holding a marriage ceremony today at 1pm in the Auckland University Quad in protest over access to student allowances.

“We believe that it is ridiculous that by the age of 18 students are considered old enough to: vote, marry, and be jailed for defrauding the student allowance system, but are considered a child dependent on our parents until the age of 25 for income support,” said Ms Thompson.

“Nearly one third of the $5 billion owed by current and former students is due to living costs. If political parties are serious about reducing student debt they must widen eligibility to student allowances so that students are not forced into such drastic measures to avoid going into debt to pay for their food and rent,” concluded Ms Thompson.
