### Students and staff shocked by University bullying at graduation

Students and staff at the University of Auckland have been shocked this week by University staff threatening to block a top student from attending his graduation ceremony for wearing a rosette.

Vernon Tava, who was graduating Masters of Law with first class honours, was told by graduation officials he would not be permitted to enter the hall while wearing a yellow rosette.

The rosette relates to a joint campaign from the Tertiary Education Union (TEU) and the Auckland University Students’ Association (AUSA) to persuade the Vice-Chancellor to retain important academic conditions in their collective employment agreement.

“I was told that the rosette wasn’t appropriate for a meeting of the university council, and that I wouldn’t be crossing the stage and graduating if it was not removed,” Tava said.

AUSA President Joe McCrory, a member of the University Council, wore a rosette on stage as part of the official party.

“Students felt intimidated, with many thinking they would be unable to graduate for wearing the rosettes,” McCrory said.

“The threats made by university officials present a massive affront to freedom of expression,” McCrory said.

“The rosettes weren’t disruptive, but the bullying of graduates by university staff certainly was. The University of Auckland should be ashamed for treating graduates in this way,” McCrory said.

Students who felt intimidated or threatened by graduation staff are asked to contact AUSA confidentially on rosette@ausa.org.nz.

“AUSA will be working on behalf of students to seek an official apology from the University of Auckland for their disgraceful conduct,” McCrory concluded.
