### Auckland University students launch street appeal for Christchurch earthquake

The Auckland University Students’ Association has launched an immediate street appeal to raise money for the people of Christchurch affected by the disastrous earthquake.

“No words can express the horror of the scenes we have seen coming in from Christchurch,” said AUSA President Joe McCrory.

“The street appeal is being co-ordinated by the students’ association and will be running throughout Orientation next week and fresher’s orientation this week,” said McCrory.

Anyone wishing to make a donation to the Auckland University Students’ Appeal for Christchurch may contact AUSA on 09 309 0789, or make a donation in person around the Student Union Building on the University of Auckland campus.

“Thoughts of every University of Auckland student are with the people of Christchurch, their families and friends,” said McCrory.

“Any University of Auckland students who wish to assist the association in organising the appeal are welcome to contact AUSA throughout the next few days,” concluded McCrory.
