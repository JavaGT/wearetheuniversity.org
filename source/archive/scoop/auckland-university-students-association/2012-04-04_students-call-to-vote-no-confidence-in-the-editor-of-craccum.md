Students call to vote no confidence in the editor of Craccum

Students at the University of Auckland have called for a Special General Meeting to move a motion of no confidence in the editor of the student magazine, Craccum.

Craccum has been published since 1914. It has had a number of high profile editors, including former Speaker of the House of Representatives Jonathan Hunt, the Right Honourable Sir Owen Woodhouse, Martin "Bomber" Bradbury and Tim Shadbolt. Students last exercised their right to remove the editor in 1989.

20 students petitioned the Auckland University Students' Association to hold the Special General Meeting, in line with the Association's constitution. The students claim that the magazine is not representative, and is overtly political.

"The Auckland University Students' Association has a proud history of electing the editor of the student magazine," says Arena Williams, President of the Auckland University Students’ Association. "It's a democratic platform for expression of students' views, and if students are unhappy about how it has been run this year, they're entitled to have their say at a Special General Meeting."

"The Students' Association does not support or oppose the students' motion of no confidence in the editor. We have called the meeting because we think it's important that students views are represented," she said.

The SGM will be held on Thursday 19 April in the University Quad. All students may attend, but only members of the Auckland University Students' Association are entitled to vote. Quorum for the meeting is 200 and the vote of no confidence requires a simple majority to pass.
