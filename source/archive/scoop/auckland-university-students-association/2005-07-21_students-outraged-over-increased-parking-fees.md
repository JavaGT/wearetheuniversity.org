Students outraged over increased parking fees.

The recent decision by the Auckland City Council to increase the cost of 90 minute parking around The University of Auckland by over thirty percent from $4.50 to $6.00 has been met with disapproval from students.

Auckland University Students Association (AUSA) President Greg Langton is concerned over the decreasing affordability of being able to study at The University of Auckland. Mr Langton commented that the “rise in cost of parking will increase the financial struggle for many students who have a legitimate need to use short-term parking spaces. Many students need the flexibility of affordable short-term parking so they can go to a lecture and then quickly return to other obligations such as child care, part-time, or full time employment.”

AUSA is also aware of substantial numbers of students who are unable to use public transport. This due to a lack of adequate service in certain regions and the high cost of public transport which provides little incentive to switch from driving. Mr Langton points out that where there is an affordable reliable bus service, such as the heavily used free inner city bus, that students are willing to jump on board. As a result AUSA is calling upon the regional authorities to provide more routes for free inner city buses and to ensure more affordable ticket prices across the board.

The Student Association commends the Auckland Regional Transport Authorities (ARTA) for its current plans to develop a viable long-term Universities Travel Plan, however in the short-term increased parking costs and lack of viable alternatives are just compounding the current transport difficulties for students.
