Iceberg in Auckland City

Media Release – 16 September 2009 – For Immediate Use

Iceberg in Auckland City

The Auckland University Students Association (AUSA) is today creating an urban iceberg within the Auckland University Quad, as part of the Greenpeace New Zealand Sign On campaign. Sponsorship has been provided by Phoenix Organics, who have provided drinks and other prizes for thirsty students. Greenpeace activists dressed as polar bears will be encouraging people to get involved and think about the environment.

The Sign On campaign encourages the Government and the Prime Minister John Key to call for a 40 per cent by 2020 emission reduction target.

AUSA President Darcy Peacock said, “This is a really fun event, and a great way for students to get in behind the Sign On campaign. There aren’t icebergs in the Quad everyday.”

“While it is no disaster for the AUSA iceberg to melt by the end of the day, it will be a bigger disaster if the polar ice caps melt and we don’t do anything.”
