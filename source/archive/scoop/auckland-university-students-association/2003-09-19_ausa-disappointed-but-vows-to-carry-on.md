AUSA disappointed but vows to carry on

AUSA president Scott Kelly said "Obviously I am disappointed with the result" of the Compulsory/ Non compulsory student membership referendum announced today.

"This is not just disappointing for me but should be disappointing to all students whose representation is been gradually eroded as a result of non compulsory membership"

He went on to say "The recent decision by the University to increase fees significantly, and in some cases past the fees maxima, shows the need for a strong, representative student voice."

AUSA president-elect Kate Sutton said "Voluntary membership brings with it distinct challenges but AUSA as a body will continue to champion the rights of students as it has since its formation in 1891"
