Further Statement on AUSA Referendum
====================================

**Wednesday, 23 August 2017, 1:56 pm**  
**Press Release: [Auckland University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association)**

**FURTHER STATEMENT ON AUSA REFERENDUM**

A number of statements are being spread about various aspects of the AUSA referendum, which is currently being voted on by students. Many of these statements are false, leading to misinformation about AUSA, and the referendum process circulating around the student body and public. This statement serves to address some of the main questions being asked of AUSA:

**1: What is the outcome of a club being disaffiliated from AUSA?**

The main effect of disaffiliation is that there will no longer be a formal relationship between AUSA and the disaffiliated club. In addition to this, organisations will have to pay slightly more to book rooms in the Student Union Building and hire AUSA assets, such as our sound system, barbecue and stage.

Disaffiliated clubs can still apply for, and receive funding. They can also book space at the University of Auckland. They are still able to access the campus, set up stalls both during and outside of O-Week, hold events, and distribute information. They do not lose their right to be a club or to have a voice at the University of Auckland.

**2: Is the question on disaffiliating the Pro-Life club endorsed by AUSA?**

No. Any student member of AUSA can submit a referendum question to AUSA. AUSA is then constitutionally obliged to hold a referendum on that subject. This question was not put forward by AUSA, and AUSA has not and will not express any opinion regarding the question. AUSA’s role in this is to facilitate a student forum on the referendum, run the voting process, and implement the results of the referendum.

**3: What is happening with AUSA’s legal advice on the Pro-Life question?**

AUSA has engaged a legal firm to provide advice on the question. As of yet, the advice has not come back. If AUSA receives advice that the question is not legitimate prior to the end of the referendum, then that question will be immediately removed. If that advice is not received before the end of the referendum, then the results of the referendum will be released, but will be considered as provisional results until the advice comes back. Depending on what the advice is, the results of the question will then either be implemented, or the question will become invalid and void.

**4: I have issues with a part of the referendum**

We would love to receive feedback from students on the entire process, including how questions are submitted, accepted, debated and voted on. AUSA will allow time for this to happen when the referendum finishes. We want all students to engage in the ongoing development of AUSA’s constitution, to ensure that changes that AUSA members make are ones that as many members as possible are happy with.
