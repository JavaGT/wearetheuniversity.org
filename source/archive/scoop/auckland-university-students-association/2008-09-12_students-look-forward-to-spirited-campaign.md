Auckland University students look forward to a spirited campaign

Students at New Zealand’s largest university are looking forward to a spirited election campaign of policies and promises, one of the most contested in recent times.

“While the election date falls during end of year exams, we will be working hard with other student associations nationwide and NZUSA to ensure as many students are enrolled to vote and are informed about the issues that matter to them,” says AUSA President David Do.

The election date announcement now clears the way for the rollout of policy announcements and election promises.

AUSA believes universal access to a living student allowance is absolutely essential to fund the future of this country - investing in New Zealand’s young people so they don’t graduate with so much debt.

“With a bipartisan consensus on no-interest on student loans, we look forward to a bipartisan commitment towards addressing the drivers of debt. We look forward to policy announcements from Labour and National that address the drivers of debt – the lack of access to student allowances, and continuously rising tuition fees."

“Students and their families call on both Labour and National to commit to a universal living allowance for all students,” concludes AUSA President David Do.
