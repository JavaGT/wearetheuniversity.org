AUSA stands in solidarity with Garissa University
=================================================

**Media Release**

**The Auckland University Student’s Association (AUSA) stands in solidarity with the students and staff of Garissa University.**

AUSA strongly condemns the action of the al-Shabaab gunmen who stormed into Kenya’s Garissa University’s halls of residence and murdered over 140 innocent students. It is AUSA’s belief that universities and institutions of higher educations are valuable and sacred places of learning. Central to this, universities should enable and encourage students to experience different ideas and cultures, allowing them to gain a better mutual understanding and help them become more tolerant. The actions of al-Shabaab directly go against this and therefore must not go unpunished.
