Auckland students welcome freedom for their Algerian Affairs Spokesperson

University of Auckland students warmly welcome Ahmed Zaoui’s newly-won freedom and look forward to hearing from their long-lost Algerian Affairs Spokesperson.

Ahmed Zaoui was appointed AUSA’s Honorary Algerian Affairs Spokesperson at a Special General Meeting on 7 October 2004, attended by hundreds of students.

“We are pleased that Mr Zaoui now has the ability to live a full life unencumbered by legal uncertainties, and that he may someday be reunited with his family,” says AUSA President and mother-to-be Lesieli Oliver.

Mr Zaoui has a real contribution to make in promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims in New Zealand. AUSA shares Mr Zaoui’s commitments to peace and social justice.

“Mr Zaoui’s messages of peace and hope can only become more pertinent as time goes on,” says AUSA Education Vice President David Do.

“His wisdom would be welcomed by many at the University of Auckland, a campus with over 5000 international students, and an increasing number from countries like Pakistan, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia.”

AUSA extends an open invitation for Mr Zaoui to come to campus and to AUSA for any seminars or lectures he might like to hold, should he wish to enlighten our students on Algerian Affairs, or indeed anything at all from his wide breadth of knowledge and experiences.
