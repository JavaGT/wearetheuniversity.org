Auckland students rally against Voluntary Membership Bill

Auckland students rally against Roy’s voluntary membership bill

Auckland University students are rallying today against the National governments’ continuing support of ACT MP Heather Roy’s private members bill on voluntary membership of students’ associations (VSM). An open student meeting and a high wire banner unveiling stunt are planned in the Student Union quad for 1.00pm today.

Membership of AUSA is currently voluntary, but students are urging the Prime Minister John key and National MPs not to support ACT’s destructive VSM bill.

Auckland University Students’ Association President Joe McCrory will be speaking at the rally today. “Auckland students voted for voluntary membership 12 years ago in 1999, when the current group of first year students was starting primary school” McCrory said.

“12 years of voluntary membership at Auckland University shows that students are missing out on the full complement of vital student services available at the smaller Victoria or Otago campuses. Now the choice to vote on which system they prefer is being removed by Heather Roy’s bill. A compromise would allow the students who wish to opt-out of membership of their association being able to, without the massive loss of representation that this bill represents,” McCrory said.

“Students at the rally today will hear, among other things, about the new Student Union renovations that students have decided to build with their membership fees at Victoria University, while facilities at Auckland are increasingly sub-standard ” McCrory said.

“The Prime Minister should consider what the real cost of ACT’s VSM agenda will be,” McCrory concluded.
