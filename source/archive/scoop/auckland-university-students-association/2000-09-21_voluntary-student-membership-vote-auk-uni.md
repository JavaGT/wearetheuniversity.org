Voluntary Student Membership Vote - Auk Uni
===========================================

**Press Release: [Auckland University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association)**

Auckland University Students to vote again on Voluntary or Compulsory Student Membership.

The Auckland University Students Association (AUSA) has collected the necessary number of signatures to request the Univesity Council to hold another referendum on the future status of AUSA.

Last year in May, as a result of governemnt legislation, students' associations around the country were forced to have a vote on whether the students in each institution which to have their students association remain compulsory or become voluntary.

The postal ballot referendum at Auckland will be open from October 1st thru November 1st. As a result of the change to the Education Act, student associations are no longer required to fund supporters of both sides equally when money from association levies are used.

This is, however, something that AUSA is committed to doing. "The AUSA executive believes that students will benefit most from an equally funded campaign, we feel that it is the executive's job to inform the students and not to push a one sided arguement as happen last year." said AUSA President Kane Stanford

"Obvioulsy AUSA executive members, including myself, have a preference for one side or the other but I feel uncomfortable using my position to influence the outcome of a vote of this magnitute."

" AUSA executive has decided to fund both sides equally this year and I think that students will be better informed as a result. The executive also has measures in place to curtail the misleading material that was published last year"

"All going well, we will have a good campaign and students will send a clear message to the executive about they want their students association to be funded"
