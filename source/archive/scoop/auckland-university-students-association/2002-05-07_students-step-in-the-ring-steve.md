Auckland University Students are furious over proposed government changes to the student loan scheme.

“While we think it is important that the government addresses the problem of escalating student loans, the proposed solutions are not what students had in mind,” said Auckland University Students Association Education Vice-President, Stephanie Thompson.

“We believe that the best way to reduce student debt is through greater access to allowances, reductions in tuition fees, as well as a scheme for writing off debt for graduates,” said Ms Thompson.

“We will look forward to debating these issues with the Minister when the plans finally become public,” concluded Ms Thompson.
