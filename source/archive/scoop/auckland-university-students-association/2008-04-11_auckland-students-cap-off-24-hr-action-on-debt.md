Auckland students cap off 24-hr action on debt

**Auckland students cap off 24-hr action on student debt**

Auckland University students have successfully completed their 24-hour debt ghetto to commiserate student debt hitting $10 billion yesterday.

Students lived in cardboard box structures in the Quad during the day and overnight, to visualise student poverty and the burden many students face through high living costs and borrowing to live.

“Students have shown through their significant time commitment that they are deeply concerned about the growing burden of student debt they have to face,” says AUSA President David Do.

“People got so worked up about one Eden Park or one waterfront stadium - $10 billion is the same as redeveloping Eden Park 42 times! We should be angry about the 42 Eden Parks we are loading onto our children and grandchildren,” he adds.

The Quad was transformed into a wonderfully creative ‘Box City’ of cardboard castles, forts, mounds, and structures. They sent a strong visual and powerful message to students and staff who attended the action. Contrary to popular belief, students were tidy and well-behaved, and cleaned up in the Quad in good time this morning.

AUSA is disappointed that the government ruling out a universal allowance for students.

“If the government is focusing on ‘economic transformation’ and ‘families young and old’, then that means properly supporting students by returning to a universal allowance for all students,” Do concludes.

\[Note: Photos will be available from the President later today\]
