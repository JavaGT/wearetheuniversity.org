MEDIA STATEMENT FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Auckland Students raise over $2300 in Tsunami Appeal

Auckland University Students Association

Over $1100 was raised by the Auckland University Students Association (AUSA) in a campus-based appeal for victims of the Boxing Day Tsunami. The money will be donated to the Oxfam Tsunami Relief Fund. The Association has pledged to match this amount, to bring the total raised to over $2300.

“This is a great achievement for Auckland Students, given that it’s only the start of the year and the numbers around Campus are relatively low”, said AUSA President Greg Langton. “We’re really proud of the generosity of our students, raising money for people who are far less fortunate than them”, he added.

David Do, AUSA’s co-Welfare Officer who co-ordinated the appeal, said that he was extremely pleased that it had been so successful. “Millions of people have had their lives devastated by this disaster, so we felt we should help them in whatever way we can. It’s particularly pertinent given that so many of our members come from the disaster stricken countries”

Mr Langton stated that the AUSA would be matching the amount raised by students on a dollar-for-dollar basis. “We feel that AUSA has a responsibility to match the generosity of its members, so we will be matching the amount raised” he said.
