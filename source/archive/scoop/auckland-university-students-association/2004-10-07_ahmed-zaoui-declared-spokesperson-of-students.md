Ahmed Zaoui Declared Spokesperson of Students

Today, in an historic vote, students’ voted for Ahmed Zaoui to be the Honorary Algerian Spokesperson of the Auckland University Students’ Association.

The meeting boasted a crowd of over 200 who heard the arguments and voted unanimously in favour of Zaoui.

“This vote shows that students are engaged with the world around them and that they will not stand for human rights abuses” AUSA President Kate Sutton said

Motion mover Eamonn Deverall said “Spokesman Zaoui’s present incarceration is only a temporary impediment to his regular attendance of AUSA meetings.”

“It is a shame that Mr Zaoui could not come to the meeting to speak to the motion but I will be contacting him to see what he has to say about Algerian Affairs on behalf of the students.” Sutton ended.

Chris Knox played to the students as a donation to the meeting of Zaoui supporters.
