TEAC Report Brings Hope Of Order In Chaos
=========================================

**Press Release: [Auckland University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Auckland_University_Students_Association)**

“We can all hope that the recommendations of the TEAC report will return sanity to Tertiary Education,” said Auckland University Students Association Education Vice- President, Stephanie Thompson, today.

“For over a decade institutions have been financially rewarded for going into direct competition with each other. This has ultimately been a waste of both taxpayer and student funds,” said Ms Thompson. “In a small country like New Zealand, that is economic suicide.”

“Clearly, the secret to success in a modern economy is through a rational and planned approach to the provision of Tertiary Education, for which this report lays down the foundations”

While the TEAC report sets out a pathway for sensible reforms these will all be in vain if the Government does address levels of funding in Tertiary Education.

“You cannot expect the Tertiary education sector to perform like a BMW when the funds only allow for a Mini,” concluded Ms Thompson.
