Association Wants Debt Collection Consistency

Press Release - For Immediate Use

The Governments decision not to pursue what could amount to millions of dollars in bad debts arising from inefficiencies in the student allowance scheme has been met with concern by student leaders.

The President of the Auckland University Students Association, Mr Ross Burns, this afternoon questioned the decision in the light of the ongoing debate over the lack of student access to the Emergency Unemployment Benefit.

"While the Government continually blames a lack of money for its ongoing refusal to allow the majority of students to access the Emergency Unemployment Benefit over the summer, they are willing to let the actions of a small minority of individuals cost the country millions of dollars without punishment" said Mr Burns.

The AUSA President went on to comment that, in failing to pursue this money, the Government was effectively allowing a situation where a small group have been able to able profit handsomely, while many students struggle through the summer months living hand to mouth.
