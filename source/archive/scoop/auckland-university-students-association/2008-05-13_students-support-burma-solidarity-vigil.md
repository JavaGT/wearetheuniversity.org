Students support Burma solidarity vigil

Auckland students will hold a candle light vigil tomorrow evening to commemorate the victims of Cyclone Nargis in Burma.

The Burma Support Group, an AUSA-affiliated club, will hold a candle light vigil to commemorate the dead, and to pray for the victims of the cyclone. The vigil will be between 6-7pm in the AUSA Quad at the University of Auckland. Speakers at the vigil include Burmese students, monks, activists, and AUSA representatives.

“We support the Burma Support Group’s efforts to support the Burmese people at this time. We are also increasingly appalled at the Burmese junta’s continued reluctance to admit international aid workers to help the Burmese people,” says AUSA President David Do.

“This continues the junta’s callous treatment of the Burmese people over many decades. The death toll rises with every day of delay,” concludes David Do.
