Media Statement for Immediate Release

Medical Students Fee Rises Upsets Auckland Students

Auckland students are deeply upset by the decision of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) to allow the University of Auckland to raise medical student fees by 10% for next year.

This rise represents an extra $1000 a year in fee costs for Medical students.

Students feel that the University is increasing their already healthy budget surpluses by increasing the financial burden on students,and that this will further add to spiralling student debt and offer further incentive for graduates to work overseas, according to AUSA Acting President Joseph Randall.

The Auckland University Students' Association is joining with the New Zealand Universities Students' Association (NZUSA) in investigating legal action over this decision.

"These substantial fee rises show that fee maxima is not working, especially when it opens the way for such unjustified exemptions.It is deplorable that legal action is the only option left to students in order to stop these increases", noted AUSA President-elect Greg Langton.
