Students Say No to Bullies On Pink Shirt Day

**Students Say No to Bullies On Pink Shirt Day**

Auckland University Students’ Association is celebrating Pink Shirt Day today to help stamp out bullying at the University of Auckland.

At 12.00pm today, 200 pink balloons with Pinkie Bars attached were released off the AUSA House balcony to raise the profile of bulling in New Zealand.

“As a Student Association we want to send a strong signal that bullying and harassment is something we do not tolerate. Last year AUSA drafted our own policy to deal with bullying, and our Advocacy team continues to support our students who have experienced harassment,” says Jessica Storey, AUSA Welfare Officer.

“Having a robust anti-bullying policy is important for minimising the risk bullying has on people’s lives.  Failing to deal with bullying endangers the safety of students as a hostile environment interferes with learning.

“Unfortunately, bullying is not confined to secondary schools and continues into tertiary education. It can be hard to know where to go to find the much needed support. Students should know that the University does have an effective anti-bullying policy in effect.

“AUSA Advocacy is the first place for students to turn to,” says Storey.

“I’m really happy to see that AUSA is taking a strong stance against bullying on campus,” says Jack McQuire, first year BCom/LLB student..
