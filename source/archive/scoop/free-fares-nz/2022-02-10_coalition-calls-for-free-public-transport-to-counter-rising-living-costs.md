Coalition Calls For Free Public Transport To Counter Rising Living Costs
========================================================================

A coalition of 60 organisations is renewing its calls for the Minister of Transport to fund free public transport nationwide for certain groups as a step to combat climate change and rising living costs.

“The high cost of living is leaving many people struggling. Free public transport for Community Service Card holders, tertiary students and under-25s would significantly reduce hardship,” said organiser Mika Hervel.

Phoebe Turner, Victoria University of Wellington student, 21: “Free public transport would save me that little extra for other things. Myself and so many other students need to pay for both the train and a bus. It would be helpful if at least the buses were free for the short 5 minute journey that most students take from the train.”

Community Service Card holder New Brighton, Christchurch: \"The buses are really important. For some people it's the only way they can get around. Everything costs more and some people can't afford to run a car or get petrol and they need to get to places as well."

Expensive fares stop people from choosing low carbon options. “In many regions it is cheaper to put your family in the car than pay for bus fares,” said Alicia Hall from Parents for Climate Aotearoa. “That is a barrier parents face.”

“Free fares will embed the habit of public transport use and enable all of us to get around affordably to where we live, work and play,” said Adam Currie from Generation Zero. “Free Fares schemes across the world have led to double and triple patronage rate on public transport use and driven to mode shift away from private cars. Here in Aotearoa, free fares for SuperGold cardholders (which the government has funded since 2008) has resulted in higher public transport use and less car use among people aged 65+. The government should fund free fares more widely to increase these benefits.”

The Free Fares campaign, run by the Aotearoa Collective for Public Transport Equity, launched in November 2021. In addition to 60 organisations, nine city and district councils have also come on board to advocate for this ask: Wellington, Kapiti Coast, Horizons, Christchurch, Dunedin, Hutt City, Porirua, Ruapehu and Palmerston North councils. The coalition is inviting members of the public to support their petition, which has attracted 7,000 signatures: our.actionstation.org.nz/p/freefares.
