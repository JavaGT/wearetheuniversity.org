AUT In Perfect Position To Freeze Student Fees

AUT In Perfect Position To Freeze Student Fees

Figures revealed in the recently released AUT Annual Report indicate AUT is a perfect position to accept the Government’s latest fee freeze offer, says AUT student association President Glen Oliver.

“The Auckland University of Technology made a surplus of nearly $7 million in the year 2000. Whilst AUT stands to lose a portion of budgeted income this year if they accept this offer, the reality is that students are at financial breaking point and cannot continue to support the burden of tertiary funding cuts and associated fee increases.”

In a recent study on the financial performance of tertiary education institutions, AUT was placed first out of all Universities when considering surplus as a percentage of income.

“With a 6.1% surplus in 2000, the simple fact is that AUT is performing very well financially. It is now time to take the emphasis off balance sheets and onto the needs of students”, said Oliver.

“AUT is also currently involved in a tendering process with a view to establishing a campus in Waitakere City. If successful, this venture is projected to cost in the region of $35 million dollars over the next ten years. The AUT Council obviously believe their current financial situation cannot possibly be bad.”

“This association is disappointed that the Government pledge to lower the cost of tertiary education has come in the form of another stop-gap measure designed to punish institutes that reject the offer.”

“We have serious concerns that some institutions in New Zealand may struggle to make ends meet if they accept this offer. However, AUT is one of the strongest financial performers in the sector. AUT is forecasting significant growth in student numbers, and will be able to freeze fees with no significant financial burden.”

“Students would be very surprised and disappointed if the AUT Council were to reject the Government offer”, concluded Mr Oliver.
