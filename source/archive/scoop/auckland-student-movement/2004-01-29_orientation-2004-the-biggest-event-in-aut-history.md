==================================================

PRESS RELEASE  
Orientation 2004 -the biggest event in AUT history  
28.01.04. For immediate release.

With a line-up reminiscent of Big Day Out, AuSM -Auckland Student Movement @ AUT presents Orientation 2004.

This year's festival boasts a huge line-up of local acts including Goodshirt, Scribe, Salmonella Dub and Goldenhorse but perhaps the biggest coup of them all is the inclusion of chart topping Californian rockers, Alien Ant Farm.

Alien Ant Farm have been fixtures in pop rock since releasing their first single, a cover of Michael Jackson’s ‘Smooth Criminal’. Debut album ‘Greatest Hits’ sold more than three million copies worldwide creating international superstars.

Hot on the heels of follow-up album, aptly named ‘TruANT’, the self confessed “goofers” will play at Auckland’s St James Theatre on March 5 as part of the national orientation schedule. Their New Zealand tour will also include dates in Dunedin, Wellington and Christchurch. The last time Alien Ant Farm played in the country was Big Day Out 2002.

Crowd favourites Salmonella Dub are back in 2004. Their performance at Orientation 2003 went down in history as the biggest on AUT campus, pulling in a crowd of over 2000. Punters will have to get in quick for the February 27 show. It is the bands only Auckland date during Orientation and is expected to sell out.

Goodshirt have a new album up their sleeves and are playing their new tracks on February 28 with Steriogram and Elemeno P in support. Steriogram, recently signed with Capitol Records, are also releasing a new album, their debut.

Scribe, the fastest selling artist in NZ music history and one of only five kiwi artists to tour Australia’s Big Day Out will perform on February 24 with Disruptiv (graffiti art) and breakers in support.

Orientation runs from February 23 until March 5. All events are brought to you by AuSM for little or no cost to AUT students and discounted for public.
