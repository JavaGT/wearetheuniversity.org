Salmonella Dub Play Orientation Gig.

Salmonella Dub, one of New Zealand’s best and most popular live acts, are headlining the Big Gig as part of the Orientation being put on by the Students’ Association @ AUT (AuSM).

Orientation is a great big knees-up bootyshaking shindig of fun and games that takes place over the two weeks from February 24th to March 7th at both the Wellesley and Akoranga AUT campuses. The festival is organised by AuSM, and features live music, DJs, competitions, markets and much more.

Salmonella Dub formed in the summer of 1992/1993 and have released four albums. Their most recent is ‘Inside the Dubplates’, which went to #1 in the New Zealand charts, and has been totally remixed and released as ‘Outside the Dub Plates’.

The group describe their sound as “a hybrid of skankin roots reggae, low rolling dub bass lines with drum n bass breaks in a distinctly Pacific style”. With support from Fat Freddy’s Drop and dDub, this is one show you don’t want to miss.

Tickets to the February 28th gig are available at greatly reduced prices for AUT students and low prices for other Tertiary students. Limited tickets are also available for public sale from Real Groovy and Ticketek. All other Orientation events are free for all, and a more detailed timetable can be found at www.ausm.org.nz/orientation.

Thanks AuSM, Export Gold and 95bFM.
