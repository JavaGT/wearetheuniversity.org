AuSM Holds Pre-Election Protests

AuSM, the Auckland University of Technology’s Student’s Association, in conjunction with NZUSA and AUSA, is set to launch a week of protest against student debt in the lead up to Saturday’s election.

AuSM and NZUSA will be holding a debt summit tomorrow at AUT, where the important issue of student debt will take centre stage in this crucial phase of the election. To open the summit 500 balloons will be released with the slogan “Student Debt, $5 billion and rising”.

“Student debt has reached $5 billion and is skyrocketing at a rate of about $11 per second,” says AuSM president David Victor. “The fact that the government sees student debt as an asset is sickening.”

As part of the universal student allowances campaign, AuSM will hold a mock wedding in the Auckland University Quad to draw attention to the current situation where married students are entitled to allowances, and are treated as dependant on their parents until they are 25. A student rally through Queen Street has also been organised for midday on Thursday.

In order to keep students informed, AuSM has included speakers from each political party in their second semester orientation, which will be running all week before the election.

According to Mr Victor, the week’s events are vital for instigating change and for the country’s future. “New Zealand needs graduates, and students need allowances. Do something about student debt, or else we’ll have to leave the country.”

Summary of Events:  
Debt Summit - 23 July 10am-5pm  
Mock Wedding – 24 July 12pm  
Balloon Release – 23 July 12pm  
Rally – 25 July 12pm
