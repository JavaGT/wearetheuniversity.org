Band bios follow;

THE COOLIES Wind the clock back a few years and you'll find them cutting class to listen to Bikini Kill, Patti Smith and X-Ray Spex . The sound is unequivocally their own, that of three girls from the southside fixing to run things, taking the long road cuz it's the only one they know. The Coolies is the culmination of seven years of frustration and false starts. Their self titled CD is out now on Ssuuxx Records

LADI 6, otherwise known as Karoline Tamati, has achieved a lot in the past six years. After only discovering music in her late teens, she has been a member of the now defunct three-girl hip-hop group, Sheelahroc, which was nominated for most promising New Act at the 2001 bNet NZ Music Awards, an award which her new band, Verse Two, won in 2003. LadiSix has also featured as guest vocalist/MC across a spectrum of NZ acts such as Shapeshifter, Scribe, Fat Freddy's Drop, Confucious, OG, Solaa and performed as a solo singer/songwriter act with an acoustic guitar supporting acts such as Anika Moa and Carly Binding.

THE WBC - create a unique sound that fuses ska, rock and reggae elements. They are an accomplished band whose standout live performances have made them crowd favourites on the live front. Established in 1999, THE WBC continue to be one of New Zealand's hardest working ska ensembles and have toured the country several times. The band have also supported international and local acts, Reel Big Fish, Bad Manners and The Black Seeds. Highlights so far include the release of the band's EP "Ease Ya Mind and "Pulp Sport". The comic sports programme which airs on Sky Sport & C4 uses the track "Ol ' Skool" as the title music.

STYLUS - are an Auckland based Rock Hip-Hop outfit. Their debut album 'PAINKILLERS' was released in 2003 on Wildside Records and is a refreshing mix of rock, funk and hip-hop. The album received rave reviews and the radio single 'Sick Of This' has been carving up airwaves throughout NZ in recent months.

THE MIDNIGHTS - While they have only been around for the a year or so Reggae outfit the Midnights have already clocked up an extensive touring record including Alpine Unity, Soundsplash, and shows with the Black Seeds and Katchafire. The Midnights are a band sure to continue gaining momentum and garnering a reputation as some of Aotearoa's finest purveyors of organic reggae rhythms.
