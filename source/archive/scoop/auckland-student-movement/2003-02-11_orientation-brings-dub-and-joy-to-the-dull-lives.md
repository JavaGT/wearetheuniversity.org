Orientation brings dub and joy to the dull lives of students

AuSM, the Students’ Association @ AUT is proud to announce the line up of music, fun and shenanigans that will be gracing Orientation Week(s) from February 24th to March 7th.

Hamilton based reggae band Katchafire will be playing in the Wellesley Street Quad from 12pm on Monday 24th of February. Their chilled out sounds will go nicely with the beach volleyball, mini golf and markets that will also be in the Quad all week.

On Tuesday 25th V presents Hip Hop Day, with P-Money, Ill Semantics, break dancing demonstrations and Graffiti by Disruptiv Ltd.

The Tui Challenge also begins on the 25th. Brave students form teams of four and compete in an assortment of quests from the spicy to the muddy to win over $1500 worth of prizes. One part of the competition is the Vesbar’s Quiz Night, starting at 7pm.

Deep house DJ Soane is playing from 12pm in the Wellesley St Quad on Wednesday the 26th, presented by Microsoft. There are also street performers, comedians Wills & Spencer and more malarkey as the Tui Challenge continues. That night, Vesbar will be shaking with laughter at comedians P-Funk Chainsaw, Wills & Spencer again and Morgan Williams.

Platinum 7 presents Stylus77 from Wellington on Thursday 27th, at 12pm in the Quad. They’ll be playing while representatives from political parties and more outdoor sports type things take place around them. In the evening, the Quad will be skanking to the sounds of Ska Night, with The Managers, The WBC and the Offbeat Selector, as students take part in the Beer Stein.
