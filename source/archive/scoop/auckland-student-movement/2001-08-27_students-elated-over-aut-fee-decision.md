Students Elated Over AUT Fee Decision

The Auckland University of Technology Council has accepted the Government’s latest fee freeze offer.

AUT Student President Glen Oliver says students at the University will be “elated” that fees will be frozen for a second successive year.

“The acceptance of this offer is welcome news after the recent stand-off between Universities and Government. It is fantastic that students will now be able to plan their short-term study with a sense of financial stability”, said Oliver.

“AUT’s governing Council has realised that while tertiary education funding is a political hot potato, the reality is that students are at financial breaking point and cannot continue to support the burden of tertiary funding cuts and associated fee increases.”

“However, New Zealand’s student loan debt is now in excess of $4 billion. As great as tonight’s decision may seem for AUT students, there is little doubt that unless the Government steps up investment in tertiary education, this debt will continue to skyrocket. We call on the Government to substantially improve its investment in the future of our country in the wake of the backlash over the current offer”, concluded Oliver.
