Maxim Institute Queries Government Back-Down on Class Sizes

**Maxim Institute Queries Government Back-Down on Class Sizes**

Maxim Institute is concerned about the Government’s back-down on class sizes announced this afternoon.

Maxim Institute Senior Researcher Steve Thomas says the Government must carefully examine its reasons for backing down.

“Is this back-down because new evidence shows it is best for our children, or is it because of public pressure?

“The Government’s job is to do what is in the best interest of New Zealand schools and students, not what is going to keep the Government popular in the polls.”

Research shows that class size is not as important asteacher quality for students' learning outcomes.

“It is disappointing to see the $60 million that was going to be set aside to improve teacher quality and professional leadership will now disappear,” says Thomas.

“The Government’s decision to focus on teacher quality and professional leadership was right and to back-down now is a mistake.”
