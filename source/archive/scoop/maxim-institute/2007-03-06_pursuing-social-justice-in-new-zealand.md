Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand

14 New Zealanders share their stories of communities helping people in ways government cannot

Social Justice - what is it really? How do we best help people? Does anyone actually care about social justice anyway? Isn't it something the government should take care of?

This powerful book, with essays from some of New Zealand's most respected minds, tackle these and other questions head on.

Published on 30 March 2007, Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand is a collection of essays and stories from a range of New Zealanders from all sides of the political and cultural spectrum. It is not often that you see Pita Sharples and Muriel Newman rubbing shoulders. These two outspoken politicians have both experienced, along with the 12 other contributors in Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand, that when it comes to providing social justice, communities are best.

Maori Party Co-Leader, Dr Pita Sharples, talks about his own experience helping at risk youth and what insights Maori offer into the concept of social justice. Former All Black Captain, Chancellor of the University of Auckland and current President of the New Zealand Rugby Union, John Graham, talks about sport and its importance in tempering ego and building togetherness.

There are very personal stories; Auckland-based Community Police officer, Nick Tuitasi, and Ruby Duncan, a former nurse who spent nine years living in a slum in Manila, reflect on how their community projects changed the lives of many people at risk.

Dr Myron Friesen's research essay into what New Zealander's consider social justice to be provides considerable insight; our understanding is as broad as the essays are in this book. The remaining eight contributors range from business to journalism and social services, providing stories that will move, intrigue and spark debate.

All the book's contributors agree however, that we cannot rely solely on government to provide social justice; that at its core, social justice is about people helping people. It is only through connecting people into communities that lives are really transformed.

Dr Pita Sharples John Graham CBE Nick Tuitasi QSM Ruby Duncan

Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand will be launched by His Excellency the Governor-General of New Zealand, The Honourable Anand Satyanand PCNZM, at the Maxim Institute Forum 2007 on Friday 30 March.

"I cannot recommend more highly this challenging collection of writings. Everyone who is interested in how we guide a future for this country . . . will appreciate the authors' insights and their call to 'make a difference'." Mary Grant, Creative Director/Co-Founder - Parents Inc.

"The spread of contributors provides an exciting opportunity to address the most pressing problem facing New Zealand: "welfare reform''. This book provides us with a worthy platform to have this national conversation." John Tamihere

"In the perplexing, confusing and at times contradictory social environment which is contemporary New Zealand . . . most, if not all of us . . . tend to look for simple, preferably one sentence solutions. These may be to blame governments, (of whatever hue), immigrants, legislative ineptitude, bureaucratic waste etc. Such criticisms allow us to divest responsibility away from ourselves. Whilst commendably, we are seeking to address issues of environmental pollution, perhaps we should extend this to social disintegration. There are no simple solutions, but this . . . volume provides some useful stepping stones." Judge M J A Brown CNZM
