Finding out what Kiwis think about social justice

MEDIA ADVISORY  
MAXIM INSTITUTE  
17 JULY 2006 - For immediate release

Two weeks left to find out what Kiwis think about ‘social justice’

Maxim Institute invites readers from around New Zealand to share their thoughts on ‘social justice’. The phrase is bandied around by politicians, lobbyists, academics and charities; but what do ordinary Kiwis think ‘social justice’ is?

Launched in May this year, the research project, Exploring Social Justice: A New Zealand Perspective, is trying to find out how New Zealanders view the concept of ‘social justice’ and what they think a socially just society looks like.

The online survey is being conducted by Dr Myron Friesen of the University of Canterbury. The project is being sponsored by Maxim Institute, an independent public policy think tank.

Dr Friesen and Maxim Institute invite readers to submit their views on ‘social justice’ by completing the online survey at: www.socialjustice.co.nz before 31 July 2006. All entries will go into the draw to win one of thirty music vouchers worth $30.

“Despite its popular use, the concept of social justice is loosely defined. Academics, politicians, journalists and the general public often use the term with contradictory implications. We want to know if any coherence can be found in the midst of this diversity”, says Dr Friesen.

Research sponsor, Maxim Institute, says the research project is an innovative attempt to try and capture the distinct New Zealand flavour of this hotly debated concept and is part of a larger goal of helping to promote informed debate on political and social issues affecting New Zealanders.
