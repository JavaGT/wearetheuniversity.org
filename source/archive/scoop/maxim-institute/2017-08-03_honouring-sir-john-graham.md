Honouring Sir John Graham
=========================

Honouring Sir John Graham

“We join many in New Zealand in remembering and honouring the life of Sir John Graham,” says Maxim Institute CEO, Alex Penk. “An exemplary New Zealander, Sir John leaves a rich legacy of service to others, through his friendship, mentoring, and sacrificial leadership in many different roles throughout his life.”

“Along with his well-known leadership roles as Captain of the All Blacks, Headmaster of Auckland Grammar, and Chancellor of the University of Auckland, Sir John inspired and led many other organisations, including Maxim Institute. As a Founding Trustee of Maxim, his deep love for New Zealand, his passion for education, and concern for those on the margins of life is at the heart of our work, and he was gracious enough to allow us to use his name for our annual Sir John Graham Lecture series. Even after stepping down from our Board, his continued support has been incredibly encouraging and humbling, both for our organisation, and to me personally,” says Alex Penk.

“Throughout his life, Sir John Graham has displayed the consistency of character and care for others we hope for in the best of our leaders,” says Alex. “He lived well, without desire for ac-claim, but with the conviction of working hard, serving others, and leading with integrity. We join with many in mourning his passing, and celebrating his life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Lady Shiela and the Graham family.”
