Free speech on the agenda - Maxim Forum 2004: Register now

Demands for any kind of control on free speech merit the closest scrutiny says Dr Frank Ellis, a visiting expert on political correctness. "Free speech is one of the most important weapons the citizenry have to defend themselves against dictators and tyrants, which is why they want to destroy it," says Dr Ellis who is speaking at Maxim's Forum on the topic of 'The journey from Communism's "Enemy of the People" to PC's "Hate Criminal".

The Forum will be held in both Christchurch on Saturday, March 20 and in Auckland on March 27. An outstanding line-up of local and international speakers will explore the influence of political correctness on New Zealanders. Register now to ensure you don't miss out on this inspirational and challenging day.

'Sexual orientation' resolution destroys free speech

'Sexual orientation' is on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights agenda at its 60th session in Geneva next week. The resolution proposes that 'sexual orientation', be added to the "equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family." It is fraught with problems and offers no definition of sexual orientation. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that sexual orientation is innate like race and sex.

What looks like an exercise in freedom is actually a direct attack on free speech. Those who disagree will be labeled and silenced. If this resolution passes it will clash with established rights of religious freedom and expression, as has happened in Sweden.

Individual nations will be expected to ensure their laws comply with the policy so as not to discriminate on the basis of 'sexual orientation'. In the absence of any definition a precedent is established to allow polygamy for bisexuals, or lowering the age of consent for paedophiles. In addition, if the resolution does become a new UN human right, then any suggestion that any of these 'sexual orientations' are wrong could be considered discrimination and become a punishable offence.

School boards create lasting legacy

The story of a parent who recently contacted Maxim illustrates the impact that boards of trustees can have on a school and community. This parent was on the board of a failing school in West Auckland at the time a principal retired and the board appointed the new principal.

The board spent time discussing the values and vision for the school and deciding what kind of school they wanted to establish. They were then able to appoint the right principal who supported their vision and could make it happen. As a result of the board direction, the primary school was totally transformed and the students achieved at a much higher level.

You too can leave a legacy like this for your children and community by standing for election. Nominations for boards of trustee's close on 19 March 2004, so act now. More information and nomination forms are available on our website: www.maxim.org.nz/ed/board\_trustees.html

Action Plan attack on family

The Action Plan For New Zealand Women released by the Ministry of Women's Affairs this week continues a Government attack on the traditional family. The importance of connectedness between men, women and children is cast aside and instead twisted to mean the reduction of 'inequalities and improved outcomes for women'.

Throughout the document is evidence of how determined the Ministry and the Government are to discriminate against motherhood and continue with spending millions to get mothers out to work. It is a manifesto for the end of the stay-at-home mother and the breadwinner father.

The state has no role in deciding when or whether a mother takes up work again after the birth of a child. This is a private decision made within a family. The Action Plan tries to engineer our most personal choices. How we balance work and life, what our financial aspirations are and even how we raise our children - all this under the guise of improved outcomes at the tax payers expense.

The single greatest problem that New Zealand faces is the progressive disintegration of the family. The Action Plan for women does nothing to help that. Fortunately, most New Zealanders do not believe that the Government can adequately replace men and raise children.

Constitution inquiry unnecessary

The Prime Minister Helen Clark plans a far-reaching inquiry into some of New Zealand's basic constitutional issues. It would include re-examining the role of the Treaty of Waitangi.

What is going on here? Does the Prime Minister want to move us towards a completely new constitution? Let us hope not. New Zealand does not need a new constitution. We are already benefactors of the oldest and most desirable constitution in the world - common law. In contrast to constitutions forged by the Russian and French revolutions, or the United States when it broke away from England, we have good reason to believe what we already have is superior - all three revolutions sought a freedom with a nucleus in common law.

If we were to write a constitution, where would we find its foundations? A constitution is born out of a shared vision to which everyone is committed. We already have a tradition of a rule of law which stands above the citizen and the state. First we need to come to terms with that before we do anything else.

THOUGHT FOR THE WEEK - Edmund Burke

When the leaders choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of popularity, their talents, in the construction of the state, will be of no service. They will become flatterers instead of legislators; the instruments, not the guides, of the people.
