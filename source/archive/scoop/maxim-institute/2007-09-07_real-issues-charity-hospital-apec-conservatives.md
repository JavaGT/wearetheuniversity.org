'I WILL COME FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SICK'

Last Friday the first operations were performed by the Canterbury Charity Hospital marking a significant milestone in this worthy venture. The hospital aims to provide free surgery for those that would otherwise be shut out of the state system and private health services. While charitable hospitals are by no means a new idea they have been all but forgotten in a world of state health care.

Universal health care was non-existent until the late 1930s saw the passing of the Social Security Act 1938. Prior to this health care was provided through a variety of means—private services for those that were able to afford it, friendly societies for those that were subscribing members, and charitable people and institutions for those that were unable to find help elsewhere. As early as the twelfth century religious orders such as the Knights Hospitaller were setting up charitable hospitals for needy pilgrims. Hospitals supported by philanthropy for the sick and destitute were common features of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

Why then, in this modern age of taxpayer-funded health care, has this historic idea been dragged out of the attic? The answer is frustration with the current system's inability to help those in need and in particular the cut-throat six-month waiting lists that fail to acknowledge that their need even exists. Two of the Canterbury Charity Hospital founders, Mr Philip Bagshaw and Dr Randall Allardyce, spent time on the Canterbury District Health Board trying to influence the services that were available, apparently without great success. The new hospital is the outworking of a desire to provide health care for those left behind by the existing system.

Potential patients of the hospital are required to be referred by a GP and to meet three criteria: 'an established surgical or clinical need,' 'an established exclusion from treatment in the Public Health System,' and 'insufficient personal financial means to access private treatment.' In most cases the 700 operations that the hospital is seeking to perform each year are for conditions that while not life-threatening are 'serious and debilitating.'

More than anything else the Canterbury Charity Hospital is a triumph of community. Each piece of equipment has been provided for by donations, and every surgical procedure by skilled volunteers seeking to help those in need. 'I will come for the benefit of the sick' sits at the heart of the Hippocratic Oath—it is a fitting tribute for those involved in this valuable venture.

STEPPING UP TRADE

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Sydney this week provides a great forum for the leaders of the 21 member countries involved to foster relationships and build on previous agreements. Discussions are expected to cover the usual range of topics, such as regional trade, and include climate change. Another hot topic will be their ongoing goal to see 'free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for industrialised economies and 2020 for developing economies.' Concluding a regional trade agreement (RTA) would be a big step for the APEC countries, but the more important goal of global free trade should not be neglected either.

APEC has mainly encouraged the creation of non-binding agreements between countries, facilitating free trade and discouraging protectionist tariffs and trade barriers. These voluntary agreements forge respect and relationship between the member countries, but do not require a deep commitment to inter-governmental cooperation. APEC members have maintained their individual identity, culture and sovereignty by only cooperating in areas of mutual advantage to each other. This is the opposite of rigid alliances such as the European Union, where deep economic and political integration have weakened the individual identity, culture and sovereignty of its members.

Concluding a RTA by 2010 would force trade to be fully liberalised among the APEC countries, and would give the APEC secretariat more clout, but freer trade would be good for the Asia-Pacific region. It stands to create better returns from trade; bringing down the costs of production and purchase on goods for everyone. This is especially important for an exporting country like New Zealand, where fair access to foreign markets is essential for its prosperity. Unfortunately, though, concluding an RTA by 2010 might be difficult as more political will is required. Nevertheless, RTAs are a worthwhile goal to pursue because they can be a stepping stone to global free trade. And this is what matters, since global free trade has even more potential to boost economies and enhance the prosperity of the poorest countries. RTAs, like the one APEC leaders are negotiating, are a stop on the way to this destination, but not the end of the journey itself.

ENDURING PRINCIPLE

Former British Conservative deputy leader Michael Ancram has released what some call his 'alternative manifesto,' warning that a modernising British Conservative Party should not become 'values free,' or 'a theatre workshop for the purely pragmatic,' for risk of it wilting. Lashing modern politics as controlled by 'cynical sound-bites' and 'vacuous slogans,' Mr Ancram seeks to identify the 'ageless values' and 'enduring beliefs and principles' of conservatism. He suggests applying these to the 'kaleidoscope of conflicting and contradictory human activity,' essentially to ensure that there is a steady foundation for the party in a changing world. In doing so, he teaches us an important lesson about politics, political ideas and vision.

Titled I am still a Conservative, Mr Ancram's treatise identifies a set of ideas which make up 'the Conservative soul.' They include: 'freedom,' 'the promotion of aspiration and merit,' fighting poverty based on long-term strategies geared towards self-sufficiency, reducing bureaucracy, 'the small State,' the 'community' and being 'the good neighbour.' He identifies placing importance on institutions such as the family, the Crown and Parliament and care of the environment as pivotal to a conservative approach.

The 'manifesto' is short on concrete policy, but does recommend a number of discrete measures as the logical consequences of conservative principles: reducing taxes, abolishing burdensome regulations, and the unapologetic fostering of marriage and patriotism. Mr Ancram's plan for the Conservatives, shorn of passionate partisan rhetoric (and even if you disagree with it) is courageous. It reminds us that in the end, political debate is about ideas and values, even presently unfashionable ones, not just about presentation and spin. Fundamentally, political parties are driven by ideas and by a vision of the country they want; the application of principle to real life. In setting out what he believes, going into bat for it, and being proud of it, Mr Ancram has set us all an example. Picking a government, in Britain or in New Zealand, is about more than image; it is about ideas, and a passionate national dialogue.

IN THE NEWS

RESTRICTIONS ON YOUTH RATES MAY ENDANGER JOB PROSPECTS

The passing of the Minimum Wage (New Entrants) Amendment Bill, put forward by Green Party MP Sue Bradford, will make it more costly to employ younger workers. From 1 April 2008 sixteen and seventeen year olds 'who have completed 3 months or 200 hours of employment, whichever is the shorter' or are in a 'supervising or training' role will have to be paid the adult minimum wage, instead of the youth one. While it is difficult to estimate the total fallout of this bill, it may have a negative impact on the willingness of employers to hire younger workers; if you have to pay for an adult, why not hire an adult? Being able to pay young people at the youth rate for the first three months of their employment is unlikely to provide enough of a financial benefit to offset the younger workers' lack of maturity and experience.

SAVING MONEY ON PRISONS

A new report has been released this week reviewing the costs involved in building two New Zealand prisons. The review compares the New Zealand prisons with similar projects in Australia, to determine whether savings could be made on future projects. The two prisons have been built to house offenders with various security levels. Although this provides flexibility, it also increases the cost of such projects. The report also recommends that New Zealand reconsider private sector involvement with regard to prisons, suggesting their involvement could bring efficiency benefits.

TALKING POINT

'Trade is the natural enemy of all violent passions. Trade loves moderation, delights in compromise, and is most careful to avoid anger .... Trade makes men independent of one another and gives them a high idea of their personal importance: it leads them to want to manage their own affairs and teaches them to succeed therein. Hence it makes them inclined to liberty but disinclined to revolution.'
