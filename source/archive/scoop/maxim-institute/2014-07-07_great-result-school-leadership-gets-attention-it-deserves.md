Great Result: School Leadership Gets the Attention It Deserves  

Despite their ideological differences, the major similarity between Labour's and National’s education policies is investment into New Zealand’s school leaders – which is a promising development for anyone who cares about the education of our kids.

Labour is providing funding for a College of Leadership that will raise standards for new principals. In advance of the Labour Party education announcement this weekend, Labour education spokesman Chris Hipkins said, \"You need to be more than just a good teacher to become a school principal. You have to \[have\] leadership characteristics."

A major plank of National’s Investing in Educational Success initiative is designed to upskill and spread expertise across schools by recognising existing quality leaders and enabling them to support other schools in their area.

Maxim Institute researcher Dr. Luke Fenwick welcomes this focus on school leadership from both parties. “Quality leadership is an incredibly powerful tool for improving the education system. That’s why leadership development and leadership sustainability is so important. The fact that both parties have recognised this is really encouraging. I’m hopeful that no matter which party gets the chance to implement their policy, school leadership will get the attention and support it deserves."
