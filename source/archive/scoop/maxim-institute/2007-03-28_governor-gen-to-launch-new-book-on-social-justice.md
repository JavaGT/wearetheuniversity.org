Governor-General to Launch New Book from Maxim Institute on Social Justice

His Excellency the Governor-General of New Zealand, The Honourable Anand Satyanand PCNZM, will officially launch a new book, Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand: 14 New Zealanders share their stories of communities helping people in ways government cannot, at the Maxim Institute Forum 2007 on Friday 30 March at the Auckland Town Hall, THE EDGE®.

The editor of the book, Ruth Porter, says, “The contributors to this book each tackle social justice from a different angle, but a common thread runs throughout: connecting people into community and seeking to meet their needs in a relational way is the best way to transform lives.”

“Between them, the book’s contributors examine social justice in a variety of contexts, including sport, community, family, government policy, immigration, business, church and the environment. They share their ideas and their personal stories, challenging and inspiring readers along the way,” says Ruth Porter.

Contributors include:

John Graham CBE - Former All Black Captain and current President of the New Zealand Rugby Union  
Dr Pita Sharples - Co-leader of the Maori Party  
Jim Hopkins - Journalist and author  
Cardinal Thomas Williams - Archbishop Emeritus of the New Zealand Catholic Church  
Peter Menzies - Businessman and philanthropist  
Nick Tuitasi QSM - Auckland-based Community Police Officer  
Dr Muriel Newman - Former MP and founder of the New Zealand Centre for Political Debate  
Lyn Campbell QSM - Families Commissioner  
Kim Workman - National Director of Prison Fellowship New Zealand  
Ruby Duncan - CEO of family support organisation, Iosis (Baptist Action)  
David Round - Environmental law lecturer, University of Canterbury and more

“It is encouraging to see people of such stature, experience and wisdom enthusiastic about social justice,” says Ruth Porter.

“Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand lays out a stirring challenge to all Kiwis: the relational fabric of family and community life must be strengthened—even reinvigorated—if social justice is to flourish in New Zealand. We should not abdicate our responsibility for those in our communities to government; rather, we should seek to connect with them ourselves,” says Ruth Porter.

“The refreshing thing about this book is that it empowers. The authors share story after story of people making a real difference in other people’s lives. They show what is possible when we take the initiative and simply give things a go. Getting alongside people is difficult at times, but it is by far the best way of helping them,” Ruth Porter says.

Endorsements

“I cannot recommend more highly this challenging collection of writings. Everyone who is interested in how we guide a future for this country and its communities will appreciate the authors’ insights and their call to ‘make a difference’.” Mary Grant, Parents Inc

“Whilst commendably, we are seeking to address issues of environmental pollution, perhaps we should extend this to social disintegration. There are no simple solutions, but this slim volume provides some useful stepping stones.” Judge M J A Brown CNZM

“The spread of contributors provides an exciting opportunity to address the most pressing problem facing New Zealand: ‘welfare reform’. This book provides us with a worthy platform to have this national conversation.” John Tamihere

Pursuing Social Justice in New Zealand is edited by Ruth Porter, published by Maxim Institute, and distributed by Addenda. It is available in selected bookstores nationwide. RRP $29.99.
