Fastest 'Same-Sex Marriage' Law In The World

Media release

Fastest 'same-sex marriage' law in the world

The government's move to rush the Civil Union Bill through before Christmas is an outrageous abuse of Parliament process.

The second reading of the Civil Union Bill is set for December 02, with the remaining stages to be passed under urgency in the following week. This would create the fastest 'same-sex marriage' law in the world.

More than 6,000 submissions were received by the Select Committee reviewing the Bill, and at least 90 percent of those opposed the Bills.

The committee was not due to report back to parliament until 23 December, and last week chairman Tim Barnett said there was no request to report earlier. This appears to be a calculated deception.

In the event, it is probable that MPs will receive the Select Committee's report less than 24 hours before the debate. And the report will show the committee is split on its recommendations.

Many MPs have not had time to properly consider what's at stake in the Civil Union Bill or the views of the public. In fact, MPs on the Select Committee may have only read submissions from people who wanted to appear before the committee.

The opinions and research of thousands of people who took a great deal of time and effort to write to the committee, but for various reasons were unable to make a personal appearance, may lie unread and ignored.

If this Bill is passed, along with its companion Relationships Bill, it will make all relationships legally equivalent to marriage, whether registered or not. In that sense, the Civil Union Bill is completely unnecessary.
