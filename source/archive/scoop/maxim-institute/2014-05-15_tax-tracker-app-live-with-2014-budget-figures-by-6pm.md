Tax Tracker App - Live with 2014 Budget Figures By 6PM

  
Did you know that your tax pays more towards subsidising tertiary education than for the Police and foreign aid combined?

Today the Government announces the new Budget, giving us spending figures in the millions and even billions – and unless you’re an economist or a policy aficionado, it’s hard to grasp what’s really going on.

We’re here to help. At 6pm we launch our **free Tax Tracker web app** at yourtaxtracker.co.nz with today’s new Budget info – feel free to check out the current version now, and we’ll let you know the moment we go live with the update.

The plan? An easy to use, mobile compatible tool giving New Zealanders a much-needed sense of scale in one click.

Simply enter a salary figure, hit ‘GO,’ and find out how much income tax you will pay this year, and how the Government plans to use it with an **instant, individualised “tax receipt”** based on today’s hot-off-the-press numbers.

What’s new? We’ve added a feature to this year’s Tax Tracker where you can toggle to **compare how Government spending has changed** on your tax receipt between the 2013 Budget and today’s new figures.

Check out yourtaxtracker.co.nz now and find out where your money is going.
