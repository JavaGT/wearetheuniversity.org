MEDIA RELEASE  
6 November 2006

Maxim Institute launches new website

Maxim Institute is pleased to announce the launch of its new website www.maxim.org.nz.

Communications Manager, Amanda McGrail, highlights that the website is just one part of a new look for the Institute, which is fast approaching its fifth birthday.

“As we move forward with clear vision and a fresh approach, it is fitting that our website reflects this momentum,” says McGrail.

“We will continue to add new and up-to-date research and policy analysis on a range of issues including legal paternity, the electoral system, the value of fatherhood and much more.”

“The website also features a dedicated section on how to engage in democracy. Packed with helpful information, Take Action is a fantastic resource for the public, students, policy-makers and ordinary New Zealanders keen to make a difference,” says Amanda McGrail.

“Maxim Institute is increasingly gaining attention overseas and we believe that this website breaks new ground among think tanks internationally,” says McGrail.

Maxim Institute is an independent research and public policy think tank based in Auckland.  
www.maxim.org.nz was designed by in-house graphic designer, Saskia Batelaan, and was developed by Acclipse Ltd.
