New Research Shows Charter Schools Have Potential

New research produced by Maxim Institute shows that charter schools have potential to increase learning outcomes for some disadvantagedstudents, given certain conditions.

Senior Researcher Steve Thomas carried out a survey of high quality studies on the effects of charter schools on four groups of disadvantaged pupils.

Thomas says there were certain conditions that seemed to increase the likelihood that a charter school would positively affect student learning.

“Having a robust accountability system, and a strong mission statement seemed to make a significant difference to whether or not a charter school helped students learn better.

“New Zealand needs to pay attention to these factors to give Partnership Schools, our version of charter schools, the best possible chance of success.

“In doing so, we may be offering disadvantaged students the best chance of success, too.”

Thomas’ research showed a variety of learning outcomes for disadvantaged students.

Low-income students showed a small to medium improvement compared to their public school peers, however special needs students were generally worse-off at Charter Schools.
