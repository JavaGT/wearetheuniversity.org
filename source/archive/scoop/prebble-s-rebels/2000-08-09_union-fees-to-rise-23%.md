Union fees to rise 23%
======================

**Wednesday, 9 August 2000, 9:25 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Students at Otago University have expressed concern at the announcement made that fees to join Otago University Students Association (OUSA) are to rise by 23% next year.

The rise of $15 was condemned by Otago President of Prebble's Rebels, Sean Dougherty, who described the hike as an outrage.

Mr Dougherty said \"this fee hike is even more unconscionable given that membership of OUSA is compulsory. Students have no choice but to dip into their pockets and find even more money to pay for junkets, bureaucracy and fringe political groups."

"OUSA demands reductions in university fees but exposes it's hypocrisy by hiking their own levies. Does OUSA think students have plenty of money for political extremism?"
