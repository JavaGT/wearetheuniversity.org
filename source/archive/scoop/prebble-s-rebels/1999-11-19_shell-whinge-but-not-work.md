She'll Whinge But Not Work
==========================

**Friday, 19 November 1999, 10:55 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Marian Hobbs has done nothing for Wellington Central, and would be the nameless, faceless MP that Wellington neither wants nor needs, according to Victoria Rebel President, Nick Archer.

"Marian is such an ineffective Member of Parliament that even the Labour spin doctors do not know how to spell her name" Mr Archer said, referring to her latest release, the first time Marian has been quoted on Wellington issues.

"The fact is, that Richard Prebble was the only MP to ask the health professionals and the people of Wellington what they thought about their hospital being relocated to Porirua."

"Ms Hobbs says 'Mr Prebble is now demanding 'urgent answers'', while she has been totally silent on Wellington issues, and has demanded nothing at all."

"By working with constituents and other Members of Parliament in the Wellington region, Richard Prebble has shown his concern for local issues, while Ms Hobbs, through her silence, has shown nothing but contempt."

"Ms Hobbs criticises Mr Prebble, but has not done anything herself to try and prevent the closure of the child cancer service, despite being Labour's 'Commissar-in-charge-of-Wellington-Central' for over a year."

"This is the first time Marian has paid attention to anything health-related in the electorate, and now her spin doctors have put out a release, we realise it's because she does not have anything constructive to say."

Mr Archer said "if Ms Hobbs was serious about wanting to represent Wellington Central she would get off her butt and get involved with the local issues. The Rebels look forward to Marian taking action - any action - on the issues that concern the Wellingtonians she has ignored throughout her campaign."
