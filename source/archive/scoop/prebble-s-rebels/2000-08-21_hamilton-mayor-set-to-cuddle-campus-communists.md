Hamilton Mayor Set to Cuddle Campus Communists
==============================================

**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Hamilton residents should prepare to be embarrassed again by mayor Russ Rimmington with the news that a group of ageing communists are planning a new round of activism at Waikato University, Prebble's Rebels president Clint Heine said today.

In March this year, a group led by communists occupied buildings at Waikato University. "Thinking he was at Berkley in the '60s, Russ Rimmington rushed in to support the group and congratulated them on their occupation. In the process Mr Rimmington made a mockery of the rule of law and embarrassed the good people of Hamilton," Mr Heine said.

"Mr Rimmington is obviously upset that he missed the summer of love in '68, and seems to think there are more votes in cuddling communists than kissing babies," Mr Heine said.

"The mayor obviously has no idea who he was endorsing when he fawned over the March occupation. The group organising the occupations are a bunch of tired communists from Auckland. If Mr Rimmington wants to support the communist revolution he should give up local body politics, grow a beard, borrow a Che Guevera t-shirt and move into a squat," Mr Heine said.

"I'm sure Hamilton ratepayers would prefer that the mayor concentrated on sorting out local problems, such as the Tainui Novotel situation," Clint Heine said.

Anyone interested in the revolutionary credentials of the leader of this motley communist group should call him on his mobile, which is hosted by that great capitalist company Telecom. "Either that or visit his site on the capitalist-created Internet," Mr Heine said.
