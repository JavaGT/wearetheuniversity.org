Liberals Urged to Stand Strong against Wowsers
==============================================

**Friday, 30 July 1999, 6:22 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

  
30 July 1999

For immediate release

Prebble’s Rebels today congratulated politicians voting for common sense liquor licensing laws, claiming that it is a positive step towards encouraging sensible drinking behaviour in our youth.

“MPs voting in favour of liberalising our liquor licensing laws have shown leadership on an issue dominated by people with good-intentions that are out of touch with today’s youth” said Victoria Rebel President Angela Beazer.

“While we’re happy with the result of this week’s votes we are concerned by the intense lobbying effort by interests opposed to liberalisation, launched just hours after the votes took place.”

“We urge all MPs to stand fast against the wowsers – they may be noisy but the Nanny State do-gooders are out of touch with today’s youth. The majority of today’s youth are liberal and responsible; if they are treated like adults, they’ll act like adults. Our politicians would do well to remember that our youth may not be vocal, but they are voters.”

“Today’s youth are looking for leadership, not dictatorship. We don’t need, and we certainly don’t want, politicians controlling every aspect of our personal lives. It’s time for Parliament to cut Nanny State’s apron strings tying down our teens.”
