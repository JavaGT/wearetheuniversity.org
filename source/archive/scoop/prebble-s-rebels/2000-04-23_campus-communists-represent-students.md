Campus Communists Represent Students?
=====================================

**Sunday, 23 April 2000, 10:55 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

The occupation of part of Waikato University has come under fire from a student group who say it is "an illegitimate protest of opportunity".

Clint Heine, President of Prebble's Rebels, said "this occupation is no more than a way of finding cheap accomodation for hardcore Fightback supporters. Far from being an expression of student anger, this is a protest of opportunity."

"The claim that any campus is 'represented' at the protest is complete garbage. The only students that the loony left represent are themselves. The vast majority of students recognise that we get a lot of benefit from a tertiary education and that it's only fair we pay some of the cost of that education."

"Miriam Bellard claims that universities rightfully belong to students. Why does Ms Bellard deserve to own our tertiary institutions? Universities belong to the people of New Zealand - to the taxpayers who fund them" Mr Heine said.
