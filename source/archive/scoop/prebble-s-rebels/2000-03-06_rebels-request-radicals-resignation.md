Rebels Request Radical's Resignation
====================================

**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

There are calls for a prominent Wellington student radical to resign, following public criticism of an editorial published in the Victoria University student newspaper, Salient.

Victoria Rebel President, Nick Archer, said that Salient's editor, Nikki Burrows, should resign after publishing an editorial which describes associate Professor Paul Dunmore as 'bigoted' and 'ill-educated', together with demands for disciplinary action to be taken against him.

Canterbury University Professor, Dennis Dutton, likened Ms Burrows' call for discipline to the methods of Pol Pot, Mao Tse Tung, Stalin and Hitler on the front page of Saturday's Evening Post.

Mr Archer said \"Ms Burrows has shown her unprofessionalism and incompetance. She may have exposed Salient and the Students Association to legal action from Professor Dunmore, and has cast a shadow over the newspaper."

"All Victoria students subsidise Salient through their compulsory union fees, and we need to ensure that the newspaper remains accountable to the students as a whole, rather than to a radical handful who would use it to push extreme views. Ms Burrows' article reflects poorly on VUWSA and all university students."

Mr Archer, who is also a member of the Victoria University of Wellington Students Association executive, said that he would raise the matter at the next VUWSA meeting.
