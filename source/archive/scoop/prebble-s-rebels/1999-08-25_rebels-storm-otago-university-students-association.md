Rebels Storm Otago University Students Association
==================================================

**Wednesday, 25 August 1999, 11:51 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Prebble's Rebels are delighted with the result of recent Otago University Students Association executive elections.

Rebels Graham Farmer and Rachael Irwin were successful in securing places as a General Executive Member and Womens Rights Officer respectively.

"This is an excellent result for the Rebels, and for all Otago University students" said Otago Rebel President Clint Heine.

"Students at Otago are clearly dissatisfied with the way their Students Association has been run over recent years and recognise that fresh new ideas are desperately needed."

Mr Heine said "we hope that the rest of the executive will listen to the students who elected them and recognise that it is time for a change in the way Students Associations serve their members."
