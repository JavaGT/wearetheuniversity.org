50,000 Indictments On Labour Policy - Rebels
============================================

**Thursday, 24 February 2000, 3:28 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

A student leader has supported ACT MP Muriel Newman's attack on the interest free student loans policy, saying that the number of new student loan applications are "50,000 indictments on Labour policy".

Clint Heine, President of Prebble's Rebels, said that figures released by Dr Newman today showed almost 50% more students would take out student loans under Labour. Mr Heine said that the impact of this upon student debt levels would be crippling.

Clint Heine said "Labour criticised the National government for leading students into poverty, and then introduced policies which are creating another 50,000 student debtors."

"Helen Clark's credit card commitment to students was 'a fairer loans scheme'. Just how is it fairer when 50% more students are trapped in debt?" Mr Heine asked.

"The craziest part of Labour's policy is that all students have access to an interest-free loan, whether they need it or not. Are Helen Clark and Steve Maharey trying to say that giving universal, unsecured, interest-free loans is fair to either students or to the taxpayers who have to foot the bill?"

Mr Heine said "Prebble's Rebels invite student unions, who constantly complained at the number of students taking out loans under National, to join us in protesting against Labour's policy of enticing more students into debt."
