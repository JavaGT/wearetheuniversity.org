Rebels delighted with election results
======================================

**Friday, 17 September 1999, 1:45 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Prebble's Rebels New Zealand President Clint Heine is delighted with the results of the Victoria University Students Association (VUWSA) student elections.

"Once again, students have spoken out loud, and what they want is a moderating voice on their student body" commented Mr. Heine.  
The moderating voice is the Victoria Prebble's Rebels President Nick Archer, who was elected onto the executive with a sound number of votes.

This result is one of many successful student election campaigns for the Rebels. "Nick Archer joins students from Auckland down to Otago who all share the philosophy of commonsense and a commitment to representing all students without prejudice" remarked Clint.

Also elected was Nicks running partner Phil Rennie the chair of the Young Nationals at Victoria University. "More evidence that student politics is headed in the right direction."

"I wish Nick and Phil the best of luck"
