Back-Room Bunkle - Rebels
=========================

**Wednesday, 3 November 1999, 11:11 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Rebels at Victoria University of Wellington labelled Phillida Bunkle's decision to withdraw from the Wellington Central election race as "cowardly".

"Ms Bunkle has paraded around the electorate crowing that she would not do a backroom deal with Labour, and then sells out at the last minute" Victoria Rebel President Nick Archer said.

"The fact is, that Labour will need all the support it can get in Wellington Central, and that even the withdrawl of back-room Bunkle does not give the Labour Candidate, Marian Hobbs, a majority of support.

"After criticising National for withdrawing Annabel Young, Marian Hobbs will no doubt be dancing in the aisles knowing that Phillida Bunkle has withdrawn. Helen Clark has already congratulated the Alliance for backstabbing their own supporters and withdrawing" Mr Archer said.

Mr Archer also said that Ms Bunkle had been stringing electors along, refusing to say whether or not she would withdraw from Wellington Central.

The Rebels noted that Phillida's campaign for the electorate vote had really ended before it began, as she had only asked people to elect her through the Alliance list.

"Obviously the decision to withdraw Phillida was made a long time ago and Ms Bunkle just didn't have the heart to tell her supporters that while they decried National for withdrawing their candidate she was preparing to do the same."
