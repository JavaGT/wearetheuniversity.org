OUSA Campaigns For Higher Fees
==============================

**Tuesday, 26 September 2000, 10:40 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Otago University Students Association (OUSA) has made a major policy u-turn, and now advocates increasing the cost of tertiary education, according to the Otago president of Prebble's Rebels, Sean Dougherty.

Mr Dougherty was referring to OUSA president Andrew Campbell's suggestion that health service levies should be raised and excepted from the Government's tertiary fee freeze.

\"How does the idea of free tertiary education fit with OUSA's 23% fee increase for next year, or Mr Campbell's media statement suggesting all students should pay higher levies for the university health service?"

Mr Dougherty said "I thought that most university students associations were advocating completely free education - presumably that includes no students association fee or health levies. I wouldn't be the only student shocked to find that OUSA is in fact campaigning for higher fees!"

Mr Dougherty also asked whether the Education Action Group at Otago will be protesting against OUSA's u-turn, and said that as this move destroyed student confidence in OUSA, the Otago Rebels would probably join a protest asking for Mr Campbell's resignation.
