Students Lose Right To Choose
=============================

**Sunday, 5 March 2000, 11:01 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

The Government is set to reverse moves towards voluntary union membership for students, after Trevor Mallard's confirmation that Cabinet has agreed to repeal the 1998 Education (Tertiary Students' Assocation Voluntary Membership) Amendment Act.

The legislation marked for repeal allows students to choose voluntary union membership through a referendum. Clint Heine, President of Prebble's Rebels, said that the government's move was a step backwards and shows contempt for the freedom of association.

Mr Heine said that the move is designed to pacify student unions, who felt under threat from their members demanding the right to choose whether or not to join the large, expensive and often unrepresentative organisations.

\"Professional student protestors have not been amused at how little Labour has offered students. The Alliance programme of free education has been all but abandoned, and this is a token to ensure continuing support from the radicals who run most of the unions."

"This is a small-minded, ideological move, designed to grease a squeaky interest group and secure power for a handful of left-wing extremists" Mr Heine said.

The Rebels believe that all students should have the right to choose whether to join a union or not.
