Clint Heine, President of Prebble's Rebels, said that the web site would play a major part in the Rebels' strategy this year.

"The Internet allows us to keep in touch with our Rebels across the country. We can co-ordinate our ACTivism and share ideas with all our branches instantly."

Mr Heine said that recent feedback from students in the United States reinforced what a powerful tool the internet is in disseminating information.

"The Internet gives individuals the power to create their own media, to evaluate conflicting opinions and to find the truth for themselves. The success of the Internet is a prime example of why we should encourage free contact between people."
