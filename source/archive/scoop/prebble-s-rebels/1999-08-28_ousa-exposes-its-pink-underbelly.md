OUSA Exposes Its Pink Underbelly
================================

**Saturday, 28 August 1999, 5:33 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Prebble's Rebels today criticised the Otago University Students Association for not checking their own facts before attacking research by the Young Nationals.

"NZUSA Vice-President Karen Skinner has admitted that under changes initiated by the National-led government average repayment times for women will be reduced to 29 years" said Prebble's Rebels Otago President Clint Heine.

"OUSA's criticism of the National Party's figures should have been saved until their own findings had been checked. OUSA has exposed the pink underbelly of its own research" said Mr Heine.

Prebble's Rebels accepts that Student Loans have made university study more accessible and that increases in student numbers over recent years are evidence of this fact.

Clint Heine said "OUSA obviously has no idea what statements the NZUSA spends so much student money making. This is a classic example of the far-left hand not knowing what the further-left hand is doing."

"This lack of communication between organisations which take thousands of dollars of student money and purport to represent them is alarming. Not only are our Students Associations out of touch with a vast majority of their members they are out of touch with each other" Mr Heine said.
