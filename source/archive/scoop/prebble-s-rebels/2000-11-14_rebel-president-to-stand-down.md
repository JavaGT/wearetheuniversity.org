Rebel President to Stand Down
=============================

**Tuesday, 14 November 2000, 11:00 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

The President of Prebble's Rebels, Clint Heine, has decided to call it quits after being in the position for over two years and a member of the ACT party since 1995.

Prebble's Rebels was formed at Victoria University of Wellington in 1996, and Mr Heine, a student at Otago University, took over as national president in 1998. The Rebels have become a famous, and somewhat infamous, organisation, that now has branches at almost every university campus. Officially, the ACT party has never recognised the Rebels as its youth wing, and in fact censured Rebel members during the 1996 election for over-enthusiastic campaign tactics.

Mr Heine said \"I've chosen this time to stand aside as president so that the Rebels can train a new fresh team of ACTivists before the next election campaign begins. Standing aside is not an easy decision, but one I feel was necessary as the Rebels continue to grow in size and strength, leading the fightback among young New Zealanders."

Mr Heine also announced that he resigned from the ACT party several weeks ago.

"My resignation from the ACT party is another matter, I feel that the party needs to foster relations with youth far better than they have. While I have a strong affinity with the ACT party and its principles, I feel that the policy direction seems to have lost its way recently" said Mr Heine.

Mr Heine will be replaced by the Vice President, Gavin Middleton, until the Rebels hold their AGM in March.

Mr Middleton said Clint's resignation was a huge loss to the Rebels, but that they would continue to campaign for individual freedom, fairness, choice and personal responsibility.
