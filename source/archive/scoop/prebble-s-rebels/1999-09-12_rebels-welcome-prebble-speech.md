Rebels Welcome Prebble Speech
=============================

**Sunday, 12 September 1999, 11:14 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Prebble's Rebels New Zealand President, Clint Heine, today congratulated Richard Prebble on his speech to students at Canterbury University on Thursday afternoon.

"Mr Prebble says that 'others can't exercise your choice for you', and this for many students will be a central issue at this year's election" Mr Heine said.

"Students recognise that they are faced with a choice between a Government of the left, which will strangle the economy and punish graduates for their learning with higher taxes, and a Government of National and ACT, which will allow students to take control of their own lives and make real decisions about their future."

"The Rebels agree with Mr Prebble when he says that 'you are not free to choose, if the state is going to take 40% of all you earn'. Nanny State is gorging herself at taxpayers' expense, and the only way for students to ensure that they are studying in a country which will reward them for their effort is if they vote to put Nanny on a diet."

"Students want the right to choose the direction of their own life - and they will use their votes to win back the right to make our own choices and to take responsability for those choices" Clint Heine said.
