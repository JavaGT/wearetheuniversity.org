PRESS RELEASE FOLLOWS:

Student Protest Once Again Misses The Mark

Members of the Otago branch of Prebble's Rebels were assaulted today when they tried to participate in an Otago University Student's Association (OUSA) protest against student debt.

Otago Rebel President Clint Heine said that he and another member were pushed and shoved, while other protesters attempted to take their signs away. The Rebels were peacefully demonstrating alongside fellow students on the issue of student debt.

The Rebels participated in the protest on the platform that lower taxes would help students to pay off debt faster.

According to Mr. Heine "the actions of these other protesters showed that the protest organisers obviously had no control". He also stated that the whole process was undemocratic, and that the Rebels should be allowed to participate in a protest that they were compulsorily paying for.

"The actions of these other protestors obviously showed that they do not believe in democracy and freedom of speech unless it happens to be the same as what they think" said Mr Heine.
