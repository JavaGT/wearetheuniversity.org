Rebel Lecturer Apologises For Strike
====================================

**Thursday, 7 October 1999, 1:48 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

While Victoria University of Wellington's academics went on strike today there were signs that the industrial action was not supported by even the half of Victoria's staff that belong to their union.

Following confirmation of the strike at least one lecturer dissented, apologising to his class and saying that "I don't think we should screw you guys around". He told students that, if he had the choice, "I personally would not go on strike".

The Victoria President of Prebble's Rebels, Nick Archer, said that the Rebels hold no position on the pay rise issue, but that disputes should not be taken out on students.

"Contract negotiations are the realm of the University and the staff, and students should not be punished for the failure of negotiations. This strike is timed for the direct lead up to final exams, when it does more harm to Victoria's fifteen thousand students than to the university."

Strike days are October 7 and 11. Classes conclude on October 15, and the exam period begins on October 22.

Mr Archer said that this strike action was only a foreshadowing of the increased union militancy students would see upsetting their study if a Labour/Alliance government was elected in November.
