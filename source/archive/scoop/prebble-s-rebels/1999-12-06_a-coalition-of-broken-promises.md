A Coalition Of Broken Promises
==============================

**Monday, 6 December 1999, 5:04 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

The Labour/Alliance government's first broken promises are only the start for what will become known as the least honest government in New Zealand's history, according to Clint Heine, President of Prebble's Rebels.

"The Alliance's 'Christmas Bonuses' of increased minimum wages and an extra $20 a week for beneficiaries are only the first wishes to be crossed off Jim Anderton's promise list" Mr Heine said.

"Labour and Alliance are finding that the realities of leading New Zealand in government are very different from their idealistic dreaming in opposition and on the hustings."

"Alliance's spokesperson for tertiary education, Liz Gordon, will not be in cabinet, signalling that Alliance policies of free education have also been thrown out the window."

"Students Associations wasted hundreds of compulsorily-taken student dollars telling us to vote for Alliance, and now the pie-in-the-sky policies they supported have crashed to a messy death on the cold ground of reality."

Mr Heine said "students were made to pay for protests against the centre-right, paid again for NZUSA propaganda telling us to how to vote, and now more union fees will no doubt be poured into protests against a left-wing government, because even Jim Anderton as Deputy Prime Minister is not extreme enough for the militant minority who have taken over the student unions."
