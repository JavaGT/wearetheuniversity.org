OUSA can dish it out but they can't take it
===========================================

**Sunday, 19 September 1999, 3:17 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

"OUSA cries like a baby whenever their political monopoly is challenged"  
said Mr Heine, the national president of Prebble's Rebels.

"If OUSA claim that our members were not assaulted, then I challenge Mr Day  
to come to our next meeting to receive identical treatment and see how long  
it takes before he is crying like a baby"

"As for the person who dressed up as a communist, I agree that it was  
unnecessary as the march was pathetic enough on its own. They did not need  
any assistance to discredit themselves" said Mr. Heine.

The protest was hijacked according to OUSA. "Both of us are required to be  
members of OUSA and to pay money to OUSA. Considering that we fund such  
protests, it is rich of OUSA to turn around and ask us to leave" argues Mr.  
Heine.

"As long as we are required to fund your pathetic whinging, we will be there  
with bells on." said Mr. Heine, "especially as long as you do a woeful job  
at representing anyone who is not an International Socialist or Alliance  
voter."
