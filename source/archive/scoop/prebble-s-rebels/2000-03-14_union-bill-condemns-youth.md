Union Bill Condemns Youth
=========================

**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Labour's Employment Relations Bill will have a "huge and devastating" effect on youth unemployment, according to student leader, Clint Heine.

Mr Heine, President of Prebble's Rebels, said that the Bill was "nothing more than a tool for union domination of the workplace" and that "this Bill will be a catastrophe for young employees".

"Young people, always the most vulnerable of workers, will be the first to lose out when unions call for strikes and productivity drops" Mr Heine said.

"Labour has already betrayed young people by heralding a return to compulsory unionism for tertiary students, and now they show no hesitiation in feeding workers to the union sharks as well."

Mr Heine said "this Bill offers nothing to young people, except the promise of even higher unemployment. To deliver anything positive for young New Zealanders, the government needs to focus on job-friendly policies that will make young people want to stay in New Zealand, instead of creating a union-dominated unemployment hell, which people will queue up to escape."
