Rebels Reject Red Budget
========================

**Thursday, 15 June 2000, 5:47 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Prebble's Rebels have attacked today's budget, saying "it lacks any reason young New Zealanders should believe that they can remain in New Zealand and get a job".

Rebel President, Clint Heine, said "by trying to scratch every itch, the Government will not boost business confidence. This is a budget that does not reward hard work, enterprise or success. The budget released today is hell bent on pandering to interest groups, and shows that not only does Government not understand business, but it does not understand the needs of youth, either."

"Nothing in this budget will encourage our young people to stay in New Zealand. Nothing in this budget will develop a knowledge economy, nothing will help special education, and nothing will have tertiary students dancing in the streets."

"The budget shows that student debt is expected to increase by 113% this year. From a Government which campaigned on shrinking the debt and reducing the costs of education, that is nothing short of a betrayal. The 2.3% increase in tertiary funding will barely allow tertiary institutions to tread water, and the Rebels predict that despite the political rhetoric, fees will rise at our universities next year."

"There is no vision of how to close the gap between Maori and non-Maori attendance in pre-schools. In fact, by scrapping the TIE scheme and reintroducing zoning, Maori and low income earners will be effectively priced out of the kind of education which would really close the gaps."

"There is nothing in the budget acknowledging that both learning disabled and gifted children have special educational needs which are not met within the standard classroom. This government has dropped the ball on identifying and addressing the urgent needs of those children who need a hand up, as well as of our best and brightest."

Mr Heine said "this budget shows no desire to empower less fortunate youth. There is nothing but an ineffectual, irresponsible string of pork-barrel spending - no singular direction and no positive vision."
