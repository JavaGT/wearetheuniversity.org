Students Associations Increase Cost Of Education
================================================

**Friday, 28 April 2000, 11:19 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Complaints by the Aotearoa Post-Compulsory Student Union (APSU) and the New Zealand University Students' Association (NZUSA) about the impact of tertiary fee increases on inflation are hypocritical as both organisations support compulsory membership of students' associations - a policy that increases costs to students, Prebble's Rebels President, Clint Heine, said today.

Clint Heine said \"approximately half of all students' associations have voluntary membership but APSU and NZUSA want to force all students into compulsory associations. Compulsory membership currently costs tertiary students $16m a year. By supporting the extension of compulsory membership, the two organisations are promoting increased costs for students."

"A pro-compulsory student politician has already admitted that compulsory membership will increase costs for students", Mr Heine said. "The Waikato Students' Union currently has voluntary membership and the president, Pita Cammock, has admitted that the cost of WSU membership would increase if membership became compulsory. WSU membership is now only $10 after being as high as $91.50 under compulsory membership. Voluntary membership has saved Waikato students almost $2m over the past two years."

"Compulsory membership gives a monopoly to student politicians and allows them to bump up fees to fund grandiose, pet projects. Students' associations are political organisations and students shouldn't have to join them in order to get a tertiary education."

"It is hypocritical for student politicians to complain about the cost of tertiary education when they are promoting policies that raise costs and barriers to students" Mr Heine said.
