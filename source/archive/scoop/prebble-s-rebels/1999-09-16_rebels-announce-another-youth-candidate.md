Rebels announce another youth candidate
=======================================

**Thursday, 16 September 1999, 10:09 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Prebble's Rebels Otago President Clint Heine is pleased to announce the list candidacy of Matt McInnes for ACT New Zealand.

Hon Richard Prebble announced the candidacy this afternoon at a speech organised by Otago University Students Association (OUSA).

"It is very exciting to have such a high profile student politician standing for the ACT party" remarked Mr Heine "more remarkable is the increasingly high number of youths being selected, this shows that the ACT party is the party that supports its younger members".

In a separate capacity, Matt McInnes is the commerce representative for the OUSA and has worked vigorously towards the goal of making OUSA a more accountable organisation for its compulsory members. "His inclusion on the ACT list is due to his continued commitment to the party and his tireless work for the Prebble's Rebels. The Rebels are positive Matt will make a great contribution to the already excellent ACT list come November" stated Mr Heine.
