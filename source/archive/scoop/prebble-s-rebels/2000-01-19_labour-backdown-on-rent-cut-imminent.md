Labour Backdown On Rent Cut Imminent
====================================

**Wednesday, 19 January 2000, 3:35 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Labour is preparing a full-scale back down on it's pledge card promise to restore income related rents for state housing tenants, according to the President of a national student group.

Clint Heine, President of Prebble's Rebels, said that recent media releases by the Minister for Housing, and the 'good behaviour barbeque bribe' for tenants, show that Labour is preparing to back out of it's campaign commitment to rent state houses at 25% of the residents' income.

"Labour are discovering that government is about reality, and that finding real solutions is harder than spouting socialist ideology from the opposition benches" Mr Heine said.

"What makes the impending policy reversal even more damning is that the policy was one of Helen Clark's credit card commitments."

Mr Heine said "if the Labour/Alliance government back down on this policy then it shows the only real 'commitment' Helen Clark made during the campaign was to herself."
