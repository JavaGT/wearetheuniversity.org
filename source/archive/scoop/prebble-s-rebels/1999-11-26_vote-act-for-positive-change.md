Vote ACT For Positive Change
============================

**Friday, 26 November 1999, 10:15 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Less than 24 hours from the opening of the polls, young people have been told that if they want a government that works for them they should give their party vote to ACT.

"Only ACT can bring the positive change that students and young people in New Zealand are crying out for" said Rebels President Clint Heine.

"ACT will end compulsory student unions in tertiary education and restore the freedom of association. ACT will also encourage choice, personal responsibility and the abolition of privilege."

"ACT's policies will benefit youth immensely. In particular, a strong economy will provide jobs, security and the kinds of goods and services we want, rather than what some government bureaucrat tells us we will have."

"Polls show that young people can connect to ACT's messages, and that support among youth is strong. Tomorrow we will watch the young people of New Zealand demand a positive future and a chance to take control of their own lives. Young people across New Zealand will vote for a country that rewards their success rather than punishes it" Mr Heine said.

"Tomorrow we vote. Prebble's Rebels asks young people take an active part in the movement for positive change, and to cast their party vote for ACT New Zealand."
