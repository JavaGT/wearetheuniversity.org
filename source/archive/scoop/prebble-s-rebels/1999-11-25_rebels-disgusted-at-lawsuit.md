Rebels Disgusted At Lawsuit
===========================

**Thursday, 25 November 1999, 10:11 am**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Auckland University Students Association (AUSA) is getting involved in another no-win lawsuit, where the only possible outcome is more student money being wasted, according to Clint Heine, President of Prebble's Rebels.

Mr Heine said \"most students have no objection to paying fees to attend university. Tertiary education is far from a free good, and it is only right that students meet some part of the cost themselves."

"The average graduate earns twice what the average non-graduate does. Why should we expect people on low incomes to pay for our study through taxes?"

"Public sympathy for the student unions would be much lower if people realised just how much extra tax the student unions expect every hard working New Zealander to pay, so that tomorrows lawyers and doctors can have an easier ride through university."

"The sad thing is, most students disagree with the protests of Eva Neitzert, Karen Skinner and the other extremist ideologues. This is only a militant minority of students made flush with student funds and high on the hollow dreams of socialism."

"The worst thing is, that this lawsuit is bound to consume more student money. At most universities, the students who have no wish to be union members are still being forced to pay for this kind of craziness through compulsory union fees."
