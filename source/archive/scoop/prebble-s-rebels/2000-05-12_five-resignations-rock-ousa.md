Five Resignations Rock OUSA
===========================

**Friday, 12 May 2000, 12:59 pm**  
**Press Release: [Prebble's Rebels](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Prebble's_Rebels)**

Otago President of Prebble's Rebels, Sean Dougherty, said that he believes five members of the Otago University Students Association executive have resigned tonight, after Andrew Campbell (OUSA President) lost a confidence vote but refused to resign.

Mr Dougherty said "Mr Campbell's refusal to accept the decision of his democratically elected executive would be unprincipled and unconscionable".

"Student unionists cling to the idea that they are the voice of students, but tonight student democracy has clashed with personal political survival."

Mr Dougherty said "I congratulate the five executive members who resigned. What legitimacy does OUSA have when it's President doesn't even hold the confidence of his executive?"
