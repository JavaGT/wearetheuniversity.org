Politics Alive And Well At Victoria

The weekly policy-setting forum of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) came alive yesterday with a plethora of motions pushing VUWSA policy further right on some issues that it has been for some time.

Student Representative Council (SRC) requires a quorum of 50 of the over 18000 students of Victoria to be present and voting. Between 50 and 65 students were present throughout the meeting.

VUWSA President Amanda Hill said that “it was great to see real debate – although the small group moving the motions rarely took the microphone to support them – and it is refreshing to see students taking an interest in what is happening both on their campus and in the world around them”

Among the policies to be passed were: The condemnation of the lack of consultation on the Library’s Collection Appraisal Project A motion of condolence to Auckland University on the appointment of current Victoria Vice-Chancellor to a similar position Support for tax cuts for the 33% tax bracket Condemnation of any move to reintroduce the death penalty Support for the continuation of the anti-nuclear policy.

“Any policy can be revoked with a similar motion at SRC, which gives VUWSA a great deal of flexibility in its policy” Hill said. “It is pleasing to see such a change in perspective from many of the right-wing groups, from discounting the SRC forum as an undemocratic crank, to actively taking part in it”.
