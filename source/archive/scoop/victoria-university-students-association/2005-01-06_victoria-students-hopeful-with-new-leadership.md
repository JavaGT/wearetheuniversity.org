Victoria Students Hopeful with New Leadership

Victoria Students Hopeful with New Leadership in 2005

Jeremy Greenbrook, the new President of the Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA) is hopeful that 2005 will be a better for Victoria students.

“2005 sees Victoria University with a new Chancellor, Pro Chancellor, and Vice Chancellor, as well as a relatively new Minister of Tertiary Education” says Greenbrook. “The changing of the guard will be closely watched by Victoria University students, who have had to bear the brunt of two significant fee increases in as many years, and the abolition of the Independent Circumstances Allowance this year.”

“Victoria students are fed up with the corporate, profit making mentality that has emerged at the university, and in the wider tertiary sector. This new leadership has the opportunity to turn this around in 2005. If this does not happen, students will be holding them accountable for the escalating student debt and hardship” Greenbrook said.

Jeremy Greenbrook is a postgraduate student, completing a Masters thesis in Geography. He is joined by Vice President (Education), Jennifer Jones, and Vice President (Welfare), Nick Kelly.
