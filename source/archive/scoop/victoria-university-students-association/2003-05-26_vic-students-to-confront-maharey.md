Vic students to confront Maharey

Students will be protesting tomorrow in the Hunter Courtyard at Victoria University at 3:30 pm against the fee maxima levels that the government has set.

Minister of Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey is speaking in the Hunter Council Chamber at 4pm about ‘Tertiary Education and the Public Good’.

“Labour have broken their promise to students by allowing fees to rise, students will be showing Maharey how angry they are about fee increases, more student debt and even longer repayment times,” said Victoria University Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) President Catherine Belfield-Haines.
