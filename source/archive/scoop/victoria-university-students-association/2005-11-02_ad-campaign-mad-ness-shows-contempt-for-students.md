Advertising Campaign MAD-ness Shows Contempt for Students

Victoria University’s latest advertising campaign show management has no regard for students, says Jeremy Greenbrook, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association.

“Only two days after the University Council voted to raise student fees, management announces that it is launching its latest highly expensive advertising campaign” says Greenbrook. “Management pleaded poverty in order to ram through an increase, yet there’s obviously enough money for high-cost advertising.”

Fees at Victoria will be going up by 5% across the board, with another 5% in Humanities and Education. This latest advertising campaign is in the style of MAD Magazine.

“This shows contempt for student’s financial situation” says Greenbrook. “It Make’s You Think? I doubt this campaign would even challenge Alfred E. Newman to think much”
