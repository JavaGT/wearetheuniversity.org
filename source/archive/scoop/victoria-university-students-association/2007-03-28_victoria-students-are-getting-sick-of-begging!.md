Victoria students are getting sick of begging!

The announcement of total student debt reaching nine billion dollars is a disappointing commentary on a flawed student loan system, according to Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association President Geoff Hayward.

\"It's no surprise that in spite of student loans being interest free has failed to actually tackle the triggers of debt, in fact when one looks at how much of the 9 billion owed was for living costs, we find that students cannot survive unless they rely upon their student loan"

Approximately 40% of the nine billion owed is from students borrowing for living costs. Each student can borrow up to $150 each week for living costs. Furthermore, in spite of Government measures to increase entitlements, 29% of all tertiary students are entitled to student allowances. Because of these, more students are forced to take out a student loan to survive while studying

"It's legislative begging. It's a white collar means to force students to take on debt, where no other group of society would be expected to. Furthermore, it's that same debt that affects people's life choices: starting a family, buying a home or starting a business. All of this because they had to take out a loan to avoid death while studying. It's time that the Government once and for all end a shameful practice, and install universal student allowances for all students."

In Wellington, the costs of living while studying make the situation even worse.

"Students are struggling to find accommodation, and when they do, they have to pay between $120 and $130 a week in rent. No wonder why students are deciding to not study at Victoria. Not only must we install a universal student allowance, we must pay allowances at a rate that will reflect the true cost of studying in Wellington. No one should be forced to beg to survive."
