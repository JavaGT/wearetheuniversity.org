Students protest Maharey’s “public good” fee rises

Hundreds of angry students showed Steve Maharey their opinion of his proposed fee rises at Victoria University today.

“Maharey was here giving a speech on tertiary education and the public good – this is bitter irony for Vic students who could face massive fee rises. We’re the public – and these fee rises are no good for us,” said Catherine Belfield-Haines, President of the Victoria University Students’ Association.

“If Steve Maharey was serious about the public good, he would introduce free education tomorrow, instead Labour is allowing massive fee rises,” said Belfield-Haines “Students already owe $5.5 billion in student loan debt and fees are already at the highest level that students have ever paid in New Zealand.”

“Let’s have a real debate about the public good of tertiary education,” said Belfield-Haines.

“This government is long on rhetoric and short on action. Raising fees are the opposite from the policies New Zealanders expect and deserve from the so-called centre left.”

“Labour have broken their promise to students by allowing fees to rise, students have shown Maharey how angry they are about fee increases, more student debt and even longer repayment times,” said Belfield-Haines.
