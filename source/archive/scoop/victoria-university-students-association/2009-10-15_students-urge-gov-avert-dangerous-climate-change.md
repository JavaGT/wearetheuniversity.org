Students urge government to avert dangerous climate change

Victoria University students will take to the streets this Friday to highlight the dangers of climate change and urge the government to take appropriate action.

Student leaders say that there is strong support amongst students for urgent government action on climate change.

“A recent meeting of students voted to support the Greenpeace ‘Sign On’ and 350 campaigns, and in support of New Zealand having a 40% emissions reduction target below 1990 levels by 2020,” said Jasmine Freemantle, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA).

“Students are concerned that the less we do now, the more the burden is likely to fall on future generations. But the more we do now, the more students can contribute to innovative solutions that will ensure New Zealand is a world leader, and has its economic future secured,” she said.

The march will depart from Kelburn Park at 12pm and progress to Parliament. The march is part of the lead up to the 350 Global Day of Action scheduled for Saturday 24 October.
