Victoria University’s massive surplus the perfect excuse for fee cuts and staff salary increases

Victoria University is second only to Massey in terms of the highest surplus recorded by universities in 2003, and has the highest staff/student ratios in the country putting academic quality at Victoria at risk.

“The University’s claims that they were forced to raise student fees and that they cannot afford to meet staff pay claims are hollow given their massive surplus in 2003,” said Amanda Hill, President of the Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA).

“In 2003, we had 22.5 students for every staff member, increased from 20.8 in 2002” said Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) president Amanda Hill.

“Reductions in staff to student ratios puts immense pressure on our academic staff and brings into question the quality of education available at Victoria in such large classes,” said Hill. “Some classes defy safety regulations, enrolling more students than can be safely seated in a lecture theatre.”

“The time is right for the University to cut student fees and increase staff wages.”

“It is obvious that profit rules the thinking of Victoria’s management - the wellbeing of staff, quality of education and financial burden on students all trail behind the mighty dollar,” said Hill today.
