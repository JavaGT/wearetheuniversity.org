Accommodation Crisis: Victoria University responding to the market rather than the needs of students.

‘Crisis of accommodation’ has hit Victoria students, admits the University, but what are they doing about it?

In 2008 University Hall accommodation will have significant price increases to reflect market values of Kelburn flats. “Flats on Salamanca will go up to around $130, while flats around Fairlie and Adams terrace will cost around $120-$125” per room, claimed a University Hall insider. Up from $110-$115 in 2007. This is a part of University policy to have University owned accommodation reflect market prices.

“How would I be able to feed myself and live on the $20 left after rent” explained a student in the Victoria University quad. Many students rely on student loan payments of $150 per week for all of their living costs and will be severely disadvantaged by the price hike. When asked about the possible price hike, the Director of Student Services, Ruth Moorhouse claimed “We are looking at rents and trying to find a reasonable level.”

Despite price hikes student accommodation is still substandard. Many students complain about damp, cold conditions and mould resulting from low up keep and a lack of necessary insulation. “Many of the Uni Hall flats have been neglected for some time and require maintenance and repairs, with those flats we can’t really justify raising rents” explained Moorhouse.

Plans by the University have been unveiled to build a new first year’s residence hall near the Kelburn campus. The building is being rushed-through with very little student or resident input other than a flyer in the Aro chip shop informing residents of a meeting.

This new hall will not serve to relieve the crisis as increasing the number of first year accommodation will create a greater demand for flats. “When these new first years move on to find flats they are going to find themselves in an even worse situation than we are now. Landlords will raise prices and students form less advantaged families will suffer and miss out” said VUWSA Campaigns Officer Tai Neilson.

Prospects for students looking to live in Wellington are not looking good. For 2007 half of the 4000 applicants for Halls of residents were denied. The new Hall needs to be built before 2009 when Weir House will undergo much needed earthquake proofing. Price hikes and more demand for flats would have hugely detrimental effects for students.
