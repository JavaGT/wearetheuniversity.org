Students March To Demand The Reinstatement Of EUB
=================================================

**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

Students March To Demand The Reinstatement Of Emergency Unemployment Benefit

Victoria University students will be protesting on Thursday 22nd of March to demand the reinstatement of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit for students over the summer.

Currently if a student is not eligible for a student allowance during the year then they are refused all financial help over the summer if they can't find a job.

"Steve Maharey and the Labour Party are denying students the right to an income," said Jimmy Southgate, VUWSA Campaigns officer and Education Action Group member.

The march is the second attempt at a protest for the EUB as weather forced the postponement of the original action scheduled for March 14th.

When National removed the EUB in 1998 Steve Maharey said "It is a mean spirited attack on students which will save a small amount of money while confirming that the Government is not interested in ensuring maximum participation in tertiary education"

Maharey has now been the Associate Minister for Tertiary Education for over a year, however not only has he refused to reverse the policy, but he is now a vocal advocate for denying 70,000 students access to the EUB.

The march will depart from Victoria University Quad shortly after twelve and head to Parliament Grounds via the Labour party head offices.

A picnic will be held at Parliament Grounds to celebrate the end of another "summer of starvation".
