Vic Students Celebrate 1st Civil Union Victory

Victoria Students Celebrate First Civil Union Victory

Queer students at Victoria University celebrated tonight as the first steps were taken toward legal recognition of same-sex and different-sex couples, in the passing of the Civil Union Bill into select committee by 66 votes to 50.

UniQ, in conjunction with their parent association VUWSA, held a Civil Union Bill picnic at Parliament before question time today. UniQ Co-President AJ Marsh commented that “it was a very positive afternoon, with several MP’s turning out to speak in support of the Bill, people bringing their children and a generally festive atmosphere”.

It was less festive in the debating chamber however, with some students finding many remarks, particularly from MP’s Dale Jones and Peter Brown, highly offensive.

“To be called an abomination, and to have it insinuated that gay men are likely to sexually abuse their children, is extremely upsetting to many people” said Mr Marsh.

“We will be working very, very hard over the next few months to ensure the public has as much information as it needs to make an informed decision” said Madeliene Drew, UniQ Co-President, after the vote today.
