VUWSA Praises Efforts of VUW Cricket Team

Victoria University students can be proud of the efforts of the VUW men’s cricket team, which won the NZ Universities Championship on Monday, said Jeremy Greenbrook, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association. Victoria won all 3 of their matches including a win in the final over a very strong Otago team.

“University life is more than just study” says Greenbrook. “The VUW Cricket team has shown this, with a last-ball victory over Otago in the final.”

“An innings of 117 not out in the final by team captain, Stephen Murdoch, is outstanding, and was rewarded with the National Bank Player of the Championship” said Greenbrook.

Five members of the Victoria team (including Murdoch) were named in the Tournament Team.

Match card:
