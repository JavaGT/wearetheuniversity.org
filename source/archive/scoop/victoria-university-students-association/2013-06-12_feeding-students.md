**Feeding students**  
The Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) in partnership with Victoria University has provided 4000 meals feeding students across all the University’s campuses during this week’s end of trimester ‘Stress Free Study Week’.

Stress Free Study Week aims to help students make the most of their study period, and make life a little bit easier while they prepare for exams. VUWSA delivered over 4000 free breakfasts and lunches at Kelburn, Pipitea, and Te Aro campuses.

During the week students consumed:  
• 2000 apples and pears  
• Over 1700 Weetbix biscuits  
• 10kgs of Cornflakes  
• 12kgs of Peanut Butter  
• Over 200 loaves of bread  
• 300 litres of soup  
•  
VUWSA’s Welfare Vice-President Simon Tapp said that the response from students was fantastic.

"VUWSA saw an increase in demand each day at all campuses" said Mr Tapp.

"At Te Aro campus in particular, we experienced a significantly higher turnout of students attending than we have in previous years.”

Mr Tapp said that a recent longitudinal study conducted by the Financial Education and Research Centre has found that 34.9 per cent of students had changed their eating habits in the past six month due to insufficient funds.

“That’s exactly why it’s important Stress Free Study Week was available at all campuses all week as hardship and lack of food is a significant worry for students.

“Initiatives like Stress Free Study Week are a huge task for VUWSA and our brilliant volunteers, but are incredibly important with the cost of living increasing, average student incomes decreasing, and fewer students being able to find work while they face soaring student loans and changes to student allowances,” said Mr Tapp.

VUWSA will be returning with the next ‘Stress-Free Study Week’ from 21 - 25 October.
