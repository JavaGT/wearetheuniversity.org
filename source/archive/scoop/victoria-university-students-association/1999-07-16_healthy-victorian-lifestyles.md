Healthy Victorian Lifestyles
============================

**Friday, 16 July 1999, 12:30 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

![VUWSA web site](http://www.vuw.ac.nz/vuwsa/graphics/newlogo.gif)Students' attitudes towards healthy living are due for a shake up, as the nationally organised Healthy Lifestyles Week rolls into town. The week sees a number of events and activities happening on and around campus, all with the stated aim of promoting more individual and planetary health consciousness among students.

On Wednesday 28 July a large number of health related groups are setting up shop in the University Quad. There is a great diversity of groups appearing, ranging from the Push Play campaign to the NZ Prostitutes Collective.

The offer of a free BBQ (courtesy of the NZ Beef & Lamb Board) promises to be a big drawcard for undernourished students.

The following day the campus hosts community and environmental groups, including Trade Aid, the Karori Sanctuary, Peace Movement Aotearoa and our very own City Voice.

Students Association representative Chris Hubscher states \"We see the concept of healthy lifestyles as extending beyond the individual. Personal fitness alone won't make you healthy. A truly healthy lifestyle includes respect for our environment, as well as ourselves."

Other activities over the course of the week include nutrition seminars, free sports club trial evenings and provision of heavily discounted access to the Recreation Centre's weights room.

There won't be any attempt to emulate Otago University Student Association's No Booze Week, where the Student Executive attempt to swear off alcohol for the duration.

"That couldn't happen here" says Mr Hubscher. "Not that our Executive are excessively fond of a tipple, but we have a responsibility to keep the Student Bar afloat. Anyway, if they must have a drink, that's their affair. My primary concern is to ensure that they recycle the glass."

**Healthy Lifestyles Week - 26-30 July, Victoria University.**
