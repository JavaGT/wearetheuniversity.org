MPs Congratulated on Drinking Age Change
========================================

**Wednesday, 28 July 1999, 6:09 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

Students are pleased that the drinking age has been lowered from 20 to 18 this afternoon. Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association President Hamish Hopkinson labelled the move a "sensible and practical" decision.

"For a number of years the law in this area has been very muddled and this has made organisation of successful campus activities difficult. A blanket drinking age of 18 will be much easier to enforce and will allow more students to participate in campus activities," Hamish Hopkinson said.

Earlier this year a "crackdown" on 18-20 year olds attending events during the Victoria University Orientation Festival meant many students either had to queue for hours for meal tickets or were turned away because they were under age. Today's change alleviates this problem.

"We congratulate MPs for making this decision in spite of the recent emotive lobbying by organisations opposed to the move. There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that a lowering of the will lead to more alcohol-related road accidents or a greater level of youth crime," said VUWSA Education Vice-President Chris Hipkins.
