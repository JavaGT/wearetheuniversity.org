TEAC Report Begins To Bridge Gaps
=================================

**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

The Victoria University of Wellington Students Association has welcomed the third report of the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission, in particular the acknowledgement that a greater emphasis on providing a link between secondary and tertiary education is required from government.

"It is now widely recognised that many Maori and Pacific students never go forward to tertiary study. Indeed many finish secondary school with no formal qualification whatsoever, making the prospect of any further study a very distant one," VUWSA President Chris Hipkins said.

"The Commission's recognition of the value of bridging courses, improved course advice, greater incentives for disadvantaged learners, and improved adult and community education is a tremendous step in the right direction," Mr. Hipkins said.

"Many prospective students find the thought of study at university or polytechnic daunting and intimidating. The aggressive marketing campaigns currently run by institutions, focused on getting bums on seats rather than meeting the needs of individual students, has only made that worse," Mr. Hipkins said.

"We are also very pleased to see the Commission acknowledge the public value of a tertiary education, which stands in stark contrast to the view taken by the previous National government that tertiary education was a largely private good," Mr. Hipkins said.

Mr Hipkins concluded by saying that the onus was now on the government to "come up with the goods" to fund TEAC's vision for tertiary education in New Zealand.
