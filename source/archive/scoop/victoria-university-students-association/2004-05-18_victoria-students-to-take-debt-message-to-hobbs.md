Victoria Students To Take Debt Message To Hobbs
===============================================

Victoria Students To Take Debt Message To Marian Hobbs

Victoria students are preparing to mark a national day of action on Wednesday in support of a living allowance for all students, by marching from the quad at the Kelburn campus to the Willis St office of Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs at 12.30pm.

Students will gather in the quad from 12pm, with the message that ‘borrowing to live means debt for life’ for the two thirds of tertiary students who do not receive a living allowance.

Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) President Amanda Hill expects the demonstration to reach the electorate office by 12.45pm, where a delegation from the Ministers’ office will meet them and accept a ‘debt backpack’ from the students.

“Our message will be that Labour needs to take some of the burden off students in the form of increased access to living allowances. Students should not be the only sector of society who must borrow to live” said Hill.
