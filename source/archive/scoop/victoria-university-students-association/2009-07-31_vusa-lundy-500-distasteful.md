For Immediate Release

**Lundy 500 distasteful and irresponsible, says student president**

Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) is disappointed to learn of the decision by student magazine _Salient_ to hold their Lundy 500 event. VUWSA does not support this event.

“The Lundy 500 event is extremely distasteful, and poses a potential safety risk to students and the general public,” said Jasmine Freemantle, VUWSA President.

While _Salient_ is funded by VUWSA, the magazine is independent of the students’ association.

“VUWSA distance ourselves from the event, and wish to make it clear to students and the public that this event is in no way associated with either VUWSA or Victoria University,” concluded Freemantle.
