Professor Guilford commended all the recipients of Blues Awards for their dedication and success.

‘Last night’s recipients have joined an exclusive club of Victoria Blues Award winners, which includes All Blacks Graham Mourie, Victor Vito and Conrad Smith; All White Simon Elliott; World Mountain Running Champ Kate McIlroy; Hockey Black Stick Suzie Muirhead; and of course our Olympians—Ian Ferguson, Natasha Hind, Matthew Coad, Richard Joyce, and our newest Olympians—Emma Robinson, who swam in the Summer Games at Rio, and sprinter Liam Malone.’

Gee says VUWSA is very proud to work in partnership with Victoria to recognise our top athletes.

‘These awards give us the opportunity to acknowledge students who have achieved outstanding sporting success through hard-work and dedication, while successfully balancing their academic responsibilities of assignments, tutorials, labs and lectures.

‘Their ability to balance degree-level study with outstanding performance in sports is an incredible achievement.’

Blues Awards’ winners were chosen by representatives from Victoria University, VUWSA and Sport New Zealand. The Blues Panel selected winners based on how well they met strict Blues Awards criteria across each category.
