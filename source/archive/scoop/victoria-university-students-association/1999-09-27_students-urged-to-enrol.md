Students Urged to Enrol
=======================

**Monday, 27 September 1999, 11:38 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

![VUWSA web site](http://www.vuw.ac.nz/vuwsa/graphics/newlogo.gif)Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association President-elect Chris Hipkins is particularly concerned about the low level of voter enrolment for the forthcoming general election. Just under 20% of Wellington Central voters between the ages of 18 and 29 have yet to enrol. Other Wellington electorates also fare badly, with Rimutaka, Hutt South and Mana all having over 20% of 18 to 29 year olds not currently enrolled.

Chris Hipkins said he was concerned that many students may be in this situation and over the coming weeks the association would be doing everything it possibly could to try to rectify the situation. Among the initiatives the association is planning are visits to many Halls of Residence, lecture speaks to remind students to enrol, and placing enrolment tables throughout campus. Enrolment forms are also available from the VUWSA office.

"I strongly urge all students to make sure they will be eligible to vote. Regardless of what side of the political spectrum you place yourself on it is your right to vote and you need to make sure you get out there and ensure your voice is heard," Mr. Hipkins said.

"The forthcoming general election will be a critical one for students. We will get to have a say in whether we think the present government is looking after our interests or not. The $3billion in debt students have clocked up under the loan scheme and the looming prospect of a massive fee hike next year are all going to be major election issues to it is really important students are eligible to have their voices heard," Mr. Hipkins concluded.
