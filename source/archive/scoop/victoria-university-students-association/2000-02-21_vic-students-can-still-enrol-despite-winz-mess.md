Vic Students Can Still Enrol Despite WINZ Mess
==============================================

**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

![VUWSA web site](http://www.vuw.ac.nz/vuwsa/graphics/newlogo.gif)The Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association is delighted that their University is taking a lenient approach to enrolling students even if WINZ have not processed their student loan applications.

President Chris Hipkins said he had spoken to staff in the enrolment office and it has been agreed that students will still be able to complete their enrolment and collect their ID cards even if the University is still waiting for WINZ to pay the students tuition fees.

"The coming week would have been chaos if students had been prevented from completing their enrolment due to WINZ incompetence. Nearly 200 Summer School students are still waiting for their loan applications to be processed and Summer School has now finished!

"Imagine what it would have been like for the main part of the academic year when around eight times the number of students enrol," Chris Hipkins said.

Previously students would not be issued with their ID cards until they had paid their fees, however with the prospect of WINZ taking some months to sort out the loans shambles, that would have been impossible to enforce.

"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff working in the enrolment office on behalf of the many students they have been helping. WINZ have not made life easy for them yet they have continued to do all they can to help students through the enrolment process,"

"When the University processed the loan applications things ran much more smoothly. It wasn't broken, but now that it has been 'fixed' it is worse than ever," Chris Hipkins concluded.
