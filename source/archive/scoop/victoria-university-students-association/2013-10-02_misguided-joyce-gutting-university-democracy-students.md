Misguided Joyce Gutting University Democracy -Students

Today Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association President Rory McCourt criticised Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce for proposed changes to University Councils that remove legislative requirements for student and staff representation as “misguided and undemocratic”

“This Minister and this Government have increasingly ignored students and staff, and now they want University Councils to do the same. They tried gutting stakeholder representation with the polytechnics, it didn’t work, and now they want to replicate it for us. No thank you” said McCourt

“Students on these Councils provide an important reality check, giving real feedback from the coalface. It’s important that any governing body gets a range of views to make the right decisions” said McCourt

“With over 23,000 students at Victoria, each paying about $7,000 a year in fees, a guaranteed seat at the table is not too much to ask. In fact –it makes for a better Council” concluded McCourt.

Steven Joyce has refused to meet with the Tertiary Education Union or the national students’ union NZUSA for the last two years. Consultation is open for six weeks.
