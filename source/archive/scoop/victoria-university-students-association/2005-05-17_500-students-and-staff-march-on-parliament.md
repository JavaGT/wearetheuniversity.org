500 Students and Staff March on Parliament

Over 500 students and staff marched on Parliament this afternoon, according to Jeremy Greenbrook, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association.

“Students marched today because they are angry at the increases in fees and inaccessibility of student allowances” says Greenbrook. “This is the largest student protest under this government.”

“Students will be taking to the streets again, unless the government realised their policies of fee increases, and lack of allowances will not cut it in an election year”

“Trevor Mallard and the Government must listen to students, and put an end to blatantly unaffordable tertiary education” says Greenbrook. “They have an opportunity in the budget to address these problems. Otherwise, students will be remembering their student debt come election day”.
