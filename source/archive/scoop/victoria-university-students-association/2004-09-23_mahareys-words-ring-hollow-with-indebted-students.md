Maharey’s Words Ring Hollow with Indebted Students

Victoria University students will view Steve Maharey’s advice to university councils as too little, too late.

“It’s a kick in the guts for student who’s fees have already been set, that the minister has the gall to ‘urge’ councils to be cautious now,” said Jeremy Greenbrook, Vice President (Education) and 2005 President Elect of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA).

The Victoria University Council voted 15 votes to 4 in favour of a 4.5% fee increase for domestic students in 2005 on September 9.

“As a former academic, Mr Maharey should know when fee setting happens, and the impact it has on student debt,” said Greenbrook.

“What does the minister plan to do for the 18,000 Victoria University students whose fees have already gone up by considerably more than cost of living increases?”
