A Signature Too Much To Ask For Most
====================================

A Signature Too Much To Ask For Most

Victoria University senior management and Wellington City Councillors have refused to sign a petition calling on the government to provide a living allowance for all students. In doing so, they have shown no concern for the welfare of students, the primary stakeholders of the institution, said the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) President Amanda Hill.

The Association issued a challenge last week to the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor and Senior Management Team of the University to sign the petition, as well as Wellington City Councillors and local parliamentarians.

“Most of these prominent people received their tertiary qualification for free, but many now support and administer a system that gives a living allowance to only a third of tertiary students, and has allowed student debt to build to over six billion dollars”, said Hill today.

Peter Dunne, leader of United Future, was the only politician to attend the VUWSA Initial General Meeting today and publicly sign the petition. Members of the Green Party have signed the petition on previous occasions.

“We are grateful for the support of the Greens and United Future. But the notable absence of the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor of the University at today’s meeting indicate that while they oppose the lack of funding for tertiary institutions, they are not prepared to lobby the Labour government on behalf of their students – the same students from whom they extract exorbitant fees every year” Hill said.
