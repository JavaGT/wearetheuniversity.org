Students Appeal For Vegetables
==============================

**Wednesday, 23 January 2002, 10:06 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

The Victoria University Students’ Association is appealing for any spare vegetables that Wellingtonians with vegetable gardens can donate to the association’s Foodbank.

‘The summer is always a tough time for students and with the increase in vegetable prices, students are really feeling the pinch,’ said Victoria University Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons.

‘The association’s Foodbank was started in response to the National Government’s axing of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit in 1998 and the need has been steady ever since,’ continued Fitzsimons.

‘The Foodbank gives away staple food to needy students, many of whom are parents with young children struggling to afford the basics, any help that the people of Wellington can offer will be gratefully received,’ said Welfare Vice President Catherine Belfield-Haines

The Association is happy to collect donated vegetables and asks that anyone who would like to donate vegetables contacts the association on 473 8566.
