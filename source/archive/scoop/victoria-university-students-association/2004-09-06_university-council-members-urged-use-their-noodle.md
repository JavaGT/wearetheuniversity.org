University Council Members Urged Use Their Noodle

University Council Members Urged To 'Use Their Noodle'

Victoria University students will be given hundreds of packets of two minute noodles this week, highlighting the hardship students face due to ever-increasing tuition fees.

Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association president Amanda Hill said that students were being informed of the proposed 4.5% increase in tuition fees as they started classes again on Monday after the mid-semester break.

"If this increase goes through, fees will have gone up by 7.5% in two years. That is totally unacceptable, and an indictment on the Council if they do not seriously begin to question the motives of management in wanting more money" said Hill.

"The income of students has not increased to match the fees now charged by institutions. The government might have given with one hand in the last budget by increasing access to allowances, but took with the other by abolishing the Independent Circumstances Allowance and the Married Allowance. That cut will affect around 7000 students who will now have to live off their loan, or discontinue their study" Hill said.

"Several members of the University Council are running in the Wellington City Council elections, and students will be watching closely to see how they vote" warned Hill.

The public Council meeting to set fees takes place on Thursday 9 September at 4pm in the Hunter Council Chamber, and all media are welcome to attend.
