Victoria Students Praise Massey’s Zero Fee Increase

Victoria University students today praised the Massey University Council’s decision not to raise domestic student fees for 2005.

“Massey University has led the way. There is no justification for fee increases on an annual basis, and students will be relieved to see that at least one institution has demonstrated this,” said Jeremy Greenbrook, Vice President (Education) and 2005 President Elect of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA).

The Victoria University Council voted in favour of a 4.5% fee increase for domestic students in 2005 on September 9.

“This sends a strong message to all tertiary institutions around New Zealand, including Victoria,” said Greenbrook. “Student representatives on the Victoria University Council will be recommending a revision of Victoria’s fees for 2005 in light of Massey’s decision.”

“Victoria is supposed to ‘Make You Think’. I wonder how many current and prospective Victoria students are going to think about going to a cheaper university in 2005?”
