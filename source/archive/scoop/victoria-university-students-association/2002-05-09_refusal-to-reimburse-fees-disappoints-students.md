Refusal To Reimburse Fees Disappoints Students
==============================================

**Thursday, 9 May 2002, 2:56 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

Students at Victoria University are disappointed at the Vice Chancellor’s announcement today that the University will not reimburse fees to students who missed classes due to the staff strike held on the 27th and 28th March.

‘Hundreds of students filled out forms requesting their fees back for the classes missed because of the staff strike. It is unfortunate that the University is not willing to recognise that students miss out when staff go on strike,’ said Victoria University Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons.

‘The request for fees back was a clear sign that students, like staff, cannot afford to bear the brunt of the current under funding in tertiary education. Hopefully the government will take note and start resourcing institutions at sustainable levels,’ continued Fitzsimons.

‘The Vice Chancellor’s pledge that the savings from the strike will be passed onto students is welcome. Adequate and up to date library resources and improved staff students ratios would be a good place to start,’ continued Fitzsimons.

‘The University must make sure that the threat from staff to withhold exam results does not occur. Students just want to get on with research and learning, which is after all why we are at University,’ continued Fitzsimons.

‘The Students Association consider taking further legal action,’ concluded Fitzsimons.
