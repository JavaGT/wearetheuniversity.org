MEDIA RELEASE

Students cautious in praise of WINZ

At Victoria University today Tertiary Education Minister Steve Maharey released statistics showing the improved performance of WINZ in the processing of student loans and allowances over the 2001 enrolment period.

The Welfare Vice President at the Victoria University Students' Association Fleur Fitzsimons welcomed the improvement in the handling of loans and allowances. "WINZ certainly have done a much better job this enrolment period compared with last year. There have been fewer instances of students waiting for months for their loan or allowance to be processed as was the case the previous year" said Fitzsimons.

"However there are a number of students in Wellington who have experienced difficulties in dealing with WINZ, especially due to the lack of communication between WINZ Student Services and WINZ main offices" Fitzsimons continued.

"The Government needs to continue working to improve the culture at WINZ to ensure the attitude of staff is to help rather than hinder students in accessing their entitlements" Fitzsimons concluded.
