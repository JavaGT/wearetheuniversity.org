Victoria Students Win Eight NZU Blue Awards

Friday 1 July 2011 marked the 92nd New Zealand Universities' Blues Awards held at Wellington’s Intercontinental Hotel. During the ceremony eight Victoria University of Wellington students were presented with prestigious New Zealand Universities Blues Awards for their achievements during the 2010 academic year.

The awards provide an opportunity for University Sport New Zealand (USNZ) and its membership of students’ associations to officially congratulate those who excel at the highest level in their chosen sport, while also balancing life as a tertiary student.

Victoria’s supreme athletes and administrators recognised with NZU Blues Awards included: Derek Woolshere (Coach of the Year); Samantha Lee (Surf lifesaving) also nominated for Sportsperson of the Year; Gareth Kean (Swimming); Ella Edginton (Debating); Stephen Whittington (Debating); Sebastian Templeton (Debating); William Bishop (Fencing); and Michael Mercer (Fencing).

President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association Seamus Brady said that he was delighted with the outstanding and wide-ranging achievements of all the Victoria University winners.

“It demonstrates that students can combine competing at the highest level with academic study.”

The New Zealand Blues have been awarded since 1919 and are based on the traditional Blue of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, The awards have seen many famous faces recognised including Richie McCaw (Rugby), Cameron Leslie (Paralympics), Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell (Rowing), Danyon Loader (Swimming) and Jerome Ropati (Rugby League).

USNZ consists of 10 Universities’ students’ associations including VUWSA, who fund and support a wide-range of national sporting events including the annual University Games and the Snow Games.
