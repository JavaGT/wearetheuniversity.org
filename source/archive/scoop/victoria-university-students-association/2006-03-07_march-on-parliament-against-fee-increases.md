March on Parliament against fee increases
=========================================

Attention: Political and Education Reporters for immediate release (7 March 2006)

Victoria University Students to March on Parliament against fee increases

  
“Students will be marching to parliament on Thursday to demand an end to fee increases and an increase in funding to tertiary education” says Nick Kelly, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association.

“Fees at Victoria went up by 5% at the end of last year” says Nick. “We are also very concerned that Victoria has applied to the TEC for an exemption to the Fee Maxima policy which could result in a 10% fee increase for BA students.”

The march will be leaving the Victoria University Quad at 12noon, for an arrival at Parliament at 12:30pm. Chris Knox will be playing in The Quad from 11:30am.

“With student debt now hitting 8 billion dollars it is socially irresponsible to allow fees to keep increasing” says Nick. “The government has a responsibility to fund tertiary education properly and stop passing the costs onto students”.
