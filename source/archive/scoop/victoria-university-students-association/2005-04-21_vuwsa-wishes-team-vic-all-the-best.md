VUWSA Wishes Team Vic “All The Best”

Victoria University students are wishing Team Vic all the best for the New Zealand University Games said Shani Wikaira, Team Victoria Manager.

“Team Victoria has always done relatively well at University Games” says Wikaira. “We came fourth at the 2004 Games in Dunedin. This year’s 210-strong team is primed and ready for a week of intense competition.”

The 2005 New Zealand University Games are being hosted by the Auckland University Student Movement at AUT next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

“VUWSA is proud to support Team Vic and the 40 sports clubs on campus” says Jeremy Greenbrook, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association. “Without the tireless work of volunteers events like University Games simply wouldn’t happen”.
