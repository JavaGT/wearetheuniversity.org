Affordable Tertiary Education under Labour; Yeah Right!

  
With today’s announcement of a private savings scheme for tertiary education, Labour has written off the student vote in the upcoming election, according to Jeremy Greenbrook, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association.

“This savings scheme is fine – if you can afford it” says Greenbrook. “For those that can’t afford tertiary education now, this has simply moved the goal posts further back, entrenching inequities which already exist.”

“What about parents who have student loans themselves? How are they supposed to contribute to their children’s university savings?” said Greenbrook. “On top of student loan repayments, mortgage repayments, and retirement savings, they are lumped with yet another financial burden”.

“The Government should come clean and admit that they are not willing to adequately fund the tertiary education sector”.
