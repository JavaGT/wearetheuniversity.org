University Students To Freeze For Their Fees

Victoria University Students To Freeze For Their Fees

Victoria University students will brave the cold tonight as they begin the campaign against domestic tuition fee increases and farewell departing Vice-Chancellor Prof Stuart McCutcheon. A marquee has been erected in the Quad of the Kelburn campus, and a group of students intend to stay overnight to protest the excessive fees currently charged to both domestic and international students.

“Victoria increased fees last year by three percent, and we are concerned that a similar proposal will follow for domestic fees for 2005” said Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) president Amanda Hill today. “The Council also increased fees for International students earlier in the year to protect a valuable source of revenue”.

“Domestic and International students are joining forces this year to protest the continuing lack of government funding for Universities, and the profit-driven focus of the University Council” said Hill.

McCutcheon leaves for Auckland University at the end of the year, but not before making a recommendation to Council on the proposed level of fees for 2005.
