Support for students glaring omission from budget

Students are appalled by the omissions from the budget of any meaningful allocations to relieve the burden of debt that many students face or to address the costs of studying.

‘This year student debt hit $5 billion dollars and students are paying higher course fees than ever before. There was an expectation that this government would provide meaningful solutions but few are evident in today’s budget,’ said Victoria University Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons.

‘Students at Victoria University have to use a food bank and work more than ever before just to pay for their education yet this budget does nothing to resolve the problem,’ continued Fitzsimons

‘It is great that the government is looking to improve the funding framework and attempt to make institutions more collaborative and less competitive but there is little point if students can’t afford to study at them,’ continued Fitzsimons.

Students around the country are signing a petition to demand that the government introduce a universal living wage for students at the level of the unemployment benefit.

‘Hundreds of students at Victoria University have already signed the petition showing their determination that the government must take student support seriously’ concluded Fitzsimons.
