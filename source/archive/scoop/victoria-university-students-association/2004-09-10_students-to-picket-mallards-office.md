Students to Picket Mallard's office

Students to Picket Mallard's office

Yesterday the Victoria University Council allowed student fees to be raised by 4.5%. This has happened under a Labour government that promised when it came to power that it would "cut costs to students of tertiary education". The current fee maxima scheme allows tertiary institutions to raise student fees by up to 5% every year. At a time when student debt has reached 7 billion, it is not acceptable that this government has allowed tertiary institutions to raise fees any further.

Yesterday over 200 students were shut out of the Victoria University Council fee setting meeting, further exposing the undemocratic nature of the universities ruling council. Today's picket is to put the pressure back onto the government as they are the ones who have allowed this to happen, and also are the ones who are able to stop further increases.

The picket will be at Mallards electorate office on Jackson St Petone, and will start around 11am.
