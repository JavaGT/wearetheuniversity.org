Queer Students And Their Friends Show Support For The Civil Union Bill

UniQ, the representative group for queer students at Victoria University, in conjunction with their umbrella association VUWSA, will host a final show of support at Parliament tomorrow as the Civil Union Bill is voted on for the last time.

UniQ Co-President AJ Marsh invites all supporters of the Bill to come along and await the final vote, which should take place around 4.30pm.

“We encourage people to bring their lunch, enjoy the music and speeches, and play a little soccer in a queer and family friendly environment” said Mr Marsh today.

“While groups opposing the Bill may be considering a silent vigil, people who have not had legal recognition of their relationships have been silent long enough – we are confident the Bill will go through and it will be the culmination of many years of hard work by people who recognise the pre-eminence of human rights in New Zealand” said Marsh.

There will be music and speeches from 11.30am tomorrow, December 9th, on Parliament grounds.

ENDS
