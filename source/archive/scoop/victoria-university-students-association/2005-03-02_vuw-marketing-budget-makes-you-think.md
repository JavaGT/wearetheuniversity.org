VUW Marketing Budget “Makes You Think”

Victoria University spent an extra $200,000 of student money on marketing in 2004 compared to 2003, money needlessly raised out of increased student fees, according to Jeremy Greenbrook, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association (VUWSA)

“According to AC Neilson figures released by the New Zealand University Students’ Association, Victoria spent more that $895,000 on marketing in 2004. This includes $364,000 on television and $267,000 on newspaper advertising” said Greenbrook. “Research shows that very few students pay any attention to this sort of advertising.”

The NZUSA Income and Expenditure Survey 2004 showed that only 6% of students regard advertising as a major source of information when deciding where to study, favouring one-on-one course advice information received through high schools, course advise, and friends and family.

“Students are questioning the spending priorities of the management of Victoria University, and will not stand for a continuation of this level of spending in 2005” said Greenbrook.
