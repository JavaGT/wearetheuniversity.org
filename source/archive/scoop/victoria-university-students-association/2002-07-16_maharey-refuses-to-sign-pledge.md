Maharey Refuses To Sign Pledge
==============================

**Tuesday, 16 July 2002, 10:03 am**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

Steve Maharey today refused to sign a pledge that tens of thousands more students would receive allowances under a Labour led government despite commenting in response to a question from a student at Victoria University’s student bar that this would be the case.

Victoria University Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons presented Maharey with the pledge, but he would not sign it, claiming that signing it would imply he was lying.

‘Maharey said that ‘tens of thousands’ more students will receive allowances under a Labour led government. This is the most precise figure that he has given. Students wanted a written commitment from him that this would be implemented’, said Victoria University Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons.

The pledge read “I, Steve Maharey, pledge that tens of thousands more students will receive an allowance under a second term Labour government’.

‘It was disappointing that Mr Maharey was not willing to sign his name to something that everyone present heard him say. It seems the Labour Party are only into signed pledges when it suits them’ continued Fitzsimons.

‘Universal allowances are the number one issue for students this election. Labour cannot use the calling of an early election to justify not telling students how many more will be entitled to allowances’ said Fitzsimons.

‘Labour has to realise that a universal student allowance must be implemented immediately so that students are no longer the only people in society that have to borrow to live’ concluded Fitzsimons.
