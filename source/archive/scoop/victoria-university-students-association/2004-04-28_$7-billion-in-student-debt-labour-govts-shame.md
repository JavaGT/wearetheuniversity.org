$7 Billion In Student Debt: Labour Govt’s Shame

$7 Billion In Student Debt: A Labour Government’s Shame.

The pledge of a complacent Labour government for affordable education becomes hollow at noon today as total student debt hits $7 billion, says Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) president Amanda Hill.

“Labour has a last chance to act in the upcoming budget by delivering increased access to student allowances” Hill said.

“Only a third of students currently receive allowances, meaning they have to borrow to live from week to week. Wellington students have some of the highest living costs in the country, usually exceeding the $150 receivable under the loan scheme.”

“The only solution to this massive problem is a living allowance for all students. Debt cannot continue to grow at a billion dollars a year.”

“The New Zealand Government wants a knowledge economy, but refuses to adequately fund it. They have allowed institutions to increase fees and continue to administer a system that blatantly inflicts debt on an entire generation.”

“If Labour does not act, student debt will be a millstone around the necks of our children and grandchildren” Hill said today.
