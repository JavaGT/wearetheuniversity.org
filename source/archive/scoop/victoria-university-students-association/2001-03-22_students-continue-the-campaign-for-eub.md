Students Continue The Campaign For EUB
======================================

**Thursday, 22 March 2001, 4:14 pm**  
**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

Students Continue The Campaign For The Reinstatement Of The Emergency Unemployment Benefit For Students Over Summer.

Students continued to put pressure on the Labour Party to reinstate the Emergency Unemployment Benefit over summer.

Around 150 students marched to Parliament Grounds via the Labour Party offices on Willis St to raise public awareness of the issue and to put more pressure on the Labour/Alliance coalition government.

The march today was a continuation of the national action surrounding the Emergency Unemployment Benefit issue.

Members of the Victoria University Education Action Group will be doing a banner drop on Monday morning above the motorway to keep the EUB issue visible to the public.
