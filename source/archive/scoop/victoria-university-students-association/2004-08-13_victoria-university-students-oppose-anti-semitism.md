Victoria University Students Oppose Anti-Semitism

Victoria University students showed solidarity with the Jewish community as it passed the motion “That VUWSA condemn all forms of anti-Semitism and discrimination in New Zealand and around the world” at the weekly Student Representative Council last Wednesday.

A petition has also been available to students calling on Parliament to issue a similar statement condemning anti-Semitism and the recent attacks on Jewish graves in Wellington.

“Many students have been moved by the recent attacks to show support for the small Jewish community at Victoria” said Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) president Amanda Hill today. “It is unacceptable that this should occur, and it is the lowest form of desecration to interfere with graves as these people have done.”

There will be a meeting at the Newtown Community Centre tomorrow (Saturday) at 6pm to discuss ways to eliminate racism in our communities.
