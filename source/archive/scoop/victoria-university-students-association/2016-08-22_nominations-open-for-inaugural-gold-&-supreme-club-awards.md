Nominations open for inaugural Gold & Supreme Club Awards

**Nominations open for the inaugural Gold & Supreme Club Awards**

Now open to receiving nominations, the Gold & Supreme Club Award is the highest recognition Victoria University bestows upon students who have demonstrated leadership and success across cultural activities and clubs.

Two award-types, the Gold and the Supreme Club Awards are presented in partnership with Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) and Victoria University of Wellington.

The Gold Awards recognises students' cultural achievements while successfully progressing academic studies; and the Supreme Club Awards recognises clubs performance within the university community.

‘Until this year, Victoria was the only university left in the country that didn’t recognise outstanding clubs and cultural activities. If Victoria is to present itself as having a student experience second to none, then it must celebrate and support our 150-plus clubs on campus,’ says Jonathan Gee, VUWSA’s President.

Recognising the cultural successes and clubs across the university was something VUWSA discussed in the past, but it was VUWSA’s Clubs & Activities Officer, Tori Sellwood, who pushed the event over the line with the university, and made action.

‘I feel strongly that culture and clubs should be celebrated. We have exceptionally talented students at Victoria that excel in many different spheres, and it’s important to recognise their hard work,’ says Sellwood.

In addition to celebrating the cultural achievements, the Gold & Supreme Club Awards will recognise the many volunteers who give their time to clubs across the university.

‘The university has over 150 clubs that really enrich the student experience and provide students with practical, lifelong skills that can’t be learnt in the lecture theatre,’ says Sellwood.

‘Clubs are a foundation of the university community and the amount of time and effort involved and volunteered by students’ calls for celebration.’

In addition to having a select number of Gold Awards to give out for cultural and artistic performances, five Club Awards will be given out: Supreme Club of the Year, Small Supreme Club of the Year, New Club of the Year, Faculty Students’ Association of the Year, and Club President of the Year.

Students can nominate themselves for a Gold Award or their club for a Supreme Club Award. Those entering the Gold & Supreme Club Awards must meet the criteria for the award applied for.

Those who enter the Gold & Supreme Club Awards will receive an email after the nomination closing date of Friday 9 September at 5pm.

Successful candidates will then be invited along with two guests of their choice to the Gold & Supreme Club Awards ceremony on Thursday 6 October at Victoria University of Wellington’s Kelburn campus.
