University unfairly charging students for fee payment

Victoria University’s new fee for students who choose to pay their tuition fees each term is unfair, says student president Catherine Belfield-Haines.

“The University has introduced a charge of $45 for students who don’t pay their fees up front for the year,” says Belfield-Haines. “This charge goes against the spirit of the fee freeze, where institutions are supposed to hold costs to students in exchange for a funding increase.”

“University management are being mean spirited, and making it more difficult for students to save for their fees through part time work. Fees are high enough as it is without another extra charge for a legitimate payment option.”

The university has failed to communicate information about new fee payment regulations to students clearly. VUWSA has received many concerned calls from students and parents believing that all fees would have to be paid up front this year.

“We’re also unhappy with how this decision was made, and the lack of consultation with student representatives. The University made a surplus last year and there is no justification for this new charge,” said Belfield-Haines. “We will be arguing for this charge to be scrapped.”
