Students suffer under Labour government…still

Latest statistics from Studylink show that the number student’s eligible for a student allowance has continued to plummet.

Only 54,621 students received an allowance in the July to September Period, a 4,031 less than the same time last year. This is a 7% decrease.

This news comes a few weeks after Victoria University raised its domestic student fees by 5% across the board and 10% for humanities students.

Tomorrow the government is expected to pass in parliament its policy to scrap interest on student loans.

“While the government promises to give with one hand, it is taking with the other by letting fees increase and giving less students an allowance” says Nick Kelly.

With student debt hitting 8 billion dollars this year many students face a lifetime of debt. While students support getting rid of interest on student loans, this in itself is not enough.

“In 2006 students at Victoria will be campaigning for greater government funding for tertiary education” says Nick. “We want to stop the situation where students are forced to borrow to live and forced to pay ever increasing course fees”.
