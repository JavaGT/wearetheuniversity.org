New President At Victoria University Of Wellington Students’ Association

The new President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association (VUWSA) for 2004 is Amanda Hill. She is joined by Education Vice-President Jeremy Greenbrook and Welfare Vice-President Karen Price.

Amanda has completed a BA in English Literature and a Law degree.

“The VUWSA Executive will continue the long struggle to hold Labour to their promise of affordable education. This means a solution to the Loan scheme, which has now reached $6 billion, increased access to Student Allowances and lower institution fees” Hill said today.

Victoria students were often the most vocal in the country, and had participated with increasingly large numbers in rolling occupation and protest against fee rises in 2003, she said.
