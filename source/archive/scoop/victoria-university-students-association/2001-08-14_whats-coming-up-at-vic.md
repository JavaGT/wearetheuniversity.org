**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

The Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association has plenty of events coming up over the next few months, and we're keen to get as many people involved as we can, so please feel free to forward this email on to everyone you know.

Annual General Meeting Wednesday 15 August 2001, 12.30pm, University Quad As well as being presented with the Annual Report and appointing the auditors and solicitors for next year, this year's AGM has some exciting resolutions on the agenda for discussion. Education Vice-President Nick Henry has put forward a resolution to re-create the Student Representative Council, which was a huge part of University life back in the 60s and 70s, and student Neale Jones has put forward resolutions to make the position of Salient Editor elected rather than appointed. We'll also be debating an increase in the levy for 2002, and some other minor constitutional tidy-up motions.
