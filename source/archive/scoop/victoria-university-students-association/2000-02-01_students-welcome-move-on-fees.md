Students Welcome Move on Fees
=============================

**Press Release: [Victoria University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Victoria_University_Students_Association)**

![VUWSA web site](http://www.vuw.ac.nz/vuwsa/graphics/newlogo.gif)The recent move by the government to decrease fees for students studying dentistry at Otago University has been welcomed by students up and down the country today.

Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association President Chris Hipkins said the decision signalled a positive change in direction for the tertiary sector.

"Under National fees continued to sky-rocket, under Labour and the Alliance we have seen fees decrease for the first time in almost a decade. It's hard not to feel positive," Mr Hipkins said.

"The high cost of tertiary education is one of the biggest barriers to participation, and if the new government are committed to reducing fees they will have our full support,

"This decrease in fees for dentistry students is a big leap in the right direction, but obviously we urge the government to go further. Students studying Arts, Law, Commerce and Science also deserve a break, and we look forward to seeing the new government commit to these areas in the near future," Mr Hipkins concluded.
