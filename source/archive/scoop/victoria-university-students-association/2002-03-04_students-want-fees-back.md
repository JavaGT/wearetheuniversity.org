Students Want Fees Back
=======================

Hundreds of students at Victoria University have filled out forms requesting their fees back from University Management for classes called off because of the staff strike scheduled to take place on Monday 4th March.

“The Students’ Association and the Vice Chancellor’s office have been inundated with students producing forms requesting fees back for classes they will miss as the staff strike looks set to go ahead,” said Victoria University of Wellington Students’ Association President Fleur Fitzsimons.

“Students are aware that the University will not being paying staff when they are on strike and believe that it is only fair that the savings are passed on to students,” said Fitzsimons.

“Students suffer when Universities cannot attract and retain high quality international academic staff because of uncompetitive salaries. While tomorrow’s strike will inconvenience students, there is support for increased salaries and improved working conditions” said Fitzsimons.

“The request for a refund is a clear message to government that students cannot afford to bear the brunt of the current under funding of tertiary education. Urgent action is required to remedy the situation,” said Fitzsimons.

“The government has done numerous reviews of the situation in tertiary education. It is obvious that all the fancy lingo and glossy documents need to be coupled with a tangible commitment to the future of tertiary education. Such a commitment can only be met with increased funding for institutions,” concluded Fitzsimons.
