Students March Today At 12 From Victoria University Of Wellington Quad

Students are marching today from the Victoria University Quad down to Parliament to protest for the reinstatement of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit for students over summer.

The march leaves at 12pm and heads to Parliament grounds via the Labour Party offices on Willis St.

After some short addresses to the crowd a picnic will be held to celebrate the end of yet another "summer of starvation".
