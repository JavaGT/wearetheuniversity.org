Victoria University Students and Staff to March
===============================================

Victoria University Students and Staff to March on Parliament

  
Hundreds of students and staff will be braving the cold weather and marching on Parliament this afternoon in protest of the dire state of tertiary education, says Jeremy Greenbrook, President of the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association.

“Students are sick of the government endorsing fee increases” says Greenbrook. “At the same time, New Zealand academic staff are still amongst the lowest paid in the OECD.”

The march will be leaving the Victoria University Quad at 12:30, for an arrival at Parliament at 1pm. Chris Knox will be playing in The Quad from 12:00.

“The Government has to step in and adequately fund tertiary education” says Greenbrook. “Only then will they get the ‘Knowledge Economy’ they so desperately want”.
