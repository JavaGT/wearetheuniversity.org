Box City - 8 August 2007

The Education Action Group announces that a Box City will be built in the Quad, Kelburn Campus at midday on Wednesday 8th August 2007.

Come and show your concern for rising accommodation costs by joining in and making your own box bedroom. Some materials provided, be creative and bring some of your own to spice things up. Even Architecture and Design students are most welcome, with prizes for best impromptu residence.

"Let's show the Government that we mean it when we say that the accommodation supplement is not enough, and that more students need more help to keep a roof over their heads." Said Campaigns Officer Tai Neilson
