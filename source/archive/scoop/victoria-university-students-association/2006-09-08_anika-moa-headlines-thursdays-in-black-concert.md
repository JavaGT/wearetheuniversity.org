Singing Out against Rape and Violence:  
Anika Moa headlines Thursdays in Black Concert

  
The Women’s Group of Victoria University Students’ Association (VUWSA) will be re-launching the Victoria University 'Thursdays in Black' campaign against rape and violence, by holding a concert on Thursday 14th September.

"Wearing black on Thursdays is a gesture of solidarity for all women, men and children who are outraged by the incidences of rape and violence that happen in our communities", said VUWSA Women’s Rights Officer Caroline Prendergast.

“By attending this concert, and supporting the Thursdays in Black campaign, our community is able to stand up and say no to rape and violence.” Prendergast said.

‘Thursdays in Black’ is a nation-wide campaign aimed at raising campus and community awareness about issues such as rape, sexual abuse, discrimination and violence. ‘Thursdays in Black’ is a student initiative administered nationally by the New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) and the Tertiary Women’s Focus Group (TWFG).

“The campaign focuses on ways that the individual can challenge attitudes to rape and violence in our community. It targets the existing social taboos associated with rape and domestic violence and states that they are not acceptable in our society.” Prendergast explained.

“Bringing an end to rape and violence in our community involves everyone – women, men and children. We hope people from across the community come out and enjoy some music in support of this most important of causes,” Ms Prendergast concluded.
