Media Release 4 April 2006

Universities Welcome Future Directions Announcement

Universities have welcomed today’s announcement by Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen on future funding directions as a positive step towards differentiating the tertiary education sector on the basis of distinctive contributions.

NZ Vice-Chancellors’ Committee chair Professor Roy Sharp says the universities’ distinctive contribution to the tertiary education system is research-led degree teaching, postgraduate provision and research itself.

As the representative body for the country’s eight universities, the NZVCC views the move to multi-year funding for tertiary education as a positive development, giving institutions more predictability for their planning on a year-to-year basis.

“The NZVCC agrees with the minister on the need to keep compliance costs in any changed funding formula to a minimum. Universities are also pleased to see a continued endorsement of open access to tertiary education,” Professor Sharp says.

“The course set for the future direction of tertiary education in New Zealand by today’s announcement represents a major step forward and universities are keen to enter dialogue on how they should be funded so their distinctive and important contributions to national economic and social goals are maximised.”
