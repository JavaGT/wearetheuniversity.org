Rhodes Scholars Elect for 2010

Thomas Hills, Alice Irving and Richard Stebbing have been selected as Rhodes Scholars following a selection meeting at Government House in Auckland yesterday.

Tenable at Oxford University, Rhodes Scholarships constitute the pinnacle of achievement for university graduates wishing to pursue postgraduate study at one of the world’s leading universities. In this country, the awards are administered by the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee.

Thomas Hills has been studying at the University of Otago’s Dunedin and Wellington campuses. He was awarded the 2008 Fowler Scholarship for Top Overall Fifth-Year Student in the MB, ChB programme at the Wellington School of Medicine, University of Otago. In 2007, Thomas received the Charles Hastings Medal for Excellence in Medicine and the McGraw-Hill Award.

At Oxford, he intends studying for an MSc in Integrated Immunology leading to his eventual goal, a DPhil programme. Once his studies are complete, Thomas plans to return to New Zealand to train as a specialist. His experience to date includes participation in the 2008 Rural Medical Immersion Programme run by the University of Otago and a 2009 medical elective in Zambia.

Active in sport, Thomas enjoys marathon running and plays premier grade club cricket. Born in New Plymouth, he attended Francis Douglas Memorial College where he was a prefect and house captain.
