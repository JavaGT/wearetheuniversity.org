Export education contribution detailed

The contribution of export education to New Zealand's economic prosperity has been detailed by Infometrics economist Adolf Stroombergen writing in The Dominion Post and The Press. The provision of education to foreign fee-paying students had experienced impressive growth, rising from just over $500 million in 1999 to $2.2 billion in 2004. While the number of foreign fee-paying students had fallen since 2003, the export education industry still managed to generate about $2.3 billion of foreign exchange in 2007-08. Of that, an estimated $70 million came from overseas provision which included delivery of teaching at foreign locations, distance delivery through electronic means, sales of curriculum and learning materials and educational consulting and advisory work.

The export education industry's contribution to New Zealand's GDP was estimated at about $2.1 billion, supporting more than 32,000 fulltime equivalent jobs. On average

foreign fee-paying students spent $6500 on tuition fees and $17,600 on living costs such as accommodation, food and travel. In terms of fulltime equivalent students, universities constituted the industry's largest sector. University students were also the biggest source of foreign exchange earnings, contributing around a third of the total. China remained the most significant source of foreign fee-paying students, accounting for 24,800 out of a total of 91,300. South Korea was next with 17,900.

Though the immediate prospects for global growth were pessimistic, the fundamental driver of demand for export education was the desire for English language education and for degrees from English-based universities, coupled with the increase in size of the economic middle class in countries such as China and Brazil.

"In the medium to long term, the growth in demand for export education will be strong. New Zealand needs to secure its share through the delivery of a high quality product in terms of the total education experience - formal qualifications, student living conditions, cultural activities and personal safety. The export education industry deserves our support," Mr Stroombergen wrote.
