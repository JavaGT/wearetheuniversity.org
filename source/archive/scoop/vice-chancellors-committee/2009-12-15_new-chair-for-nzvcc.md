Media Release  
15 December 2009

New Chair for NZVCC

Auckland University of Technology Vice-Chancellor Derek McCormack has been appointed for a two-year term as chair of the New Zealand Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, the body that represents the interests of the country’s eight universities.

Mr McCormack will take up the post in January and takes over from Lincoln University Vice-Chancellor Professor Roger Field who will serve as deputy chair of the NZVCC for 2010.

On accepting the position, Mr McCormack noted that the next couple of years would be a critical time for universities. NZVCC would be working with government to ensure the university sector was able to continue to provide the opportunities and outcomes that New Zealand and New Zealanders needed and expected from it.
