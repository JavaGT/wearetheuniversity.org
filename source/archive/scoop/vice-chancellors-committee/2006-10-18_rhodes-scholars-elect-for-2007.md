Rhodes Scholars Elect for 2007

Luke Fenwick, Eesvan Krishnan and Holly Walker have been selected as Rhodes Scholars following a selection meeting at Government House in Wellington last night.

Tenable at Oxford University, Rhodes Scholarships constitute the pinnacle of achievement for university graduates wishing to pursue postgraduate study at one of the world’s leading universities. In this country, the awards are administered by the NZ Vice-Chancellors’ Committee.

Luke Fenwick is a University of Canterbury graduate who has completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with first class honours. A former prefect of Middleton Grange School, he played for the First XV and continues to coach rugby and play at a senior level. Luke’s academic focus on history has seen him awarded eight scholarships in his tertiary career to date, and he was instrumental in establishing the European Society at Canterbury; a social network for history postgraduate students. Since 2005, Luke has been involved in volunteer youth work with the Spreydon Youth Community and Cashmere High School. He is currently completing his masters thesis which concentrates on the social history of faith communities in the Thuringian region of Germany following WW1. Luke would like to expand on this theme for his DPhil at Oxford.

Eesvan Krishnan holds a BCom/LLB(Hons) conjoint degree from the University of Auckland. He was recently appointed as a Judge’s Clerk to the Chief Justice. Eesvan was a prefect and house captain when he attended Macleans College. His contribution to school life was acknowledged in 2000 when he won the prestigious Boys All-Rounder Cup. During the final two years of his degree, Eesvan worked as a student volunteer on the case of Algerian refugee Ahmed Zaoui. His work initially involved assisting Mr Zaoui’s lawyers with research, then branched out into raising public awareness of the case. Eesvan and some contemporaries launched the Equal Justice Project, a voluntary organisation which provides free legal representation and advice to Auckland residents. At Oxford, Eesvan will pursue a BCL and then undertake an MPhil (which he hopes to pursue under Professor Andrew Ashworth) in human rights law; particularly involving issues of access to justice. Eesvan plans to return to New Zealand to work as a criminal defence lawyer and hopes eventually to gain an academic position.

Holly Walker holds a BA in political science and English with first class honours from the University of Otago. She is currently working as a media officer for the Green Party. Holly grew up in Wellington and attended Hutt Valley High School where she was Deputy Head Girl and a prefect in her final year. At Otago, Holly worked as a volunteer and staff writer for the student magazine Critic, becoming editor in 2005. She has also been heavily involved in debating, representing New Zealand in Malaysia in 2005 and gaining a debating blue in 2004. At Oxford, Holly intends undertaking an MPhil in development studies with a focus on post-colonial debate. The MPhil is a two-year taught degree incorporating a 30,000 word dissertation. Holly will return to New Zealand to a career in journalism, academia or politics.
