Saudi Arabian Students To Enrich NZ Universities

The New Zealand university system is looking forward to the first arrivals of Saudi Arabian students studying here under a scholarships scheme, the chair of the NZ Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, Professor Roy Sharp, says.

Tertiary Education Minister Dr Michael Cullen announced today that Saudi Arabia had nominated more than 300 students to apply for study in this country under the expanded King Abdullah scholarships programme for Asia and Oceania.

The NZVCC represents New Zealand’s eight universities which expect applications from at least 350 Saudi Arabian students at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels for the current academic year.

Professor Sharp says the OECD thematic review report of New Zealand tertiary education released this week noted that this country was one of the leading exporters of tertiary education in the world.

“This Saudi Arabian initiative is further recognition of the quality of New Zealand university education. As the OECD report states, international education not only benefits the economy and society but also the universities themselves through new academic perspectives, cultural contexts and an enriched learning environment.”
