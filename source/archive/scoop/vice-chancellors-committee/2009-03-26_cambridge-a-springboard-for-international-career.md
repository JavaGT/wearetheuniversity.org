Cambridge Seen As Springboard For International Career

Cambridge University is the next challenge for outstanding scholar, thespian and sportsman Tom Elton following his selection as the Girdlers’ Scholar for 2009.

The former Westlake Boys High School pupil is currently studying at the University of Auckland, having won a scholarship to attend that institution, and will fulfil a long-held ambition to study economics at Cambridge when he takes up his Girdlers’ award later this year.

Tom sees that ambition as pivotal to his career aspirations which centre on global business consultancy. The recipient of a NZ Qualifications Authority Outstanding Scholar Award in 2007 while still at year-12 level, he achieved A grades in all his Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) including “top in New Zealand’ results in three subjects and a “top of the world” result in a fourth..

Administered by the NZ Vice-Chancellors’ Committee, the Girdlers’ Scholarship is funded by the Worshipful Company of Girdlers which traces its foundation back to medieval times as a craftsmen’s guild. The award is worth a minimum of £20,000 and enables a “distinguished New Zealand school pupil” to undertake a degree course at Cambridge’s Corpus Christi College.

As the 45th Girlders’ Scholar, Tom hopes to contribute fully to extracurricular life at Cambridge, having already played rugby at 1st XV level, captained a school cricket team in a successful tour through the Netherlands and United Kingdom, competed in swimming events at national level since the age of nine and played lead roles in school dramatic productions, including Maurice Shadbolt’s Once on Chunuk Bair.

He has gained insights from a number of former Girdlers’ Scholars – including Albert Bollard – which have heightened his determination to gain rewards from the rigorous Corpus Christi learning environment – “only at Cambridge could I study economics at a level without parallel in the world”.
