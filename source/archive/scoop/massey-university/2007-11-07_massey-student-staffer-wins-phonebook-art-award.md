The etch will feature on the cover of next year's Manawatu telephone book.

Ms Jamieson, who is also studying public relations part-time at Massey, has a Bachelor of Architecture from Victoria University. The foundation is a charitable trust that funds and supports projects enabling excellence in the delivery of teaching and research at Massey.

Ms Jamieson is also an artist, specialising in print making. Her winning entry is currently exhibiting at Hang Ups Gallery in Russell St, Palmerston North, in an exhibition based on the life of Wilkie Mardon and his sister Winifred, Virginia's grandmother.

Exhibition images include a family flaxmill at Rangiotu, the local school and local marae Te Rangimarie. Ms Jamieson says she imagined the lives of the Mardon youngsters at Rangiotu and reflected on the past eight years when she has been resident in the Manawatu.

Ms Jamieson spent seven years working with exhibitions and special projects in the museum and art sector, including at Te Manawa from 1999 to 2005. A printmaker since 2004, she is an active member of the Central Print Council of Aotearoa New Zealand, recently being involved in the 'Endangered Species' poet-printmaker project exhibited and auctioned at Bowen Galleries, Wellington. She illustrated Greg O'Brien’s poem 'Where You Stand'.

An etching involves zinc metal plates covered in a waxy substance called hard ground, into which the artist draws a reverse image. After being dipped in an acid bath the zinc reacts, forming grooves in the surface of the plate. Ink is then applied to the surface and cleaned off leaving residue in the grooves. The image is transferred to paper through a printing press.

Ms Jamieson believes hers is the first etching to feature on one of the 18 regional telephone books. The Yellow Pages Group Art Awards is one of New Zealand's largest original art competitions and has been held annually since 1990.
