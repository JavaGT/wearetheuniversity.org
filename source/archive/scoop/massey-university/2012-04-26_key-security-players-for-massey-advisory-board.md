**Key Security Players For Massey Advisory Board**

A new high-level advisory board will provide strategic guidance to Massey University’s Centre for Defence and Security Studies, potentially shaping the future of New Zealand’s security sector.

The heads of a number of government departments are on the board, which held its first meeting in Wellington today (Thursday April 26).

Nick Nelson, acting director of the Centre for Defence and Security Studies, says the board was formed to provide strategic advice to the centre.

While the University has academic expertise, it wants to draw on the significant professional knowledge and experience of the board to develop programmes “that meet New Zealand’s needs in the contemporary international security environment”.

Mr Nelson says the advisory board will provide direction on teaching, research and developing programmes as well as providing leadership and management guidance to the centre.

“This is a significant initiative that will be of considerable benefit in shaping New Zealand’s education and research in security studies, a rapidly emerging and hugely important field of academic study.”

Massey University’s Professor Ingrid Day, the Vice-Chancellor’s representative on the board, says the board, established by the centre, would bring together an outstanding group of professionals who all make a significant contribution to New Zealand’s security.

“The advice they will provide to the University will be of immense benefit and will ensure that the newly established security studies programme remains both relevant and highly credible.”

Security Intelligence Service director Dr Warren Tucker is the advisory board chair and agreed it was an important step for the security sector.

“The establishment of this board is an important initiative designed to provide the professional guidance necessary to ensure the new programmes Massey offers not only meet the academic needs of its students, but also the needs of the various agencies involved in security within New Zealand,” Dr Tucker says.

“Given the potential this board has to shape the future defence and security sector for New Zealand, I am delighted to have been invited to chair it.”

The board will meet twice a year.

The advisory board comprises:

Dr Warren Tucker (chair) Director, Security Intelligence Service  
Peter Marshall, Commissioner of Police  
Lieutenant General Rhys Jones, Chief of Defence Force  
John Allen, Chief Executive of Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade  
Maarten Wevers, Chief Executive of Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet  
Carolyn Tremain, Chief Executive and Comptroller of Customs  
Professor Ingrid Day, Assistant Vice-Chancellor Academic and International, Massey University  
Nick Nelson, Acting Director, Centre for Defence and Security Studies, Massey University
