Centre links with Malaysian university

After a worldwide search, Massey’s Centre for Defence Studies has been chosen to collaborate with a leading Malaysian university on research and teaching.

The centre has signed a memorandum of understanding that will see it work closely with the National Defence University of Malaysia.

Centre director Professor Glyn Harper signed the agreement last month with Vice-Chancellor of the Malaysian university Lieutenant General Dato’ Pahlawan Hj Zulkifli bin Hj Zainal Abidin.

Professor Harper says the agreement will involve the two universities working together in a variety of ways.

“We’re looking to collaborate on postgraduate studies for academic staff and explore other areas of research,” he says. “Also, we will look into forming a joint masters programme in strategic and defence studies along with other forms of academic co-operation.”

Being chosen to partner the Malaysian university is recognition of the high regard in which the Centre for Defence Studies is held, Professor Harper says.

“The Malaysian university undertook a worldwide search for partners, so to be the first to sign an agreement such as this is a great endorsement of what we’re doing here.”

Professor Harper travelled to Malaysia to sign the memorandum of understanding.

The centre offers the Bachelor of Defence Studies, a unique programme that is the only one of its type offered in New Zealand. Subjects include military history, command/leadership, logistics, tactics, military technology, international relations, military law and the law of armed conflict.
