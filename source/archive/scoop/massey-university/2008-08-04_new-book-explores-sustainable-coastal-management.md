New book explores sustainable coastal management

  
An ecological approach to managing coastlines and oceans is required to ensure their resources are sustained, according to a book released this week.

Ecological Economics of the Oceans and Coasts is edited by Associate Professor Bruce Glavovic, from the School of People, Environment and Planning, and Professor Murray Patterson from the New Zealand Centre for Ecological Economics at Massey University.

Dr Glavovic says the book explores fresh ways of managing oceans and coasts.

“Oceans are the last frontier on earth but we’re currently exploiting them like they’re a limitless resource. Marine ecosystems are under huge pressure and it’s not sustainable.”

He says ecological economics approaches coastal management with a fresh perspective.

“We’ve tended to use an economic model that ignores nature’s limits as we have exploited marine resources in the past, but here we are bringing ecology and economics together in an integrated approach to ocean and coastal management. The focus is on sustainability.”

The book addresses key issues relevant to the New Zealand context, but contributors include scholars and practitioners from across the world, Dr Glavovic says.

The book is a product of the New Zealand Centre for Ecological Economics, a partnership between Massey University and Landcare Research.

Dr Glavovic is also an editor of another book about to be released. Integrated Coastal Zone Management also looks at real-world experience and innovative ways of managing coastal zones, presenting case studies from around the world including many Asian countries, Africa, North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and island nations.

Ecological Economics of the Oceans and Coasts will be officially launched at Landcare Research at 4pm on Tuesday 5 August.
