Iguaçu tops Hospitality Association Awards

Auckland’s Iguaçu restaurant collected top awards at the New Zealand Hospitality Association Awards, held last week in Wellington.

Co-owner Julie-Ann Bell (Massey MBA, 2005) said she and partner Phil are “pretty chuffed” with the awards.

The competition included both restaurants and hotels. Judging was undertaken by an independent panel who visited premises unannounced on three separate occasions.

Iguaçu won HANZ awards for Best New Zealand Restaurant, Excellence in Customer Service, Best Lamb dish and to top it off, the HANZ 2007 Supreme Overall Winner.

Ms Bell said one of her first moves after buying Iguaçu in 2005 was to create a staff training programme, bringing in expert tutors and preparing a blueprint based on advice from the Hospitality Standards Institute.

“It was all about customer service and communication. That means looking after people from the moment they walk in until they leave the restaurant. It means taking a constructive approach to any complaints: if someone isn’t happy with their food, our staff replace it immediately. It also means understanding that all customers are different in their expectations and needs.”
