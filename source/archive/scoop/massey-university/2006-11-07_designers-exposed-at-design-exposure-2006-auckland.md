New Generation Designers Exposed at Design Exposure 2006 Auckland

An amphibious disaster recovery vehicle, a next generation offroad skateboard, a hydroplane to break the world water speed record, an electrically powered car, a range of household cleaning products designed for men, an ergonomic hydration system designed to enable athletes to train for longer, a biometric airport check-in kiosk, and a chair made from recycled waste paper are just a few of the exhibits to be revealed this month at the Design Exposure 2006 Auckland exhibition.

Design Exposure showcases the best in design from Massey University Auckland Design School’s graduating students. It includes work from the School’s transport, industrial and visual communication design programmes.

Massey’s Auckland Design School Regional Director, Azhar Mohamed encourages the public to come along and view the designs, some of which have already been commissioned for production and commercialisation by the private sector.

“This is a rare opportunity to see the best of Kiwi ingenuity and innovation from our upcoming designers - people who will take New Zealand to the global stage. With world-class abilities they are destined for success in the international market,” says Mr Mohamed.

Design Exposure is open to the public from Tuesday 14 November to Thursday 16 November inclusive, from 10am to 6pm (Tuesday and Wednesday) and 10am to 1pm (Thursday), at The Britomart Pavilion, 47-69 Tyler Street, Auckland.

The exhibition features prototypes and scale models of the students’ designs and admission is free.

Massey University’s School of Design is the oldest design school in the country and the Auckland campus’ focus on yacht design is unique. It is the only design institution in the world to offer such a specialty and has been recognized by the Royal Institute of Naval Architects.

Mr Mohamed says the School of Design is working with government and industry to ensure its designers leave university with the skills and experience necessary to make real contributions towards New Zealand’s competitive edge in the international sector.

“This year’s graduating students have produced exceptional work and we’re delighted to have the opportunity to share it with the public,” says Mr Mohamed.
