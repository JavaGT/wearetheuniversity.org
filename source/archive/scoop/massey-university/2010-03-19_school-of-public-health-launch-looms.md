**School of Public Health launch looms**  

Confronting the biggest health issues faced by New Zealand societies is the basis for the University's new School of Public Health that will be officially launched in Wellington on Wednesday.

The school encompasses five research centres that are at the forefront of increasing expertise and understanding of the impacts of alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, non-communicable diseases such as asthma, industrial and occupational diseases and cancers, as well as health issues that impact most severely on particular populations groups, such as Maori and Pacific Islanders.

The centres all focus on research but also provide supervision for doctoral students and others seeking postgraduate qualifications. They are:  
The Social and Health Outcome Research and Evaluation Centre, known as the SHORE Centre, led by Professor Sally Casswell and based in Auckland.  
Te Ropu Whariki, led by Dr Helen Moewaka Barnes, also based in Auckland.  
The Centre for Public Health Research, led by Professor Neil Pearce, based in Wellington.  
The Sleep/Wake Research Centre, led by Professor Philippa Gander, based in Wellington.  
The Research Centre for Maori Health and Development, led by Professor Chris Cunningham, based in Wellington and Manawatu.

Associate Professor Cindy Kiro, a former Children’s Commissioner and previously a Massey public health researcher who specialises in health policy and social determinants of health, is heading the school.

Dr Kiro says public health research plays a crucial role in addressing major health problems including cancer, asthma, respiratory infections and health inequalities.

“Massey University’s school is based on different disciplines working together to improve our understanding of health and prevention of disease.”
