Renewal of international accreditation for veterinary graduates

The University’s veterinary science programmes’ international accreditation has been renewed for a further seven years. This enables Massey-trained vets to practice in New Zealand, Australia, Britain and North America.

A recent visit by representatives of American and Australasian veterinary professional bodies to the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences in Palmerston North has resulted in a full pass and a glowing report.

Institute head Professor Grant Guilford says the American accreditation, in particular, is crucial to the University’s $4 million per year full-fee paying veterinary programme.

The combined delegation consisted of 12 leading veterinarians from the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Veterinary Schools Accreditation Advisory Committee of the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council. They checked compliance with a set of international standards relating to organisation, finances, admission policy, curriculum, facilities, faculty, student care, learning resources, clinical resources, research and outcomes assessment.

The delegation also conducted interviews with senior University management, institute staff, undergraduate students, postgraduate students, alumni and employers. Their report focuses on the strengths of the programme and makes a small number of recommendations. Points of strength identified include:

\- The recent upgrades to the equine/farm services clinic, the large animal teaching unit and the microscopy teaching spaces. The plans for further upgrading of current facilities are commended and encouraged.  
\- The collaborative research between AgResearch and IVABS in the new Hopkirk Institute, and the opportunity to improve postgraduate recruitment.  
\- Support for international students and the mentorship program.  
\- The range of online and electronic resources available to students and the impact of computer-aided learning.  
\- The availability of healthy cattle, sheep and horses and the access to large animals to students who need further handling experience.  
\- The participation of students in the teaching hospitals and their involvement in client communication.  
\- Strong support by students for their learning experience, particularly the approachability and care by staff.
