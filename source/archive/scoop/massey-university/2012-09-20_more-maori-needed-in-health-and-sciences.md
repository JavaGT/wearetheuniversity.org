More Maori needed in health and sciences

There is a dire need to encourage more Maori into health and science fields, says Massey School of Public Health head Associate Professor Cindy Kiro (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Hine).

Next week up to 200 Maori students are expected to attend a “Maori into Health and Sciences Day” at Massey’s Albany campus. Dr Kiro says the event is a step in the right direction.

“It’s a great initiative and we need to have more like these throughout the country to assist Maori to get into health and science related careers.”

Dr Kiro says there are high demands for qualified Maori in these fields, which will only increase in future.

“Iwi and Maori communities have signalled these areas as being important, so we know there is future workforce demand among Maori organisations but there is also strong mainstream and international demand.”

Dr Kiro says it is an exciting time to move into the industry, and to study health at Massey. “There is huge scope to work with Maori patients and their whanau in new, innovative ways and make a difference.”

Massey’s new College of Health will be established in January 2013, and take a fresh approach to the complex issue of health by focusing on wellness, promoting healthy lives and preventing disease, illness and injury.

The School of Public Health, Institute of Food Nutrition and Human Health, School of Health and Social Services, School of Sport and Exercise and the School of Nursing will form the new college.

Massey University will host the Maori into Health and Sciences Day event in conjunction with MITE (Maori into Tertiary Education), and other MITE partners at the Albany campus on 27 September, An expo will feature exhibits from health and science fields, and Maori students will speak with experts.
