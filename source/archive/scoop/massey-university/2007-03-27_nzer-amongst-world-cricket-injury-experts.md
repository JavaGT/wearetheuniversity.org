New Zealander amongst world cricket injury experts

Sport injury expert Darryl Cochrane will represent New Zealand at an international congress in Barbados timed to coincide with the World Cup series.

Mr Cochrane, a Massey University lecturer in sport management, is being sent to the World Congress on Science and Medicine in Sport by Cricket New Zealand. Apart from his research on sport injuries, Mr Cochrane has also had practical experience working with the Black Caps as a fitness trainer during the Commonwealth Bowl series in Australia earlier this year.

He will report back to Cricket New Zealand on fresh information on sport in injuries delivered at the conference. “We have a particular interest in injuries to fast bowlers,” he says. “It has become a big concern. They are the players most prone to injury, largely because of their workload as well as the nature of their conditioning and physical training.”

He says the workload for fast bowlers is now heavier, with an increase in international and one day matches, leaving them less time to turnaround after what may originally be a minor problem. “A niggle gets neglected, becomes rose and turns into an injury.”

He says the sport has also become harder, faster and more vigorous. “In the days of, say, Richard Hadlee, the game was still played hard – but certainly not as frequently.”

The congress will be held in Bridgetown, Barbados from 4 to 7 April, just before the Super 8 series in the Cricket World Cup. It will feature sport science and medicine experts, physiologists, researchers, coaches and administrators from the major cricket playing nations.
