Massey joins forces with Singapore Institute of Technology

Massey welcomes a new collaboration with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) to provide a jointly awarded honours degree programme in Food Technology.

From 2008-2015, Massey delivered and awarded the Bachelor of Food Technology (Honours) from a base at Singapore Polytechnic. Massey will now partner with SIT to jointly deliver our internationally-recognised Food Technology honours degree programme, beginning in September at SIT’s Dover campus.

Representatives from SIT including its President, Professor Tan Thiam Soon, yesterday visited Massey’s Manawatū campus, where the new partnership was officially signed.

Distinguished Professor Harjinder Singh says, “We are extremely pleased to partner with SIT to jointly deliver our flagship programme to Singaporean students. We look forward to delivering a unique, high calibre qualification that provides multidisciplinary, comprehensive training and education for excellent careers in the food industry."

The SIT-Massey University programme focuses on food product technology, combining food science, food engineering and food business. The programme educates and equips students with the fundamentals of food science and applied food technology skills required for global careers in the food industry. Students learn in the classroom and in practical laboratory and workshop sessions that focus on industry problems and solutions, as well as obtaining hands-on experience in industrial-standard food processing plants.

Students have to complete 28 weeks of an Integrated Work Study Programme (IWSP) and will undertake real work and acquire experience in food manufacturing companies. In their final year, students will complete a research project on food technology as well as complete a food product development project.

Pro Vice-Chancellor of Massey’s College of Health Professor Paul McDonald says finding ways to increase the production and distribution of nutritious and safe food over the next century in Asia and other world markets is one of the most significant problems in the world today. “Massey has one of the world’s best programmes in food technology and the largest group of food innovators in the southern hemisphere.

“We are delighted to work with the Singapore Institute of Technology, a university with a growing list of world-class programmes led by superb academics in outstanding facilities. This agreement will enable SIT to join Massey as a leader in food technology and help Massey expand its international  
partnerships and impact.”

  
SIT Deputy President (Academic) and Provost, Professor Loh Han Tong says the food industry both in Singapore and globally, is expanding by leaps and bounds. “The demand for better-tasting food is now coupled with demand for better access to high quality foods that are also healthy. With the growing focus on health and wellbeing through food consumption, countries are looking for new ways to add value to raw products whilst tackling productivity and cost issues. This has led to an increasing demand for better-qualified, well-trained food technologists within the food industry.

“I am confident the SIT-Massey University joint degree programme in Food Technology will empower our graduates and place them on an exciting pathway, leading to a wide variety of professions in the food industry with opportunities to further their studies in postgraduate research.”
