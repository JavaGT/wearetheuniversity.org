**School of Design number one in the Asia-Pacific**

Massey University’s School of Design, based in Wellington, is now ranked number one within the Asia-Pacific region by global design award agency Red Dot.

It’s a rapid rise for the school, which is part of Massey’s College of Creative Arts - five years ago the school was placed 11th in the same rankings.

The latest ranking confirms Massey’s School of Design as a leader in teaching design with further evidence provided by the 12 Red Dots awarded to staff and students at a gala function in Singapore last night.

An internationally recognised quality label for excellent design, Red Dot recipients are selected by expert juries in the areas of product design, communication design and design concepts. The ranking is determined through tracking and measuring the success of universities in producing exciting new concepts over the previous five years.

The ranking saw Massey’s School of Design outclass similar institutions across the Asia-Pacific including in Australia, China, Japan and Singapore.

College of Creative Arts Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Claire Robinson says the ranking is verification of the University’s excellence in design.

“This is a massive achievement for the institution and the individual designers who have showcased their creativity, innovation and designs on the international stage,” Professor Robinson says.

A study of the economic contribution of design to the economy, launched last month by DesignCo, a New Zealand design consortium, shows it contributes over $10 billion – or 4.2 per cent of GDP. The study and the importance of recognition like Red Dot Awards highlights the rise and rise of design, using a 21st century understanding of what design is, she says.

“The creative potential exemplified by the ranking, and the designs awarded Red Dots, provides a great future for New Zealand’s capacity to embrace innovation that brings benefits to all parts of society,” Professor Robinson says.
