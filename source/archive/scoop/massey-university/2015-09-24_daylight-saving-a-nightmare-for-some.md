Daylight saving a nightmare for some

**Daylight saving a nightmare for some**

It’s that time of year again, when our clocks go forward an hour, the mornings plunge back into darkness, and insomnia ensues. For many, the welcome sunny evenings are plagued by restless nights and lost sleep.

So what can you do to keep your internal clock on time? Dr Lora Wu, a research officer at Massey University’s Sleep/Wake Research Centre, says even though the amount of sleep lost during daylight saving seems small, it can have a big impact. She says large studies overseas have shown in some countries an increase in the number of motor vehicle accidents following the time change.

Dr Wu says, “Daylight saving challenges your internal timekeeper, the circadian clock. Your circadian clock does not automatically shift with daylight savings, so it can take some time to recover.

“Springing forward is harder than falling back in time. It is easier to fall asleep and wake up later than it is to fall asleep and wake up earlier each day. It will likely be harder for night-owls to adjust, which means it can be tough on teenagers and young adults.”

Here are some tips to help you before and after the clocks are changed:

\- Try to get a lot of natural sunlight exposure when you first wake up in the morning.

\- Avoid bright lights in the evening (including light from TVs, computers, and mobile devices).

\- Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening.

\- Don’t use alcohol as a sleep aid.

\- Give yourself extra time for travel. A lot of sleepy drivers on the road is never a good thing.

\- Bring your bedtime and wake-up times forward by 20 minutes per day for the day before, during, and after daylight saving to give yourself time to adjust.
