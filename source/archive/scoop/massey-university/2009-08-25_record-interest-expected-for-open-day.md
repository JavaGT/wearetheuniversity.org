**Record interest expected for Open Day**

Massey’s Wellington campus is gearing up for record numbers of visitors for its Open Day this Friday as national demand for university enrolment continues to grow.

The University's Manawatu campus had its biggest-ever Open Day earlier this month, with prospective students coming from throughout New Zealand. The economic downturn is driving up enrolments faster that expected as job numbers shrink.

Massey is noticing enrolments are up both from school leavers and mature students either wanting to retrain after losing work or up-skill part time or extramurally while working.

At the end of last month overall student numbers were up 5 per cent on the same time last year to 35,240, while the Wellington campus has had a 12 per cent in students to 4500.

At least 1500 visitors are expected on Friday to find out more about the programmes offered. Four of the University's five colleges have courses at Wellington – Business, Creative Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, and Sciences.

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says Open Day gives prospective students the opportunity to experience first-hand he exciting and innovative things that happen at Massey every day. “Here in Wellington, masterpieces are crafted in our Schools of Design, Fine Arts and Music at the same campus that creates midwives, nurses and leading business researchers.”

Open Day highlights will includes lectures on the designer’s and engineer’s role in building the Hulme Supercar, presentations from staff in departments including nursing and exercise science and Vex robotic displays.

Wellington regional chief executive Professor Andrea McIlroy says a major benefit is the campus' proximity to the central city and easy access to a wide range of cultural, sporting, entertainment and leisure activities. “Open Day is our way of introducing you to the possibilities for your future education and careers," Professor McIlroy says. "Our staff and students are available to discuss your interests, academic programmes, potential careers and student life.”

There will be entertainment as well as information, with art competitions and live music. Guided tours, including rides between different campus sites on quadricylcles, will also be a feature of the day with activities running from 8.30am till 3.30pm.

The Albany campus Open Day is on September 12.
