New Generation Designers Exposed at Exposure 2005 Auckland

An amphibious craft, a transforming kayak and futuristic sports cars are just a few of the exhibits to be revealed this month at the inaugural Exposure 2005 Auckland exhibition.

Exposure showcases the best in design from Massey University Auckland Design School’s graduating students. It includes work from the School’s transport, industrial and visual communication design programmes, with a focus on transport design - the only tertiary design programme of its kind in New Zealand.

Massey Design School’s Auckland Acting Regional Director, Azhar Mohamed encourages the public to come along and view the designs, some of which have already been commissioned for production and commercialisation by the private sector.

“This is a rare opportunity to see the best of Kiwi ingenuity and innovation from our upcoming designers - people who will take New Zealand to the global stage. With world-class abilities they are destined for success in the international market,” says Mr Mohamed.

Two of the students exhibiting have received international recognition in Europe and in the United States for their designs.

Exposure is open to the public from Tuesday 15 November to Friday 18 November inclusive, from 10am to 5pm each day, in the atrium of the Vero Centre, 48 Shortland Street, Auckland Central.

The exhibition features scale models and prototypes of the students’ designs and admission is free.

Massey’s School of Design is the oldest design school in the country and its focus on yacht design is unique. It is the only institution in the world to offer such a specialty and has been recognized by the Royal Institute of Naval Architects.

Mr Mohamed says the School of Design is working with government and industry to ensure its designers leave university with the skills and experience necessary to make real contributions to prospective employers.

“This year’s graduating students have produced exceptional work and we’re delighted to have the opportunity to share it with the public,” says Mr Mohamed.

Exposure 2005 Auckland : Preview

Exposure showcases the finest projects from three specialisation programmes: Transport Design, Industrial Design and Visual Communication Design.

Previewed below are eleven designs from the large body of work that will be on display, including ‘Fan Personal Computer’, ‘Lighting Projects’, ‘Thermal Blanket’ and  
‘Durt Thumper’. High resolution images can be downloaded from http://www.studioahoy.com/Exposure2005/

Flyte (pic below) is a transforming Kayak designed by Melissa Bornholdt. It was designed to fulfil the needs of demanding water enthusiasts who expects more out of a medium-sized, transportable kayak. Melissa intends to commercialise Flyte following the exhibition.

A New Zealand company well regarded internationally, Sealegs International Ltd, sponsored design student Matt Gibson towards his amphibious craft Anaconda (pic below).

At 6 metres in length, Anaconda is a compact, rugged amphibious craft meant for recreational purposes and also suitable for professional marine police and navy applications. Anaconda will go straight into production following the Big Boys Toys Expo and the Exposure show.

Early this year Jay T was the only finalist from Australasia in the prestigious Michelin Design Award at Detroit’s North American International Auto Show, in the company of automotive firms such as Daimler-Benz and Opel.

Jay T is exhibiting PSV (pic below), a fuel-cell compact sports car. PSV was designed to be environmentally friendly yet sporting a young, sleek image ready to paint the town red!

Fusion (pic below), a Jaguar crossover vehicle designed by Jay Hoon Lee, is a compact sports car designed for the young and the young-at-heart. Following the tradition and design of the E-type Jaguar, Fusion blends the latest in technology and compact practicality, yet putting the car within reach of younger, urban-centred drivers. This is truly the younger sibling of the XKR series.

Young One (pic below) is a multifunctional rigid inflatable tender designed by Brendon Sweeney. Through rigorous testing of the concept, Brendon developed the design to fulfil the requirement of discerning pleasure yachts owners who demand an equally impressive tender. Young One, designed and developed using the latest hydrofoil testing software is ready to go for production.

Following New Zealand’s international reputation in super-yacht building, Max Zhang’s design Azimut SS (pic below), a 40 m pleasure yacht caters for the need of international clients demanding the best in design and craftsmanship. Azimut SS offers unparallel luxury for a yacht in its class by offering elegantly appointed interior and the most up-to-date level of specifications.

Thermal Blanket (Tania Ball, Industrial Design)  
"Thermal Blanket" is a self-enclosed emergency tool for trampers and rescue organisations. It provides hypothermia victims with warmth and protection from extreme elements.

Durt Thumper (Ben Thomsen, Industrial Design)  
Durt Thumper is an off-road, man-powered “snowboard on wheels”. The design, which was proven through a working test-rig, is meant for enthusiastic outdoor lovers.

Wheelie Scooter (Tommy Ng, Industrial Design)  
The Wheelie Scooter is a fun scooter meant for advanced users to perform tricks. It is also ideal for students travelling to and from schools, allowing pedalling or coasting.

Fan Personal Computer (Danny Wilson, Industrial Design)  
The personal computer was designed to be stylish, modular and portable without sacrificing the desktop-feel and function. The main unit clips to the base and the screen opens up like a hand fan.

Lighting projects, Industrial Design

The design was based on a brief “From plane to volume” where all designs must be manufactured out of a single sheet of plastic and use the minimum amount of fastening.

These designs and many more will be on show at Exposure 2005 Auckland
