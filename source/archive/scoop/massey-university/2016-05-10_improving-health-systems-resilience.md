**Improving health systems’ resilience**

Thursday marks International Nurses Day – the annual celebration to mark the contributions nurses make to society around the globe, as well as commemorating the birthday of one of the world’s most famous nurses, Florence Nightingale, born in Italy on May 12, 1820.

This year’s theme is Nurses: A force for Change: Improving health systems’ resilience. The International Council of Nurses has celebrated this day since 1965.

Professor Jenny Carryer from Massey’s School of Nursing says as health systems all over the world report difficulty in sustaining service delivery levels, amid rapidly increasing global demand for registered nurses, nursing has never been a more vitally needed profession.

“Nurses and nurse practitioners make the difference to keeping people out of hospital through their presence in all communities across New Zealand, and their partnerships with people from birth to death.

“In hospitals nurses strive to make the intolerable, tolerable and to ensure that wherever possible people are restored to health and wellbeing as quickly as possible. In all settings nurses partner with people to ensure their safety, comfort and dignity through all health challenges,” she says.

Associate Head of School Dr Mark Jones notes the Massey nursing programme spans a three-campus undergraduate program in Auckland, Manawatū and Wellington, and a large postgraduate programme including doctoral students. “As a multi-campus university, we have a relationship with many District Health Boards and provide students with a wealth of clinical practice experiences alongside their academic journey.”
