Teen robotics wizards to compete for US event

Tech-savvy teenagers from around the country will unleash their specially designed robots in a New Zealand Vex robotics competition at the Albany campus on Friday and Saturday.

The two best teams will be able to compete in the world championship in Dallas, Texas, next month.

The competition involves 31 teams of six pitting their remote-controlled creations against each other to complete tasks in the fastest time.

Started in the United States, Vex robotics has been gathering momentum in New Zealand since being launched by the University's School of Engineering and Advanced Technology at Albany last year.

The teams come from 18 schools, including Mt Albert Boys’ Grammar School, Northcote College, Rangitoto College, Glenfield College, Kristin School, Albany Senior High School, Takapuna Grammar School, Edgewater College, Westlake Boys’ High School, Westlake Girls’ High School, Avondale College, Lynfield College, Auckland International School, Rutherford College, Onehunga High School and home school teams in Auckland, as well as two teams from Palmerston North Boys’ High School and one from Nelson College.

Sponsors for the competition are New Zealand Trade & Enterprise, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, FedEx Express, Smales Farm, Glidepath and The Edge radio.

Beyond the fun, excitement and fierce competition of robotics contests is a deeper philosophy aimed at promoting education and skills in the areas of technology, science, engineering and mathematics, as well as critical life skills such as team work, project management and problem solving, says Dr Johan Potgeiter, senior lecturer in Mechatronics, Engineering and Industrial Management.

“We want to foster the notion of gracious professionalism,” says Dr Potgeiter, the competition convener. “It’s an important concept encompassing cooperation, collaboration and respect alongside competition. It teaches how you conduct yourself when you work as a professional engineer.”

He says the competition provides a learning pathway for school pupils who are keen on science, maths and engineering but are not sure of study and career opportunities in these areas. Massey engineering student volunteers have played a crucial role in running the competitions, providing mentoring and helping school teams design, build, test and operate their robots.

The University aims to offer the competition to 280 high schools throughout New Zealand over the next three years. The international championship is expected to draw 2000 students comprising 200 teams from 13 countries.
