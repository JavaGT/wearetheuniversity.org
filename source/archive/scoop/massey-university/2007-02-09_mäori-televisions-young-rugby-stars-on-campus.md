Mäori Television’s young rugby stars on campus

The makers of one of Mäori Television’s most successful programmes, School of Hard Knocks, have returned to Massey University’s Palmerston North campus to produce a second series.

School of Hard Knocks follows the progress of three promising young Mäori rugby players as they participate in the International Rugby Academy’s annual high-performance players course at the Sport and Rugby Institute. The three-week course exposes about 30 teenage players – usually two from each position – from throughout the world to some of the best New Zealand and international coaches and former players. They include current All Blacks coaches Graham Henry and Steve Hansen, former Wallabies and current Queensland Reds coach Eddie Jones, and greats of the game such as Frank Bunce, Grant Fox, John Eales, Richard Loe, Sir Brian Lochore, Sean Fitzpatrick, Nick Farr-Jones and John Kirwan.

The academy, headed by former All Black Murray Mexted, is in its sixth year of operation at the Sport and Rugby Institute, where it offers courses for coaches, managers and players. Mäori Television broadcast eight episodes of School of Hard Knocks last year, the final of which was its highest-rating programme since the channel’s inception, according to Head of Programming Larry Parr.

This year’s series has been increased to 10 episodes, Mr Parr says. “We were very happy with the way it went. It was something we funded ourselves and took a punt on.”

Mäori Television paid the $7500 fee for each of the three players, Matenga Baker from Otaki, Ariki Henry from Omaio and Turoia Kuka from Tauranga. All have followed similar paths in their plans to become rugby professionals. Mr Henry (Te Whänau a Apanui), 19, a second five-eighth, who has just finished Rotorua Boys High School and three seasons in the 1st XV, says the academy is “awesome” and the SRI facilities “probably the top in New Zealand”. He played for the Bay of Plenty Academy team that came to Palmerston North last year to play the last year’s international academy team. “The coaches are top too – you can’t get better.”

Mr Kuka (Ngäi Te Rangi),19, now living and studying in Auckland, plays prop and also spent three seasons in the 1st XV at Kings College, Otahuhu. Last year he was in the Auckland Rugby Union Academy.

Mr Baker (Ngäti Toa, Ngäti Raukawa and Te Atiawa ki Whakarongotai) is an openside flanker who played three seasons for Otaki College 1st XV, two as captain.

After a comfortable win over the Manawatu Academy on Wednesday, the players will build up to a much tougher challenge next Thursday when they take on Wairarapa Bush, the winners of the inaugural Heartland Championship Meads Cup (second division) last year.

School of Hard Knocks will screen on Thursday nights at 8pm from 7 June. Caption: Matenga Baker, Turoia Kuka and Ariki Henry at the Sport and Rugby Institute.
