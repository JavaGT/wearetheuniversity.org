Info and enrolment evenings on campus this week
===============================================

**Info and enrolment evenings on campus this week**

Finding out the courses on offer, uncovering scholarship opportunities and demystifying the enrolment process are just three key reasons for attending the information evenings on Wednesday and Thursday this week at the Auckland campus.

Student recruitment advisor Rebekah Walker says it’s also a great opportunity to speak with prospective lecturers and find out the wide range of study options available.

“It can be quite daunting looking at all the options on offer while you’re at home or at school, so holding these information evenings is a chance for people to come along and find out about the subjects that interest them. Education is such an important component in people’s lives – and we want to help you make the most of your potential study,” she says.

“We have found that speaking face-to-face with people who can demystify the enrolment process also helps cut down the anxiety that can arise with unfamiliar systems. We understand the process, and are happy to help and answer questions.”

The information evenings start at 6pm in the Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatres on May 13, starting with design, business, arts and introducing the new Bachelor of Commercial Music.

On May 14, the sciences, agriculture, engineering and health programmes feature, with overviews on everything from Agribusiness to Zoology.

Parking is free on campus and there is no need to register to attend.
