**C.K. Stead presents his poetry at Writers Read**

One of New Zealand’s best-known authors, C.K. Stead, is guest speaker at the first event in Massey University’s 2013 Writers Read series, at Albany on March 27.

The distinguished poet, novelist, scholar, critic and Emeritus Professor at Auckland University, has a career spanning more than 50 years.

Professor Stead will be reading from and discussing his most recent work: his new book of poems _The Yellow Buoy: Poems 2007 - 2012_, published last month, and the novel _Risk_, which was published in late 2012.

He has published numerous books of poetry, essays and literary criticism, as well as 12 novels and two books of short stories. His _Collected Poems 1951-2006_, published by Auckland University Press, appeared in 2008. A memoir of his early life, _South West of Eden_, appeared in 2009.

Professor Stead’s lecture will be held in the Round Room of the Atrium Building on Wednesday March 27, starting at 12 noon. It is free to anyone wishing to attend.

Writers Read is an annual series of readings by some of New Zealand’s foremost authors, with events held on all three Massey campuses in Auckland, Palmerston North and Wellington. Sponsored by the School of English and Media Studies, the Palmerston North City Library and the Office of the Campus Registrar, Wellington, the series started as a partnership with the Palmerston North City Library eight years ago.
