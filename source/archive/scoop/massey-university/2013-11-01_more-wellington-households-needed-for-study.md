**More Wellington households needed for study**

The future of the Wellington region and how locals feel about it is currently being explored in a new study by Massey University and University of Waikato researchers – and they’re looking for more households to interview.

The Nga Tangata Oho Mairangi study is funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and led by teams from the two universities.

The Wellington research is being conducted by Phillipa Gaines, and she is looking for 12 households of two or more people to interview face-to-face. She wants to hear their views on what is happening in the region, the changes taking place, and the challenges and opportunities they present.

The study aims to investigate the impact of demographic and economic changes in the Wellington region, and hopes to provide a detailed model of the nature of these changes, and also make projections about future changes out to 2036.

Research manager Dr Trudie Cain has already visited the West Coast and Southland regions for the study, and says they are looking forward to hearing what Wellingtonians have to say so they can compare residents’ perspectives.

“We are looking for a broad range of people and households – working age or retired, longstanding Wellington families or new migrants, tertiary students or unemployed, for example. We want to find out what their perceptions are about life in Wellington, what opportunities they see, why people move to the area – why they move away – and what would make young people stay.”

Dr Cain says Wellington is a region of economic and historical significance, and the information gathered from these interviews will help future planning for the Wellington region.

Wellington is one of five regions examined in the study. The other regions are Auckland, Christchurch, the West Coast and Southland.
