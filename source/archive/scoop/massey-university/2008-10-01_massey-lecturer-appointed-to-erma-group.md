Massey lecturer appointed to ERMA group

Senior lecturer Dr Nick Roskruge (pictured) has been appointed to the Environmental Risk Management Authority’s Mäori Advisory Group.

Ngä Kaihautü Tikanga Taio is a statutory committee that advises the authority on Mäori issues and applications made to it that raise significant issues for Mäori.

Dr Roskruge's appointment will be for a term of three years. “It is a compliment to be appointed to the committee and the work will give me an opportunity to contribute at a higher level on issues of national importance," he says.

“As well as bringing the elements of expertise in horticulture, resource management and genetic technology to the table, I expect it will be knowledge of tikanga \[customary knowledge\] that is the strength of the group,” he says.

Dr Roskruge, based on the Palmerston North campus in the College of Sciences' Institute of Natural Resources, is also involved in several research, government and non-government groups concerned with vegetable production, Mäori land utility and soil systems.
