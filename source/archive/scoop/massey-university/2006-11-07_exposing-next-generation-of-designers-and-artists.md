Exposing the next generation of designers and artists

WELLINGTON – The College of Creative Arts is gearing up for its annual celebration of New Zealand’s next generation of designers and artists. Graduating students’ finest work will be on show at Exposure 2006.

The Wellington campus hosts an invitation-only launch on Friday (10 November), after which Exposure will be open to the public until 19 November. Admission is free.

Fine Arts exhibits will be located in Blocks One and Two. Galleries on the third floor of the Museum Building will be given over to an exciting and diverse range of exhibitions covering advertising, digital media, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, fashion design, performance design, illustration, and photography.

Exposure is open on weekdays 9am–7pm, and weekends 10am–4pm.

Fashion students have their big night at the popular end-of-year fashion show, Blood Sweat and Shears, in the Museum Building on 18 November. See http://exposure.massey.ac.nz/
