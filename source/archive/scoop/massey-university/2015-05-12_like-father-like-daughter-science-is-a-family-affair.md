Like father, like daughter – science is a family affair

**Like father, like daughter – science is a family affair**

Female scientists may be a rare breed, but two Massey graduates are bucking the trend, following in their father’s footsteps as they graduate on the same stage where their fathers are seated.

Laura Schwerdtfeger, daughter of Distinguished Professor Peter Schwerdtfeger, and Dr Mirjam Guesgen, daughter of Professor Hans Guesgen, graduated today with a Bachelor of Veterinary Science and a Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology respectively.

Miss Schwerdtfeger says there was no question about her chosen career, which started when she brought animals home to care for as a young girl. What is surprising to her is that she now works as a rural production animal veterinarian at a practice in Franklin.

“I wasn’t brought up on a farm at all. I’m a city girl brought up in Auckland. But that’s what I love about my new job – I love the learning side of things, learning from farmers and other vets.”

This drive to continue learning was instilled by her father, she says. “My dad is a scientist himself so he always encouraged me to have an inquisitive mind. Whether I wanted to go down the research side of things or the clinical path is something I had to decide along the way.”

Professor Schwerdtfeger, 2014 Rutherford medal winner, acclaimed scientist and leader of the Centre for Theoretical Chemistry and Physics at Massey University, says it means the world to him to see his daughter graduate.

“I am terribly proud of my daughter, she has done incredibly well, being on the Dean’s list twice in her studies. Massey University also has one of the best vet schools in the world. She told me many times about the outstanding lecturers she had and the high level of teaching she experienced,” he says.

This will be the second time Miss Schwerdtfeger graduates from Massey University. She completed a double major in physiology and zoology prior to starting her veterinary degree.

Like Miss Schwerdtfeger, Dr Guesgen’s passion for science was fostered by father. She fondly remembers occasions where her father would visit her school and talk about science.

“I remember the whole class being so engaged and almost in awe – even the ones that usually skived off during class! He also used to let me come with him to university during the school holidays. I knew that’s where I wanted to be. He is so inspirational and was also a great sounding board when I was doing my research.”

Although both keen scientists, their fields of study couldn’t be more different. Professor Guesgen’s research involves designing ‘smart environments’ – spaces that are seamlessly interwoven with sensors and computational elements, while Dr Guesgen investigated emotion in animals for her doctoral thesis, and how the social environment affects pain behaviour of lambs.

Both work at the University. Professor Guesgen is the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology’s computer science chair and Dr Guesgen as the university’s science communications adviser.

“I really enjoyed studying zoology and being in the academic environment but I also really enjoy communicating science to the public,” Dr Guesgen says. “I want to get other women interested in science and the way I can do that is by showcasing the amazing, wide-ranging research that’s going on.”

Professor Guesgen says he is puzzled as to why more young people are not interested in pursuing a career in science. “New Zealanders are known for their ingenuity – it comes naturally to them,” he says.

“I am definitely happy with Mirjam's choice of going into science. It will take her places and give her the opportunity to make a contribution to the world.”

He says that with the internet, the opportunities are broader than ever before. “Just think about it, nowadays knowledge can be shared almost instantaneously and at little cost, so every result you produce can be accessed by a large number of people. Which other products can be distributed that easily?”

Both young women hail from Germany – Miss Schwerdtfeger from Stuttgart and Dr Guesgen from Bonn – but now call New Zealand their home.
