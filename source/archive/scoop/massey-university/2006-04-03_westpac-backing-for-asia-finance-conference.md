Westpac backing for Asia Finance Conference

Westpac will be the major sponsor of the most prestigious finance conference ever held in New Zealand.

The Asia Finance Conference will be held at the Carlton Hotel in Auckland from 9 to 12 July this year. It will be hosted by Massey University in partnership with the influential Financial Management Association, the largest finance practitioner and academic group in the United States.

The conference also marks the annual meeting of the Asian Finance Association which represents academic researchers with an interest in Asian finance.

The head of Westpac Institutional Bank New Zealand David Mclean says Westpac's support of the conference, hosted by such a well-respected institution as Massey University, presents a very natural and exciting synergy for the bank.

"Westpac provides a range of financial services to New Zealand  
and Australian businesses operating in the corporate, institutional,  
government and semi-government markets. Business in the Asian region is  
becoming ever more important for our clients.”

The organisers, Professor Lawrence Rose from the University’s Department of Commerce and Associate Professor Martin Young from the Department of Finance, Banking and Property, have also announced a second international key note speaker for the conference.

The organisers have already scored a coup by securing Nobel Prize winner William F. Sharpe as the first keynote speaker. Professor William F. Sharpe was one of the architects of the model that financial markets now use to value shares and other financial assets.

The second keynote speaker, Professor Mark Flannery, teaches corporate finance and financial management of financial institutions in the graduate finance programme at the University of Florida. His research interests include government regulation of the financial sector and asset pricing. Yale and Princeton educated, he is also a visiting professor at a number of universities, including the London Business School.

Professor Rose and Associate Professor Young have confirmed that academics and practitioners from 27 countries will be contributing to the conference, in the form of research papers or as speakers.

The conference content is tailored to match the interests of both researchers and practitioners: Associate Professor Young says the first day will be of particular value to practitioners.

In the run up to the conference, the organisers say they have been greatly helped by the Institiute of Finance Professionals New Zealand, the pre-eminent professional industry body for the financial and capital markets in New Zealand.
