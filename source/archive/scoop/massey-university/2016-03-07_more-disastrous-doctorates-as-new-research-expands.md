More ‘disastrous doctorates’ as new research expands

**More ‘disastrous doctorates’ as new research expands**

Damaging natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones and tsunami that have hit the Pacific Rim in recent years have also led to an increase in postgraduate students studying emergency management – and presenting their research in an annual workshop.

Known as Disastrous Doctorates, the workshop from March 8-9 is coordinated by PhD students for PhD students and provides a forum for them to engage with each other in their respective research projects.

Event coordinator Miles Crawford says when the event started in 2007 it only had a handful of students, but now features more than 40 doctoral students from New Zealand and Australia representing nine different academic institutions.

“This year it’s been expanded to two days and is a great opportunity to share experiences with other students from around the country and Australia.”

The event coincides with a week-long short course programme hosted by Massey’s Joint Centre for Disaster Research that provides a theoretical and practical introduction to selected topics in emergency management.

“With large emergencies, like the recent Cyclone Winston in Fiji to the on-going earthquake sequence in Christchurch, there is an increased demand across sectors to better understand the social, physical and infrastructure impacts of these disasters,” Mr Crawford says.

“This increase means more researchers are needed to try and tackle some of the very complex issues regarding disasters. Disastrous Doctorates is a place where doctoral students can meet each other, learn about future career options and discuss the intersections between practice and research.”

Some of the research being discussed includes the merits of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act and the agency CERA created to enact its regulations; how children have coped in the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes, spiritual response to natural disaster in Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands and the use of video games as a tool to foster interest in learning about disasters.

Other activities include a three-minute thesis presentation for all attendees and panel sessions. Students will also have an opportunity to engage with researchers and practitioners from Massey University, GNS Science, the Earthquake Commission and other international organisations about post-PhD career options, gaining valuable tips on surviving and thriving in a PhD programme.

Disastrous Doctorates receives generous support from the New Zealand Earthquake Commission; all New Zealand-based Ph.D. students studying outside of Wellington have received scholarships to attend the workshop.
