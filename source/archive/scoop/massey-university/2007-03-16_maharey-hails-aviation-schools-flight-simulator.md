Maharey hails Aviation School’s new flight simulator

Education Minister Steve Maharey says he decided this morning that operating the Massey School of Aviation’s new flight simulator was likely to be the most exciting thing he did today.

He wasn’t disappointed.

Mr Maharey cut the ribbon, declared the Frasca Truflite simulator “open” then climbed into the cockpit and took off.

The simulator, at the School’s Milson Flight Systems Centre at Palmerston North Airport, is probably the most high-tech available with any New Zealand aviation training provider.

Modeled on the interiors of the Piper Seneca V and the Piper Warrior it offers controls with actual "feel", accurate and realistic high quality Instrumentation, a high fidelity sound system, and, most importantly, a visual display system that provides 170 degrees of horizontal view, enabling pilots to look out of the side window. It has the capability to simulate various weather conditions, as well as day and night conditions.

Mr Maharey described it as “a very auspicious day. You are now looking at a mature relationship between Aviation and the University.”

He said a lot of people had doubted the validity of having an aviation school in a University environment, but the decision had proved correct.

“Massey has been the cutting edge institution in New Zealand in taking in areas that have traditionally been outside the university environment..”

The Vice Chancellor, Professor Judith Kinnear, said the acquisition of the new simulator met an identified need in pilot training and was indicative of Massey’s ongoing commitment to quality education and training programmes.

The school’s general manager, Captain Ashok Poduval, says the Frasca is "an excellent training device and a giant step in enhancing the quality of aviation education and training within the Bachelor of Aviation programme.

“The School now has the capability to add a new dimension to their training – a module for training students in multi-crew co-operation competencies to bridge the gap and enable smooth transition from single pilot light aircraft operation to the multi crew air carrier environment.”
