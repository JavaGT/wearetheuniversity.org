Creative arts festival nears lift-off

Opening the night after Guy Fawke’s, the University's creative arts festival BLOW 2010 is a sure fire way to end the university year with a bang.

From November 6-20, the College of Creative Arts in Wellington and Albany will offer an intriguing variety of events featuring art, fashion, music and especially design.

The festival includes exhibitions, screenings, performances, workshops and public lectures, continuing a tradition of excellence that has cemented itself on the public consciousness. Since 2007 the festival has showcased the talents of staff and students as well as international visitors.

College Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Sally Morgan says the festival has become a popular forum for creative practitioners to network with each other, contribute to the learning environment and support the next generation of creative talents entering into the design and art industries.

Highlights this year include an interactive entertainment conference, a controlled cacophony of sound called Musicircus, everyday objects converted to a different use in the Surplus and Creativity exhibition, lectures on robotics and the ever-popular BLOW fashion show in which the work of graduating fashion design students is proudly paraded.

BLOW adds Blast to its line-up this year too. This forum offers a series of design events that promise a wealth of provocative ideas and debate for design practitioners, commentators and the wider public. International speakers at Blast include design critic and editor of Britain's Eye magazine, John Walters.

The next generation of artists and designers will also be making their presence felt at the annual Exposure Exhibition by graduating students, now running throughout the two weeks of the festival to enable more opportunity for the public to see their innovative work

The festival foreshadows a still bigger year of celebration next year, when the college celebrates 125 years of art and design education. It traces its history back through the Wellington Polytechnic School of Design to the first School of Design established in 1886.

This heritage has enabled Massey to induct nine artists and designers to its College of Creative Arts Hall of Fame, including Sir Richard Taylor from Weta Workshop, artist John Drawbridge and fashion designer Kate Sylvester. Three new inductees will be named later this month.
