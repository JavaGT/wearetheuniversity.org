**New book tackles potato chemistry**

A new book brings together for the first time leading research on the chemistry and technology of the potato.

Advances in Potato Chemistry and Technology is edited by Massey University and Riddet Institute scientists Dr Jaspreet Singh and Dr Lovedeep Kaur.

The role and importance of chemistry in determining the processing quality and nutritional value of potatoes is presented for the first time in this single volume recently published by Elsevier-Academic Press (USA).

Dr Singh says that until now there has been a gap in the literature relating to potatoes. “Other books have focused on biology or agronomy, but this book collects the latest work on the technology and chemistry of the potato.”

Its major focus is on recent information related to carbohydrate and non-carbohydrate composition, cell wall chemistry, analysis of glycoalkaloids, phenolics and anthocyanins, thermal processing and quality optimisation, new and sophisticated methods of quality determination of potatoes and their products, potato starch characteristics and its modification, and the nutritional value of potatoes.

“It has some very interesting chapters,” Dr Singh says. “One is written by a scientist from NASA that explores the potential of potatoes in space exploration. There are other chapters that look at novel applications and non-food uses of potatoes and recent developments in post-harvest storage.”

The project has been two years of work for Dr Singh and Dr Kaur, who reference leading researchers from around the world.

The book is aimed at food scientists, chemists, nutritionists, agronomists, upper-level undergraduate and graduate students and food industry professionals working with potatoes.

Dr Singh’s research interests are focused on the characterisation and utilisation of future generations of carbohydrates and he currently leads several projects on starches and cereals at the Riddet Institute, including the Taewa (Maori potato) project, aimed at developing unique snack products and chef-ready products. In 2006, Dr Singh was awarded the early College Research Award by the University in recognition of his research.

Dr Kaur has also worked with the Maori potato group and is currently working on a project looking at the kiwifruit enzymes to see if they assist protein digestion.
