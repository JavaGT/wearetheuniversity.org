Funky “FudgeBall” design nets $2000 scholarship

  
Designs for a silicon sink plug and a “FudgeBall” funky correction tape dispenser helped industrial design student Blake Richardson win this year’s Macdonald Scholarship.

Mr Richardson, 20, received the award on the Wellington campus yesterday. It was presented by its sponsors, geophysicist Peter Macdonald and his wife Doris.

The award, worth $2000, is given annually to a third-year School of Design student majoring in Industrial Design who has achieved high academic and technical standards in year-two of their studies.

Mrs Macdonald has extensive connections with the tertiary education sector and Mr Macdonald a strong interest in the development of New Zealand design and technology. In 1995 they established a trust fund to provide the scholarship.

“We particularly wanted the scholarship to support high achieving students during the middle stages of their degree studies,” says Mr Macdonald.

Mr Richardson designed a range of products including a silicone sink plug, perfume bottle, and FudgeBall, a “funky” correction tape dispenser. He thanked Mr and Mrs Macdonald, described the award as “awesome” and said he would invest the money in his further studies.
