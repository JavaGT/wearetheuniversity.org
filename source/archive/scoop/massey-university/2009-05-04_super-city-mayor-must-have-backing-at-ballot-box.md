Super City Mayor must have backing at ballot box

A local government specialist says the powerful role given to the first Mayor of Greater Auckland means there is a need to rethink the current electoral system.

Dr Asquith, a senior lecturer in the Department of Management and International Business at the University's Albany campus, has raised concerns about the first past the post electoral system, which produces winners who may be supported by quite small minorities of voters.

He says unlike those who currently wear mayoral chains, the Auckland mayor will have real executive power and a new voting system should acknowledge that.

Dr Asquith supports the single transferable vote system - where voters rank candidates with a number in order of preference - and is keen for a public education programme about the merits of this system, which is seen as more complex. Nationally, eight councils use STV out of 73.

“We need to ensure that the person elected as Auckland mayor has indeed the support of the voting populace,” he says. “Under the present system in New Zealand, we have a system of weak mayors. Our mayors are, in fact, powerless...other than some have a casting vote in council if a vote is tied. All a mayor can do is to persuade, cajole or plead with their council to act according to the mayor’s agenda.”

He adds that of the 73 mayoral elections, 13 were returned unopposed. Hence voters had no choice to express an opinion on the office holder. In 28 of the 60 contested elections, where more than two candidates sought the role, more votes were cast for losing candidates than for the winner.

In the Auckland region, all mayors apart from Rodney's Penny Webster were elected on a turnout of less than 40 per cent.

Dr Asquith says only the mayor of Carterton, Gary McPhee, can claim to have the majority of support of people in his are after being elected by more than 52 per cent of the registered voters, with total turnout of 61 per cent.

"STV provides a much fairer result, whereby all votes are considered,” says Dr Asquith. “Given the importance of the position of Mayor of Greater Auckland, isn’t it time that we persevered with STV and engaged in a mass public education programme to ensure that all kiwis understand both the importance of, and need for, an electoral system which delivers a mayor for Auckland who is empowered not only by statute, but by the people as well.”

Dr Asquith has followed the issues surrounding the Royal Commission’s report into the Super City closely and was involved in submissions to the commission by the One Auckland Trust and others.
