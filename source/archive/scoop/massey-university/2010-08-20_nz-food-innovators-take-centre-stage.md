**NZ food innovators take centre stage**

New Zealand’s most innovative food products will be easily identifiable in the future, with the introduction of the new Food Awards mark.

The New Zealand Food Awards will be presented at a gala dinner in Auckland on October 28.

The awards themselves are being named "the Masseys" to reflect the University's support of the competition and its longstanding involvement in New Zealand food technology teaching, research and innovation.

The Food Awards mark is a consumer-focused initiative, available to category winners to differentiate their products on shelves as being of nationally-recognised quality.

The awards are a celebration of innovation in food, offering consumers a clear indication of food excellence and the industry's new benchmarks and leadership, says University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey.

"Massey University has been supporting the New Zealand food and beverage industry for more than 80 years," Mr Maharey says. "We have a commitment to provide innovative responses and solutions across the value chain. This year, we’ve refreshed the awards to place a greater emphasis in three key areas – products, operations and enterprise."

There is no limit to the number of entries – products simply need to be manufactured in New Zealand and be available in retail outlets – and the process has been streamlined and simplified to enable an online entry to be completed in about 20 minutes or less. These close on August 31.

At the awards dinner category finalists will be showcased and winners will be announced, including those in special categories and the supreme winner.

Sponsorship of the awards is also open, with sponsors able to align with the awards’ objectives of excellence and innovation, as well as taking an industry leadership role.
