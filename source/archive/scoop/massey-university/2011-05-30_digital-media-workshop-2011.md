This 17 - 19 June Massey University – College of Creative Arts in association with CoLab – AUT University will run the second edition of the Digital Media Workshop 2011. Up to ten selected teams will spend a weekend producing a 2-minute story-based project for the mobile phone or internet, under the tutelage of experienced practitioners Max Schleser and Laurent Antonczak.

The aim is to experiment with the mobile phone to see what works… or does not while discovering a new medium and developing relevant content for mobile devices.

The workshop is open to teams of 1-3 who need to cover the key skills to produce the project. Applicants are required to submit an outline of the outlines or scripts of potential theme / area to be explored along with (and up to) 3 images capturing the spirit of the following potential field of investigation:  
\- SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT  
\- COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT  
\- VIRAL MARKETING FOR A FEATURE FILM  
\- INTERACTIVITY  
\- GAMING

From the applications up to 10 projects/concepts will be selected on the basis that they suit the medium, are innovative, are achieveable and tell a story.

Projects relating to the marketing of a film will be considered, as long as the project is strongly story based and intended to be viewed on mobile devices.
