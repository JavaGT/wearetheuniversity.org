Massey University - Chunuk Bair commemoration talk at PN City Library - Monday

Seizing the WWI story of Chunuk Bair

Military historians from New Zealand and Australia will offer insights into the epic World War One battle for Chunuk Bair on Turkey’s Gallipoli peninsular 101 years ago, in a public lecture jointly organised by Massey University and the Palmerston North City Library.

The event will be held on August 8 - the day in 1915 when New Zealand troops briefly held the summit, Chunuk Bair, before Turkish forces overwhelmed them.

Guest speakers at the event are Ashley Ekins, a prominent Australian military historian, and New Zealander Dr David Richards, who was awarded a New Zealand Bravery Medal this week for his actions in helping to rescue people trapped in Christchurch’s CTV building in the February 22 earthquake in 2011 that claimed 185 lives, including 115 at the CTV building.

Dr Richards will discuss medical challenges for the men who fought at Gallipoli in his talk _Blood, Sweat and Fears: medical issues at Gallipoli_. He will also talk about the medical and nursing personnel at Gallipoli who helped look after the wounded.
