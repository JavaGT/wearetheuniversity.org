**Eminent British design guru visits Wellington**  
  
Noted British arts critic Sir Christopher Frayling is to visit Wellington this month at the invitation of College of Creative Arts Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Sally Morgan.

Sir Christopher, who till last year was Chairman of Britain’s largest arts funding body, the Arts Council of England, is Chairman of the British Design Council and a Governor of the British Film Institute.

From 1996-2009 he was Rector and Professor of Cultural History at the Royal College of Art, the only wholly postgraduate university of art and design in the world. In 2000 he was knighted for services to art and design education. He has published 17 books on contemporary art, design, film and the history of ideas.

Sir Christopher will give two lectures, one in the Museum Building theatrette at 6pm on March 15, and a lunchtime lecture, at Te Papa on March 17. the first lecturer is entitled The New Bauhaus; the second lecture is The Hollywood History of Art.

While in New Zealand he will have talks with government officials and tertiary leaders on issues surrounding arts funding and public research.

Professor Morgan says she is delighted Sir Christopher accepted her invitation to come to New Zealand as he has immense global standing both in arts and education. He is also a passionate campaigner for the importance of a creative arts education, the creative industries and government investment in the arts.

She hoped his discussions with university and government officials would help find new ways to harness creativity and establish new industries or opportunities for New Zealand businesses, especially at a time when this country is looking at how to grow its current economy.
