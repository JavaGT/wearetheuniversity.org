**Japanese Earthquake Warning Specialist Speaks**

Earthquakes in Japan and Christchurch will be the focus of a guest lecture on Wednesday by a specialist in earthquake warning systems who has also devised a new method of estimating the accurate height of tsunamis.

Dr Shigeki Horiuchi is an Associate Professor at Tohoku University and a former director of Japan’s National Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, and will speak at a lecture on the Wellington campus, about the best ways of mitigating against natural disasters like those that struck his country in March.

“The March earthquake highlighted some shortcomings in the magnitude and tsunami height as advised by the Japanese Meteorological Society”, Dr Horiuchi says. He will propose a new improved method that aims to provide a more accurate measurement of earthquake magnitude as well as forecasting tsunami height.

Before this system was devised, Japan had long used an earthquake warning system specifically geared to notifying and slowing down its bullet trains. The new Horiuchi system is intended to enable counter measures to be taken by the general public, including clearing out lifts, taking cover under desks and moving away from rocky walls. “A few seconds’ warning could also save lives on constructions sites”, Dr Horiuchi says, “allowing workers to grip girders or move cranes to safer positions”.

The lecture organised by the Centre for Professional and Continuing Education takes place at **6pm on** **Wednesday, July 6** at lecture theatre 4B06, Entrance B, Massey University, Wellington campus, 63 Wallace St, Mt Cook, Wellington.

The Centre for Professional and Continuing Education offers professional development courses, training packages and conference services to those who want to explore, learn, grow and access the expertise of Massey University.
