**Exciting options at Massey Albany’s Open Day**

From robots to 3D printing, experiencing New Zealand’s only university Trading Room — it’s all on offer at your local university – and there’s a chance to see what the new student accommodation village will look like.

Open Days are being held on all three Massey campuses, with the first one at Manawatū on August 6, followed by Albany - August 16, and Wellington - August 29. The Albany event runs from 10-3 pm.

**ROBOTS, 3D PRINTERS, TRADING ROOM**  
Presentations, displays, hands-on workshops and demonstrations are designed to highlight the diverse range of degrees and papers available – from Aviation to Zoology. A shuttle bus operating at the main campus runs to the Albany Village and Oteha Rohe campuses. 3D printers, robots, sport science labs, the speech and language therapy clinic, the nursing suite, and the Trading Room are just a few of the highlights.

**UNDERSTANDING THE ELECTION: 2-3 PM**  
The politics programme features a Q&A session on understanding the general election, and the value of a politics degree.

**CAREERS FOR THE 21st CENTURY**  
Two distinguished College leaders will outline careers in health and humanities for the 21st Century.

**TOURS, INFORMATION, SUPPORT SERVICES**  
Campus tours feature labs, libraries and lecture spaces that students will inhabit, and there’s a chance to sample campus services including cafés, theatre spaces and student learning support services. In addition, information sessions for distance learners, international students and Maori and Pasifika support networks will be run, as well as sessions on cultural and sporting activities, and student welfare.
