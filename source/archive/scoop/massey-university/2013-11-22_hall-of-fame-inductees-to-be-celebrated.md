Hall of Fame inductees to be celebrated

**Hall of Fame inductees to be celebrated**

Designer Mark Cleverley, costume and set designer Kate Hawley, and architect Bill Toomath will be inducted into the College of Creative Arts Hall of Fame at a gala dinner in their honour tonight.

Mark Cleverley has had a distinguished and varied design career, spanning architecture, graphic design, ceramics, packaging and postage stamps. He designed the most iconic Crown Lynn ceramics of the 1960s, including the New Zealand parliamentary dining suite for the Bellamy’s restaurant, and some of the most distinctive postage stamps of the 1970s, such as the Ross Dependency series and 1970 New Zealand Exposition stamps. Mr Cleverley also taught at the Wellington School of Design for more than a decade. College Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Claire Robinson says that his designs “have a deceptive simplicity, reflecting his belief that anything a designer does must make a contribution.”

Kate Hawley’s feature film credits include Pacific Rim and The Hobbit, along with numerous other costume and set design credits ranging across film, television, theatre and opera in Europe, the US and Australasia. During and after her diploma in visual communication design in 1992, Ms Hawley took any opportunity to help in local productions and in 1996, received a Television New Zealand Scholarship, and assistance from Wellington City Opera, to study at The Motley School of Theatre Design in London. Since then, her career has taken off. Ms Hawley is currently filming in Toronto; a far cry from the advice of her high school career advisor who saw her most likely career as a mortician!

Bill Toomath headed the Wellington Polytechnic School of Design for ten years (1979-1989), and was a key player in the development of modernist architecture in New Zealand for over five decades. In 1946, Mr Toomath jointly founded the Architectural Group in Auckland a collective renowned for their provocative pursuit of a specifically New Zealand form of architecture, with an emphasis on open plan, indoor-outdoor flow and honesty with materials. For almost 35 years, from 1955, he had his own architectural practice in Wellington, specialising in educational and community buildings, including the award-winning Wellington Teachers College complex in Karori. He had a strong vision for central city development and helped save Wellington’s Old Town Hall and other heritage buildings.

“The contribution of each Hall of Fame inductee is almost impossible to sum up in a paragraph,” Professor Robinson says. “ Through their creativity, drive and commitment, their work helps define us as a nation and enriches our lives even though most of us are never aware of it.”

The College of Creative Arts Hall of Fame celebrates alumni of the college and its forerunner institutions who have made an outstanding contribution to New Zealand’s economy, reputation and national identity through art and design. Invitations to the annual gala dinner are highly prized in the creative community as it has quickly gained respect as a prestigious event that gives long overdue recognition to the role of art and design in everyday life and credit to those who create it.
