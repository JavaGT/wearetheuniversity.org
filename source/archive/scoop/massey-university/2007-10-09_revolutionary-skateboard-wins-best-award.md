### Revolutionary skateboard wins 'BeST' award

An all-terrain in-line board and an animation focusing on computer dependency have won top awards for Massey design students and staff.

Industrial design graduate Ben Thomsen, now a tutor on the Auckland campus, collected a gold award at the "Best" Awards, held last Friday, for creating a skateboard designed to move on grass.

Judges of the Designers Institute national award programme say his entry showed an ability to challenge traditional solutions for human-powered vehicles.

"The designer present a credible solution that is aligned in form, materials and finish with the proposed market."

In the interactive media and website design category, Wellington graduate Caroline Ting won a gold award for her animation, titled Computer Dependency, pictured at right.

Judges called it the best animation at student level they saw. "The observation and character building was outstanding in this engaging and delightful work by a truly gifted student."

In the student spatial design category, Lauren Skogstad and Gemma Devonport-Ward won a gold award for Disseminate + Densify. Judges said they took a brief and executed the concept through to its natural conclusion. "This has been explained well showing a strong understanding of process and presentation."

Auckland School of Design regional director Azhar Mohamed, says success at the awards confirms that Massey's research-led approach to design is finding favour with industry.

The Government's Performance Based Research Fund rankings confirmed Massey as New Zealand's leading design school.
