**Leading Interactive Designers to “Play” in Wellington**

Leading experts from the Interactive Design field are set to converge at Massey University in Wellington for _Interactive Entertainment 2010_ – a conference on the science and art of designing “Play”, November 22-23.

This unique event has lured a big fish from New York, leading play theorist Katie Salen, Professor of Design and Technology and Director for Transformative Media at Parsons The New School of Design.

Conference Convenor, Associate Professor Aukje Thomassen, says _“We are thrilled to be hosting Professor Salen. Her innovative game design work has been hugely influential on the field. She's also paving the way for the future of education through her work with institutions like_ Quest to Learn_, a new 6-12th grade public school in New York City that uses a game-based learning model.”_

Thomassen continues _“We're also hugely fortunate to be joined by our local keynote, Joe Bleakley, who has been a leading creative force in the New Zealand film, television and performance industry over the past 30 years. He's well known for his work as Art Director on films such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong, but outside of this work he is also a widely respected theatre designer and has worked on huge productions like WOW.”_

The conference will include workshops, walking tours, two days of presentations – both Academic and Industry focused – and an interactive design exhibition that is open to the public.

_“The conference will explore how “Play” can contribute to challenges we face in our society. What can we learn from being inventive and playful? How can Play contribute towards facilitating change? What do we as designers, developers, critical thinkers and researchers need to consider when faced with these challenges?”,_ Thomassen says.

Katie Salen will deliver her keynote lecture at 9.30am on Monday 22 November, and Joe Bleakley will deliver his keynote lecture as part of the conference at 9.00am on Tuesday 23 November at the Museum Building Theaterette, Massey University, Wellington. Tickets are available from http://ieconference.org/ie2010/

The conference exhibition is open to the public from 9am – 4.30pm, Mon 22 – Tue 23 November in the Tea Gardens, Massey University Old Museum Building, Buckle St, Wellington. Entry is FREE.
