**VEX Robotics scrimmage at Albany campus**

Thirty-five teams from schools across Auckland descended on the Albany campus on Saturday for the fifth VEX Robotics Auckland Ladder challenge. Event organisers say it was one of the largest competitions of the season.

The tournament champions were Lynfield College (2915A) and Wingus & Dingus Robotics (7682) from ACG Strathallan. The Design Award went to Mt Albert Grammar School (2908X).

The challenge is part of a regular competition run by Kiwibots New Zealand, and is aimed at inspiring a passion for science and technology.

Lecturer in the School of Advanced Engineering and Technology Dr Frazer Noble is part of the Massey Engineering team, including staff and students, who regularly mentor the high school pupils participating in the VEX Robotics competitions.

“It was great to see so many teams set up in the Recreation Centre, honing their skills and working on their robots. These kids have the potential to be our next wave of engineers, and they’re also developing essential skills like teamwork, leadership and problem solving. It’s a chance to have great fun while they’re learning.”

Kiwibots national manager Chris Hamling says the competition is helping set a strong foundation for New Zealand’s future.

“The Kiwibots are creating a field of dreams for New Zealand students who, in turn, are strengthening the foundations of our knowledge economy. In 2008 we started a journey ‘To challenge young people to try Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths, through a robotics competition’. Now more and more schools around New Zealand are joining us on that journey.”

New Zealand is a world beater in the VEX Robotics World Championships held each year, with New Zealand teams bringing home trophies for the past six years running. In 2008 Massey University first launched the American-based VEX Robotics in New Zealand, with the first National championships held in Albany in 2009. Since then Massey University has provided ongoing mentoring to participating schools.
