Also on display at the school will be its new flight simulator and visitors will be given full details of the courses available.

For those with an interest in the sciences, there will be will be opportunity to see someone really walk on water, thanks to the amazing properties of cornflour. This will be run by the Institute of Fundamental Sciences on Concourse, on the Saturday only.

The open days will both run from 9am to 2pm. Each day will include: College presentations, halls of residence tours, careers advice, budgeting advice, “Explore Science” sessions, veterinary hospital tours, College of Education and School of Aviation visits, plus entertainment.

There will be shuttle buses linking the campus Turitea and Hokowhitu sites, the Milson Flight System Centre and Ucol, which has coinciding open days.
