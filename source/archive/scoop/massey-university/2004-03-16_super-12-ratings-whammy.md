Super 12 Ratings Whammy

Super 12 ratings whammy

The Blues, the Highlanders and the Hurricanes all suffered a double whammy in the latest Massey Super 12 rugby ratings.

All three teams slipped down on their home advantages and down on ratings at the weekend.

Mixed fortunes came the way of the Brumbies and Sharks, both of whom suffered net losses. The Waratahs made a small net gain. There was little net change among the other teams.

\`\`The ratings are taken over a 12-month period, but early signs of this season’s statistics are beginning to emerge,’’ Professor Hugh Morton, of Massey University, said today. Professor Morton prepares the ratings each week.

\`\`The average home advantage so far is about nine points. Only the Reds and Waratahs are significantly above this figure, and only the Crusaders significantly below, well into a current home disadvantage.’’

On ratings so far, the Crusaders and Sharks are looking good, and the Cats and Reds looking weak. On combination, the teams to look out for are the Waratahs, Sharks and Brumbies. Only the Sharks have not had a home game yet, so going on their earlier record, they may fade.

The weekly results are analysed for the ratings using a computerised adjustive rating system, similar to the PriceWaterhouseCooper rankings for cricket.

Over the whole competition a lowly rating can be offset by a high home advantage.

In the last four Super12 seasons the three highest average ratings have been Brumbies 28.6, Blues 26.7 and Crusaders 25.2, while the three lowest averages have been Cats 7.4, Bulls 8.6 and Sharks 13.4.
