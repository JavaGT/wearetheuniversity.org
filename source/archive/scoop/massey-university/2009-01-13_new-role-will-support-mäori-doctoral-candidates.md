**New role will support Mäori doctoral candidates**

Massey University’s more than 70 Mäori doctoral candidates will get the best possible opportunities for study with the appointment of a new Mäori doctoral studies coordinator.

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the appointment of Dr Nathan Matthews, formerly a Mäori studies lecturer at Otago University, is a milestone appointment. It will add to the University’s strong reputation built over the years by the late Hugh Kawharu, and maintained by Assistant Vice-Chancellor Mäori and Pacific Professor Mason Durie and Professor Tai Black.

“Dr Matthews will be charged with creating the best environment for Mäori research and putting in place the support needed. We are looking for big things from him.”

Assistant Vice-Chancellor Mason Durie says the position will play a pivotal role in supporting doctoral candidates to complete their doctorates. “Dr Mathews started in the role on Monday and will be working closely with the Doctoral Research Committee, colleges, academic units, and doctoral supervisors to ensure that Mäori doctoral candidates, including those studying off campus, have access to the right information and resources.

“Many of our PhD students study at a distance, and are not always able to participate in academic networks. One of the main elements of Dr Matthews’ role will be to create a network that includes the cyber portal for PhD student’s trialled last year. The support Dr Matthews will provide will be in addition to that received from their tutor and supervisor.”

Dr Matthews is a well qualified Mäori researcher. He is a former student of Hato Paora College in Feilding and was a lecturer in Mäori studies for 10 years. He completed his PhD in 2006 examining Mäori Catholic secondary schooling. Dr Matthews has also researched and published in the field of Mäori performing arts, particularly haka and its use as a vehicle for the transmission of social and political messages.

Dr Matthews is of Ngä Puhi descent. He is excited by the opportunity of moving his family to Palmerston North and welcomes the challenge the new role presents.

“It is great to be in a role that will help other Mäori students complete their doctoral studies. There is considerable focus on undergraduate students but not so much beyond that. To my knowledge, Massey is the first the University to create a fulltime position for this type of role.

“As a recent PhD graduate I am still very aware of the challenges of being a PhD student and trying to marry Mäori research and academic processes while working fulltime.” I am looking forward to working at a university I perceive to be outgoing, proactive and motivated to make a difference for Mäori.”
