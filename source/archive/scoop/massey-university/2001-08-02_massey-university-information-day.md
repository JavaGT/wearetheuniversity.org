Student liaison adviser Deb Buchanan said the information day is about trying out new things and getting a feel for what Albany is all about.

“This is a fun day and a great chance to students to get to know about all the different courses and career options there are here at Massey Albanym” Ms Buchanan said.

“The Albany campus is New Zealand’s northern most university environment; it is modern, purpose built and most importantly it is personal.

“We now have more than 4000 students but we have not lost our level of personal concern for student welfare and successful study. We welcome students from the Northland area who are considering going to university, to come in and identify the advantages that study with us offers.”
