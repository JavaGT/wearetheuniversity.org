Massey ranks highly in latest CWTS Leiden Ranking

Massey University’s Mathematical and Engineering Sciences have been ranked in the top 150 in the world and the best in New Zealand in the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2014. Massey’s Natural Sciences were ranked in the world top 200, and first in  
New Zealand on the same measure.

Head of the Institute of Naural and Mathematical Sciences Distinguished Professor Gaven Martin says the Leiden Ranking uses a more transparent methodology that offers more advanced indicators of scientific impact and collaboration.

“These rankings reflect the proportion of the publications of a university that belong to the top ten per cent most frequently cited, compared with other publications in the same field and in the same period. It is a strong measure of the impact of those publications, and indicates a relatively small group of high performers in these fields.”

“It also reflects the calibre of the research currently being undertaken at Massey University, and justifies the reputation of the research and teaching staff within the College of Sciences. We are delighted that we continue to attract scholars from across the world; recent recuits are from Harvard, ambridge, Max Planck and other leading institutions, who will continue their research in New Zealand at Massey, while collaborating with colleagues across the globe.”

The CWTS Leiden Ranking differs from other university rankings by focusing exclusively on measuring impact, and does not use highly subjective data obtained from reputational surveys or provided by universities themselves.

The 2014 Ranking includes 750 universities in 49 different countries with the largest number of publications in international scientific journals covered by the Web of Science database from the period 2009-2012. Using a sophisticated set of bibliometric indicators, the ranking aims to provide highly accurate  
measurements of the scientific impact of universities and of universities’ involvement in scientific collaboration.
