Call for Pacific University of Aotearoa

Massey has been challenged to establish itself as New Zealand's first "Pacific university".

Dr Colin Tukuitonga, the guest speaker at the ceremony to honour Pasifika graduates at the Albany campus last week, acknowledged the University’s foresight in developing the Pasifika@Massey strategy in 2005, a first for a New Zealand university. Dr Tukuitonga, chief executive at the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, suggested Massey now consider another bold move – to become the country’s first “truly Pacific university”.

He had three pieces of advice for the graduates, the first taken from his medical training: “first do no harm; second, take responsibility – our society has to stop looking for someone to blame; third, kindness.”

Nine former Pasifika students, from Fiji, Rarotonga, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Tahiti and Tonga, joined with their families and University staff to celebrate their graduations.

Albany campus registrar Andrea Davies said Pasifika enrolments had increased by 48 per cent in the past three years. Campus Pasifika development adviser Ben Taufua, who acted as master of ceremonies, said the University was committed to ensuring every Pasifika student who enrols completes their course of study. Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasifika) Professor Sir Mason Durie applauded the range of disciplines Pasifika students were graduating in, including business, social sciences, education and sport and exercise science.

Massey’s graduation ceremonies continue at Manawatu and Wellington over the next six weeks, and will see 105 Pasifika students graduate.

Ceremonies to honour Pasifika graduates will be in the Regent on Broadway Theatre, Manawatu on May 13 at 2.30pm and in the Tea Gardens of the Wellington campus Museum building on May 28 at 6.30pm.
