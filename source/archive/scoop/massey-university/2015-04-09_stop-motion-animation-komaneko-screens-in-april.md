**Stop-motion animation KOMANEKO screens in April**

The delightful tale of a curious cat who likes to make stop-motion films is the latest Japanese film to screen at Massey University’s Auckland campus on April 13.

_KOMANEKO – The Curious Cat_ is an award-winning stop-motion animation film that follows the adventures of a kitten named Koma who lives with her grandfather and loves to make stop-motion films with her 8mm camera. She encounters strange creatures, battles with an obnoxious fly interrupting her filming, and meets new friends, including Radi-bo who loves gadgets, trains and planes. They also learn lessons about the importance of being yourself, and not judging people. The G-rated film is perfect for children of all ages.

The original film was a five-minute animation _KOMANEKO – The First Step_ created by writer/director Tsuneo Goda in 2006 to demonstrate stop-motion animation for an exhibition. It was well-received by the audience and the film was invited to many international animation festivals. It also won the Excellence Prize (Animation Division) of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2003.

Mr Goda then spent four years developing the short film into a one-hour animation called _KOMANEKO – The Curious Cat_, which will screen alongside _KOMANEKO’S Christmas – A Lost Present_. In Japan he is better known for creating Domo, the official mascot for public broadcasting television channel NHK.

The film will screen in the Atrium Round Room at 6.30 pm on Monday. The screening is slightly later to accommodate the Easter break and fits in with school holidays. Everyone is welcome to attend the free screening, which starts at 6.15 pm with a short documentary video on Japanese life and customs. The films are brought to New Zealand with kind permission from The Japan Foundation and the Consulate-General of Japan, and screen in Japanese with English subtitles.

The May 4 free Japanese film screening will feature the 1992 comedy _Sumo Do, Sumo Don’t_, starring Masahiro Motoki from the Academy Award-winning film _Departures_.
