Rugby player Sarah Goss and taekwon-do champion Kane Baigent were named the sportswoman and man of the year at the BNZ Manawatū Blues Awards last night.

Ms Goss is studying towards a Bachelor of Arts in Māori Studies and is vice-captain of the New Zealand Sevens rugby team that won this year’s Women’s World Cup and the IRB Women’s World Series.

Mr Baigent (Bachelor of Sport and Exercise) made the quarterfinals at the International taekwon-do World Cup. He won three gold medals at last year’s National Championships and three gold, one silver and one bronze at this year’s event.

World champion sailor Jo Aleh (Bachelor of Business Studies) was named BNZ Massey University Distance Student Sportswoman of the Year. She won this year’s 470 World Championship and was second at the European Championship.

Softballer Jeremy Manley (Bachelor of Sport and Exercise) was named BNZ Massey University Distance Student Sportsman of the Year.
