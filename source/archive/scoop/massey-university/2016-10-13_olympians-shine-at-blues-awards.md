**Olympians shine at Blues Awards**

More than 100 people attended the annual Blues Awards at Massey University’s Auckland campus last night, to honour top student athletes.

The annual awards now in their 26th year, included a star-studded line up of some of New Zealand’s top sportsmen and women, including a number of Olympic medallists.

Rio silver medallist Luuka Jones, who is studying a Bachelor of Business, was awarded the Distance Sportswoman of the Year. Jones won silver in the Women's K1 at the Rio Olympic Games - her third Olympics. She has also represented New Zealand at World Cup events and is the current New Zealand Champion for Open and Senior Women K1.

After accepting her award, the 27-year-old said it was a privilege to win a Blues Award. “It’s really fantastic to be able to study and do sport full time. It’s quite a special thing to be so well supported, to be able to sit exams overseas is really great. I have friends whose university’s aren’t as supportive, or they just simply can’t study because they don’t have extramural programmes like we do, so it’s a bit of a game changer.”

Jones is already eyeing up the Tokyo Olympics. “I am keen to keep paddling to Tokyo. There is a lot more I want to achieve in sport, so I am just trying to get back in to training again, which is a bit hard!”

With just four papers left in her business degree, Jones wants to take on further study too. “I want to start studying psychology. I think it’s really useful to have both degrees. Business has been really useful in my sport, because sport is like a business, and psychology just really interests me.

“I have realised how important the mental side of sport is, so to pursue that as a career, and put everything I have learnt into my future and be able to help other people, that really excites me,” Jones said.

Paralympic alpine skier and psychology student Corey Peters was awarded the Distance Sportsman of the Year, for the second year in a row. The Bachelor of Arts student was last year named Adaptive Athlete of the Year and Overall Skier of the Year at the annual Snow Sports NZ Awards. Peters is currently training in Wanaka and was unable to attend the event.

Black Sticks hockey player Samantha Charlton was awarded the Auckland Sportswoman of the Year Award. The 24-year-old graduated earlier this year with a Graduate Diploma in Science. She competed at the Rio Olympics, and also played for Midlands National Hockey League. Charlton has nearly 200 caps for New Zealand. Charlton was also out of the country and unable to accept her award in person.

First-year Bachelor of Business student Hayden Phillips won the Auckland Sportsman of the Year Award. The 18-year-old debuted for the Men’s Black Sticks hockey team in March this year, and continued on to be a valuable member of the team at the Rio Olympics. Phillips, one of the youngest Blues winners this year, gave a short acceptance speech, thanking those who have helped him on and off the hockey field.

Former sports broadcaster Hamish McKay hosted the event, with Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey commending the student athletes for their inspirational attitudes to life. “You are not only fantastic athletes, to get a Blue you must be both a great athlete and smart. You have to be able to carry a study load as well as achieve at a national or international level if you are going to be able to call yourself a Blue. It’s not easy.”

Mr Maharey says Massey takes its athlete friendly status very seriously. “Our staff are absolutely committed to our athletes. They go that extra mile to ensure you can study, that your lecturers are flexible, that we work with you to make sure you achieve the right standards, but do it in a way that fits in with your training and competition.”
