Judges prepare their palates for NZ Food Awards

With more than 100 entries received in the 2013 NZ Food Awards, the panel of judges convening this week are preparing their palates for the challenge ahead.

The celebrity line-up includes Ray McVinnie, Geoff Scott, and Nici Wickes. They will be joined by a number of technical experts and food specialists from industry at Massey University’s Albany campus to seek out this year’s winning entries.

The finalists will be announced at an industry event hosted at Villa Maria Estate in Auckland on August 29.

Pro Vice Chancellor of the College of Health Professor Paul McDonald says the Food Awards are an opportunity to showcase New Zealand’s talent and innovation in the food and beverage industries.

“Food is the very essence of life. However, one in seven people on Earth is malnourished. That’s why it’s so important that we recognise and celebrate the people and organisations who are finding innovative ways to produce, process, and distribute food. Their efforts make it possible to feed more people, keep us healthy, grow our economy and reduce human tragedy and conflict. Congratulations to all the entrants, as well as those who quietly work to make our country and world a better place through food.”

The gala dinner will be held at the Auckland Museum Events Centre on September 19. Tickets go on sale from August 12.
