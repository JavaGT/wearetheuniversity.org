**Albany migrant study launched at Massey**

New migrants say lack of support and access to social services is hampering their settlement in New Zealand, according to a Ministry of Social Development report launched at the University's Albany campus last week.

The report, titled Settling In – Albany, is based on input from 23 focus groups representing 25 migrant communities in Albany, one of New Zealand's fastest growing communities. Almost half its 32,000 residents were born overseas ¬– mostly in China and Korea. Of these, 61 per cent have lived here for less than 10 years, according to the latest census in 2006. The population is expected to double by 2031, with migrants making by far the biggest contribution to this increase.

Maori Party co-leader and Associate Minister of Social Development and Employment Tariana Turia was guest speaker at the launch, which was also attended by National Party MP Melissa Lee, North Shore City mayor Andrew Williams, Race Relations Commissioner Joris de Bres, former Race Relations Conciliator Rajan Prasad, and Social Development Ministry Community Relationships, Family and Community Services manager Ann Dysart.

University historian Associate Professor Peter Lineham welcomed about 200 guests – many from ethnic focus groups who contributed to the report. Dr Lineham said the campus was an appropriate location for the launch because the University related well to its local community and the new migrant students from within it. \"Massey University is your place, and we are at your service."

Mrs Turia said it took huge courage to move to a new country where people often felt excluded at first. "We must extend the hand of friendship and show respect for what you bring from your cultures. It is so important to hold onto your lifestyle, your culture and the essence of who you are."

Long Bay College students performed kapa haka and sang waiata during the powhiri, and a group of Korean children in traditional costume sang popular Maori song po kare kare ana during the programme.

Among those consulted for the report was Massey social work master's student Rebecca Harrington, whose thesis on neighbourhood dynamics and how this contributes to migrant settlement is referred to extensively in the report. Mrs Harrington spoke with migrants in Albany about their experiences and perspectives and found many were discouraged by a lack of positive interaction with their neighbours.

Language barriers, busy lifestyles and perceptions about privacy were among factors inhibiting friendly neighbourhood communication, she says. "The role of local community centres or houses and neighbourhood based organisations in helping bridge connection between neighbours was highlighted by participants in my study."

According to the report, Albany lacks a community hub with sufficient community facilities for recreation and socialising such as a swimming pool, gym and adequately sized library and accessible, comprehensive English language teaching services. It pinpointed further language teaching opportunities for private and local schools as well as for the University, which has a Centre for University Preparation and English Language Studies as well as extensive student learning support services.
