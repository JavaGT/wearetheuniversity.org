Climate change adaptation hot topic for book launch

Climate change and ways to prepare for the worst effects of natural hazards are hot topics in a newly-published book featuring the work of international and New Zealand researchers being launched on at Massey’s Wellington campus.

Adapting to Climate Change, which is co-edited by Professor Bruce Glavovic, the EQC Chair in Natural Hazards Planning at Massey’s School of People, Environment and Planning, will be launched on Thursday August 14.

The book identifies lessons already learned from past experiences of natural hazards through case studies of severe storms, sea-level related hazards, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, floods, (including the 2004 Manawatū floods) earthquakes and tsunami, in North America, Europe, Australasia, Asia, Africa and small island developing states.

Professor Glavovic says the book draws upon the work of experts from around the world, including New Zealanders, who are involved in wide-ranging research, teaching, professional development and community service on matters related to reducing disaster risk, building community resilience and adapting to climate change.

This work includes the University’s membership of the New Zealand Climate Change Centre - an initiative with the country’s Crown Research Institutes as well as the University of Canterbury and Victoria University.

The Centre’s goal is to “enhance the capacity of New Zealand, both domestically and in partnership with other countries to anticipate, mitigate and adapt to climate change.”

Professor Glavovic says the Centre provides a forum for Massey to participate with key players in dialogue and shape the climate change research agenda in New Zealand and help “bridge the science-policy-practice gap”.

It also encourages greater engagement on climate change between research organisations and the Government and internally within Massey.

Professor Glavovic will be joined at the launch for a discussion about how communities can plan

for and adapt to climate change by one of the New Zealand contributors to the book Michele Daly from GNS Science.

Adapting to Climate Change co-edited by Professor Glavovic and Gavin Smith is being launched at the Museum Building of Massey University’s Wellington campus at 5.30pm on Thursday August 14.
