Run the Night gets Auckland moving

Massey University is gearing up for the inaugural Run the Night event, which will be held at the Auckland Domain on March 27.

Billed as New Zealand’s first ever party-themed run, it promises to offer a truly unique experience and is aimed at people aged 16 and over. This type of event has proved extremely popular overseas.

Massey University director of marketing and student recruitment Vasso Koutsos says it’s a chance to get Auckland moving.

“As principal sponsor of Run the Night, we know that this is a unique chance to get students and young people across Auckland moving and having fun. With the academic year underway for university and high school students alike, it’s a chance to have a break with friends and relax a bit,” she says.

“We’re looking forward to a fun-filled evening of lights, movement, and amazing music in the beautiful Auckland Domain. It’s going to be a fantastic night.”

Event director Scott Rice says Run the Night is a 5km “party on the move” with thousands of lights and over 100 concert-quality speakers spread across the course in the Auckland Domain.

Gates open at 6.30pm and the alcohol-free non-competitive run/dance starts at 8.30pm.

Music is integral to the event, with ticket-holders given the opportunity to have advance input into the party playlist featuring on the night. The after-party will include a 90-minute DJ set from Rhythm and Blues duo Jupiter Project.

The social media hashtag for the event is #runthenight and participants are encouraged to follow @MasseyUni on Instagram, and share their photos of the night. Winners will be picked every 10 minutes and can collect their prizes from the Massey stand.

Tickets are on sale now, with a limited run of tickets selling at $25.
