Massey to celebrate Mäori alumni at inaugural event

The University will roll out the red carpet for Mäori alumni and stakeholders at the Wellington campus on Thursday evening in the first of what will become regular events.

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey and Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasifika) Professor Mason Durie will host the event and be present to discuss Massey's Mäori and overall strategy.

Mr Maharey says Mäori students, graduates and communities are an important part of what defines Massey. “Massey has been celebrating Mäori achievement for almost 40 years," he says. "This event is a significant milestone in our history.”

Professor Durie says that with more than 3000 Mäori students currently enrolled and the more than 80 Mäori doctoral students, Massey has a strong record in Mäori tertiary education. “Massey has been building its Mäori capacity since the appointment of the late Sir Hugh Kawharu as the foundation Professor at the Department of Social Anthropology and Mäori Studies in 1971,” says Professor Durie. “Since that time the University has developed a number of strategies to increase Mäori participation and has made significant contributions – through its research, partner organisations and graduates – to Mäori development in health, education, business, science, art, design and social sciences.”

Professor Durie says renewing Mäori links and strengthening relationships will be the focus of the function. More than 150 guests are expected for the event, which will be held in the Tea Gardens of the Museum Building and will include a display of student art.

Massey has approximately 5000 Mäori alumni, about 3400 of whom, are registered on the Alumni Relations database. There will be Mäori alumni and stakeholder events at the University's Albany and Manawatu campuses later in the year.
