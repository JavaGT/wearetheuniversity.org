Conference to launch infant mental health association in New Zealand

Issues relating to the mental health of infants will be the subject of a conference in Wellington next month (26 April).

The conference marks the establishment of the Infant Mental Health Association of Aotearoa NZ (IMHAANZ) as an affiliate of The World Association for Infant Mental Health (WAIMH). The association brings together and supports professionals and academics specialising in education, health, psychotherapy, social and family services.

“Our affiliation to the world association is an important step in becoming the organisation for professionals involved and interested in infant mental health in New Zealand”, says association president Dr Kimberley Powell.

Dr Powell, from Massey University’s College of Education’s School of Arts, Development and Health Education, is known for her research and other work in early childhood education and development.

She says the organisation of a national infant mental health body has taken more than two years of hard work by the IMHAANZ executive committee, who were successful in achieving affiliate status in mid 2006.

Former Massey College of Education lecturer, Dr. Janet Gregory, was also a driving force in developing IMHAANZ so that it could achieve international affiliation.  
WAIMH is one of the leading research and professional organisations, providing a forum for collaboration and professional development advancing the wellbeing of infants and families.

“The time is right to now have a national launch of a much-needed infant mental health organisation here in New Zealand,” Dr Powell says. “The primary purpose is to give professionals working with children up to four years of age and their families the support and networking they need along with up-to-date research information so that the integration of services for families can be more easily obtained within New Zealand.

“We know from research in other OECD countries that the coordination of services for infants and their families and a unified approach by a range of professionals is much more cost effective in the long term for reducing poverty, reducing rates of neglect and abuse, and for providing more efficient outreach through social services to families. Children that start off well and are supported early in life benefit New Zealand economically because they develop, learn and grow more rapidly when their emotional environment is healthy and nurturing.

“Infant mental health is all about ensuring that infants are given an optimal environment and emotional support from the pre-natal period onwards. Infant mental health practitioners and researchers are interested in promoting supportive caregiving attachment relationships that will ensure emotional equilibrium, a healthy sense of self and a good basis for optimal development and learning in infants and young children.”

The symposium will be held on Thursday, 26 April, at the James Cook Hotel Grand Chancellor, with the official launch cocktail function to follow at the Banquet Hall, Parliament Buildings.

Speakers include top New Zealand and Australian professionals and researchers:

Elisabeth Muir, IMHAANZ Patron and author of Watch, Wait and Wonder.  
Beulah Warren, founder of the Australian AIMH, child psychologist, Brazelton trainer, and author.  
Dr Denise Guy, Wellington child psychiatrist and infant mental health clinician.  
Sarah Te One, lecturer in early childhood education and lead researcher for the Te Marua-Mangaroa Playcentre Supporting Parents alongside their Children’s Education (SPACE) programme.  
Dr Trecia Wouldes, researcher and University of Auckland lecturer.  
Hon Steve Maharey, Minister of Education.
