Media Release - April 20

Stormers, Crusaders on top in Super 12 ratings

The Crusaders and the Stormers lead the Massey Super 12 rugby ratings after round nine.

The Bulls and the Stormers gained in rating but dropped their home advantages. The Cats restored their good home advantage while the Brumbies have the best home advantage of all the teams.

The weekly Super 12 results are analysed for the ratings by Massey University Professor Hugh Morton using a computerised adjustive rating system, similar to the PriceWaterhouseCooper rankings for cricket.

In the last four Super 12 seasons the three highest average ratings have been Brumbies 28.6, Blues 26.7 and Crusaders 25.2, while the three lowest averages have been Cats 7.4, Bulls 8.6 and Sharks 13.4.
