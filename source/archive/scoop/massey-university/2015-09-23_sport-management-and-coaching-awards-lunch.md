Sport management and coaching awards lunch
==========================================

**Sport management and coaching awards lunch**

A special lunch will be held at Palmerston North’s Institute of Sport and Rugby next week to celebrate the success of Massey students’ sport industry practicum projects.

The awards recognise the top sport management students from 2014, across internal, distance and post-graduate classes. They are presented by industry partners Sport Manawatū and Arena Manawatū, alongside the JJ Stewart Memorial Prize in Sport Management.

Associate Professor Andy Martin from the School of Sport and Exercise says, "Former All Black coach JJ Stewart was the driving force behind the introduction of qualifications in sport management and coaching prior to rugby going professional.

“Through the Bachelor of Business Studies major and Bachelor of Sport and Exercise major, students with different related career focuses have been able to gain insight into areas of sport management and marketing, sport event management and programming and sport development and coaching.”

He says, “The practicum paper has provided students with significant industry experiences and has been a graduate point of difference that employers' value. In 2016 a new degree will also be introduced, the Bachelor of Sport Management."

The lunch, on Wednesday September 30, will be attended by students, staff and industry supervisors. Prizes will also be awarded to the top students from 2014.
