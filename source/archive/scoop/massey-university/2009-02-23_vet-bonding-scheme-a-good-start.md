Vet bonding scheme a good start

**Vet bonding scheme a good start**

New Zealand’s top vets have welcomed the Government’s bonding scheme to combat the shortage of rural vets. Agriculture Minister David Carter announced the scheme, which encourages vets to stay in an eligible rural practice by providing a payment of $11,000 annually for up to five years.

Massey University is the only training provider for veterinary science in New Zealand. About 95 vets graduate from the five-year Bachelor of Veterinary Science programme, based at the Manawatu campus, each year.

Professor Grant Guilford, Head of the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical sciences says the bonding scheme is a “good start” to the shortage of rural vets.

“It’s not the answer in isolation but we have worked closely with the Government to develop the scheme and it is a well-thought out financial incentive, especially the decision to withhold payment till after the end of the third year. We also support the opportunity to iron out wrinkles in the transition period.”

Professor Guilford says the university has also implemented its own initiatives to support rural vet practice, including offering for the first time this year a new three-year Bachelor in Veterinary Technology. The new BVetTech will be both applied and academic, providing graduates that can give hands-on and management support for vets.

“By rationalising vet activity and having well-trained support people we can free up vets’ time. Work for veterinary technologists could include radiology, it could be on-farm work like ultrasound scanning or blood sampling, and even record collection, collation and analysis.”

Veterinary science programme co-ordinator Professor Norm Williamson says vet technology graduates are already well accepted internationally, with established courses in the US, Canada and Australia.

“It’s part of an international trend and it’s analogous to having paramedical and para-dental professionals,” Professor Williamson says. “There is also an opportunity for the veterinary technologists to focus their studies, completing their final year in a large animal, equine, small animal or business and management tracks.”

The three-year course includes basic physics, chemistry and biology, progressing to anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, diagnostic procedures animal production, and advanced clinical studies. It is anticipated that around 30 students will graduate each year.

The University has also developed a conversion programme allowing people who have qualified from Massey with a Diploma in Veterinary Nursing to complete the Bachelor of Veterinary Technology in a shorter timeframe.
