Gastro outbreak confirmed as Norovirus

Laboratory tests have confirmed that the gastroenteritis outbreak that has affected about 160 students at the Manawatu campus is a Norovirus.

Regional Registrar Dr Sandi Shillington says a marvellous effort by staff and contractors has seen the contagious virus contained with only a few new cases reported this week. Measures instituted to combat the virus will remain in place, including extra cleaning, an alternate exam venue for students who have been unwell and cleansing wipes and hand sanitisiers available across campus.

Staff are now working on processing exam scripts and assisting students who have been affected by the outbreak, which peaked on 31 October, during the end-of-year exam period. The final exams for the year will be held on Saturday.
