**Sharing social work supervision research with Singapore**

Sharing research knowledge with other countries is an important part of building a strong network of global expertise that has a positive impact on communities.

With this in mind, Massey University’s head of the School of Social Work Associate Professor Kieran O’Donoghue is heading to Singapore this week to deliver a keynote address to more than 250 social work supervisors at the two-day _Social Work Supervision: Challenges and Advances Seminar 2015_.

“Over the past 21 years we have developed a professional culture in New Zealand where supervision has become integral to the development of social work practice and social work practitioners. The Singapore Social Work Accreditation and Advisory Board are keen to advance the professionalism of social work in Singapore through strengthening supervision,” he says.

There are about 1200 registered social workers in Singapore, where registration is voluntary and was only introduced in 2009. In New Zealand there are about 4800 registered social workers.

His keynote address will be on knowledge building and research with social work supervision, and its implications for supervisory practice and the social work profession nationally and internationally. Dr O’Donoghue will also deliver workshops on ethics and supervision practices within sessions.

Massey University’s School of Social Work leads research supervision in New Zealand through student research, publications, professional consultancy and training, and its postgraduate diploma in social service supervision.

“The social work workforce, like many other professions, is increasingly becoming an international one. This internationalisation means that there is a greater need to share knowledge through collaborative research networks, and the development of national and international standards for best practice.”
