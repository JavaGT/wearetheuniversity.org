Students in space, 2008

Technology and engineering students are working towards the launch of a satellite to be controlled and monitored from ground stations at the University’s campuses in Auckland, Palmerston North, and Wellington.

The European Space Agency has accepted Massey’s application to host the New Zealand ground station as part of the Student Space Exploration and Technology Initiative.

Third-year communication and networking engineering students will take part in the special space satellite programme alongside student groups from more 15 European countries.

Dr Ibrahim Al-Bahadly, a researcher in the College of Sciences at the University’s Palmerston North campus, says the space programme will enable students and staff to work on projects across international boundaries as well as develop their own satellite applications.

Dr Ibrahim Al-Bahadly says New Zealand is the first country outside Europe to join the initiative (established in 2000), and staff from the Institute of Information Sciences and Technology will oversee the students’ work.
