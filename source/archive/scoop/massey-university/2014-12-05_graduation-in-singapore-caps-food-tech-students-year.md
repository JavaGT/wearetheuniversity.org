**Graduation in Singapore caps food tech students’ year**

Twenty-six graduates from Massey University’s Singapore campus crossed the stage in a special ceremony on Wednesday to receive their degrees.

They are the fifth cohort of students to graduate with a Bachelor of Food Technology (Hons) from the Singapore campus, based at Singapore Polytechnic. The University teaches the final two years of the programme in Singapore.

Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Health Professor Paul McDonald, who chaired the graduation ceremony, says the students are well-prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.

“All human enterprises depend on food – and these students will address the oldest and most important challenge in human history – getting enough healthy food to eat.

“Our Massey graduates are prepared for current and emerging global challenges, including food safety, availability, access, utilisation and stability. We know they are ready to transform our world for the better, and they will still be able to tap into the vast range of food technology networks at their alma mater.”

The guest of honour, Professor Jeyakumar Henry, Director Clinical Nutrition Sciences at the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, told the students they will play a key role in the global demand for food scientists.

“Interest in global food technology is greater now than ever before. How can we use your talent as a food technologist to reduce post-harvest losses, develop new ideas that will minimise food spoilage, and at the same time enable people to enjoy foods that are low in sugar, fat and salt?

“Know your science, be passionate about your science, and understand how science may be utilised for the greater good of society,” Professor Henry says.

The programme is managed by Associate Professor Kelvin Goh, who works full-time at the Singapore campus, and is taught by more than 20 staff from the Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health, Institute of Fundamental Sciences and the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology.

Associate Professor Goh says the graduation is particularly special as this year is also the 50th anniversary of the food technology degree at Massey University.

“Massey University’s food technology programme has gained a tremendous reputation in the last few years in Singapore. It is comforting to hear first hand from a few key industry partners that the programme has produced the best food technologists their companies have ever employed,” he says. “Our graduates have been excellent ambassadors and have proven themselves to be of great value to the food industry in Singapore.

“The successful graduation of the fifth cohort is a testament to the dedication, hard work and commitment of every single staff member – from management and academics to admin support and IT – who taught and supported the programme.”

Class representative Ms Ying Jie Chen says the programme was a roller coaster ride that challenged and strengthened the students.

“This degree programme has put us through a journey as if we were on a roller coaster ride. It challenged our intellect, shaped our character, strengthened our resilience and bonded our friendship.

“In this programme, we were not only grounded theoretically, but we were ready to get our hands dirty with applied learning. We are well-equipped with practical and theoretical knowledge and ready for the food industry in Singapore and beyond.

“The Singapore staff and lecturers who flew in from New Zealand were all very dedicated and knowledgeable in their respective fields. it is indeed our privilege to be trained under their guidance,” Ms Chen says.

The Singapore graduation ceremony was the final graduation event on the Univesity calendar for 2014.
