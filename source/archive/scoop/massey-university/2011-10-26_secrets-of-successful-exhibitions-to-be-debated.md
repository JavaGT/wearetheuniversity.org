**Secrets of successful exhibitions to be debated**

Questions around staging art exhibitions and what makes one exhibit work over others are part of a discussion being led by the School of Fine Arts this weekend.

Head of School Associate Professor Heather Galbraith says the symposium, featuring international speakers, offers a chance for lively discussion about current trends and challenges in contemporary art and exhibition making.

“Exhibition making is an evolving practice, yet rarely in New Zealand do we talk about how we can trial new ways of approaching exhibition making. What do we want to do, and how can we make it happen?”

To help answer such questions American art critic Chris Kraus and British-based curator, artist and writer Paul O’Neill, will be present as guests of the School at Massey University’s College of Creative Arts.

“This event is for people interested in how art and audiences can connect, especially outside of established gallery and museum spaces and exhibition structures,” Ms Galbraith says.

“The symposium and accompanying lecture are an exciting development for the School as it extends its research and public programmes focus into the field of exhibition making.

“Critical and speculative thinking about modes of display, distribution and reception of contemporary art is crucial to an art school right now.”

**_Where Art belongs/ Exhibition as Medium_ symposium is being held at the theatrette of the Museum Building, Buckle St, Wellington from 10.30am-4pm on Saturday October 29. Entry and lunch is by koha. A lecture featuring international guests Chris Kraus and Paul O’Neill is also being held at the City Gallery, Wellington from 5.30pm-7.45pm on Friday October 28.**
