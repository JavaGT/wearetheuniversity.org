Nobel Laureate gives free lecture

Nobel Prize winner Sir Paul Nurse, a scientist at the forefront of world cancer research, will give a free public lecture in Palmerston North next month.

Sir Paul, President of Rockerfeller University in New York, shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2001 with fellow Briton Dr Tim Hunt and American Dr Leland Hartwell.

The prize – or laureate – was for his work on genes that regulate the cell division cycle. This is the process that takes a fertilised egg from a single cell to the 100 trillion cells that make up the human body – or an accidental mutation that leads to a cancer tumour.

Before taking up his current position, Sir Paul headed the world’s largest volunteer-supported cancer research organisation, Cancer Research United Kingdom. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1989 and was knighted for services to cancer research and cell biology in 1999.

His lecture, The great ideas of biology, will be delivered at the University’s Hokowhitu Auditorium, Centennial Drive, at 7.30pm, Wednesday 2 August.
