College of Creative Arts a finalist at Wellington Gold

College of Creative Arts is a finalist in the 2014 Wellington Gold Awards, celebrating the excellence and enterprise of business in the Wellington region.

The college has been selected in the Supporting Gold category, covering infrastructure and professional services including tertiary education providers. The selection was done by 40 independent judges who chose their top five in each category.

Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Claire Robinson says the college is a proud and active contributor to the creative capital. “We have been in the heart of Wellington since 1886, and our students are part of what makes this city such a vibrant and globally-connected place to study, live and work.”

A recent economic impact report found the college contributes approximately $237.5 million annually to Wellington’s regional economy.

The college’s entry, and those of the other finalists, will now be re-assessed to choose the eventual winners across ten categories. The winners will be announced at a gala dinner on June 19.

Previous winners include global brands like Weta Digital and Weta Workshop, Icebreaker, Xero, Trilogy and phil&teds; businesses about to go global like Aptimise, Magritek, Wedgelock and Radiola Aerospace, and more local heroes like Boomrock, WoW, Matterhorn, Tuatara Brewing, The Sevens and the New Zealand Festival.
