Papatuanuku inspires exhibition

Iwi Creativity, an exhibition of artwork from nine Maori students inspired by Papatuanuku (the earth mother) goes on display at the Great Hall in the Museum Building on 8 October.

Kaiwhakaahua (Director of Maori Development) Ross Hemera (Ngai Tahu) says the work is a celebration of creativity from Mäori students in design and fine arts, from Toi Rauwharangi–the College of Creative Arts.

“The work celebrates Maori student achievement and highlights the students’ academic endeavour.” Mr Hemera says.

“We have chosen the concept of Papatuanuku to describe the work in this exhibition. Papatuanuku is the symbol of sustenance for Maori. Papatuanuku sustains all life including these tender new shoots of iwi creativity as they strive for excellence.”

Contemporary Maori design and the work of Irish furniture designer Eileen Gray are the inspirations for third-year industrial design student Jamaine Fraser (Te Arawa). He has designed Haupapa (pictured), a space divider which is laser cut from resin or perspex.

Building on his love of drawing since he was at kindergarten, Mr Fraser says he always knew his future lay in design.

The exhibition will also feature in Blow: Nga hau e wha, the College's creative arts festival next month.
