**Joint poetry appearance for Wellington Writers Read**

Palmerston North poet, Helen Lehndorf, Massey University’s 2013 visiting artist resident, makes a visit to the Wellington campus this week for the first Writers Read event in the capital this year.

The event, being held as part of the Arts on Wednesday lunchtime sessions, also features fellow poet Maria McMillan in a joint appearance where they’ll read their poetry and discuss their work, the writing life and their shared love of op shopping.

Ms Lehndorf, who hails from Manawatū and is a writing teacher, has had her work published in many journals including _Sport_ and _Landfall_ and North & South magazine. Her debut collection of poetry, _The Comforter_, featured in the Listener’s ‘100 best books of 2012 list. Her feature writing has appeared in the _Dominion Post_ and her fiction produced on Radio New Zealand National.

Her year’s residency at the Manawatū campus will be dedicated to working on her next poetry collection, which deals with ecological issues.

“”I will be working on my second poetry collection which will be a creative response to environmental decline and humanity as an endangered species,” she says. “As our collective ship slowly sinks, we’ll need to find solace in art, I’m hoping my next book will offer something of that.”

Ms McMillan’s poetry sequence _The Rope Walk_ is being published by Seraph Press in July with a second book, _Tree Space_, due to be published by Victoria University Press next year.

Dr Ingrid Horrocks, from the School of English and Media Studies, who coordinates the Wellington Writers Read events, says the annual series of readings is now firmly established on the literary calendar with events on all three Massey campuses.

In addition to the Wellington event, Ms Lehndorf and Ms McMillan will be reading as part of the series at Palmerston North City Library on April 24. The series started as a partnership with the library eight years ago before expanding to the Wellington and Albany campuses.

Other writers to feature later this year will include playwright Jo Randerson and a panel of Kapiti writers comprising Hamish Clayton, Laurence Pratchett and Tom Conroy.

**Writers Read, 12.30pm, Wednesday April 17, Theatre Laboratory (Block 5, Level D, Room 14) Wallace St, Entrance A, Wellington campus.**

**Wednesday April 24, 6pm, Palmerston North City Library.**
