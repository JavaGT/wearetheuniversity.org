**Blow festival celebrates fresh creative talent**

Innovative product design, challenging art works, cutting-edge animation, original textiles, show-stopping fashion, movies made on mobile phones: Wellington will see it all in the 6th annual Blow Creative Arts Festival.

Blow is coordinated by Massey University’s College of Creative Arts and celebrates the past, present and future of art and design in New Zealand.

Each year, events within the festival honour New Zealand’s creative pioneers, showcase emerging talent, and act as a forum for creative practitioners to network. Some of these events are well established in the Creative Capital’s calendar, notably the _Exposure_ exhibition of graduating students’ work and the Massey Fashion Show.

This year’s programme has just been released. It incorporates events from the College of Creative Arts, Massey School of English and Media Studies, New Zealand School of Music and the New Zealand School of Dance, and reflects partnerships with design-related groups including Semi-Permanent, the Mobile Innovation Network Aotearoa and the John Drawbridge Scholarship Trust.

Highlights of this year’s programme include:

• **_Exposure_ Opening Night**: about 1,000 invited guests see the festival opened in style, surrounded by awe-inspiring art and design by graduating students. _Exposure_ will be open throughout the festival in Wellington. _Design Exposure_, featuring transport, industrial and graphic design, runs in downtown Auckland, Friday 16 November to Sunday 25 November, at Silo Park (Jellicoe St, Wynyard Quarter).
