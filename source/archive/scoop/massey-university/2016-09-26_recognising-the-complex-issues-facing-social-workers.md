**Recognising the complex issues facing social workers**

This Wednesday marks National Social Workers’ Day – a day to recognise the contribution social workers make towards a more humane, just and caring society.

Associate Professor Kieran O’Donoghue, head of Massey University’s School of Social Work, acknowledges Massey’s social work graduates who work towards achieving better outcomes for their clients across all fields of the sector.

“I commend the country’s social workers for their commitment to the people they serve, who are often those most in need of social assistance and support. These people work in an environment in which there is growing social and economic inequality, scarce resources, increasing accountability and public scrutiny,” Dr O’Donoghue says.

“In the face of these challenges, social workers continually support people to manage and/or change the difficult social situations they experience.”

Dr O’Donoghue says today’s professional social work is complex, specialised, and contractually managed in four major areas:

· The issues facing children and whānau, such as neglect, abuse, violence and offending.

· The provision of support and care for people experiencing health, disability, mental health and addiction issues.

· The social challenges affecting children at school and contributing to challenging behaviours in the classroom and playground.

· Assessing needs and coordinating services so those most in need can access and receive support services.

“Across all fields of practice, social workers engage with people through the medium of a professional relationship. In doing so, they aim to facilitate participatory change, while ensuring the safety of those involved. Social work is a challenging, demanding and rewarding work that is both a career and a calling,” Dr O’Donoghue says.

Massey University’s School of Social Work is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Bachelor of Social Work at a three-day conference _Social Work in Changing Times: Towards better outcomes_ from 17-19 November in Palmerston North. The aim of the conference is to gain new insights into the issues social workers are facing and to encourage innovative practice that makes a difference.
