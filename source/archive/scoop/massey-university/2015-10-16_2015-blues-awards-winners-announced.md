**2015 Blues Awards winners announced**

More than 100 people attended a glamorous gala dinner in Auckland last night to honour top atheletes studying at Massey University.

The annual Blues Sports Awards, now in their 25th year, included a star-studded line up of some of New Zealand’s top sportsmen and women.

Mary Fisher, who is studying psychology, was awarded the Distance Sportswoman of the Year. The blind swimming champion says it is really special to have para-sport recognised in this way. “It’s a really high calibre of athletes from across all sports, and it’s been great being able to work with Massey over the past four years to be able to chip away at a degree while competing in swimming on the international stage.”

Paralympic alpine skier and psychology student Corey Peters was awarded the Distance Sportsman of the Year, but was unable to attend the evening due to sporting commitments.

Bachelor of Construction student and pole vaulter Nicholas Southgate, who has been studying at Massey part-time for the past three years, was awarded the BNZ Albany Campus Sportsman of the Year. He says it came as a big surprise. “It’s cool to look back and see the huge names in sport who have won this award in the past.”

He says while studying part-time drags things out a bit, “Massey is pretty flexible, and the support team are awesome. I should be finished in two years”.

First-year Bachelor of Communications student Cheree Kinnear was shocked by her win, taking home the trophy for the BNZ Albany Campus Sportswoman of the Year. “I am in awe of the other nominees. It’s such an honour to be in the company of so many amazing athletes. It really means a lot.”

She took up archery when she was 13, after being inspired on a Brownies camping trip. Later she visited the archery range at Olmypic Park in Sydney. “That’s when I decided, I’m going to do this.”
