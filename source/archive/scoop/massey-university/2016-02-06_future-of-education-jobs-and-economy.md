Future of education, jobs and economy
=====================================

**Future of education, jobs and economy**

Understanding the global economic forces that determine whether a tertiary degree will result in a job – let alone a well-paid one – is the theme of visiting British educational economist Professor Hugh Lauder’s lecture series in New Zealand this month.

His public talks on the relationship between education and the economy explore the question: “Are we in need of a radical re-think about education and its role in our economic and social lives?”

Professor Lauder, a Distinguished Visiting Scholar at Massey University and Auckland University of Technology, is the author and co-author of several books on the topic, including _The Global Auction: The Broken Promises of Education, Jobs and Incomes_ (Oxford University Press, 2011).

He was quoted in the British press recently saying the British government should pay minimum wages to graduates saddled with hefty debts and encourage them to be more entrepreneurial.

Three lectures will be held in Palmerston North, Wellington and Auckland, and have been organised by Massey University’s Institute of Education, Auckland University of Technology and The Policy Observatory.

He will also address academics at Massey University’s Manawatū campus on Tuesday, 9 February, in a seminar titled: _The Vexed Relationship between Education and the Economy – and what can be done about it._ This seminar, also delivered in Wellington the following week, will explore the fundamental tensions in this relationship prompted by the demise of the dominant theory of the education-economy relationship: Human Capital Theory.
