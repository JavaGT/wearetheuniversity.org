Who will win the 2014 NZ Food Awards?
=====================================

**Who will win the 2014 NZ Food Awards?**

Will a South Island company finally take home the Supreme Award at this year’s NZ Food Awards? Or will the North Island continue it’s domination?

Last year several South Island businesses won key categories, including Healthier Choice, Beverages and the Rabobank Business Innovation Award. But the Supreme Award (and several other prizes) went to Auckland-based ToMeTTe for their French-inspired convenience meals.

Prospective entrants only have this week to get their entries into the 2014 NZ Food Awards. It’s the perfect opportunity to showcase regional pride, highlight the best of the food industry, and celebrate success.

In 2014 the awards categories have been adapted to increase opportunities for small, medium and large manufacturers to shine, including food service, primary producers and ingredient supply companies. A new two-step entry process will also help companies work through the best categories to enter their products in.

Massey University Vice Chancellor Steve Maharey says acknowleding success in one of our biggest export industries is important and helps build New Zealand’s international reputation.

“New Zealand exports an increasingly wide range of value-added processed foods to markets worldwide, and the size of companies contributing to this market ranges from petite niche operators to multi-national organisations. Everyone has to eat — and New Zealand’s reputation as a high-value food producer should be recognised.”

New categories introduced this year will enable growers and primary producers to show a different side of the industry. The New Cultivars/Primary Producers award is open to all food and beverage manufacturers who, by producing new varieties and cultivars or process produce by-products, add value to food and beverage products. The Novel Ingredient category is open to growers and manufacturers who have best demonstrated the use of technology and innovation to develop a profitable new ingredient product.

Auckland-based businesses featured highly in the finalists and winners for 2013, and Ingham’s Enterprises of Te Aroha represented the provinces by taking out the coveted AsureQuality Food Safety Award.

The stage is set, with less than a week to go. Will it be a battle between North and South at the 2014 NZ Food Awards?
