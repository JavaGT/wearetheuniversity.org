**Massey takes its creativity to China**

Massey’s reputation for creativity is to the fore during a visit to China this week that showcases the University’s innovation across the arts spectrum.

College of Creative Arts Pro Vice- Chancellor Professor Claire Robinson and senior Wellington and Palmerston North staff have joined Chancellor Chris Kelly and Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey for the five-day trip. It is a joint delegation with Weta Workshop staff led by Massey alumnus Sir Richard Taylor.

Sir Richard delivered the citation when China’s First Lady, Madame Peng Liyuan, had an honorary doctorate conferred on her by Massey University in November when she visited the College of Creative Arts. The college is ranked fourth in design in the Asia/Pacific by global design organisation Red Dot.

Madame Peng, an accomplished musician, renowned soprano opera performer and Professor Of Music, has strong ties with Chinese arts institutions including the People’s Liberation Arts Academy, which the Massey-Weta delegation will visit this week. The National Library of China and Tsinghua University are also on the itinerary and there are several speaking engagements for Mr Maharey and Professor Robinson.

Massey and Weta will also host a function in conjunction with Education New Zealand at the New Zealand Embassy residence in Beijing.

Mr Maharey says the visit continues a longstanding and strong relationship for Massey University with China.

For more than 35 years it has fostered connections, and currently has more than 70 active agreements and collaborations with Chinese university and government agencies covering all areas of teaching, research and exchange activity.

Key among them is a sheep project led by the International Sheep Research Centre at Massey’s Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences. It is part of the Joint Research Centre for Sheep Breeding and Developmental Biology partnering with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Shihezi University.

As part of a Tripartite Agreement Massey shares with Peking University and Shihezi University, more than 30 university lecturers from western China will arrive in Palmerston North in late June for a three-month professional development programme on teaching agriculture.
