Honorary doctorates for Bollard and Hancock

Former Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard and social work pioneer Mervyn Hancock will receive honorary doctorates from Massey at next month's graduation ceremonies.

Dr Bollard, from Wellington, a former Treasury secretary, Commerce Commission chairman and Institute of Economic Research director, stepped down as bank governor last month after a decade in the role. He will be awarded a Doctor of Commerce (honoris causa) in recognition of his outstanding service to the nation in the field of economic policy.

Mr Hancock, from Palmerston North, spearheaded Massey’s Bachelor of Social Work degree, the first at a New Zealand university, and was director of the social work programme from 1975-82. He will be conferred a Doctor of Literature (honoris causa) in recognition of his pioneering work, his influence on the professionalisation of social work and his outstanding national contribution in the field of social work education.

Both degrees will be conferred at ceremonies at the Regent on Broadway Theatre, Palmerston North, on November 30 – Mr Hancock's at the 10am ceremony and Dr Bollard's at the 2pm ceremony.
