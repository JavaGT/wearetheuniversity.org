Symposium sets sights on equity through education

**Symposium sets sights on equity through education**

The need to establish research and advocacy to help combat inequity in education is the driver for a symposium hosted by Massey University’s Institute of Education on Wednesday, 17 February.

Key educators and visionaries from a range of non-government organisations, including UNESCO, UNICEF, Listening2Kids and the Human Rights in Education Trust, will gather at Massey’s Auckland campus in Albany to examine the challenges involved with achieving equity through education, and to provide direction for the Institute’s new research group, Equity through Education.

Co-leaders of the Equity through Education Research Group, Associate Professors Alison Kearney, Mandia Mentis and Tracy Riley, hope the symposium will provide an opportunity for those instrumental in tackling these issues to share ideas and propose new research.

“Education is such an important determinant of the quality of our adult lives, affecting our earning potential, health and life satisfaction,” says Dr Kearney. “It’s critical we find innovative solutions to the present inequity in education where factors such as gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status are not determinants of school success.

“For example, despite many educational initiatives, a disproportionate number of Māori learners are not receiving the level of knowledge and skill needed to successfully participate in a 21st century society and economy. Our researchers, including Professor Jill Bevan-Brown, are keen to explore what educational factors have had a negative impact on Māori students and how these can be successfully addressed.”
