Comment regarding the possible funding cut to RHAANZ

Please see below comments from Massey University College of Health Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Jane Mills, in reaction to news [the Government may cease funding Rural Health Alliance Aotearoa New Zealand.](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1804/S00064/govt-may-force-umbrella-rural-health-organisation-to-close.htm)

_“The Rural Health Alliance Aotearoa New Zealand plays a vital role in connecting universities, clinicians, policy makers and consumers of rural health with the aim of improving the health and wellbeing of individuals, whānau and communities. In particular, the Rural Health Roadmap provides a common manifesto for prioritising our activities. Massey University is in essence a rural university. We provide highly skilled health graduates in the disciplines of nursing, social work, sport, exercise and nutrition. We are active rural health researchers with a strong focus on public health and occupational health and safety. The College of Health values our involvement in this forum as it links us in a meaningful way with other rural organisations who share our beliefs and concerns.”_
