Chris Kelly becomes Massey Pro Chancellor

Businessman Chris Kelly was elected Massey University Pro Chancellor – deputy chair of the University Council – at today's council meeting.

Mr Kelly, the chief executive of state-owned Landcorp Farming Ltd, is a veterinary science graduate of Massey and highly regarded New Zealand business leader with multiple directorships. He has been on the University Council since August 2005.

He replaces Dr Alison Paterson, who has been Pro Chancellor since the appointment of Stephen Kos as a High Court judge in April last year.

Chancellor Dr Russ Ballard, who the council re-elected for a further one-year term, congratulated Mr Kelly and thanked Dr Paterson for "active participation as pro chancellor". Dr Paterson remains on the council. She and Mr Kelly are council appointees, while Dr Ballard is an appointee of the Minister of Education.
