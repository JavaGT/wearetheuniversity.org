Final Call for NZ’s cutting edge food products

Food companies have until tomorrow to enter the prestigious bi-annual Massey University Food Awards 2008. 

The awards recognise New Zealand’s most cutting edge new food and drink products that champion innovation and excellence. Entrants will be scrutinised by a panel of food industry experts, headed by new Master Judge Allyson Gofton.

Products developed in the last 18 months for the New Zealand market or for export are eligible for entry. All products must be manufactured in New Zealand with a manufacturing base and/or New Zealand address. Twenty categories will be judged, from which one premier award winner will be selected.

To be part of the competition, food companies need to get their entries in quick as the closing date is Friday 6 June.

This year the awards process has been simplified so the initial entry is much easier to complete. Entry forms can be found on the website http://foodawards.massey.ac.nz.

Entry forms and the judging criteria and categories for the 2008 Massey University Food Awards are now available on the awards website http://foodawards.massey.ac.nz. Entries close June 6 2008. The Awards will culminate in a gala dinner on October 20 2008, when the winners will be announced.

ENDS
