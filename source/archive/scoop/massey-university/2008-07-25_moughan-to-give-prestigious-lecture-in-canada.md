Canada lecture invitation provides international recognition for Riddet Institute co-director

Professor Paul Moughan has been invited to present the 2008 JM Bell Distinguished Lecture in Canada in September.

Professor Moughan, the co-director of the Riddet Institute, will present the lecture, titled The functional foods revolution – opportunities for agriculture, in both Saskatoon (in Saskatchewan), and in Edmonton (Alberta).

The lectureship is awarded annually to an individual who has achieved international prominence in nutritional sciences and recognises Professor Moughan’s leading contribution to animal growth biology, mammalian and human amino acid metabolism and food chemistry.

“My address will highlight the need for new scientific alignments in food and agricultural research and the strategic importance to New Zealand of recent cross-disciplinary initiatives such as the Riddet Institute and Massey’s Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health,” Professor Moughan says.

He has a longstanding association with Canadian researchers and is an Honorary Fellow of the University of Guelph’s Centre for Nutrition Modelling and a member of the College of Reviewers for the prestigious Canadian Research Chairs. He also serves as a scientific adviser on a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada research project.

The JM Bell Lectureship was established by the University of Saskatchewan to honour the scientist, JM Bell, FRSC.

The Riddet Institute was successful last year in its bid to become one of New Zealand’s Centres of Research Excellence (CoREs). Based at Massey University in Palmerston North, the institute’s CoRE partners are Crop & Food Research, the University of Otago, AgResearch and the University of Auckland.
