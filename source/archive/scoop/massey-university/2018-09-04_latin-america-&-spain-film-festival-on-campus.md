Latin America & Spain film festival on campus
=============================================

Movies from 11 Latin American countries and Spain will screen at Massey’s Wellington campus as part of an annual showcase of cinema from the region.

Starting tomorrow, The College of Creative Arts co-hosts the Latin America and Spain Film Festival from September 5-13 in a celebration of the strong ties and relationship between Latin American nations and New Zealand.

Co-host Mexico will be joined by representatives from the 10 other participating countries, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and Spain, for the nine-day festival which will see each Embassy host screenings free of charge from their respective countries on particular nights.

Acting Pro Vice-Chancellor Associate Professor Rebecca Sinclair says the festival was a chance to “engage with these vibrant Latin American and Spanish cultures, revel in their differences and further cement the rich and important relationships we have with many of these Embassies already.

Next year, connections with the Embassy of Brazil will be enhanced when Massey launches a new programme in Portuguese, believed to be the only Portuguese language and culture qualification offered at a New Zealand university.

Mexico however, will take the spotlight at this year’s festival with a visit, following the opening night launch, by director Roberto Girault who will lead workshops at the School of Music and Creative Media Production with the support of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.

In addition, the Festival coincides with the visit of Mexican multi-media artist Eduardo Abaroa who is the latest recipient of the Te Whare Hera international artist residency offered by Massey’s School of Art and Wellington City Council. It allows a visiting artist to live, work and exhibit in the city and includes a public lecture later in the month at the theatrette of the Museum building.

Ms Sinclair says the Festival offered other opportunities in addition to seeing high quality films from the region.

“While the Festival represents a home-away-from-home experience for many cinema goers, for a growing audience it provides a virtual opportunity to learn about, experience or revisit other cultures – hugely important in this increasingly fractured global context where connection and cultural understanding are becoming increasingly vital.”

All films feature English subtitles.
