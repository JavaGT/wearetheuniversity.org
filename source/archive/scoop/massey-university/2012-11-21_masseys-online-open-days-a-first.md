**Massey’s Online Open Days a first in New Zealand**

Massey University’s online Open Days, which allow distance students to connect with lecturers and support staff in a general panel discussion, break new ground for New Zealand Universities.

The open events are the first to be held by a New Zealand tertiary institute and reflect Massey’s commitment to be a modern digital era university. The initiative aims to give a taste of how Massey extends the reach of traditional universities by taking learning to the learner.

Director of Distance Education and Learning Futures Alliance, Professor Mark Brown, says Massey’s support for distance students is world-renowned.

“Digitally enriched blended and distance learning is the ‘new normal’ as students increasingly expect the flexibility and convenience afforded by new technologies.”

The Open Days are designed to introduce more people to the benefits of advanced university-level education and demonstrate how Massey’s distance students make a significant contribution to the national economy and the local communities people serve.

Students can join the online Open Evening on Tuesday November 20 from 7.30pm – 8.30pm and the online Open Day on Tuesday November 27 from 12.30pm – 1.30pm at http://www.engine.ac.nz/first-steps/distance-learning/

The online Open Days have been timed to maximise convenience for working professionals, who comprise the majority of Massey’s distance students. Massey provides highly relevant professional development and opportunities for career progression for people throughout the country and increasingly internationally.

Professor Brown advises there are no requirements for special software but a good internet connection is recommended.
