**Shortland Street films at Massey University**

  
Massey University’s Auckland campus was the perfect venue for filming scenes for this week’s Shortland Street television programme, screening on May 25/26.

Featuring characters Wendy Cooper (Jacqueline Nairn), Kane Jenkins (KJ Apa), Jack Hannah (Reuben Milner) and Jimmy Issac (Joel Tobeck), the storyline follows Wendy Cooper’s interest in further study.

Filming for the episode took place back in mid-March, with the Shortland Street film crew dodging Auckland’s unpredictable weather to capture all the scenes, using Massey University students as extras.

Massey University’s video intern Anna Beaton tagged along and was able to capture “behind the scenes” footage for this video, available to view on May 27. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZgaoBd\_M9c
