Music for improved health

New Zealand’s inaugural Music Therapy Week begins this weekend, highlighting the healing qualities of music, and raising awareness of music therapy. The theme of the week is Celebrating Music Therapy.

Massey University’s Wellington campus will host a free event for staff and students on Tuesday, called ‘Massey Musicking’.

It will raise awareness of the use of music in maintaining good health and will ask participants what music helps them to be energised, to study, as well as relax when times are tough.

Organiser and professional clinician Craig Waterworth from the School of Nursing says music is used by nurses as well as music therapists, with the focus more on creating an ideal listening environment, rather than on the performance or creation of music.

“Listening to music can lead to reduction in pain, reduced anxiety during clinical procedures, and increases in positive mood. It has even been used in intensive care to reduce the period of time that patients have been artificially ventilated. Music listening can also be used in health promotion, another important area of nursing practice,” Mr Waterworth says.

There are 52 registered music therapists in New Zealand, many based in the capital. They work with thousands of clients around the country, from dementia patients to young children with learning difficulties. Music is used as part of a therapeutic toolkit to assist with the healing and personal growth of people of all ages and abilities with emotional, intellectual, physical or social needs. Music therapists often work as members of a clinical team at early intervention centres, hospitals, schools, prisons and rest homes, in addition to private practice and working in homes.

Mr Waterworth is interested in starting a student led Massey Wellington Music Playlisting Club, involving bi-monthly meetings and social media to allow students and staff to identify songs or playlists to inspire others.

The club would hold lunchtime meetings to obtain the music. “Another idea I’d like to encourage is Pacific Island Discs. You are stranded on a desert island in the Pacific and can only take 10 songs with you – what would they be and why? We all know of music that has a special meaning to us personally.

Sharing the stories behind these meanings can help others to see how music can help us overcome challenges in life, and also enhance our resilience when times are tough.

“I’m keen to also find out if anyone wants to start a community rock and pop choir club, as well as raising awareness for the already established Dance Club and Music Club at Massey,” Mr Waterworth says.

Local music therapist Kate Sanders O’Connor will also be at the event to answer questions about the music therapy approach and methods. She is a keen advocate of the message that music brings people closer together.

Since 2004, a Master of Music Therapy training course has been available in New Zealand, through Massey University and later Victoria University. All registered music therapists in New Zealand hold a Masters or equivalent qualification.
