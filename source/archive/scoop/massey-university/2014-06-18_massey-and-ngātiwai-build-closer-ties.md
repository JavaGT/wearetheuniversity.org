Massey University and the Ngātiwai Trust Board are actively building closer ties with the recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) at Takahiwai Marae in Ruakaka.

The agreement was signed by Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Māori, Pasifika and New Migrants) Dr Selwyn Katene, Ngātiwai Trust Board chairman Haydn Edmonds, Ngātiwai education general manager Philip Alexander-Crawford and Bream Bay College head girl Tivaan Doak-Smith. It will provide Ngātiwai with a greater involvement in decision-making around policy, strategy and the design of tertiary education for Ngātiwai iwi.

“Education is probably the most powerful weapon we have for change, and with a new Aotearoa emerging Māori, and iwi like Ngātiwai, are carving out futures for themselves confident in the knowledge they have something unique and highly valued to offer the world,” Dr Katene says.

“By being here, we’re saying we are opening our doors to you in the spirit of creating a mutual relationship of respect and learning. We want to assist you in growing your capability and capacity for the benefit of Ngātiwai.”

Scholarships to the value of $10,000 for prospective students were announced at the signing, and the iwi already have one scholarship-winning student, Ramon Curtis, studying for a Bachelor of Natural Sciences.

Mr Alexander-Crawford described the signing as a watershed moment for the iwi.

“It is about iwi entering into a meaningful partnership with a university that is also committed to change for the betterment of learners. Actions rather than words will be the legacy of this agreement. Massey wants to work with iwi and we will work with them to advance the educational ambitions of Ngātiwai.”

The agreement will allow both organisations to explore a coherent pathway for Ngātiwai members to advance education, and social and economic development opportunities.
