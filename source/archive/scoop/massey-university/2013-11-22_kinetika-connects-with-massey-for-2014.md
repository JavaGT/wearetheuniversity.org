**_kinetika_ connects with Massey for 2014**

A competition and showcase fusing kinetic art, design and engineering in the Taranaki region is getting a helping hand from Massey University, with an award for design innovation and scholarships to the value of $10,000.

_kinetika_, which was first presented by the Taranaki Arts Community Trust (TACT) in 2010, is run by the Taranaki Arts Festival Trust (TAFT), which is also responsible for WOMAD, The Taranaki International Arts Festival, The Powerco Taranaki Garden Spectacular, and Tropfest NZ.

Co head of Ngā Pae Māhutonga – The School of Design Associate Professor Andre Ktori says _kinetika_ is a natural fit with the university’s role in fostering innovation, and will inspire collaboration between students from the arts and engineering.

“Our programmes set up our students to create their own futures, to experiment and innovate. Our staff and students work alongside industry on emerging technologies and innovations, so we are delighted to support this event.”

The competition and showcase provides an opportunity for artists, designers and engineers to combine their skills to bring kinetic sculptures and inventions to life, and is aimed at highlighting the creativity that ensues when these specialists work collaboratively.

TAFT chief executive Suzanne Porter says _kinetika_ is an important part of the unique cultural mix that makes Taranaki as a great place to live, work and visit.

“The economic, social and cultural benefits engineering and art bring to Taranaki are significant to Taranaki and _kinetika_ is a fine example of how these communities can blend their skills to showcase the best of both to the world.”

There are five competition categories to enter, and entrants across all categories could be in to win two awards from Massey University. One is a $1000 design innovation award from Ngā Pae Māhutonga – The School of Design in the College of Creative Arts, or the Excellence in Innovation Scholarships from the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology (SEAT) in the College of Sciences of up to $10,000.

Selected works and designs will be exhibited at Puke Ariki in New Plymouth during October and November 2014.
