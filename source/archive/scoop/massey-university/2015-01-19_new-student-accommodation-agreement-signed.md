New student accommodation agreement signed
==========================================

**New student accommodation agreement signed**

The first group of students settling in to Massey University’s new $26.2 million Albany student accommodation village will be in experienced hands, with the signing of an agreement with Campus Living Villages (CLV) to provide accommodation management services.

Albany campus registrar Andrea Davies says CLV has been supporting the Manawatū campus in a similar manner for the past nine years.

“CLV are recognised as the leader in the provision of tertiary accommodation services in New Zealand, and with this being a new development at Albany, we’re looking forward to them helping provide an excellent experience for students living in our accommodation.

“We really care about our students, so we will still be delivering pastoral care to our students, while CLV deliver on the operational side of things, including managing the facilities, and ensuring that things run smoothly for those living on campus,” Ms Davies says.

The ten-year agreement, which covers both the Auckland and Manawatū campuses, was won through a comprehensive tendering process.

CLV New Zealand chief executive Darryll Park says the organisation was delighted to be appointed to manage the University’s newest campus accommodation.

“Having the ability to seamlessly integrate our capability for the provision of world class, best practice student accommodation across the Manawatū and Albany campuses, gives us an opportunity to extend our proud support to the University. Our nine years at the Manawatū campus perfectly places CLV in a strong position to deliver on this for the long term.”

Manawatū campus registrar Sandi Shillington says the multi-campus agreement means that students on both campuses will now be able to benefit from living close to sporting and other facilities, including the library and student social spaces.

“A strong Halls culture central to a great student experience is already in place, and the University will now be able to focus on refurbishment of some of the Manawatū accommodation to further enhance our students’ experience,” she says.

In Wellington the University manages accommodation and has partnerships with other accommodation providers.

Demand for the Albany student accommodation village has been high, with all the apartments and studio apartments now full, and Ms Davies says the Halls of Residence are also proving popular.

“The pressure is on if students want to live on campus. The Halls of Residence are filling up fast. They’re usually the best option for first-year students, as everything is taken care of.”

The Albany Accommodation Village will open in mid-February in preparation for the 2015 academic year.

The new accommodation village continues to build on Massey’s investment at the Albany campus, with the recent construction of new science laboratories, a central student amenities hub, and the expanded library. This investment is a key part of Massey’s plan to grow dynamically in Auckland and meet New Zealand’s need for academic excellence and innovation.
