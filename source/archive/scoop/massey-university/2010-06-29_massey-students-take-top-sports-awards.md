Massey students take top sports awards
======================================

**Massey students take top sports awards**

Two Massey students, Hamish Bond and Storm Uru, have been named New Zealand University Sportsperson of the Year and Maori Sportsperson of the Year, respectively.

Both are international rowing champions as well as distance learners at the University.

Sixteen Massey student-athletes were awarded New Zealand University Blues at a ceremony in Wellington on Friday night – the most of any university.

Mr Bond is doing a Bachelor of Business Studies degree, while Mr Uru, already a Massey graduate, is now working on a Master of Management degree.

The New Zealand Universities Blue is awarded by University Sport New Zealand and is based on the traditional Blue of Oxford and Cambridge. It is awarded to students who have achieved excellence both on and off the field of play.

Presented since 1919, over 2600 Blues have been awarded to some of New Zealand’s most famous sporting names.

The accolade continued a triumphant week for Mr Bond, having just secured gold in the mens’ coxless pairs at a World Cup regatta in Munich with Eric Murray.

Other Massey recipients were: Olivia Spencer-Bower (canoe polo); Peter Latham, Jaime Nielsen and Simon van Velthooven (cycling); Stacey Carr, Emily Naylor and Kayla Sharland (hockey), Scott Bicknell, Jason Searle, Erin Taylor, and Tania Perrett (kayaking); Rebecca Scown and Peter Taylor (rowing); and Cameron Gibson (swimming).
