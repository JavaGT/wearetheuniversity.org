Moss to captain university games team

Swimmer Moss Burmester will captain the New Zealand team at the 2007 World University Games in Bangkok in August.

Burmester, a design student at the Auckland campus, is one of 14 Massey students among the 65 who will receive university Blues awards at a function at Massey’s Wellington campus next Friday.

Competing in the 50m, 100m and 200m butterfly and possibly the 400m freestyle and 4x200m freestyle relay, Burmester will captain 120 competitors and officials from nine sports.

“It’s an honour. I’ve wanted to carry the flag into an opening ceremony for a long time now and I’m really looking forward to it. Most of all, I’m looking forward to helping the other athletes out and creating a good team atmosphere”, says Burmester.

With more than 9500 competitors from 170 nations competing in 17 sports, the World University Games are the second largest international multi-sports event after the Summer Olympics.

Burmester is also one of five athletes shortlisted to receive the New Zealand Universities Sportsperson of the Year award at the Blues Awards Ceremony.

Blues will be presented to 65 sportspeople on Friday 29 June at Massey Wellington’s Great Hall.

Blues are awarded to those who have excelled in sport as a player, coach or administrator, while filling the academic requirements of the university.

Massey and Waikato are celebrating joint top University status with 14 recipients.

Massey student Sara Randall, rally co-driver to New Zealand champion Richard Mason (also her fiancee) will receive the first ever Blue for motorsport.
