=============================================

**Press Release: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

Massey University Centre for Defence Studies

The American-led coalition's "war on Terrorism," dramatically evident in current waves of air strikes on Afghanistan, is extremely complex and hard to make sense of. Local expert analysis may seem hard to find.

Massey University's new Centre for Defence Studies has several experts available to the media for public comment on the key aspects of this fluid and rapidly unfolding war.

Major General Reid, rtd, is Director of Defence Studies. A former Army Chief of General Staff, he is an expert on modern warfare, especially land and joint operations. Gen Reid is available to comment on: likely military scenarios, the employment of special forces, and on military strategy in general.

Dr Joel Hayward, Senior Lecturer in Defence and Strategic Studies, has published widely on the use of airpower and on military history, strategy and operational art. He is available to comment on: the use, limitations and capabilities of airpower, and on military strategy in general.

Dr Glyn Harper, Senior Lecturer in Command Studies, has published widely on military leadership and New Zealand's military and peacekeeping operations. He is available to comment on: military security in the Pacific region, and on New Zealand's military contributions to international operations.

These gentlemen can be contacted during office hours:
