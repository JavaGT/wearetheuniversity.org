Peace Week at Massey
====================

**Wednesday, 14 September 2016, 11:57 am**

**Peace Week at Massey**

A series of events are being hosted on Massey University’s Auckland campus next week, to mark Peace Week.

Race Relations Commissioner Dame Susan Devoy will be giving a public talk on the new Human Rights Commission initiative #ThatsUs – a digital platform for collecting stories of migration and experiences of racism in New Zealand.

"We just need to look around the world right now to see what happens when racial intolerance and racism is normalised. We think New Zealanders are better than that," says Dame Susan.

"Many people don’t think racial intolerance or racism is a problem, often because they do not experience it themselves. By raising the voices of those New Zealanders who face racial intolerance in their everyday life: we’re hoping other New Zealanders will take the time to listen. We suspect many of us don’t realise when something we say is unfair or biased, but we would if someone pointed it out to us."
