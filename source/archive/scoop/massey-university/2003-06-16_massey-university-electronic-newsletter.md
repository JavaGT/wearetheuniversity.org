Professor de Bruin says world research in the field is still young and limited - and this is the first academic work on the subject in New Zealand.

Maui's dolphin, on the brink. A Hector's, or Maui's, dolphin was found washed up on O'Neils Beach, Auckland, in early June and an autopsy found it died from chronic pneumonia. Massey marine mammal expert Dr Padraig Duignan says pneumonia in New Zealand dolphins is rare and even more rare is the fungus Aspergillus, which appears to have caused the pneumonia.
