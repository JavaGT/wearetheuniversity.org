University awards 150 scholarships

The University has awarded 150 High Achiever Scholarships valued at $3000 each to secondary school students across the country. The High Achiever Scholarships are awarded on the basis of general academic excellence, excellence in the arts or excellence in sports. They were keenly sought after this year by high calibre applicants.

The recipients come from schools from Whangarei in the North to Gore in the South Island. A dozen of the successful applicants have already left school and are of varying ages but have not yet embarked on university study.

Forty of the scholarship recipients will study at Massey University’s Wellington campus, 64 at Palmerston North and 36 will attend the Auckland campus. Some are still to finalise which campus they will study at.
