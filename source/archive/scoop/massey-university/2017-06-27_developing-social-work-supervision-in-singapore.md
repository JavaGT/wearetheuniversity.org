Developing Social Work Supervision in Singapore
===============================================

**Tuesday, 27 June 2017, 9:37 am**  
**Press Release: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

Associate Professor Kieran O’Donoghue, Head of Massey University’s School of Social Work, is heading to Singapore next week to deliver a keynote address to more than 250 social work supervisors at the Social Work Supervision: Innovative ways to chart the bare essentials seminar.

Dr O’Donoghue’s keynote address will explore the issues and challenges facing social work supervision in the 21st century and will emphasise the importance of a professional supervision culture, the need to build supervision capability, and the importance of evaluating the influence and impact of supervision on social workers’ practice with clients and their development as a practitioner.

He will also deliver a workshop on solution-focused supervision to field education supervisors at the National University of Singapore and share how social work supervision has developed in Aotearoa New Zealand.
