New Book Presents Mäori Views On The Environment
================================================

**New Book Presents Mäori Views On The Environment  
**

A new book that explores a range of environmental issues relevant to Mäori – from the effects of Agent Orange on Mäori Vietnam War veterans to 1080 poisoning and the health of the Manawatu River – will be released this month.

_Kaitiaki: Mäori and the Environment_ (Huia Publishers) include contributions from 25 authors. Two of the book’s three editors, Rachael Selby and Malcolm Mulholland, are Massey staff and the third, Pataka Moore, is a graduate.

Eight other Massey staff or graduates have contributed to the book, including Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Sir Mason Durie, who looks at universal and cultural values and sites of significance, and Dr Rangi Mataamua, who co-authors an article challenging Tühoe knowledge about their environs.

Ms Selby is a social policy and social work lecturer; Mr Moore, her son, is an environmental science graduate; while Mr Mulholland is a researcher at Te Pütahi-a-Toi the University's School of Mäori Studies.

Ms Selby says the three share a passion for protecting the environment. “We wanted to show a way forward in protecting what limited resources we have and highlight stories from hapü and iwi throughout the country who have managed environmental clashes and issues with various local authorities."

She hopes the book will make a positive contribution to Mäori development by providing access to Mäori knowledge and principles, and highlight concerns and aspirations for the environment.

“The book contains fascinating stories and will be of great interest to others who want to do their bit to protect the environment.”
