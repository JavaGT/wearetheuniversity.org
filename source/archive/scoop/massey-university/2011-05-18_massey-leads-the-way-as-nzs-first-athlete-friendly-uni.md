### Massey leads the way as New Zealand’s first athlete friendly university

Massey University has become the first New Zealand University to sign up to a new ‘Athlete Friendly Tertiary Network’ set up by the New Zealand Academy of Sport.

The academy has recognised Massey’s drive to nurture high performance athletes and wants all universities to join the network.

The network will be made up of tertiary institutions that agree to adopt a set of guiding principles to support New Zealand’s high performance athletes to combine their sporting and academic aspirations.

“We’re delighted that Massey is the first member of the Athlete Friendly Tertiary Network. It is very fitting given the considerable support they have given athletes,” says Susan Thomason, the academy’s athlete life manager.

Massey Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the University has placed huge emphasis on creating a supportive environment for student-athletes both on and off campus.

“We believe Massey is the number one choice for athletes who want to successfully combine their sports careers with their study. Massey allows athletes to study and sit exams wherever they may be in the world, and with the flexibility they need,” he says. “On campus, our Academy of Sport gives young student-athletes the support they need to achieve in their chosen sport and academically, and our campuses are home to high-quality facilities.”

The University employs a high performance co-ordinator who is dedicated to supporting student-athletes with all of their sporting and academic requirements.

This year, Massey is the largest tertiary provider for 119 of the Prime Ministers’ Athlete scholarship recipients. At last year’s Commonwealth Games 41 members of the team were Massey student-athletes, with 31 winning at least one medal. Eight of the ten medallists at the 2010 World Rowing Champs were Massey students.

The value of athletes being able to pursue academic studies is well documented and the Athlete Friendly Tertiary Network will enable a more structured and effective system for both athletes and tertiary staff.

Massey University led the way to sign the agreement followed by Victoria University, AUT University and the University of Waikato.

Massey student-athlete and double Commonwealth Games medallist Amaka Gessler is in training for the World Swimming Championships and World University Games, both in China, this year. “But I’m also continuing studying towards a Bachelor of Science,” she says. “The flexibility and support offered by Massey makes it possible to continue my studies while preparing for, and competing in, these big events.”

Bachelor of Business Studies student Blair Tarrant has just returned from Malaysia with the New Zealand Black Sticks Hockey team. “It’s really good to have an opportunity to continue to study while travelling with the Black Sticks. I was studying internally but have switched to distance-learning, with Massey’s help, this year because of overseas commitments.”
