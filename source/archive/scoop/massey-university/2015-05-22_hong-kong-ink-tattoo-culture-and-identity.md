**Hong Kong Ink - Tattoo Culture and Identity**

By Helen Mitchell

This photographic survey charts how tattooing in Hong Kong has shifted from subculture to popular culture. The project examines how tattoo functions as an agent of cultural exchange and reflects the tattoo renaissance currently occurring in the Asia-Pacific region. After an initial photographic survey of Hong Kong tattooists in 2010, Mitchell returned to Hong Kong in 2015 to explore the expanded field of tattoo acquisition in an increasingly diverse client base that new tattoo parlours have established over the last five years. Mitchell showcases a range of talent and the styles of tattooists through a series of portraits that include tattoo clients from some of the best tattooists in the region along with stories from their subjects.

Helen Mitchell is a Wellington based photographic artist and academic. Mitchell has a decade long engagement with photographing and documenting tattoo stemming from research into tattoo acquisition for her Masters of Fine Arts degree. This initial investigation resulted in a number of photographic exhibitions including _Show Me Your Tattoo, Shifting Identity: The Evolution of a New Tattoo Culture,_ and _Tattoo Collectors._
