Turbo-boost from wax packs

Turbo-boost from wax packs

What more could you want? The beer, the burger and the Brazilian – oh and four tickets to the Manawatu Turbos’ long-awaited return to first division rugby.

Christopher Long, a third year Bachelor of Business Studies student majoring in sport business management and marketing communications, has helped ensure several hundred extra supporters will be at Arena Manawatu tomorrow and for the teams other home matches of the season by selling $20 Turbos packs on campus and around Palmerston North.

Today he hopes to sell the last 45 of 500 packs he prepared as part of his practicum assignment. The packs contain Manawatu Rugby Union merchandise – a green poncho, a green glove and a Turbos wristband, along with vouchers for a Big Mac McDonald’s burger, three cans of beer from the union sponsor Speight’s and a voucher from Palmerston North beauty salon Studio 31 for a Brazilian wax.

Mr Long, 20, who plays senior club rugby for Marist, is in no doubt what the major selling point was for the packs: “Definitely the Brazilian voucher. My girlfriend Jess said the pack needed something that appealed to women, although the vouchers can be used by anyone.”

He reckons about half his sales have been to women. “And a lot of guys have bought them for their lady friends.”  
While Speight’s-maker Lion Breweries and McDonald’s Restaurant in Rangitikei St, Palmerston North, were already supporters and sponsors of Manawatu Rugby, getting Studio 31 involved was his initiative, Mr Long says.  
“When I went in there I was hoping they’d give me a discount voucher, like 20 per cent off or something, but the owner Wendy Newth is so confident she will get repeat customers once they’ve had their first wax she was happy to do the whole thing free.”

Several other students from the same sport business management course have worked with Manawatu Rugby as part of their practical studies and will be responsible for match day entertainment as well as behind-the-scenes activities at FMG Stadium.

So how does Mr Long expect the team to perform? “Tomorrow, if they can score a try against Auckland or put points on the board it will be a huge step for rugby and hopefully draw people back.

“Manawatu’s such a proud rugby province and has been for years, I think if they can play with pride the community will be happy with that.”
