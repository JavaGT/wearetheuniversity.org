Pink Ladies ripe for the picking

Apple lovers with a taste for the traditional should act quickly to secure the final trees available for rent from the University’s Fruit Crops Unit. Most Pacific Rose and Braeburn trees are rented, but there are still about 20 Pink Ladies available.

Plant Growth unit manager Steven Ray said renters were guaranteed a 60kg haul of fruit, though most could expect closer to 90kg. The Pink ladies were paired up for renting as they had a lower yield, with two trees costing $50 this season.

“Pink ladies are an older style apple, a little tart with a sweet background – good for keeping and for cooking,” Mr Ray said. “Picking sessions will be held each Friday afternoon from noon to 5pm, and Saturday morning from 8.30am to 12.30pm for the next three weeks. Ladders are supplied, but pickers need to bring their own bags or baskets.”

For information on the rent-a-tree programme or to rent a tree, contact Denice Stewart on 06-350-9099 ext 5996 or email d.m.stewart@massey.ac.nz

Any apple trees not rented or used to top-up yields will be picked by staff and sold on campus.
