Vet Students Strip Off for Charity in Annual Naked Calendar

Vet Students Strip Off for Charity in Annual Naked Calendar

  
Third-year vet students from Massey University have stripped off in the 13th annual ‘Barely There’ nude calendar to help raise funds for Retired Working Dogs New Zealand, and the students’ ‘Half Way Day’ celebration.

Half Way Day is a tradition that goes back many years at Massey, marking the mid-point of the students’ five year veterinary degree. It aims to help the students unwind from their study, and spend time together as a class, outside of the lecture room. However, 10 per cent of the proceeds also goes towards Retired Working Dogs, a charity that helps to rehome former work dogs to their forever home.

This year’s calendar co-ordinators, students Aimee Alexander and Stephania Hpa said while the trip is important, the tradition is to give back as well. “We put out a poll to all of our students to see what charity they wanted. It was pretty clear that this was an amazing charity as these dogs still had a lot to give off farm, but they were also a young charity so needed a helping hand.”

It’s something we all know was coming, so we just embraced the tradition, and the daunting nature of a nude calendar. We spilt into groups for each month with the photographs being taken all over throughout New Zealand, mainly on farms but also a car museum. I will say they featured many animal co-stars, strategically placed hay bales, and a lot of laughter.

Third-year student, Tommy Mills, said “Despite a bit of awkwardness at the start, it was all worth it for a good cause.”

“Getting ready for a naked photo, with 50 other people from your class, was certainly an experience. But we have all come to be good friends over the past two and a half years (of our degree), so managed to laugh it off and enjoy the photoshoot”, third year student, Hannah Burrows, said.

The students are hoping to sell more calendars than last year, with a larger class. Calendars can be purchased for $15 from the website www.vetcalendar.co.nz, shipping both domestically and internationally. Pre-orders have opened, with the official release of the calendar on March 28th.
