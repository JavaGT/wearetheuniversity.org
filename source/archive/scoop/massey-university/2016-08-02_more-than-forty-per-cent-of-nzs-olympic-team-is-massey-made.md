More than forty per cent of NZ’s Olympic team is ‘Massey made’

With just days to go until the Rio Olympics kick off, a large contingent of current and former Massey students have arrived at the Olympic Village to compete in the Games.

The University has a record number of athletes heading to Rio – 84 of the 199-strong Olympic team are either studying with Massey currently, or have done so in the past. The impressive cohort makes up more than 40 per cent of the New Zealand team, including Black Sticks captain Simon Child, Women’s Rugby 7s captain Sarah Goss and sailing siblings Molly and Sam Meech.

Massey is well-represented in a number of teams, with 14 of the 16 Men’s Black Sticks players connected to Massey, as well as 24 of the 36-strong rowing team. This includes the entire lightweight men’s coxless fours, made up of James Hunter (Bachelor of Business Studies student), Alistair Bond (Master of Environmental Management student), Peter Taylor (Postgraduate Sport Management student) and James Lassche (former Bachelor of Arts student).

Massey University students and staff have sent hundreds of messages of support to the Olympic Village in Rio via a hand-signed flag.

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey congratulated the athletes who qualified for Rio. “On behalf of all the students here, all the staff, all the wider Massey community, we can’t do more than just to wish you every very success. Have a wonderful time, and come home proud of yourself.”

The flag travelled around the Manawatū, Wellington and Auckland campuses and was taken over to Rio by Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson, who is on site as the New Zealand Olympic Team lead psychologist. This is Professor Hermansson’s fifth Olympic Games. You can read his blog here.

Massey High Performance Coordinator Vicki Hudson says the University wanted to show its continued support for students and alumni. “I am overwhelmed by the level of support the University community has shown towards our student athletes.

“I hope the flag will inspire them during the Games, and remind them that Massey and New Zealand are behind them all the way. We know it’s not always easy juggling life and study, especially when you’re learning by distance, so the achievements of these elite athletes is truly inspirational. They are proof that if you put your mind to something, you can achieve it."

Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson: Massey University Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson is in Rio as the New Zealand Olympic Team lead psychologist. In a series of videos, he discusses the key psychological challenges facing athletes.

How do drug cheats affect clean athletes psychologically?

Despite increased concerns about the state of doping in sport, it can motivate some athletes to try harder. “Drug taking is an indication of people trying to get an edge, and I think in the next five to 10 years it’s going to be in the area of psychology where this is going to have the biggest effect.”

How do Olympic athletes handle the pressure to perform well?

Often doubt comes about when people get ahead of themselves. “Part of the job of the sport psychologist is to bring the person’s attention back to the moment. So that they can just focus on what they are in control of, as it happens, there and then, and to carry that through the event itself.”

How are athletes feeling about the risk of Zika virus?

Despite concerns, no New Zealand athletes have decided not to go to Rio, due to the risk. “There have been some very important things that have been done to try and prevent that being an issue.”
