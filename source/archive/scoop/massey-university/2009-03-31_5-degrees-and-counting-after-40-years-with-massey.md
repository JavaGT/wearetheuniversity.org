Five degrees and counting after 40 years with Massey

American astronauts had just taken their first steps on the moon when Margarret Fidow began extramural studies at Massey University.

The Auckland accountancy teacher enrolled as a Bachelor of Commerce student in 1969. Forty years later, she is still enrolled as a student and has become a pioneer of lifelong learning, with five degrees – two yet to be conferred - and two diplomas to her name.

Ms Fidow has done a Bachelor of Arts majoring in geography, a Bachelor of Science in computer science with a minor in psychology, a Diploma of Education and a Postgraduate Diploma in Development Studies. She also studied a Master of Commerce at the University of Auckland.

She marked her anniversary as a student by embarking on a Postgraduate Diploma in Geography (historical geography) and a Graduate Diploma in Psychology at Massey University. Ms Fidow has recently completed a BA in social anthropology and another in philosophy but plans to graduate next year – when she has time.

“I just love the energy that comes from learning,” she says. “I apply everything I have learnt either in my own life or through teaching others. It keeps my brain ticking over and I’ve also made many friends.”

Her title reads Margarret Fidow M.Com B.Com BSc BA Dip Ed (Distance Education) Post Grad Dip (Dev Studies).

She can also add her current professional qualifications: Fellow of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (FHKICPA), Member of the Institute of Data Processing Management UK (MIDPM), Associate of the Cost and Management Accountants UK (ACIMA) and Associate of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries (ACIS).

Ms Fidow enjoyed two-years teaching in Papua New Guinea and a near 20-year teaching career in Hong Kong but was still keen to hit the books. Her favourite subjects over the years were geography and psychology. She says that stems from her interest in people. But a paper on cognitive psychology, where she had to look a pigeon behaviour, she found distinctly odd. “I think there was a book burning ceremony after that,” she says.

Ms Fidow says she has received "amazing" support at Massey. “Mathematics was my nemesis, but I have found throughout my time at Massey that the lecturers are caring people and they gave me the extra bit of help I needed. I would advise anyone to give extramural learning a try – just do a paper at a time.”
