**Massey University - free public lecture on identity politics: Pacific to Palestine**

**IDENTITY POLITICS: from the Pacific to Palestine (free public lecture at Massey’s Albany campus – Thursday, 5 April)**

The lecture will be held in the Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatre Building (SNW300) at 6pm.  

Exploring forces and factors that shape individual and national identities in a globally connected world – from Aotearoa to Palestine – is the theme of a free public lecture at Massey University’s Auckland campus on April 5.

Well-known sociologist and commentator on immigration and population issues Distinguished Professor Paul Spoonley will open the discussion with a focus on populist nationalism.

He will be joined by colleagues, Dr Trudie Cain and Dr Rand Hazou in ‘Close Encounters in Cosmopolitan New Zealand’ – the second of ten in this year’s in the Our Changing World lecture series. The free 10-part series titled “Our Changing World”, held monthly from February to November at Massey’s Auckland campus, follows on from last year’s successful series coordinated by the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Speakers bring their expert knowledge and astute insights to topics that are front of mind for many, offering fresh perspectives and analysis of some of the more complex, gritty questions.

Professor Spoonley says the modern era of identity politics has been defined by the rise of minority nationalist, linguistic and indigenous communities, the civil rights moment and feminism.

“In the 21st century, there has been a considerable reversal as elements in white majority communities have reacted to minority and feminist politics – by actively rejecting them. Their reaction is often expressed along the lines of ‘Why should women, ethnic minorities or indigenous (non-white) groups ‘jump the queue’ for educational, housing or labour market resources and positions? Why should they be able to make claims on a government? Shouldn’t there be one law for all? Shouldn’t being an American, Australian, British, New Zealander take precedence over all other identities?’”

**Banksy in Palestine – irony or insult?**

Theatre lecturer Dr Hazou will bring a global perspective to the border where identity politics and art intersect, with a discussion of a controversy surrounding UK street artist Banksy in Palestine.

Sociologist and facilitator Dr Cain will link these topics to the central theme of the lecture – the impact of New Zealand’s increasingly diverse population and a recent surge in migrants from over 100 countries. She will explore such questions as; how well do we know and relate to one another in Aotearoa 2018? Are our core institutions adjusting to superdiversity? What about our local and national policies? What are the challenges ahead, and what is needed to ensure social cohesion – and not division – in our culturally rich, complex society?
