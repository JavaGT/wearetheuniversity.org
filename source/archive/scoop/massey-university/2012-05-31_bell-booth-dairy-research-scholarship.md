Bell-Booth Dairy Research Scholarship

**Bell-Booth Dairy Research Scholarship**

A Massey University student working on dairy calf nutrition is this year’s recipient of the $3,000 Bell-Booth Dairy Research Scholarship.

Chelsie Hansen is from Iowa in the United States, but has completed a BSc at Massey University, majoring in animal science. She is now completing papers for her Masters, studying ruminant nutrition, digestive physiology and research practice, and will then undertake a 6 month Masters research project.

Chelsie’s research project will compare protein sources used in dairy calf starter diets, looking at soy bean meal, canola meal and a combination of the two.

This is being looked at to see if these different diets affect the type of growth the calves make. Getting the right diet for calves in the first 12 weeks of life is important as it affects later mammary development and milk yield.

The project will be supervised by Dr Jean Margerison, a Massey University Lactational Physiologist.

The Bell-Booth Dairy Research Scholarship was established in 2011 by Bell-Booth Ltd to encourage postgraduate research, especially projects of relevance to the dairy industry and nutrition of calves.
