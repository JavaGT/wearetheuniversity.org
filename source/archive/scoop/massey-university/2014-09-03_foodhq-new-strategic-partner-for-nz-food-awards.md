**FoodHQ new strategic partner for NZ Food Awards**

The New Zealand Food Awards strategic partner team has been boosted by the addition of FoodHQ to the line-up.

FoodHQ is New Zealand’s international centre for collaborative food research. Based in Manawatū, it was officially launched in July last year as a partnership between AgResearch, AsureQuality, ESR, Fonterra, Plant and Food Research, the Riddet Institute, the BioCommerce Centre, Massey University, Manawatu District Council and the Palmerston North City Council. It is the largest food collaboration in New Zealand’s history.

FoodHQ programme director Mark Ward says FoodHQ’s focus is on creating high-value food products for export into growing international markets, so the strategic partnershp with the New Zealand Food Awards "makes perfect sense".

"As a centre for collaborative food research, FoodHQ is an integral part of the New Zealand food industry’s growth strategy, and we’re inextricably linked with the best of New Zealand’s food producers and the innovative processes that are being developed.

“The awards showcase the best of New Zealand to the world, and that’s very much in line with what FoodHQ intends to do – competing on the world stage with other global centres of food innovation research. We can use this opportunity to raise FoodHQ’s profile as we build on the work we’re doing with the industry.

“Our FoodHQ partners have an extensive history of research and development. We’re looking forward to adding our expertise to the team, and helping build the New Zealand Food Awards into an even better competition," Mr Ward says.
