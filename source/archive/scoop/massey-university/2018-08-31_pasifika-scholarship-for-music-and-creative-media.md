**Pasifika scholarship for music and creative media**

Massey University’s School of Music and Creative Media Production has announced a new Pasifika scholarship for study in 2019.

The scholarship, for study starting in Semester 1, is for prospective students who identify as being of Pasifika heritage and show evidence of leadership and creative potential in disciplines including animation, visual effects, film and television, web and interactive, games, music practice, music industry and music technology.

Worth $10,000, the scholarship is open to applicants who intend to enrol in full-time study for a Bachelor of Creative Media Production or a Bachelor of Commercial Music degree offered by Toi Rauwhārangi – College of Creative Arts. The scholarship can be spread across all three years of the degree for those that don’t qualify for fees free, or applied over two years.

All Bachelor of Commercial Music applicants must attend an audition (music practice) or consultation (music industry, music technology), which provides an opportunity to demonstrate their creative potential and commitment. The pre-enrolment audition or consultation is part of the entry procedure for the Bachelor of Commercial Music.

College of Creative Arts Senior Pacific Adviser Herb Bartley says supporting Pasifika leadership in our creative industries is imperative for the Pasifika arts community.

“The scholarship helps connect and support creative young people to further build on the future of music and media in New Zealand, in the wider Pacific, and throughout the world.”
