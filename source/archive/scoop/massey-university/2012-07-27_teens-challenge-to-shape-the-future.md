Teens’ challenge to shape the future

  
Flying cars, holographic pets, and a population explosion are part of the picture New Zealand teenagers are painting for the country’s future.

Teenagers are being asked to reveal what they think New Zealand will be like in 2050 in a new competition being launched jointly by Massey University and Westpac.

Both Westpac and Massey firmly believe we need to start focusing on our vision of what we want New Zealand to be and then working out how to get there – and the best people to ask are our future adults.

A pre-competition survey conducted amongst several groups of Auckland teenagers identified some of the key issues they face. These include growth in technology, environmental concerns, war, security, health, careers, loss of national identity, and growing corporate power. Some said they were inspired by the thought of solving the world’s big issues, and making the world a better place to live.

Massey Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says today’s young people – including current and future Massey students – are likely to see more change in their lives than any previous generation.

“We’re preparing students for careers that may not have even been invented yet.”

“We want to make sure that we are providing our students and future students with the right skills and ability to learn that will support their future careers as tomorrow’s leaders,” he says. “We all need to listen to their perspective, what motivates them, what they are passionate about and how we can equip them to drive New Zealand as a major player on the international stage.”

Future U is an online competition, run by Massey University in partnership with Westpac, for 13 to 18-year-olds. Teens are challenged to upload a two-minute video of their vision of New Zealand in 2050, and the challenges they think they’ll face. They have an opportunity to influence the nation’s thought leaders at an event later this year.

Westpac Chief Executive Peter Clare says, “Westpac is delighted to support the Future U forum as today’s young people are what will make New Zealand in 2050, and we need to nurture the country’s leaders of tomorrow.”

Up to 20 finalists, chosen by online voting and an expert judging panel, will attend a mentored workshop in Auckland in October to refine their vision. They will present their final version to the judging panel and the overall winner will receive a prize package for them and their school.

The competition is open until August 26, online voting closes on September 7, and finalists will be announced on September 14. The workshop, called Future Leaders, will be held in Auckland in October. The overall winner of Future U will address the opening of an exclusive two-day thought leaders’ forum, It’s Our Future – The new New Zealand Symposium, to be held in Auckland fro December 3 to 4.

Prizes include a $10,000 Massey scholarship, a $2500 cash prize package, travel to Auckland and the opportunity to appear on TVNZ U.

The competition website will be open on July 30 to upload videos.
