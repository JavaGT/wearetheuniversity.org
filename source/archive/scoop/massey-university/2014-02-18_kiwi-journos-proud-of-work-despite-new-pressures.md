Kiwi journos proud of work, despite new pressures

New Zealand journalists have contributed their experiences and opinions to a global survey of journalists.

Researchers at Massey and Waikato Universities asked full-time journalists by online survey in 2012/ 2013 about their work practices, ethical and political stance, and other views.

The survey was undertaken as part of the Worlds of Journalism Study, which will map for the first time the attitudes, ethics and work practices of journalists from all corners of the world.

First results from the New Zealand phase of the study show that New Zealand journalists are generally happy in their work, and believe the New Zealand media does a good job, despite tougher work conditions in recent years.

The typical full-time (earning more than half their income from journalism) journalist is likely to be female, slightly left-of-centre, and have a university degree specialising in journalism.

They have a strongly ethical stance, and don’t want to see more regulation of the news media, as has been proposed in other countries.

Further results from the New Zealand phase of the study will be available later this year after further analysis is completed. The first results from the Worlds of Journalism Study, comparing journalists across all countries, are expected to be available later in 2014 or early 2015.
