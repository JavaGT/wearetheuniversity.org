Reputation key to success

  
Creating a good and lasting reputation is one of the keys to success in business and in life, says former Telecom chairman Peter Shirtcliffe.

The veteran businessman, Enterprise NZ trustee and honorary member of the New Zealand Business Roundtable, was guest speaker at the Manawatu campus College of Business graduation ceremony yesterday afternoon.

Known for his public campaign against the introduction of the mixed member proportional representation voting system in 1993, Mr Shirtcliffe said the constituents of a good reputation are integrity, courage, tenacity adaptability and charm.

\"Create a good reputation and the introductions will flow, the relationships will build, the credit will be available and the deals will happen. In the new economic and financial environment into which we are entering, your earning potential will be your greatest asset – more important than the physical and financial assets you may accumulate – and a good reputation will protect that potential."

He advised graduates to treat their triumphs and disasters similarly. "To do one's best and fail is no disgrace. Nor is there virtue in winning dishonourably. Admit mistakes and learn from them. Some days you are the dog, others the phone pole."

He said graduates needed to continuously work to develop their powers of persuasion by mastering oral and written English and, when they had done that, persuade others of the benefits of private capital and market economies. "Run a mile from anyone approaching you and saying 'I'm from the Government, and I'm here to help'."
