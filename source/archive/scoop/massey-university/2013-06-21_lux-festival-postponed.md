LUX Festival Postponed

LUX Festival Postponed

The start of the Wellington LUX light festival has been postponed until tomorrow (Saturday) night due to the weather. The organisers have decided that it is safer not to encourage people to come out tonight, and some artworks need repairs. The festival will now run from Saturday to Monday nights inclusive. With the weather set to improve, the light works should provide a great boost to the spirit of the city after the storm.

Free LUX festival attractions includes:

18 artworks that use light, set up along the waterfront and in some back alleys in downtown Wellington. Many artworks are interactive. International artists are participating from: Germany, the Netherlands, UK, Norway, South Korea, Australia, Mexico.

Chalk the walk: play with glow-in-the-dark chalk under UV light along the footpath next to Frank Kitts Park (glow sticks for the kids)

Te Papa photo booth: take your photo and see it projected on the wall of Te Papa

Bring Your Own Beamer: a open event inside at People's Cinema, Manners Mall, 8-11pm, Saturday night.

The festival is also running a two-day symposium for artists, designers, architects, researchers and others in the field this weekend at City Gallery. This is a paid event. Registration: lux.org.nz
