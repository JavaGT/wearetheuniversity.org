**New science labs blessed in dawn ceremony at Albany**

  
A dawn ceremony blessing the new Student Central Science Labs was held at the Albany Campus on Wednesday.

The blessing was led by Haahi Walker (Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara kaumātua) with support from his daughter Rita and Glen Willcox, and included a tour through the two-storey building.

Head of the Institute of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Distinguished Professor Gaven Martin says the new labs will provide a great environment for undergraduate science students to learn in.

“These facilities are state-of-the-art and will support Massey’s many innovative programmes both in the new College of Heath and in the College of Sciences – it’s just great space and staff are really looking forward to getting in there and getting going. It’s a great way to start the year,” he says.

The new labs back on to the original Student Central building, which was officially opened in March 2012. The entire facility, with the addition of the labs, cost just over $21 million and it’s an investment Professor Martin says is essential to support the growing Albany campus.

The ground floor houses three physics teaching labs and an equipment room, with one lab able to be transformed into a completely dark environment for optics experiments. It is also home to technicians and tutors who will teach in the labs.

The second level has four biology labs of varying sizes with moveable walls to allow for changes in class sizes, and includes the latest ventilation technology and in-room bio-hazard showers.

An official opening ceremony for the building will be held when students are on campus.
