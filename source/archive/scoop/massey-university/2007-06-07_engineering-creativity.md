Engineering creativity

Engineering students have created six sculptures from $2 Shop toys, musical instruments and anglepoise lamps in an assignment where engineering meets art.

Structural Sculptures is an exhibition of creativity from second year Mechatronics Engineering students.

Mechatronics is the combination of precision mechanical engineering, electronic control, computer technology and a systems approach in the design of products and processes.

The engineering workshop will be transformed into a gallery space for an exhibition of work that demonstrate mechanical engineering principles.

Visitors are invited to view and interact with the sculptures, then help decide prizewinners by voting for the sculpture that captures their imagination.

Engineering lecturer Dr Paul Smith says, “A broad project brief has given the students freedom to explore their ideas, unconstrained by technical or commercial requirements.”

The project has been guided by Technology, Engineering, and Creative Arts staff.

  
Structural Sculptures  
Where: Massey University, Room 2C05, Block 2, Wallace St, Wellington  
When: Thursday 7 June at 3–6pm; Friday 8 June from 10am to 2.30pm
