Unique partnership to take Massey research global

Massey University today announced a groundbreaking partnership that will dramatically increase the commercial potential of research carried out at the University.

The partnership utilises the expertise of two already well-established commercial organisations, the BioCommerce Centre in Palmerston North and the e-centre in Albany, Auckland. The aim is to have high throughput, with Massey providing leading, innovative research and then quickly handing over the commercialisation process to the BioCommerce Centre and the e-centre.

Massey’s director of Research Management Services Mark Cleaver says the new approach will deliver solutions to New Zealand and the world.

“The partners provide the external commercial perspective on the opportunities our research provides, Mr Cleaver says. “We identify the opportunities within the University but ultimately it comes down to the market for potential products, and that is where we will rely on the BioCommerce Centre and the e-centre.

“The two keys to commercialisation are strong industry connections and investment networks; both the e-centre and BioCommerce Centre have proven themselves in these areas.”

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the approach backs the Government’s aim of boosting the economy in order to lift New Zealand’s standard of living.

“We know that as a country we have to earn more if we are to pay for infrastructure and services befitting a first-world country,” Mr Maharey says. “As a University we are embracing that challenge and doing our utmost to get our research to markets more quickly. Examples of our innovations generating economic success are found across the spectrum and throughout our history – from the recent marketing of the Omega 3 advanced nutritional products to perhaps the first globally-relevant Massey commercialisation, development of the Perendale sheep in 1956.”

The strategy will see Massey retain a stake in any start-up company formed to commercialise University research while the other aspects of the process, including marketing and investment, will be handled by the business incubator partners, which have a proven track record in research commercialisation.

“Both the Prime Minister and his Chief Science Adviser have stated that an increased investment in science is required to lift productivity and aid economic recovery,” Mr Maharey says. “We need to triple private investment in science and this new strategy shows Massey is leading the way in realising this goal.

“A perfect example of the partnership in action is Polybatics Ltd, a start-up company that designs and manufactures bionanoparticles with functional proteins attached. The technology, devised by Professor of Microbiology Bernd Rehm at the Institute of Molecular Biosciences, allows for these biobeads to be manufactured on a large scale quickly and cheaply. It has ground breaking potential in a variety of industries, from vaccines to washing powders and food processing,” Mr Maharey says.

Polybatics Ltd chief executive Tracy Thompson says the company represents a significant commercial opportunity for the country.

“This is a biotech company commercialising a platform technology with the potential to impact both the local and national economies. Massey is providing ongoing research and qualified people to feed our need for highly skilled talent. Our goal is to retain the business here in New Zealand as we deliver our high value, high margin products to a global marketplace. We are very eager to create a knowledge-based business here in the Manawatu.”

BioCommerce centre chief executive Dean Tilyard says his organisation facilitated the capital investment of $1 million into Polybatics, with investors the Manawatu Investors Group, K One W One and New Zealand Venture Investment Fund.

“It is very clever technology with high growth potential and what has been particularly pleasing is the high calibre management and directors that have been attracted.”
