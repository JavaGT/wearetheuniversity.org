Journalism education’s dynamic changes
======================================

**Press Release: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

Journalism educators are driving dynamic changes in their institutions and their own association to meet the demands of changing requiements of employers and students.

The Journalism Education Association of New Zealand has launched a new website as a portal for members, industry and people generally intersted in journalism studies.

The new site comes at the same time as members in journalism schools around the country are redeveloping their programmes.

The developments address the dramatically different job descriptions and rise in demand for the journalism skills being delivered in the digital environments of modern journalism programmes.

The website redesign has been co-ordinated by JEANZ Executive Member Cathy Strong of Massey University, who says there has never been a greater demand for quality journalism.

“Journalism educators are staying ahead of that demand, and it’s reflected in the website content which is easy to find on any platform, and in the programmes being delivered around the country.”

The new website includes news updates about member activities, resources including journalism links, student run news sites in Aotearoa and textbook exercises, contact information, and research by members.

Next week journalism educators get together for their annual conference hosted at Te Auaha New Zealand Institute of Creativity in the heart of Wellington.

The conference will cover journalism education’s response to disruption in mainstream news media, diversity of voices in journalism education, and include teaching feedback sessions.

For further information about attending the conference, about the website or journalism education in general, please contact JEANZ President Bernie Whelan on 027-706-5237.
