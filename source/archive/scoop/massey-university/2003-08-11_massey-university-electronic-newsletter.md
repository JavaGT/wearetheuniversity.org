The University has a surplus for the six months to 30 June 2003 of $9.120 million. That's a variance of $5.459 million against the budgeted surplus. The increased surplus is largely the result of a growth in international student numbers.

Renowned botanist Dame Ella Campbell died recently at the age of 93. She was the University's first woman staff member, starting in March 1945, and her vast collection of liverworts is held at the Massey herbarium. Dame Ella was also an expert on orchids and an internationally accredited orchid judge.

From next year, the University will introduce systems to better manage international student numbers. The aim is to ensure international student numbers at each campus allow quality teaching and services to continue to be provided. No current students will be disadvantaged.

A new research centre recognises the demand for innovative learning technologies. The Advanced Learning Technologies Research Centre in the College of Business will build on pioneering research in e-learning technologies, focusing on specific environments such as mobile and life-long learners. The centre has strong collaborative links with external agencies.

A two year survey shows Maori radio stations are a popular choice amongst Maori listeners. They're also an essential component in revitalising the Maori language. The survey was commissioned by the Maori broadcasting funding agency, Te Mangai Paho, and covered the broadcast regions of 21 Maori radio stations. Just over 50 percent of those surveyed listen to Maori radio.

A new initiative will provide professional development for those working in primary industries. The Certificate of Completion can be co-branded with industry partners, and may be able to be credited towards a higher academic qualification, such as a degree or postgraduate diploma. The move has been praised by the major players in the fertiliser industry.

Professor Kerry Howe is to curate a major exhibition - Waka Moana. It will tour world centres after opening in Auckland in late 2005. He was invited to join the team by the Auckland War Memorial Museum, after the publication of his new book 'Quest for Origins'.

Design graduate Lyndon Craig has won the prestigious Dyson Product Design Award. At a presentation in Auckland, Mr Craig won with the 'Digit', an ingenious fingerless glove combined with an electronic reader that uses wireless technology to speed up fruit measuring in the orchard industry. He wins a trip to the UK to meet British inventor James Dyson.

University alumni will reunite at a function in Wellingon on 18 August. Colleagues, friends and partners are also invited to the reunion to be held in the Museum building.

Four researchers have secured funding from the International Science and Technology Linkages fund. It's administered by the Royal Society and supports research projects with international connections. The four projects are within the College of Sciences.
