**Christchurch head boy wins Quote of the Year**

Christchurch Boys’ High School head boy Jake Bailey is the clear winner of Massey University’s 2015 Quote of the Year after receiving an unprecedented 77 per cent of the public vote.

The secondary school student, who is being treated for an aggressive cancer, is the first winner in four years whose quote is unrelated to world of politics.

The winning quote – “Here's the thing – none of us get out of life alive. So be gallant, be great, be gracious, and be grateful for the opportunities that you have” – came from a heartfelt prize-giving speech that went viral on social media.

Dr Heather Kavan, a speech-writing specialist at Massey University, says every now and then, a person comes along who inspires great feelings of affection in New Zealanders – and this was certainly the case with Mr Bailey.
