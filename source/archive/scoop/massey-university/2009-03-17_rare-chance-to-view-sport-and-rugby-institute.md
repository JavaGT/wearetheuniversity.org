Rare chance to view Sport and Rugby Institute

The Massey University Sport and Rugby Institute will open its doors to the public for an open day on Sunday.

The University has managed the institute for three years, providing a venue for high-level sport and corporate team training.

The Sports Day Out will showcase not only the world-class facilities available at the institute, but also offer fun activities for people of all ages.

Representatives from a large number of Massey clubs will be on-site, with visitors able to watch and participate in activities ranging from speed skating and wheelchair rugby through to squash, badminton and Jujitsu.

Commercial operations manager Denis Jenkins says the open day will give the public an opportunity to see the facility.

“While it will be a fun day with lots of things to do for all the family, it’ll also provide the chance for people to look through the facility to see what it has to offer,” Mr Jenkins says. “It is a unique facility that caters for corporate team building retreats, sports squads of all codes and levels, one-off functions and school groups.”

The institute can house up to 45 people in its accommodation block and has conference and training facilities.

“Elite-level athletes train in the gym here, but anyone can join and take advantage of the state-of-the-art facilities,” Mr Jenkins says.

Schools from around the district will be heavily involved on Sunday, with teams taking part in an obstacle course race.

There will be a backyard cricket tournament featuring teams from the University’s halls of residence, sport management staff, food technologists and economists.

Members of the Massey University Academy of Sport will also be on hand to discuss their sporting goals and how the academy can help them achieve them with budding athletes.

Plenty of snacks and drinks will be available throughout the day, but visitors are welcome to bring a picnic and make a day of it on the playing fields and take in the sights.

The open day runs from 10am to 3pm on Sunday 22 March at the Sport and Rugby Institute, Albany Drive, Massey University.
