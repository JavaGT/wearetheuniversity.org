**Top two Asia-Pacific ranking for Wellington design school**

Massey University’s School of Design, based in Wellington, is now ranked second within the Asia-Pacific region by global design award agency Red Dot. Four years ago the school was placed 11th in the same rankings.

The latest ranking confirms Massey’s School of Design as a leader in teaching design and on the eve of the University’s Open Day helps cement Wellington's place as New Zealand's creative capital.

Only China’s Zhejiang University was ranked higher.

Red Dot Design Awards (Asia) president Ken Koo says the award for the school, which forms part of the College of Creative Arts, was due recognition “for continuously and progressively, producing cutting edge and forward thinking product concepts”.

College of Creative Arts Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Claire Robinson says the ranking is validation of the university’s international excellence in design.

“This is the highest international design ranking reached by any New Zealand design school ever.”

The ranking also showed the value of design to the New Zealand economy, she said.

“Given the critical role of tertiary education and training in raising productivity, the government needs to develop a more targeted approach that includes tertiary policy and an investment infrastructure that supports the growth of our design sector.”

The latest ranking was largely achieved through the work of staff and students awarded Red Dot Awards as reward for innovation and initiative with their product concepts. A sample of three of these projects is outlined below.

Student Cameron Holder designed a rapid response facility for cleaning marine birds affected by oil spills. Fellow student Abe Winter-Beard designed an agricultural device fitted to cattle to offset pollution associated with cattle farming.

Senior lecturer Tanya Marriott designed an interactive exhibition concept to engage the public with ecological preservation issues for the Department of Conservation.

The Red Dot Design ranking for design concept recognises the top 15 companies, design studios and universities in the Asia-Pacific region. Red Dot founder and chief executive Dr Peter Zec says the awards offer the recognition companies and institutions deserve “ and encouragement toward their continued investment in design.”

Each year more than 10,000 students enter the Red Dot competition.
