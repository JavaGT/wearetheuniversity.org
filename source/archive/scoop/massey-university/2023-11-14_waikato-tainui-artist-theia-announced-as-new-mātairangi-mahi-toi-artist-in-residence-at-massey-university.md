**Theia**, who this year won the coveted **Taite Prize** for ‘**Best Independent Album’** with her reo Māori project **TE KAAHU**, will be officially welcomed with a pōwhiri on to **Te Rau Karamu Marae**, **Massey University Pukeahu campus** on **November 15**.

The **Mātairangi Mahi Toi Residency** was created by **Toi Rauwhārangi** in partnership with the office of the **Governor General** to support the development of Māori and Pacific visual arts and creative practices. Previous recipients of the residency include **Troy Kingi**, **Horomona Horo** and **Lindah Lepou**.

Through the generosity of the office of the **Governor General** artists were able to live and work in a house in the grounds of Government House. This year the college has partnered with **Te Whare Hera** to be able to continue the residency and provide a Māori artist with a paid opportunity to reside in Wellington and take full advantage of the world class facilities and resources available to them at **Toi Rauwhārangi College of Creative Arts**.

**Theia** is an enigmatic artist who effortlessly straddles the two worlds of her riot-pop namesake and her award-winning reo rangatira project, **TE KAAHU**. Both projects reflect her artistry and demonstrate a sharp wit and poetic beauty set to different sonic landscapes. Where her **Theia** bangers challenge and confront social injustices; **TE KAAHU** explores themes of spirituality, whakapapa and the environment.

Her catalogue in reo Pākehā has drawn a loyal fan base across the globe, receiving critical acclaim from the likes of **Pigeons & Planes**, **Rolling Stone**, **Clash** and **Billboard Magazine**. Her songs have earned her a multitude of nominations at the **New Zealand Music Awards**, the **Waiata Māori Music Awards**, the **George FM Awards**, as well as commercial radio play in NZ, Australia, and Asia, alongside local chart success.

**TE KAAHU** has also seen local and international success. Alongside being awarded the **Taite Prize for Best Independent Debut**, in the last 18 months **TE KAAHU** has been a finalist in the **Rolling Stone NZ Awards**, the **AMAs**, the **APRA Maioha Award**, the **Waiata Māori Music Awards**, and the **Student Radio Network Awards.** **Theia** has also toured **TE KAAHU** in Canada, performing at the iconic **Calgary Folk Music Festival** and **Folk on the Rocks** in Yellowknife.

**Theia** is excited to take up the residency and is looking forward to completing her debut **Theia** album and writing new waiata for **TE KAAHU** during the residency. “I’m honoured to join in the legacy of **Mātairangi Mahi Toi** for 2023/24 as both a proud young Waikato woman and a passionate composer and performer.”

News of the residency comes on the back of the critically acclaimed **GIRL IN A SAVAGE WORLD Tour,** which brought **Theia** and **TE KAAHU** together for the first time on the same stage. Although now officially over, **Theia** has just announced that she will present one final show for Auckland friends and fans, with an intimate performance at **Freida Margolis** in **Grey Lynn** on **December 3**. Only a few tickets remain for this show. Click here.
