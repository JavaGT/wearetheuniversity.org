**Professor Sir Mason Durie To Retire**

Massey University Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasifika) Professor Sir Mason Durie will retire from his current positions next month.

Sir Mason (Rangitäne, Ngäti Kauwhata, Ngäti Raukawa) joined Massey in 1988, established the School of Maori studies, Te Pütahi-a-Toi, and was head of school for 14 years before being appointed Massey's first Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori) in late 2002, a role that was later expanded to include Pasifika. He has been Deputy Vice-Chancellor since 2009.

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says Sir Mason provides superb leadership and has made numerous valuable contributions both internally and externally. He was successful in gaining funding to establish a Centre for Mäori Health Research, Te Pümanawa Hauora, and also negotiated the Mäori mental health programme, Te Rau Puawai, which provides up to 100 scholarships a year for students studying health-related subjects. Most recently he has led the work on establishing the planned new College of Health and has agreed to take on a role in the college at a later date.

The process to appoint a replacement for Sir Mason will be conducted over the next two months.
