**_Broadcasters take on Massey roles_**

Prominent Māori broadcasters, Scotty and Stacey Morrison will join Massey University’s Te Pūtahi-a-Toi at the beginning of September.

Both Scotty (Te Arawa) and Stacey (Ngāi Tahu, Te Arawa) are prominent television and radio presenters who have forged impressive careers in the media spanning more than two decades. They have also been closely involved in a number of significant te reo Māori revitalisation initiatives and promoting the growth and capacity of te reo Māori speakers.

Head of Te Pūtahi-a-Toi, Professor Meihana Durie, says their dual appointment signals the commencement of a new phase of advancement for the school.

“Scotty and Stacey are champions of te reo Māori communities and bring with them a formidable depth of experience in broadcasting and immense expertise as a result of working across te ao Māori (the Māori world) in many capacities. Their combined talents will support Te Pūtahi-a-Toi to make a meaningful contribution that is fully responsive to the dynamic and evolving needs of our communities.”

Distinguished Professor Paul Spoonley, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, is excited by the arrival of Scotty and Stacey Morrison.

“Massey University and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences are committed to being Tiriti-led. Te reo capability, in relation to both teaching and research, is essential to this mission. He says the Morrisons are extremely important additions to boosting the University’s capability and community outreach.”

For Scotty, the appointment represents a return to Massey, having previously lectured in te reo Māori at Albany during the mid-1990s. For Stacey, the opportunity to join Massey will enable her to bring a special dimension to Te Pūtahi-a-Toi.

“Massey has built a dynamic team and approach, which makes us very excited to join them as they launch into further innovation. We see huge potential to inspire learners to study in ways that best fit their life, learning style and goals.”

With Te Pūtahi-a-Toi now preparing to deliver more programmes at Albany, Professor Durie says their appointments are timely.

“With over a quarter of the total Māori population now living in the wider Auckland region, it is critical that Te Pūtahi-a-Toi can help bring to fruition the academic aspirations of our whānau. They both carry consistently high expectations for the place of te reo Māori across Aotearoa and we know that this determination will resonate not only with our students, but across all communities who seek to embrace the acquisition of te reo and tikanga Māori.”

Professor Durie is quick to point out the challenges ahead. “The way in which te reo Māori is taught and the needs of learners themselves continues to evolve at a rapid pace. The work that Stacey and Scotty have done in bridging the previous divide between new learners and access to immersive and experiential learning experiences will, without doubt, pave the way forward for a more informed approach to reo acquisition.”

Scotty and Stacey will shortly publish their first co-authored book entitled _Māori At Home_ and will continue their media roles when they start with Massey.
