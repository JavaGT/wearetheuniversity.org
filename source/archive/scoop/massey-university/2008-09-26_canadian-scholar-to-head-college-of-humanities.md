Canadian scholar to head College of Humanities and Social Sciences

Internationally recognised historian Professor Susan Mumm has been appointed Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Professor Mumm will join Massey in February from Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, where she holds the positions of Dean of Arts and Science, and Professor of History.

She was raised on a sheep farm in Saskatchewan, Canada and studied British history at the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Sussex, England, where she was a Commonwealth Scholar.

Her academic career began as an Assistant Professor at York University, Toronto, in 1992 and she spent more than a decade at the Open University in England, moving from lecturer to senior lecturer to head of department, before moving to Mount Saint Vincent two years ago.

She has published three books and numerous articles in her area of research and is working on a fourth book on the history of organisations for young working women in 19th century Britain.

Professor Mumm says she is looking forward to the next chapter of her academic career. “I am honoured at having been appointed to this position and am looking forward to working with the faculty, staff, and students of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences,” she says. “There is exciting work in front of us as we promote and enhance our contribution to the overall advancement of Massey University.”

Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Warrington says he is delighted to welcome a scholar of Professor Mumm’s calibre to the University. “Professor Susan Mumm brings a wealth of experience to the role in terms of both academic achievement and administrative skill,” Professor Warrington says. “Her leadership will be vital as the college continues to grow in size and status.”

Vice-Chancellor Designate Steve Maharey is looking forward to working with Dr Mumm. "Massey has an outstanding tradition in the Humanities and Social Sciences and Professor Mumm shares the University's determination to build on these strengths," he says.
