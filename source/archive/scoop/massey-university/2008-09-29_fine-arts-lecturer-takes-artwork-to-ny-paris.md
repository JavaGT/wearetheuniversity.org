Fine arts lecturer takes artwork to New York, Paris

The original artwork of a dozen self-taught New Zealand artists will be showcased in New York, after a university lecturer was invited to host a stand at next year's International Outsider Art Fair in January

Fine Arts lecturer Stuart Shepherd will also take work by self-taught Australian artists to the fair New York. It will be the first time in the fair’s 17-year history that work by Australasian artists has been on show.

“To be invited to have a stand there is really thrilling,” Mr Shepherd says. All the work will be for sale, and Mr Shepherd says sales that result will be a real affirmation for the artists, who often struggle financially on the fringes of the art community.

“I want to encourage serious investors to value this stuff. If it’s for economic reasons, that’s fine. It puts value on the people too.”

He plans to show between 10 and 100 works by each artist. The stand at the fair will happen in collaboration with the New Zealand Trade Commission, Lower Hutt's New Dowse Museum, and charitable trust Arts Access Aotearoa.

“I see this as an opportunity to close the gap between self-taught artists and the wider community. Some of my colleagues struggle to see why I’m excited about this work but this is a great opportunity to legitimise a section that has been marginalised.”

After the New York fair, Mr Shepherd will also showcase the New Zealand work at a contemporary and outside art show at the Galerie Impaire in Paris.
