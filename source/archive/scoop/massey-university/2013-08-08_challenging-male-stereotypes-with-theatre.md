Challenging male stereotypes with theatre

A theatre show that challenges sterotypes and focuses on the experiences of New Zealand men will be performed in Albany next week at the Massey’s Theatre Lab on August 14 and 15.

The production of The Brave, performed by Massive Theatre Company, is a collaboration between Massey University and Massive.

It is part of an exciting research project theatre lecturer Dr Rand Hazou says uses theatre to explore the issues around male identity in New Zealand.

The four performances – two lunchtime and two evening shows – are open to the public and will feature a post-show forum to enable the audience to discuss their perceptions and experience with the performers and Massey academics.

“The Brave is a powerful work that explores what it means to be a man in contemporary New Zealand,” he says. “This is a unique opportunity to develop research around contemporary approaches to devising performance in New Zealand. It is also a great opportunity to explore the impact of theatre as a pedagogical tool and register what impact (if any) the performance might have on audience conceptions of masculinity and male identity. We want to know if this production challenges stereotypes about what it means to be a man in New Zealand today.”

The Brave features eight men from different backgrounds who take to the stage to honour those who were once, or are still, in their lives. Combining true confessions with raw athleticism, contemporary dance, and kapa haka, they strip away every façade to reveal their innermost thoughts and feelings.

Dr Hazou is an Australian/Palestinian academic and theatre facilitator. His research interests lie in theatre that addresses human rights and engages with issues of social justice. He hopes that The Brave tour will reflect the growing cultural diversity of our region, and that the event will play an important role in facilitating networks of participation and belonging.

“As a creative producer, I am proud that Massey is in a position to facilitate creative work and community networks and I hope that the Theatre Lab will continue to consolidate its position as cultural hub in the region.”

Dr Hazou’s last production A Night in Iran was a sold-out event that drew audiences from across Auckland.
