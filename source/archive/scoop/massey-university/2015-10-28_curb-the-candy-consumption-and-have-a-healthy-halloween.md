**Curb the candy consumption and have a healthy Halloween**

It is a night many parents dread. Children walking the streets and  
taking sweet treats from strangers. But Halloween does not have to be scary. Here is how you can avoid the frightful sugar rush, and still make sure your kids have a good time.

Dietitian Miriam Mullard from Massey University’s School of Food and Nutrition, says it is important to decide on a plan with your kids before taking them trick or treating. “Eat dinner before you go out to prevent snacking on sweets. And use a small basket or bag to carry your child’s stash – no large buckets or pillow cases!

“Try to limit the time spent collecting treats to no more than an hour, or until the small basket is full, then plan a family activity like watching a movie for the rest of the evening.”

Miriam says portion control is key. “Decide how many lollies to let your child eat on Halloween, and portion out the rest – perhaps two or three small pieces that night, then one to two each day afterwards, such as one after lunch and one after dinner. Save only their favourite sweets and throw away the rest.”

So what about people who want to provide healthy treats for their scary guests? Miriam has some more tips:

\- Focus on elements of Halloween that don’t involve sweets. Decorate your home, carve or paint pumpkins, and roast the seeds. These make a tasty snack.

\- Prepare Halloween-themed foods like pumpkin soup, roasted pumpkin seeds, or eyeballs (peeled grapes) on a stick.

\- Try giving out healthier alternatives, such as little bags of popcorn, packets of raisins, dried mango, pure fruit bars, or bundle up some mini pretzels in cellophane.
