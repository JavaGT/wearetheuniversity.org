Pasifika scholarships reward persistence

Four Pasifika students at Massey received scholarships for their persistence, effort and cultural involvement today.

The Pacific Island Polynesian Education Foundation, Nova Gas and the National Bank sponsor the scholarships, which enable students to take courses that might not usually be popular with Pasifika people. The scholarships are each worth $1000.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Andrea McIlroy says the scholarships mark the relationships the university has with stakeholders and the community. She congratulated the students for their significant achievements, which recognise persistence and consistency.

National Bank scholarships were awarded to Sosene Iosia, who is studying a Bachelor of Music in jazz, and business student Jackie Simati.

National Bank branch manager Liz Walmsley says development of people and community involvement are two of the bank’s core values. “We’ve been involved in the student market for many years, and we understand the financial pressures on students.”

Nova Gas awarded two scholarships – one to business student Seru Tiqatabua, and another to design student Leilani Isara. Ms Isara, who is majoring in illustration and graphic design, says the scholarship is a huge boost, and will help with course materials.
