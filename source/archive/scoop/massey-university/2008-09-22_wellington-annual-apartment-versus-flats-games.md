Wellington students battle for supremacy in annual apartment versus flats games

Wellington campus students finished a day’s competition in Friday’s Abode Challenge with a few circuits on a keg-racing track before a prize giving and a spit roast dinner.

The annual challenge sees students from private flats and university-run apartments competing in sports and other activities, including indoor soccer, basketball, netball, and poker.

The overall winners were Team Flats, who took out the basketball and poker, while students from the combined Te Awhina and Basin Reserve apartments team won the indoor soccer.

The day is organised by staff of Events and Accommodation Services, the recreation centre, "BPM", Tussock Bar and Café and the students' association.
