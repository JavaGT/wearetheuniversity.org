Media Release – July 19, 2004

All Blacks surrender No.1 rating for first time since last year, according to Massey World Rugby Ratings

The All Blacks have surrendered their No.1 spot for the first time since losing to Australia in last year’s World Cup, according to the latest Massey University world rugby ratings.

The New Zealand rating has been in steady decline over the last four months: 98.0 on April 14, 94.2 on June 30, 93.8 on July 18 and 89.7 on August 15.

Australia’s ranking on the other hand has risen from 80.7 in fourth place to 93.3 and first place over the same period, said Massey University professor Hugh Morton, who prepares the ratings.

South Africa has held steadily over this period from 79.1 to 82.2.

\`\`For the final Tri-Nations game South Africa would win by 14 points according to our figures,’’ Professor Morton said.

\`\`I note the TAB punters seem to think it will be less, somewhere in the 1 to7 points winning margin range seems to be the popular choice. We'll see.’’
