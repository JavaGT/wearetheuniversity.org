**Terrorist attack challenges journalists’ convictions**

  
The terrorist attack on the premises of Paris-based satirical magazine _Charlie Hebdo_ is further evidence of the swiftly changing world for journalists, a journalism commentator says.

Massey University School of Communication, Journalism and Marketing senior lecturer Dr Catherine Strong says the fatal attacks are part of an alarming trend where journalists are being deliberately targeted for the job they do.

The attacks raised questions about how media outlets could increase security for their staff while continuing to encourage open debate, and whether some organisations would consider self-censorship in the face of such intimidation.

Dr Strong, who spent three years teaching multi-media journalism in Dubai, says it is common practice for foreign correspondents covering the volatile Middle East region to arrive there knowing how to say the words “I am not a journalist” in Arabic.

“Journalists are more likely to be targeted than enemy opponents over there in some cases.”

The targeting of the French cartoonists showed that all media practitioners were becoming more dangerously exposed to having their right to free speech attacked.

“Making informed comment whether with pictures or as text is a crucially important role of journalism,” she says.

If extremists continued to target the profession by violently suppressing free speech, it presented another challenge to new entrants in an industry already fighting a fragmented market, falling circulations and fewer resources.

“New journalists coming into the industry are coming into a different world and instead of being treated with respect for asking the tough questions they are being targeted for doing their job.”
