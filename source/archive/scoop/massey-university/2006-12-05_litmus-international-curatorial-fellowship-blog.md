Litmus International Curatorial Fellowship blog
===============================================

**Tuesday, 5 December 2006, 12:07 am**  
**Press Release: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

Visit the Litmus International Curatorial Fellowship blog at

  
http://situationsuk.blogspot.com/

  
Where you can read Claire's thoughts and discoveries of New Zealand so far. Acting like an 'insiders guide' to the Fellowship, this blog is a great way to keep in touch with developments around the project and is also an opportunity to feed back to Claire on her research and activities. Please feel welcome to post your own comments.

  
New posts will be added on a regular basis beyond Claire's initial residency through out next year in build up to the 2008 project.

  
\"New Zealand for me is already an event in progress - a combination of intellectual and social encounters set against torrential storms and a few minor earth tremors, collisions between the local and international, moments of total space-time compression and utter disorientation."

Please visit litmus.org.nz for full Fellowship details.
