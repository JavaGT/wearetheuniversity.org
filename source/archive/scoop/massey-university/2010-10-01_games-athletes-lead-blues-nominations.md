Games athletes lead Blues nominations

Fifteen New Zealand Commonwealth Games representatives are among the 41 student-athletes nominated for the top prizes at next week’s University Blues awards in Albany and Manawatu.

At the Albany ceremony, on Monday, nominations for sportsman and woman of the year include New Zealand representative cyclists Rushlee Buchanan and Jaime Nielsen, both Bachelor of Business Studies students. Ms Buchanan won a bronze medal with the pursuit team at the World Track Cycling Championships in Copenhagen earlier this year. Ms Nielsen is also a pursuit specialist, finishing seventh in the individual pursuit at the Copenhagen event.

Hockey players Simon Child and Elizabeth Gunson are also now in Delhi preparing for the games. Mr Child, a Business Studies student, was a member of the Black Sticks team that competed at the Champions Trophy in Germany in July. Ms Gunson is fitting a Bachelor of Science around her playing commitments, which this year have included the Champions Trophy in England.

Other nominees competing in Delhi include swimmers Moss Burmester, Glenn Snyders, Amaka Gessler, Natasha Hind, Penelope Marshall and Hayley Palmer, and sprinter Adrian Blincoe.

At the Manawatu event, on Tuesday, nominees for the top Blues awards include cyclist Lauren Ellis, who is also a member of the pursuit team in Delhi. She will be taking a break from her Bachelor of Business Studies while competing.

Boxer Angus Donaldson is the current national titleholder in the men’s lightweight division and will compete in that weight class at the Commonwealth Games. He won a silver medal in that division at the recent Oceania Games. He is studying a Bachelor of Sport and Exercise.
