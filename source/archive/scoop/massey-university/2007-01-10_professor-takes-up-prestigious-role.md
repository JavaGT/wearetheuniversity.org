Professor Takes Up Prestigious Role

Professor Janina Mazierska has been elected to a two-year term as Director of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for the Asia Pacific Region.

Professor Mazierska, head of the Institute of Information Sciences and Technology at the University’s Palmerston North campus, is the first woman to lead more than 66,000 IEEE members in the Asia Pacific region.

The IEEE is a non-profit, professional association of more than 353,000 members in 150 countries, with a budget of US$500,000,000 governed by 31 directors. Through its members, the IEEE is an authority in computer engineering, biomedical technology and telecommunications, electric power, aerospace and consumer electronics among other areas. It produces 30 per cent of the world's literature in electrical engineering, computers and control technology, holds more than 300 major conferences annually and has more than 860 active standards with 700 under development.

  
She completed her PhD at the Warsaw University of Technology in Poland, and before joining Massey University she held various roles at James Cook University for more than sixteen years. She was also a Stanford University Visiting Scholar (Ginzton Laboratory) in 1991 and 1996.

Professor Mazierska is well known for her research into precise microwave characterisation of low loss materials (especially High Temperature Superconductors) for which she has been elected an IEEE Fellow Class 2005, and for her service to the engineering profession worldwide.
