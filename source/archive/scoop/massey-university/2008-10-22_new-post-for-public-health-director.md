**New post for public health director**

Director of the Centre for Public Health Research Professor Neil Pearce has assumed the presidency of the International Epidemiological Association.

Professor Pearce was elected to the position three years ago and, after a term as president-elect, took over the role at the recent World Congress of Epidemiology in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

The association is the only global organisation of epidemiologists and has members in more than 100 countries. It publishes the _International Journal of Epidemiology_ and has also published the _Dictionary of Epidemiology_.

Professor Pearce is the first president of the association from the Southern Hemisphere.

He says his focus will be on training. “In particular, epidemiologists in developing countries,” Professor Pearce says. “We will start an IEA international education programme in epidemiology, which will run training courses.”

The first of those courses, on epidemiological methods, takes place in Jaipur, India in April next year.
