### **Animal urban search and rescue team ready to respond**

The University’s new Veterinary Emergency Response Team, the first of its kind in Australasia, is operational.

A specialist team, able to conduct technical rescues and perform in-field veterinary treatment and disaster assessment, the 12 members have been on standby since Tuesday’s earthquake in Christchurch, although to date there have been no reports of significant animal injuries.

Based at the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences at the Manawatu campus, the team comprises veterinarians, veterinary technologists and vet nurses with expertise in companion animals and livestock.

Trained by search and rescue expert Steve Glassey, who runs Rescue 3 Pacific, the team has been working closely with Wellington SPCA’s Animal Rescue Unit. The Massey team’s point of difference is its ability to provide treatment to animals in the field including in remote locations.

Team leader Hayley Squance says natural disasters in New Zealand and throughout the world have highlighted the need for animal care in crisis situations. “Many owners have risked and lost their lives for their animals and thousands more have felt long-term emotional and financial impacts of animal loss,” Ms Squance says.

The team is associated with the World Society for Protection of Animals disaster management division and may be deployed internationally if required. Ms Squance says the team will work and train with territorial authorities, civil defence, police force, fire service, the army and the SPCA, to develop a co-ordinated response to emergencies or disasters involving animals. The team will complement Massey University’s oiled wildlife response unit.
