**CT scanner gives insight into first patient’s lameness**

The University’s new computed technology (CT) scanner was used for its first equine clinical patient yesterday, and probably its largest equine patient as well.

Equine surgeon Fred Pauwels requested the CT scan of Sydney, an eight-year-old gelding being treated at the Veterinary Hospital for ongoing foot problems.

Mr Pauwels said the 1.8 m high, 750kg patient had a cyst in the pedal bone of his foot. He used the CT scan to find out how much impact the cyst had on the joint and to determine a course of treatment, potentially keyhole surgery.

More than 10 staff attended, both in the intensive scanning phase which saw a vet anaesthetist, two radiologists, two radiographers and a surgeon involved, and in the preparatory phase where the horse had to be carefully positioned and removed from the scanner.

Scan results were being interpreted today, with early indications that the horse may be facing other foot issues including important tendon damage within the foot.

“The CT scan has really proven its value” Mr Pauwels says, “The tendon damage in the foot is not visible with any other means. Had we not done the CT, I would have treated the cyst and then be wondering in a few months time why that had not solved his problems.”

The $1.1million scanning facility includes a purpose-built knock-down box where large animals can be safely anaesthetised, a hoist able to lift up to 1.5 tonnes and a $470,000 Phillips CT scanner, the only one of its type in New Zealand with an integrated table enabling scanning of large animals including horses, whales and cattle.

Initially proposed as a solution for Landcorp Farming, to enable scanning of production animals to assist development of leaner meat, the scanner can also be used for companion animals and wildlife. It has already scanned several patients in the New Zealand Wildlife Health Centre at the hospital, including kakapo and kiwi.
