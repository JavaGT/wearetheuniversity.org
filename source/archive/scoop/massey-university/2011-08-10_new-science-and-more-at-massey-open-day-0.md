New science and more at Massey Open Day

Imagine a university degree that could lead to scaling the remote peaks of the Himalayas in search of snow leopards, exploring the Ugandan jungle to observe mountain gorillas, or working with rare native kakapo.

These are among the many fascinating projects undertaken by nutritional ecologist Professor David Raubenheimer, who is programme director of a new science course that aims to address some of the world’s critical issues of the kind he encounters in his work. Aspiring scientists seeking a broader education designed to help them solve real-world problems, such as sustainable food production, biosecurity, climate change impacts and species extinction, can find out more about Massey’s new degree at the Albany campus Open Day this Saturday.

The Bachelor of Natural Sciences is a brand-new course available at the Albany campus from next year, and is based on the University of Cambridge model – one of the world’s top science degrees, says scientist and the programme’s associate programme director Dr Gayle Ferguson.

The new degree provides knowledge across the natural science disciplines and the flexibility to study beyond classical science subjects in areas including; sociology of science, sustainability, philosophy and project management, says Dr Ferguson. It encourages group and enquiry-based, research-focused learning, and aims to produce a new breed of scientist equipped to tackle the complex 21st century problems requiring cross-disciplinary knowledge, and analytical, integrative thinking.
