Fieldays site showcases new thinking on energy, effluent and environment

Massey University’s site at National Fieldays will showcase three cutting-edge projects, each taking New Zealand’s agri-food industry a step closer to sustainability.

The stand will feature a scale model of the remote farm community at Totara Valley, in the Tararua District. With collaborator Industrial Research Limited, Massey energy researchers have harnessed the power of the environment using wind, solar and hydro systems to generate electricity. Energy postgraduate researcher Mandy Armstrong will be on site each day between 10am and noon, and 2-4pm, to answer any questions about the project.

A University-led effluent monitoring project will also be featured. The project, in collaboration with Harmonic Ltd, will soon bring farmers new tools to better manage dairy effluent. Using a blend of new technology and farm-specific data, a decision support model will enable informed decision-making to support sustainable effluent practices. Farmers will receive real-time information to their mobile phone or computer.

The third project features the work of Associate Professor Marta Camps, whose research into biochar could mitigate greenhouse gases. Dr Camps is working on the potential for biochar – produced by burning waste products at high temperatures. Biochar also has potential agronomic benefits when added to soil.

University agri-food strategy manager Mark Jeffries will be at Fieldays with Director of Massey Agriculture Professor Jacqueline Rowarth and Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey. Mr Maharey says he is delighted to be attending Fieldays for the first time in his role as Vice-Chancellor of New Zealand’s leading agri-food university.

“It’s accepted that our land-based industries need to go through a step-change, enabling New Zealand to produce more food at higher quality while adding value and ensuring sustainability,” he says.

“We know these challenges are huge but Massey is ready to play its part in this change: we offer the expertise of more than 400 researchers working on every aspect of the agri-food continuum. We have 2000 ha of farmland and a history of innovation. And we’re also used to the big challenges.

“At fieldays we want to showcase that can-do approach – and take the opportunity to talk with industry about what we can achieve together to drive New Zealand forward.”

Friends of Massey are warmly invited to attend an alumni function on Thursday from 5pm at the ASB Stand (number 36).
