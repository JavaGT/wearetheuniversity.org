**Another international honour for Distinguished Professor**

The head of the newly-formed Massey Institute of Food Science and Technology (MIFST) Distinguished Professor Harjinder Singh has been elected a Fellow of the United States Institute of Food Technologists (IFT).

The IFT is the largest union of food scientists in the world and, for more than 70 years, has been unlocking the potential of the food science community by creating a global forum comprising of members from more than 95 countries. The IFT focuses on food security, food safety, sustainability and food education.

Professor Singh says it is an honour to have been elected a Fellow.

“It is a further demonstration of the international profile and impact of food science and technology research and education programmes of the Riddet Institute and Massey University.”

Professor Singh says Fellows are expected to take a leadership role within IFT and participate in think-tanks and taskforces. He will travel to Chicago in July to accept the honour.

“Only 10 or 12 people are elected as Fellows each year, and most are US-based,” he says.

College of Health Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul McDonald says New Zealanders are very fortunate to have someone of Professor Singh’s leadership.

“Professor Singh’s world-class expertise as the head of the Massey Institute of Food and Nutrition contributes to making us a leader in food and health innovations in New Zealand, offering integrated research and education across the entire food and health value chain.”

Professor Singh is a key figure helping to align the School of Food and Nutrition with Riddet Institute Centre of Research Excellence-related activities. Professor Singh is the Head of the School of Food and Nutrition and Riddet Innovation, and also serves as co-director of the Riddet Institute CoRE, while Professor Moughan is the other co-director of the Riddet Institute CoRE.

The new organisation allows students to benefit from the best of both worlds with excellent academic and teaching programmes on one hand, combined with world-class research opportunities Professor Singh says. The collaboration will ensure leading-edge programmes for students, who will graduate with exciting careers in food innovation, and a better understanding of the big food and nutrition issues facing New Zealand and the world.
