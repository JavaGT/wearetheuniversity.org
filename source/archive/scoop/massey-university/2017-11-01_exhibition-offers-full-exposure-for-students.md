Exhibition offers full Exposure for students

Massey’s eye-catching end-of-year exhibition for final year students at the College of Creative Arts opens on Friday.

Featuring colourful, practical and creative exhibits from students studying programmes at the School of Art and the School of Design, the exhibition on the Wellington campus has in past years been the launching pad for many careers beyond university.

Exhibits include a hand-held scanner for measuring the quality of kiwifruit, a coffee and water refill, re-use and recycling service and a proposed new typeface that would provide visual clues to English speakers about the correct way to pronounce te reo Māori.

All of three of these exhibits hail from the School of Design, which teaches disciplines including industrial, textile, photographic, spatial, visual communication and fashion design. The school is now ranked the top design school in the Asia-Pacific region by global design award agency Red Dot.

Exhibitors will this year be joined by the first graduates of the Bachelor of Creative Media Production. Now housed in state of the art high-tech facilities in Wellington, the programme prepares students to enter jobs in the creative media industry. Graduates, who are part of the School of Music and Creative Media Production, are instructed in a four-pronged programme addressing industry skills such as animation and visual effects, web and interactive, game design and television and film production.

All exhibitors will feature in an industry evening for stakeholders and representatives from Wellington’s design, arts and creative sectors on Tuesday.

On Thursday staff and students from the Bachelor of Creative Media Production programme host an evening showcase of films and games produced by final-year students.

The work of final year students from the fashion design programme will be paraded at an annual fashion show on the campus over the weekend of Friday-Saturday November 10-11.

College of Creative Arts Pro Vice-Chancellor, Professor Claire Robinson describes the fortnight-long Exposure programme as “the biggest student exhibition ion New Zealand,” with more than 350 students showing their work.

Exposure is launched with an opening function on Friday at 6pm and continues daily from November 4-18 in the creative arts precinct located around Block 12, Te Ara Hihiko, on the Wellington campus.
