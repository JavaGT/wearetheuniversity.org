Local history tells a bigger story – Whanganui series
=====================================================

**Press Release: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

New Zealand soldiers – from heroes to conmen – who served in other countries’ armies during WWI is the topic of a public history seminar next week by Professor Glyn Harper.

He opens a five-part series running for the third year in a partnership between the Alexander Heritage and Research Library, the Whanganui Regional Museum and Massey University’s W. H. Oliver Humanities Research Academy.

Professor Harper’s talk, _For King and other Countries: New Zealanders at war 1914-1919,_ is a taster for his new book due out next year. The series, titled _Home and Away,_ includes new and established historians talking about their research on the environment, immigration, war propaganda and naval history.

Professor Harper will share some of his latest research findings, including that a much higher number of New Zealanders than previously thought – more than 10,000 – enlisted in foreign armies during WWI, for a variety of reasons. Around 4000 joined the British army, often those from rich, middle-class families for the prestige. A further 4000 joined the Australian Imperial Army because it was easier to enlist, especially for younger, or older and infirm men who did not make the cut for the New Zealand army. Others joined armies of France, Canada, India and South Africa, and several even enlisted in the German army.

Professor Harper’s talk also touches on New Zealand war heroes in foreign armies, such as Alfred Shout – a New Zealand-born and Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, and other distinguished soldiers and servicewomen, as well as the occasional conman or rogue whose stories he has uncovered.

The series aims to raise awareness of the presence of history in the local community as well as celebrating students embarking on careers in “the rich field of New Zealand historical research,” says the series coordinator Associate Professor Kirsty Carpenter.

Professor Harper’s talk highlights the link between local and global history, she says. “Whanganui’s link to this was by correspondence with relatives and connections to the Whanganui Collegiate School, where a number of the soldiers who Glyn is going to talk about had been students.”

**Small events encapsulate grander stories**

Local history is never just local – it fits into a much broader picture about what happened and how we understand the past, says Dr Carpenter, a specialist on the French Revolution who lectures in the School of Humanities at the Manawatū campus.  
She says the key inspiration for the seminars is; “raising awareness of the value of our own history in the locality, and how local history and local archives fit and filter into national history and national archives –likewise to international history and international archives.”

“What has small beginnings can end up as central to the history of continents and empires. All the pieces of the puzzle are important, and they begin with people valuing their own family history and local history enough to preserve it and the documents that come into their possession. Only in this way can we arrive at histories of the local communities, towns and provinces of New Zealand.”

Dr Carpenter says the seminars in this series have “played a role in uniting people with interests, either as future university students, or adults interested in their family connections and local history with professional academic historians and trainee historians.”

She is currently working on a book – with local and distant links – about refugees during the French Revolution, including one who stowed away to New Zealand under an alias, married a niece of Te Rauparaha (chief and warrior of Ngati Toa who played a lead role in the Musket Wars), with which he had eight children, leaving a trail of New Zealand descendants right down to the present day.
