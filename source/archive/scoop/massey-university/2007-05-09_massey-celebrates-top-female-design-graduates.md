Industrial design graduate Lucy Cant was awarded the 2007 Zonta Design Award last night in Wellington.

It was presented by Wellington Mayor Kerry Prendergast and award sponsor Melissa Dodds from Weta Workshop.

The awards honour the top female graduates from the University’s School of Design.

The five finalists were: Lucy Cant, industrial design, sponsored by Weta Workshop; Nina Wells, visual communication design, (Saatchi and Saatchi); Rachel Higham, fashion and textile design, (Rembrandt); Rosemary Horn, photographic design, (Image Lab) and Hannah Ferens interior design (Limited Editions Interior Design).

Zonta is an international club of business women. The Zonta Design Awards reward the aspiring designers with a cash prize of $1000 for the four runners-up and a $5000 prize for the supreme winner.

Ms Cant says, "It's a huge honour to be given the award.

“These awards celebrate the unique perspective women bring to design. We invent, create and pour ourselves into our work.”

She is now working on film projects at Weta Workshop under Richard Taylor, who is a graduate of the School of Design.

She is interested in sustainable design, which aims to reduce the amount of materials used to create a design and considers the effect it has on the environment.

In 2006 she won a Wellington City Council Scholarship for Creativity and Innovation.
