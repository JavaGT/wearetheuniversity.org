**Defining social work in Aotearoa**

A new book published by the Massey University Press looks back at the past 40 years of research and teaching Social Work at Massey University.

_Defining Social Work in Aotearoa: Forty Years of Pioneering Research and Teaching at Massey University_, is co-authored by Dr Michael Dale, Hannah Mooney and Associate Professor Kieran O’Donoghue from the School of Social Work.

Forty years ago, Massey was the first New Zealand university to offer a social work degree. Relevant to all social workers today, this book highlights the political and social backdrop against which the profession has developed over the past four decades.

“It also casts a critical eye over the key issues and trends that continue to preoccupy the profession, policy-makers, politicians, the media and the general population,” Dr O’Donoghue says.

“It highlights the remarkable and influential body of work of Massey social work students, staff and alumni since 1976.”

The book gives readers a context for understanding the issues and challenges that social work in Aotearoa New Zealand works with, the knowledge base it has developed and the contribution that social workers make to enhance the well-being of people who use their services, as well as the profession’s efforts towards a more humane and just society.

The book is being launched at the School of Social Work professional development seminar for local social work practitioners and alumni this Wednesday (September 27) in Palmerston North, coinciding with National Social Workers Day.

Professors Robyn Munford and Jackie Sanders, together with Raechel Osborne, Sue Gardiner and Darryl Gardiner from Kapiti Youth Support, will give a presentation on the application of the PARTH model as a way of developing meaningful support for young people. Ange Watson from the School of Social Work will present the findings from her master’s research study Tukia: Ma te hē, ka tika – exploring Māori social workers’ experiences of the collision of their personal, professional and cultural worlds. Dr Kathryn Hay will present her research on social work and emergency management.

The day will conclude with the book launch. Dr Leland Ruwhiu and Dr Sarah Fraser will speak at the launch about the contribution the book makes to social work and social work education. Dr Ruwhiu is a

Massey University graduate, a leader in the social work field and a former Massey staff member. Dr Sarah Fraser, also a Massey graduate, is the current President of the Council of Social Work Education in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Massey University’s School of Social Work offers qualifications that lead to registration as a registered social worker, as well as post-graduate qualifications to advance professional development.
