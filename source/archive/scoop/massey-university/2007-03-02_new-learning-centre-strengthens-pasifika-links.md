New learning centre strengthens Pasifika links

Links between Pasifika students and the University were strengthened with the opening of a new Pasifika Learning Centre at the Wellington campus this week.

Pastor Jacob Semeri welcomed the initiative. “Today we are sowing a seed to reap a future of wisdom and knowledge.”

Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Andrea McIlroy says the University’s Pasifika strategy aims to increase gains for Pacific peoples through teaching, research and consultancy services.

“Opening the Pasifika Learning Centre is a significant step. It provides a place for study and companionship, and where Pasifika students can connect with the University.“

In 2006 Professor Sitaleki Finau was appointed as Director Pasifika, a first for any New Zealand university. The University has about 1000 Pasifika students enrolled, half extramural, and half internal at its three campuses.

With the Pacific population of New Zealand growing significantly, Massey aims to position itself as a key university in the Pacific region, committed to the achievement of Pacific peoples whether in New Zealand or in island states.
