Venice, Basel, Muenster … Wellington

Four major European art events – the Venice Biennale, Art Basel, Sculpture Projects Muenster and Documenta 12 – opened consecutively in June 2007, showcasing recent international developments and current trends in contemporary visual arts practice.

Many New Zealand visual arts practitioners found their way to Europe this year to view these events and participate in this international exchange. Come and hear the views, insights and perspectives from a range of artists, writers and curators fresh from these European events.

Designed as a platform to share ideas and responses to the Grand Tour, the forum will consist of two panel discussions introduced by four individual takes on the exhibitions themselves.

In true European style, discussions will continue over refreshments on offer from the embassies of Germany, Italy and Switzerland, the European Delegation and the Goethe-Institut, together with the sounds of visiting Leipzig-based D.J. Matthias Tanzmann.

Speakers include:  
Paula Booker (Writer and Curator, Enjoy Public Art Gallery)  
Brian Butler (Director, Artspace; editor of Speculation),  
Jon Bywater (Writer and Curator; Lecturer, Auckland University Elam School of Fine Arts),  
Natasha Conland (Curator, Auckland Art Gallery),  
David Cross (Artist and Writer; Associate Professor, Massey University School of Fine Arts)  
Heather Galbraith (Senior Curator, City Gallery Wellington),  
Gavin Hipkins (Artist; Senior Lecturer, Massey University School of Fine Arts)  
Charlotte Huddleston (Curator, Te Papa Tongarewa; Documenta 12 Intern) and  
Melanie Oliver (Assistant Curator, Govett-Brewster Art Gallery; Documeta 12 Intern).

What: Grand Tour panel discussion  
When: Tuesday 6 November, 4.30pm–7.30pm, followed by refreshments and music  
Where: Museum Building Theatrette, Massey University, Buckle St, Wellington
