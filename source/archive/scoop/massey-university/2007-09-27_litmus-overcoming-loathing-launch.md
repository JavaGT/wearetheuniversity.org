“Walk a mile in my slippers: soap opera’s appreciation for the unenthused” is one of the many titles mooted to be part of Overcoming Loathing, an ancillary pamphlet project attached to the current sixth issue of Natural Selection and presented in conjunction with Gwyn Porter’s stay in Wellington as the Massey University School of Fine Arts/ Rita Angus inaugural Writer-in-Residence. Dedicated to “problems” (yours, dear reader, the ones you perpetually stare down, surmount, or otherwise negotiate) these expedient publications offer solutions to a multitude of ongoing issues we all face. Overcoming Loathing offers pamphlets of unsolicited advice ranging from personal health care to tips on surviving in the workplace to folklore guides to drug taking in New Zealand.

Originally conceived of for the Living Newspaper event as part of Natural Selection’s participation in the documenta 12 Magazines project, the production of Overcoming Loathing fell over in Kassel due to a series of problems (familiar feelings again, dear reader?). At last realised and up for offer, Overcoming Loathing could be seen as a contemporary suggestion of Lenin’s “collective organiser”, offering forth a generative series of writings for distribution and addition. In true cooperative spirit, some titles for the Overcoming Loathing series have been collectively authored and will continue to grow in an ongoing cycle of production in response to the energies of the writers involved.

The School of Fine Arts began its artist-in-residence programme in 2002. Working in partnership with the Thorndon Trust, caretakers of the Rita Angus Cottage, Massey University has established an opportunity for significant visual arts practitioners, both here and overseas, to develop a particular body of work in situ in Wellington. The residency is research focused with the aim of enabling practitioners to concentrate on developing a particular strand of their practice.

The residency is now entering its fifth year. In that time it has hosted artists from Germany (Thomas Bayrle), England (Rachel Chapman) and New Zealand (Ronnie van Hout, David Clegg, Monique Redmond, Dane Mitchell).

Gwyn Porter is an established New Zealand writer, editor and curator. Alongside catalogue and magazine writing for both national and international publications, Gwyn lectures at the Manukau School of Visual Arts and is a member of the Auckland-based artist collective Cuckoo. She is co-founder and editor of the Australasian online Arts Magazine Natural Selection (www.naturalselection.org.nz) established 2004, and co-founder of Clouds Publishing (www.clouds.org.nz) established 2006. Previously she was editor of the historical journal Log Illustrated and worked as the curator for Dunedin Public Art Gallery from 1994-9.

Natural Selection is an Australasian art reviews magazine edited by Gwynneth Porter and Dan Arps, and based in Auckland, New Zealand. Designed by Warren Olds, it is an online magazine distributed as a PDF that people can print out and assemble as a craft project (www.naturalselection.org.nz)
