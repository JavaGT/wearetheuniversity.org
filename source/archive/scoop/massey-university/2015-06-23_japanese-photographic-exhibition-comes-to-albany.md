**Japanese photographic exhibition comes to Albany**

An uplifting exhibition of 123 photographs showing aspects of the Tohoku region in Japan before its devastation by the 2011 tsunami and earthquakes, will open at Massey University’s Auckland campus library on July 11.

_TOHOKU: Through the Eyes of Japanese Photographers_ is a Japan Foundation travelling exhibition featuring photographs of the region located in north-east Honshu, that were taken by nine individual photographers and one photographers’ group.

The photographs, allowing visitors a glimpse of the region as it used to be, range from images taken in the 1940s through to just before the devastating tsunami and earthquake.,.

Auckland campus registrar Andrea Davies says it is apt that the Albany campus is hosting the exhibition in Auckland.

“Massey University was the first university in New Zealand to offer Japanese language courses, so hosting this wonderful exhibition on campus is truly fitting. We are delighted to welcome people from all over the wider Auckland region to experience this fantastic exhibition in our library.”

The new Consul-General of Japan in Auckland Mr Yoshitaka Yokoyama will be attending the opening reception on July 10, prior to the public opening of the exhibition on July 11. He hopes it will open a window on the Tohoku region’s beauty before the earthquake and tsunami hit.

“The great earthquake that assaulted Japan on March 11, 2011 devastated the Tohoku region. I will never forget how quickly New Zealand answered with waves of sympathy and support for the recovery effort – even though New Zealand had just had its own disaster with the Canterbury Earthquake,” he says.

“The media coverage of the destruction made many people familiar with the names of Tohoku cities and prefectures, but I believe few are likely to have a broad knowledge of other aspects of the region - its climate, natural and cultural environment, history, way of life, or people.

“This exhibition does not attempt to document the damage or recovery but instead uses photography to show the natural and cultural environment of Tohoku along with its people and their way of life. By presenting the viewpoints of highly individualistic photographers, this exhibition aims at introducing many fascinating aspects of Tohoku to the people of the world. I hope the brilliant artistic expression of these talented Japanese photographers will familiarise New Zealand people with this region,” Mr Yokoyama says.

The exhibition was curated by photography critic Kotaro Iizawa, and shows the varied faces of the region, which is divided into six prefectures: Aomori, Iwate, Akita, Yamagata, Miyagi and Fukushima. It is known as the centre of the Jomon culture, which was developed by some of the first people living in Japan.

Known for the flame-like forms of its pottery, this culture flourished in Tohoku between 15,000 to 3000 years ago before the centre of political power and culture shifted to Nara and Kyoto in western Japan. However, aspects of the Jomon culture and spirit have survived.

Photographers Teisuke Chiba and Ichiro Kojima photographed Tohoku in the 1950s and 1960s, while Hideo Hega, Masatoshi Naito and Masaru Tatsuki recorded festivals and fold religious rites throughout the region. Hiroshi Oshima and Naoya Hatakeyama combined their personal histories with the landscapes of their home regions. Meiki Rin turned his camera towards the beautiful natural environment, while Nao Tsuda searched for the source of the Japanese spirit in relics and artifacts of the Jomon period. A group of photographers, led by Toru Ito, created the Sendai Collection, comprising a series of photographs of anonymous scenes in Sendai, Miyagi prefecture.

The exhibition has already been displayed in Christchurch’s Artbox Gallery, and the Wellington Central Library before coming to Auckland. It is free to visit and parking is available on campus.
