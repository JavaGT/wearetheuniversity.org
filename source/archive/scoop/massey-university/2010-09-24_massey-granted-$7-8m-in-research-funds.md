Massey granted $7.8m in research funds
======================================

**Massey granted $7.8m in research funds**

Eleven Massey University research projects have received Marsden funding totally $7.8 million, representing 13 per cent of the total $60 million allocated among 13 organisations this year.

Two awards are for "fast-start" projects and nine are for standard projects over the next three years. A project led by Professor Gaven Martin was extended for another two years, with new funding of $600,000.

Acting Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Robert Anderson says the announcement maintains the University’s sustained success. “Our academic staff are at the forefront of research in New Zealand,” Professor Anderson says. “The diversity of projects is a testament to the University’s breadth of academic research and shows we are finding new areas for research.”

The Marsden Fund, administered by the Royal Society of New Zealand on behalf of the Government, supports projects in sciences, technology, engineering and maths, social sciences and humanities. It is extremely competitive, with just 252 of the 1089 preliminary proposals received asked to submit a full proposal and 102 getting final approval, a success rate of 9.5 per cent.

Marsden Fund Council chairman Professor Peter Hunter said it was encouraging to see such a high standard of proposals coming through in all areas. “The Marsden Fund supports investigator-driven fundamental research, and plays an essential role in building a healthier, socially more cohesive and economically stronger nation.”
