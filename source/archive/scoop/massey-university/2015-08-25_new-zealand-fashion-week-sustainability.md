**New Zealand Fashion Week - Sustainability- #NZFW #SNZFW #sustainablefashion**

With New Zealand fashion week 2015 in full swing this week, Space Between and Sustainable Fashion have joined forces to incite change in the industry by raising awareness for the true cost of ethical sustainable fashion. They will do this by facilitating NZ brands to share information about their supply chain during NZ Fashion Week.

Jennifer Whitty is the project lead at Space Between, a new social enterprise for fashion situated at Massey University's College of Creative Arts, which is about exploring alternatives to mass-produced high-waste clothing, and creating ethical business opportunities for new designers. Space Between explores new research strategies that shift fashion towards zero waste through products and services, to challenge and amplify experiences of consumption, retail and post- purchase.

Bec McMaster is the Lead Catalyst at Sustainable Projects, who have just launched the Sustainable Fashion project-a new collaborative initiative to raise awareness among consumers, fashion labels and retailers through a pop-up exhibition and shop that will tour the country in 2016 and beyond.

Both projects believe in the positive power of fashion but at a time when fast fashion costs as little as a take a way meal it is important that the industry unites to create an industry that values people, the environment, creatively and profits in equal measure. Space Between and Sustainable Fashion are working together to support brands on the transition towards a sustainable future and to advocate for what NZ designers are doing, particular in regards to slow fashion an alternative to mass-produced high waste garments.

Jennifer Whitty says "both projects aim to raise the value of fashion, to support and encourage the industry to tell their stories more broadly, to encourage a positive dialogue around sustainability and fashion.”

Bec says 'we want to raise awareness of the Fashion Revolution Movement and assist the NZ media in asking the 'right' questions about fashion and the design process.”
