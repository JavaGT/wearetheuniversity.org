Open Day showcases diverse Albany campus

Prospective students will have a chance to fly a plane on a specially designed flight simulator, read the news on television or invest in the share market at the Albany campus Open Day on September 12.

Aspiring broadcasters and those interested in studying media and communications can test their nerves and vowels as news anchor in a mock newsroom complete with cameras and replayed tapes to assess their talent at reading from an autocue.

For those who would rather be behind the camera, there is the Report on Open Day competition organised by the School of Cultural and Social Studies, with three $1000 university bursary prizes for the best three entries. These can be in the form of a written or photo essay, or a mini documentary.

The school’s English Studies department is also running a Haiku poetry competition. Scribes must pen three Haiku on their Open Day experience for a chance to win an iPod touch. The judge is senior lecturer, poet and editor Dr Jack Ross.

For the engineering and technology-minded, there will be a demonstrations of Robo Soccer (a game developed by computer science researchers), and a high-action Vex robotics competition – a team robotics game that the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology introduced to New Zealand schools last year.

The Hulme Supercar will be on display as a symbol of innovation being nurtured at the engineering school and the University's Auckland School of Design, which offers transport design as well as industrial and visual communication design. Visitors can find out more about the school’s new Integrated Design degree to be introduced next year.

Prospective business students can try their hand at The New Zealand Investment Game, created by investment advisor and former College of Business lecturer Frank Newman, which aims to raise the financial IQ of players and teach investment strategies based on real-time market indicators.

Those with an interest in psychology can test their truth-telling tendencies on the lie detector machine, while budding jazz musicians can pre-register for free workshops with top jazz tutors for voice, piano, bass, jazz flute, drums and guitar which will run throughout the day.

Open Day offers a feast of information and fascinating displays representing all five colleges on the campus and including specialised degrees and programmes from food technology and nutrition to speech and language therapy and information technology (come and find out your geek rating!). Guest lectures by historian Associate Professor Peter Lineham and mathematician Distinguished Professor Gaven Martin give visitors the chance to hear great minds communicating their knowledge.

Food stalls, live rock and jazz and Pasifika cultural performances will bring a festive buzz to the day, and informative seminars; such as navigating university jargon, and a question and answer panel by extramural and mature students, will ensure students from all walks of life will come away with new insights into university life and information about courses they want to pursue.
