**Students asked to rate University’s services**

Twenty thousand students are about to be asked how they rate the support and service they receive from the University.

The student experience survey goes on-line next week. Conducted annually, it is used to improve service provision and identify student concerns.

For the first time, feedback on student experience will also be used in collaboration with another institution, Victoria University of Wellington. The universities, which are also joint shareholders in the New Zealand School of Music, will run a shared student experience improvement project using these results.

“The results we get from this survey are a loud, clear message from students and help drive changes to these services,” student management director Dr Pat Sandbrook says. “Overall student satisfaction with administrative and support services is high by comparison with other organisations and it increased by a further 5.4 percentage points last year, but that does not mean there isn’t more we can do.”

Last year 6839 students responded to the survey, Dr Sandbrook says. “We’re hoping to increase the response rate and get it closer to 50 per cent this year. It’s a case of raising awareness that the benefits of participating in the survey are seen in improved services to students.

“As a result of last year’s responses, we are changing enrolment and advisory processes, staff training, information on the web, IT support and organisational structures. Some of these are minor refinements; others are more comprehensive; all of them reflect an acceptance that we can do things better and students will benefit from that.”

The survey measures experience with services such as enrolment, commencement, campus life, study support, information provision and communication with students. A separate survey is used to gather feedback on students’ academic experiences.

An email invitation to participate will be sent to all students – internal and distance. Results survey will be available in June, after which University staff will work with students’ association representatives to analyse the responses and consider changes.
