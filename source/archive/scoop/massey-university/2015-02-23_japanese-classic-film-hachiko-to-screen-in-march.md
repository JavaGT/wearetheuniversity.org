Japanese classic film 'Hachiko' to screen in March

**Japanese classic film _Hachiko_ to screen in March**

The classic 1987 Japanese film _Hachiko monogatari,_ shown on 16 mm film stock, will screen film at Massey University’s Auckland campus on March 2.

The free films are brought to New Zealand with the kind permission of the Japan Foundation and the Consulate-General of Japan, and are shown in Japanese with English subtitles.

Auckland campus registrar Andrea Davies is delighted with the Japanese film screenings to date.

“We have had a fantastic response from members of the wider community who now feel welcome to come along to our Japanese film screenings. It’s great to see so many people on campus, and with the new semester having just started, it’s a fantastic way for our students and staff to enjoy our diverse campus life.”

_Hachiko monogotari_ is based on the true story of a loyal golden Akita dog, Hachiko. The film covers his entire life from the early 1920s to the mid-1930s.

Adopted by Professor of Agriculture Hisesaburo Ueno as a puppy, Hachiko greets him at the end of each day at nearby Shibuya station. When his owner dies suddenly and fails to return home, Hachiko spends the next nine years returning to the station each day, at precisely the time the train was due.

The story of Hachiko has become well-known throughout Japan, and his legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty. A statue in his likeness was erected at Shibuya Station in Tokyo, and another in his hometown in front of Odate Station. The exact spot where Hachiko waited in the train station is permanently marked with bronze paw-prints and a plaque explaining the story of his loyalty.

In a slight departure from previous screenings, this film is presented on 16mm film stock, so there will be a couple of intervals when film reels are changed. Attendees are welcome to bring their own food and drink.

Preceeding the main feature is a short 15-minute documentary on life and culture in Japan, which starts at 6.15pm. No bookings are required to attend the films, which are held in the Atrium Round Room, on the ground floor of the Atrium Building. The films will also be shown at the University of Waikato on March 12, and at the University of Auckland on March 26.

The next two films in the series will be stop-motion animation film _KOMANEKO – The Curious Cat,_ and _KOMANEKO’S Christmas_ screening on April 13, and comedy _Sumo Do, Sumo Don’t_ on May 4.
