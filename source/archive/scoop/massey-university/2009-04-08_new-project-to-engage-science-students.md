New project to engage science students

A national project has been launched to find ways to get more scientists in New Zealand by examining the transition from secondary schools' science classes to university degrees.

Funded by Ako Aotearoa, the National Centre for Tertiary Teaching Excellence, the project is considered to be of significant strategic value to the tertiary sector. It is a joint initiative involving Massey's College of Sciences and College of Education.

The project team, made up of Massey staff, will be overseen by a group including the principals of Wellington High School, Palmerston North Girls' High School and Palmerston North Boys' High School, and the head of biology from Rangitoto College. Its findings, due by the middle of next year, will help shape the content and delivery of science, engineering and technology degree programmes.

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says there is a need for tertiary education to examine science curricula and teaching in response to the changes taking place in secondary education. Failing to do so will put universities at risk of not meeting the expectations of today’s students, he says.

Professor Tim Parkinson from the College of Sciences is leading the Project Team, which includes Bill MacIntyre and Marg Gilling (College of Education), Gordon Suddaby (Centre for Academic Development), and research associate Helen Hughes.

Professor Parkinson says it is vital that universities convey to schools what university science is about.

"It is increasingly clear that not enough students are enrolling in degrees in science, engineering and technology to meet the demands of New Zealand's industry," he says. "There are more jobs than scientists. That's not just the schools' responsibility; it's our job to make young people aware of what we've got and where it can take them.

"We are hoping to show young people that there is a pathway from interesting secondary school science to exciting and fascinating tertiary science, to careers that are valuable and rewarding. It’s all about making science engaging and challenging right through the education system.”

Palmerston North Girls' High principal Melba Scott describes the project as very exciting. "The transition from school to tertiary education is one of the factors that we are interested in," she says. "If we can learn from the University about the opportunities in the field of science, then that is going to inform our students and possibly motivate them to continue studying.

"The other exciting thing is the opportunity to reflect on teaching practice in secondary schools; also the potential for collaboration to identify what works for learning."

The reference group members are: Pru Kelly (WHS), Melba Scott (PNGHS), Barbara Evans (Rangitoto), Tim O’Connor (PNBHS), Nick Roskruge (Kaiarahi Maori, College of Sciences) and retired schools careers counsellor Bob Rosemergy.
