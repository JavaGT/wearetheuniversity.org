**Online news no death knell for newspapers**

Online news is a massive challenge to print media, but it will not kill off the traditional newspaper, the former head of News UK Mike Darcey told a journalism conference in Wellington today.

The ex-Wellingtonian this morning spoke at the opening of the Journalism Education Association Conference, being hosted by Massey University’s Journalism School.

“I am optimistic for the future of professional journalism, even printed newspapers, despite the challenge of the free web,” he said.

Mr Darcey moved to England 25 years ago, where he held positions as strategy director and then chief operating officer at broadcasting and telecommunications giant BskyB, before heading News UK from 2013 to 2015.

News UK publishes The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun.

“Journalism plays an important role in a society, but the advent and proliferation of online news has disrupted the old business model that newspapers relied on for survival.

“This is proving to be a serious risk to the future of newspapers,” Mr Darcey said.

“But the problem is more complex than readers getting their news for free online, advertising revenue has also been impacted.”

He believes a paid-for edition model, in both print and digital form “looks the best bet to fund serious journalism going forward”.

However, he said he believes this does not spell the end of the printed newspaper.

“I believe there will be an enduring demand for the bundle that we think of as a newspaper.

“I accept that demand is less than in the past, but there is a stable base and I think we will still be printing in 20 years’ time.

“There has always been an emergence of new media alongside the old and history shows the result has been co-existence and not elimination,” Mr Darcey said.
