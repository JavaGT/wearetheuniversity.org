‘Gay rainbow’ speech wins Quote of the Year

For the second year in a row the Massey University Quote of the Year competition has been taken out by a Member of Parliament.

Maurice Williamson’s now-famous ‘gay rainbow’ speech beat out the competition with an impressive 38 per cent of the vote.

Dr Heather Kavan, a speech-writing specialist at MasseyUniversity’s School of Communication, Journalism and Marketing, says the quote’s win was expected.

“This speech had global impact – it has almost one and a half million views on YouTube and famous people including Stephen Fry and Ellen DeGeneres liked it, but what makes the quote so appealing is its irreverence,” she says.

“Several people commented on international social media that, in the countries they came from, no politician would have the courage to make fun of a priest in a televised parliamentary speech.”

Mr Williamson’s colourful support for the bill clearly struck a chord with New Zealanders as seven different lines from the speech were nominated.

“They were all great quotes and it was difficult to choose between them,” Dr Kavan says. “In the end we chose the gay rainbow quote because the speech became known as the gay rainbow speech.”

The competition runner-up, with 16 per cent of the vote, also related to one of the key political issues of 2013 – just what information are government agencies collecting about us? The quote, “The GCSB, the only government department that will actually listen to you” is also the first time a non-attributed quote has made the shortlist.

“Several anonymous quotes from social media were nominated this year, including this one, which reflects the growing use of social media,” Dr Kavan says. “But this quote stood out because it was funny and most people can relate to having a frustrating experience with a government department.”

Dr Kavan says this year’s voting reflected the importance of issues, but also that Kiwis enjoy a bit of a “While the top three quotes are political, I think a lot of people also voted for the quote they thought  
was the funniest, rather than for political reasons. The issues are important – especially to those deeply affected – but so is the wit.”

At the beginning of December Dr Kavan and her judging panel narrowed down several dozen entries nominated by Massey students and the general public to a top 10. The shortlist was then put to a public vote to find the winner.
