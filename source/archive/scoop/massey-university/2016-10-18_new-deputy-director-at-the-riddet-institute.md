Massey University’s Riddet Institute is today welcoming Professor Warren McNabb, as the Centre of Research Excellence (CoRE) deputy director.

Professor McNabb joins Massey following his most recent role as research director at AgResearch. He is also a Principal Investigator at the Riddet Institute and is a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences.

Riddet Institute co-director Distinguished Professor Paul Moughan says Professor McNabb’s move to the Institute means a return to fundamental research. “I am delighted Warren is joining the team, and look forward to seeing him in a high-level science leadership role. He has had an excellent career of leadership in agrifoods science. It is wonderful that a person with so much yet to give to leadership in foods and wider agriculture, has been retained by the Riddet Institute.”

Professor Giselle Byrnes, Assistant Vice-Chancellor, Research, Academic and Enterprise for Massey University, who chaired the selection committee for the recruitment to this position says, “We are delighted to welcome Professor McNabb to the Riddet Institute and look forward to his leadership, both in advancing the Institute’s engagement agenda and in progressing key science research projects, including building research capability and capacity through postgraduate supervision.”
