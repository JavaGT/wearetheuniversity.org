Three new professors emeriti

  
The Massey University Council has conferred the title of Professor Emeritus on three recently retired academics – psychiatrist Sir Mason Durie, psychologist Dr Ian Evans and historian Dr Margaret Tennant.

Sir Mason retired in June after 24 years at Massey, the last 10 as Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasikifa). From 2009 he was also the Deputy Vice-Chancellor.

Professor Evans also retired in June. He joined Massey's School of Psychology in 2002 after an established career in the United States. He headed the school from 2003-07 and has an international reputation for his research achievements.

Professor Tennant retired at the end of last year. She was a student at Massey and has worked at the university for most of her career since 1978. Much of her research has focussed on women's history and the history of social policy policy. She was appointed to a chair in history in 2002 and Dean of the Graduate Research School in 2007.
