**Knowledge shared for Auckland’s growth**

The opportunity for research-led planning to help Auckland become, in Mayor Len Brown’s words, “the world’s most liveable city” has gained momentum with the recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between Massey University and Auckland Council.

This agreement, under the umbrella of the Auckland Knowledge Exchange Hub, sees co-directors Professor Paul Spoonley and Professor Christoph Schumacher, from the University’s Albany campus, working closely with Auckland Council’s research team. Together they will develop high quality research programmes across the areas of economic development, social and community development and environmental management. Their aim is to build on existing knowledge and capacity to create a research centre of excellence on Auckland’s North Shore.

“The timing of this partnership couldn’t be better,” says Massey University Vice Chancellor Steve Maharey. “The Albany campus has grown steadily over the past two decades and we see real benefits in working alongside Auckland Council to help drive innovation and share knowledge that can make a difference in the lives of people across the community.”

“Massey University is a powerhouse of knowledge and smart thinking, and by strengthening our relationship together we can make Auckland the innovative hub of the Pacific Rim,” says Auckland Council CEO, Doug McKay.

At the signing, Mr McKay confirmed that the council’s Long-Term Plan and the Auckland Plan (Auckland’s 30-year vision) had recently been signed off, so having this agreement in place enables both organisations to identify immediate areas where collaboration can begin.
