Independent Monitoring Contract Goes to Massey University

Massey University has been appointed to carry out independent monitoring for the National Cervical Screening Programme.

NCSP Clinical Leader Dr Hazel Lewis welcomed the appointment and said the unit looked forward to working with the university to ensure quality independent monitoring.

Dr Lewis said independent monitoring was one of several systems the National Screening Unit used to ensure its programmes were working well.

The university has been providing an interim monitoring service since the previous contract with Otago University ended in early 2004.

Cancer epidemiologist Dr Mona Jeffreys, from Massey University?s Centre for Public Health Research, will lead the monitoring work.

Dr Jeffreys, a member of the Cancer Control Taskforce, says: \"We are delighted to provide independent monitoring to the Screening Programme. Regular cervical screening offers women the best chance to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer. Our input will assist with ensuring that the programme maintains its current high standard. It is imperative that women in New Zealand know they can trust the cervical screening programme. We hope our monitoring service will help them to do that."

Massey University was selected for the role through an open tender process, which also sought a new provider for independent monitoring of the BreastScreen Aotearoa (BSA).

While no suitable provider was found for the BSA monitoring, an interim process will continue to develop the six monthly reports.

All providers for both screening programmes are contractually bound by stringent national policy and quality standards and are required to conduct monthly audits to check the accuracy of data entry against their paper clinical records. They also provide six monthly quality plans and undergo visits by programme staff to follow-up monitoring issues.

As well, the National Screening Unit seeks external advice from a range of sources to support its work. It has established a number of national screening advisory bodies to provide advice and an oversight of screening activities, including population screening programmes.

The advisory groups include the Consumer Reference Group, the Maori Advisory Group, BreastScreen Aotearoa Advisory Group, National Cervical Screening Programme Advisory Group, National Screening Advisory Committee and the Pacific Advisory Group.
