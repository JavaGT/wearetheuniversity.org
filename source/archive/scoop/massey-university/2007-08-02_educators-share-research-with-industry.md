Fashion conference enables educators to share research with industry

Change in the fashion industry – including the increasing number of niche designer labels – will be studied at the industry’s annual tertiary education conference, in Wellington next week.

The Fashion Industry New Zealand conference will be held on 9 and 10 August at Massey’s Wellington campus, home to the country’s leading school of Fashion and Textile Design.

Now in its fourth year, the two-day conference has increased communication and alignment between the fashion education and in industry sectors. It provides a forum for discussion and an opportunity for tutors to attend professional workshops that bring them up to speed with industry practices and processes.

Fashion Design programme leader Deb Cummings says hosting the conference provides opportunities for the Massey school. “It is a great venue to bring together representatives from the apparel industry and national educational providers,” she says.

“The theme this year, The Broader Perspective of Design, will spark much discussion on the changing roles of design, product development and manufacturing within a changing economic environment,” Ms Cummings says.

“There are a number of industry changes, including more niche designer labels, greater design orientation in branding, marketing and merchandising, increased exports and offshore production, to which the Massey Fashion Design programme has responded. In particular, this has impacted on the need for extensive learning across design and creative practice, business and product development.”

She says the conference will allow a positive interchange of ideas, which will benefit both industry and education. “It is very important to maintain a strong link between the sectors. Part of this includes the opportunity for recent research to be presented. Janet Webster, one of our senior lecturers, is presenting a paper on apparel sizing, which has national and international interest for manufacturers, retailers and consumers.”
