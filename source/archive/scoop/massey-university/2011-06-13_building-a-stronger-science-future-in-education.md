Building a Stronger Science Future in Education

**Building a Stronger Science Future in Education**

A framework to inspire more students to study science and its related fields through to degree level has been developed by Massey University researchers as part of a project funded by Ako Aotearoa, the national centre for tertiary teaching excellence.

The project addressed a trend of declining numbers of students completing tertiary level science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and concern that the numbers of graduates will not meet the demand if New Zealand is to develop as a high-value, innovative, knowledge-led economy, with a strong base of scientific and technical professionals.

The same trend has been detected in many other countries, including in Australia, the United States, Britain and elesewhere in Europe.

The project team, led by Professor Tim Parkinson from Massey's Institute of Veterinary Animal and Biomedical Sciences, explored what motivates and demotivates science learners as they transition from school to university.

It identified that while science learners are attracted to the subject at both compulsory and tertiary levels and see it as relevant and contemporary, it is often the “transmission” method of instruction that results in their disengagement – in other words, they become bored by the way science is taught.

The research also found evidence of gaps in mutual understanding between tertiary sector educators and their secondary counterparts, in terms of the way learners are being prepared for, and are expected to, undertake tertiary study in the sciences. On one hand, this can result in lecturers underestimating the breadth and depth of the knowledge of their students and pitching teaching at too low a level. But it can also result in such disparity of learning on entry to university that it is impossible to pitch the teaching at a level that satisfies all entrants.

This research indicates that the single most important factor in learner engagement is the interaction between the teacher-lecturer and the learner. The findings also highlight the importance of organisations enhancing their support for teaching and learning practices that optimise learner engagement.

In response to these findings, the project team has developed a framework for enhancing student engagement across the secondary-tertiary transition as well as identifying key questions for a teacher-lecturer and learner dialogue. It includes the development of closer ties between secondary and tertiary institutions to make sure school leavers are equipped with the knowledge needed to start their degrees. Ensuring teaching content is relevant and rewarding of critical thinking is also pivotal.

Professor Parkinson says, “I hope that the results of this study will help both sectors formulate strategies that will create long-term benefits for science education in New Zealand.”

Professor Robert Anderson, Pro-Vice Chancellor, College of Sciences at Massey University comments, “This is an important research project that stands to have far-reaching impact in shaping future secondary and tertiary educational approaches in science and engineering in New Zealand.”

Ako Aotearoa’s director, Dr Peter Coolbear adds, “Ako Aotearoa is pleased to have been the funding partner in this very significant project that aims to improve successful transitions for science learners between secondary and tertiary. The work is unique in how it comprehensively unpacks and contrasts the perspectives of staff and students involved in science education across these levels”.

The research was officially launched by Massey University’s Vice Chancellor Steve Maharey at the University’s Manawatu campus today.
