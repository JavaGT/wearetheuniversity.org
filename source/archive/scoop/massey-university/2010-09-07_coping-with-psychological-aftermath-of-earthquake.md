**Coping with psychological aftermath of earthquake**

The Joint Centre for Disaster Research, based at the School of Psychology, has prepared fact sheets for different sectors of the population dealing with impacts of the Canterbury earthquake.

The fact sheets offer tips on helping children, adolescents and families in the wake of a disaster, identifies common reactions to disasters, how to recognise and respond to the stress of being under threat and what to do when someone you know has been through a traumatic experience.

In addition there is information for communities, as well as health staff and volunteers and a guide for emergency response workers and their managers.
