Journalism student wins Alex Veysey Memorial Prize

Matt Chisholm has won this year’s Alex Veysey Memorial Prize, funded by The Dominion Post in honour of the late Wellington journalist.

The prize is available only to Massey journalism students. They vote for the class member who most lives up to Mr Veysey’s reputation for old-fashioned journalism and zest for life.

Mr Chisholm told his classmates he was “humbled” by the award.

“Any one of you could have won it too.”

The fifth student to win the prize, he plans a career as a broadcast journalist.

In awarding the prize Dominion Post editor Tim Pankhurst took a moment to remember his old mate.

“He was a good friend and I miss him. He enjoyed life and loved music. Under the name Ash Burton, Alex recorded some classic country songs.”  
Mr Veysey worked at both The Dominion and The Evening Post during a career that lasted more than 50 years. He was a sports and political reporter, features editor, and assistant editor. He also wrote several acclaimed books on New Zealand sporting heroes. He died in 2002.
