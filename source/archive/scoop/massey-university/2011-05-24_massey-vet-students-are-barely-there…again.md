Massey Vet Students Are Barely There…Again

**Massey Vet Students Are Barely There…Again**

Massey University’s third year veterinary students have revealed all in a calendar to raise funds for their half-way celebration and chosen charity – SPCA Canterbury.

“We are celebrating reaching the half-way point in pursuit of a gruelling veterinary degree,” says vet student, Rosie Keen.

She says the students find a talented photographer (which is never difficult!) to take the pictures and then travel to unique locations, undress and pose artistically with animals.

The combined theme for this year’s calendar is the role of animals in society and the international nature of the third year vet class.

Rosie says “the theme is fitting because this year is World Veterinary Year and celebrates 250 years of the veterinary profession working to improve animal health worldwide. It's also Rugby World Cup year!”

The photos feature the 'Barely There' students with baby chicks at an ostrich farm, elegantly seated on top of a fire engine and sharing a few ‘quiet’ ones next to a large Tui billboard… yeah right.

Ten per cent of money raised from the calendar sales will be donated to SPCA Canterbury - an organisation dedicated to housing animals that are mistreated, abandoned, sick and injured - especially those affected by the Canterbury earthquakes.

She says the donation from the calendar sales will help SPCA Canterbury continue their work protecting the region’s animals from abuse and mistreatment.

It is the sixth year the students have held a fundraiser. The July to June calendars are available for purchase at www.vetcalendar.co.nz or from the University’s Palmerston North campus for $15 (inc gst) from 1 June.

The New Zealand Veterinary Association is a major sponsor and supporter of the 2011 Barely There calendar and future young vets.

The calendar’s official launch will be held this Friday.
