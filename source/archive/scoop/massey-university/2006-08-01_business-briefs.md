BUSINESS BRIEFS

  
The impact of housing loans

Banking researcher David Tripe will look at the likely future economic impact of home lending, at a New Zealand Futures Trust forum in Wellington next week. His presentation will consider the banks' lending on housing, and how the steady increase in such lending may relate to the balance of payments deficit and the increase in private sector foreign indebtedness.

Dr Tripe is Director of Massey University’s Centre for Banking Studies and has worked in a number of New Zealand banks. He publishes a quarterly newsletter reviewing the financial performance of New Zealand banks. The forum will be held on Wednesday 16 August from 12.15 - 1.30 pm at the Museum Room, Turnbull House, Bowen St, Wellington.

  
High ranking for business research

Massey University’s Finance programme has gained an even higher ranking in a respected international measure of research relevance and quality.  
It is now ranked 28th amongst business schools outside the United States, as measured by the number of research papers downloaded from the eLibrary of the Social Science Research Network (SSRN).

The ranking improves on the University’s previous position at 34 and again places Massey at the top of the list amongst New Zealand and Australian universities. The nearest Australasian universities are Monash University in 50th place and the University of Otago at 56.

The web-based SSRN network is devoted to scholarship in the fields of economics, finance, accounting, management and law. Its eLibrary is co-hosted by Stanford University.
