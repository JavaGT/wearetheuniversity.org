Maths website for secondary and tertiary students
=================================================

Maths website for secondary and tertiary students

The launch of an online mathematics resource featuring interactive practice sessions, video tutorials and quizzes aims to boost student success in arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and calculus.

The MathsFirst website has been developed by Dr Tammy Smith and Dr Kee Teo in the University’s Institute of Fundamental Sciences. It is designed to help students sharpen their maths before enrolling in first-year papers at university, and for secondary students seeking additional resources.

Dr Smith says the success of first-year tertiary maths students depends on their competency in algebra, and that it is important that secondary school students are equipped with the basic skills required for tertiary study.

Free to access, the site contains a course map outlining first-year maths papers and information about the level of knowledge required to enrol in each course. Competency tests specific to papers are available, allowing students to identify any problem areas. From there, they can link to remedial work offered online in the form of video tutorials and interactive practice.

The tutorials use moving graphical images, colour, and audio explanations of concepts. An advantage of MathsFirst, and of online resources, is the user’s ability to navigate through tutorials in their own time.

MathsFirst can be found at: http://mathsfirst.massey.ac.nz
