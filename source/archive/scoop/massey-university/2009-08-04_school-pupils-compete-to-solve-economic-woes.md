**School pupils compete to solve economic woes**

Teams from schools in Auckland and Wellington will attempt to help solve the country’s economic woes during the inaugural ANZ Massey Economics Challenge at Albany campus next month.

Economics professor Anne de Bruin, one of the organisers, says the event has potential to help not only the pupils taking part, but also the national economy.

“The macroeconomics presentation is on _How can we protect the New Zealand economy from global recession_, which is timely and will hopefully turn up some fresh, innovative ideas," Professor de Bruin says. "The microeconomics team quiz is also closely linked to the school curriculum, so it is highly relevant for all students.”

The aim is to foster a greater interest in economics in secondary schools and support those with innovative ideas, as well as to establish closer links with educational organisations, the business community and policymakers.

Each of the teams is assigned a Massey student as a mentor, who will provide guidance and support before the challenge, and guide them around the campus. “It will be quite a buzz for our students and the school students to be part of it,” says Professor de Bruin.

Judges of the macroeconomics presentation are financial writer and commentator Mary Holm, the Treasury's principal tax adviser, Norman Gemmell, and College of Business Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Lawrence Rose.

Three senior lecturers from the University will judge the microeconomic challenge judges.  
Professor de Bruin says the entry of a team from Scots College in Wellington has prompted the organisers to extend the challenge next year to become a national event on all three Massey campuses.

There are still places available for schools wishing to enter this year's challenge. Register at: http://econchallenge.massey.ac.nz/
