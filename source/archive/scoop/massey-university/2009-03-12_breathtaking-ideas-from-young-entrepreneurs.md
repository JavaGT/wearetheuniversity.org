Breathtaking ideas from young entrepreneurs

An energy boosting ice block, a beat-the-recession internet blog and a gym towel with iPod storage were among the business ideas suggested by students at the launch of the Young Enterprise Scheme (YES).

More than 370 secondary school students from around the North Shore and Rodney took part in the e-day, which was hosted by Massey University on the Albany campus this week.

More than 30 business professionals and experts from the University’s School of Engineering and Advanced Technology were on hand to advise students about their fledgling companies at “speed coaching” sessions.

Dr Aruna Shekar, a senior lecturer in product development at Massey University, spoke to the Year 12 and Year 13 students about how to make their innovative ideas work.

“These are really talented, bright young students. We encouraged them to do a situation analysis and think about the product category, to understand the market and to research the competition,” she says.

“We also asked them to consider the reality of making these ideas work in terms of materials, process and manufacturing, which is key to success.”

YES is a nationwide scheme that teaches high school students the principles of commerce by establishing and running a business within the school curriculum.

It is hosted in the Auckland region by Enterprise North Shore.

Regional co-ordinator Lisa Ford says she saw flecks of brilliance among the participants. “Some of the students’ ideas were absolutely breathtaking; the enterprising and innovative future of the North Shore looks extremely secure,” she says.
