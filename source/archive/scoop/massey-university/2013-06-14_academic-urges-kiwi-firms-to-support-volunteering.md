**Academic urges Kiwi firms to support volunteering**

A Massey University academic is using National Volunteer Week to encourage New Zealand companies to embrace employee volunteering.

Dr Louise Lee, an employee volunteering specialist with Massey’s School of Management, says New Zealand lags behind countries like the United Kingdom and the United States when it comes to employer-supported volunteering programmes.

“Internationally there’s been rapid growth in employee volunteering schemes and, increasingly, these initiatives are seen as an integral part of corporate social responsibility programmes for many businesses,” she says. “It’s a growing trend in New Zealand, but it would be good to see more Kiwi firms implementing schemes.”

Dr Lee’s most recent research focuses on the experiences of City Action, a free employee volunteering brokerage initiative run by the City of London Corporation that links City-based businesses with local community organisations. She believes New Zealand companies, government agencies and charities have much to learn from programmes like this.

“Employee volunteering is still relatively underdeveloped in New Zealand but I’m excited about the potential for growth and innovation in this space. Well-established programmes like City Action play a critical role in helping business and community organisations to develop volunteering initiatives that add value and tackle important community issues,” Dr Lee says.

“For example, in 2012 City Action launched a new initiative aimed at harnessing the professional expertise of City firms to support the growth of local social enterprises. As part of this initiative Sumitomo Bank employees, participating in a talent programme for junior management staff, worked with two local social enterprises to provide strategic planning, fundraising and marketing strategies. This sort of programme could work well within New Zealand’s own growing social enterprise movement.”

Dr Lee says employee volunteering programmes, if done well, can bring benefits for employees, employers and non-profit organisations alike. The best results are achieved, she believes, when companies and charities develop long-term and sustainable relationships, leveraging employees’ workplace skills.

“While there is certainly a place for short-term collaborations, the magnitude of social issues often requires more sustained engagement between businesses and non-profits through volunteering. One way for firms to increase their impact on specific problems is through skills-based volunteering. Leveraging employees’ professional skills and expertise can really build capacity within non-profits and help them better meet their goals.

“At the same time volunteering provides employees with opportunities to challenge themselves, practice their existing skills and learn new ones outside of the normal work environment – all positives from an employer perspective.”

With austerity measures leading to government spending cuts globally, the contribution of volunteers is set to become more important, including in New Zealand. And employee volunteering, argues Dr Lee, has a role to play in assisting non-profits to deliver vital services.

“All volunteers are important to non-profits, but businesses have significant resources they can call on to foster, encourage and support volunteering and community participation with their staff.

“Employee volunteering programmes also help those who are keen to volunteer but are unsure of where to start. An employer-supported programme lets people dip a toe in the water and can be a catalyst for a lifetime of voluntary work.”

National Volunteer Week is a Volunteering New Zealand initiative that runs from June 16-22, 2103. It brings together a range of events and celebrations to recognise the invaluable contribution made by volunteers in New Zealand. Dr Lee is a Volunteering New Zealand board member.
