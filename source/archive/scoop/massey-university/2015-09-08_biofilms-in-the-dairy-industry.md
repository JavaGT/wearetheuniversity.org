**Biofilms in the Dairy Industry**

Recent high-profile contamination scares within the international food industry have highlighted the need for best practice when it comes to dairy manufacturing. After 15 years of research into dairy biofilms, there is now a cornerstone publication for a better understanding of the current science, and ways to reduce the occurrence of biofilms associated with dairy manufacturing.

_Biofilms in the Dairy Industry_ provides a comprehensive overview of biofilm-related issues currently facing the New Zealand and international dairy sector.

The book presents potential solutions for reducing contamination throughout the manufacturing process. While the dairy industry has grown in size, sophistication and quality to satisfy a growing international demand for dairy products, contamination remains a major risk.

The ultimate origin of most micro-organisms capable of producing biofilms is the raw milk. However, the conditions found throughout the manufacturing process provide specific niches that are ideal for the growth of biofilms that provide a source of contamination for dairy products.

This book represents the result of 15 years of research into those issues, and involved researchers from Massey University, University of Otago, AUT, and Plant and Food Research.

Massey University Professor of Food Safety and Microbiology Steve Flint has had a long and successful career in both academia and in the dairy manufacturing industry. John Brooks, Professor of Food and Microbiology at AUT, is one of New Zealand’s most respected food safety experts. Koon Hoong Teh is a PhD graduate from Massey University and is the chief editor of this book. Together with other academics, and a group of collaborative experts, the authors have meshed their experiences and expertise to create a comprehensive book on dairy biofilms.

Professor Flint says, “The intention is that this book will be a useful resource for the dairy industry to help them meet customer specifications for quality product, and to improve their efficiency in dairy manufacture.”

Dairy industry managers, researchers and students will find _Biofilms in the Dairy Industry_ useful in providing a fundamental understanding of problems relating to biofilms in the dairy industry and offering some solutions and suggestions for improvement in managing dairy manufacturing plants.
