PM acknowledges contribution of science hub at Microscopy Centre opening

Prime Minister Helen Clark opened the new Manawatu Microscopy and Imaging Centre on the Palmerston North campus today, citing the state-of-the-art centre as an example of industry and science coming together to boost knowledge and the economy.

The centre was a project very much in line with the Government’s goals of driving New Zealand forward using research science and technology, Ms Clark said, and the successful application to the Tertiary Education Commission, which provided $1.5 million for the project was recognition that the state-of-the-art facility would be used not only by Massey staff and students but by many Crown Research Institutes and industry partners.

“Palmerston North’s contribution is huge in biological science and research, so it is very logical hub for a centre of this kind. The new Microscopy Centre enables the Manawatu to stay at the forefront of teaching and research in the biological sciences.”

The centre, which houses a range of imaging equipment for use across the physical and biological sciences, represented an important linkage between town and gown, Ms Clark said. “As a country we haven’t always been good at that … but a centre such as this makes it clear we should be.”

Ms Clark also noted the support for New Zealand’s primary industries provided by the University.

“What we know is that our primary sector would not be making the huge contribution they are making to the economy were they not relying on the research coming out – a good deal of it coming here from Massey.”

University Vice-Chancellor Professor Judith Kinnear said the cutting-edge microscopy and imaging technology was an essential component of research in many fields, including:

\- The identification by a veterinary pathologist of disease-causing viruses.  
\- The study of milk proteins by Fonterra researchers.  
\- The investigation of the elemental composition of volcanic glass by vulcanologists.  
\- Confocal analysis of nutrient release in food products by researchers from Crop & Food.

The centre also supports areas of fundamental research such as studies in endophyte symbiosis, micro-rheological studies of bio-materials and human chromosome studies.

“The range of instruments and ancillary equipment – light, fluorescence and confocal microscopes and scanning and transmission electron microscopes – provides the tools to study biological and material structures, both the surfaces and interior features,” Professor Kinnear said. “The facility is already being heavily used by Massey staff and those from external agencies. As well as this use by leading researchers, another important use in support of the research training of our PhD students who will be the next generation of researchers.”

Professor Kinnear acknowledged the work of artist Kura Te Waru Rewiri, whose work You cannot measure the distance to infinity is displayed in the centre.

“It’s a wonderfully apt title for a centre that is concerned with precise measurements – but, rather than measuring astronomically large distances reaching towards infinity, the transmission microscopy in the MMIC can reveal extraordinarily small distances reaching to the atomic level.”

The centre is a key resource for one of the most important biological science hubs in New Zealand. The hub includes the Hopkirk Research Institute for animal health research, four Crown Research Institutes (HortResearch, Crop & Food, AgResearch, Landcare Research), Fonterra Innovation, and Leather and Shoe Research.

More than 150 staff and guests attended the opening. Centre director Dr Al Rowland acknowledged the contribution made by staff, particularly Professor Barry Scott, the team at facilities management, and both the project architect and builder.
