“Is it a world first?” and other flag quandaries
================================================

**“Is it a world first?” and other flag quandaries**

Is our flag vote a world first? Should people rig the result by voting for their least favourite design, if they don't want change? These are among the ten most common questions asked of the Flag Consideration Panel. Now, panellist and Massey University Māori senior researcher Malcolm Mulholland is answering them.

Mr Mulholland delivered his explanations in a speech to the Palmerston North Rotary Club today. He says it is timely to reiterate the many important issues surrounding flag selection, so that voters are well informed about the process and the design choices, as well as the significance of the exercise, before the first stage of voting later this month.

How many people know, for example, the traditional indigenous symbolism for the silver fern? It says when Māori traversed the forest they would leave the silver side of the fern facing the moonlight to provide a pathway home, Mr Mulholland explains.

Other queries from the public include; what do other vexillologists \[flag experts\] think; what do the top five designs really mean; and should the process be repeated if it doesn't result in flag change this time?

The following are summaries of Mr Mulholland’s responses to these, and other vexing vexillology queries:

o **Are you worried about the level of feeling in the debate?**

No, because it shows that we care deeply about what is arguably our most prominent symbol of nationhood. Whether we stay with what we have or we decide upon a new ensign, it is vitally important we get it right and that above all else we have an emotional connection to our flag. We need to remember that the purpose of a flag is to incite a strong sense of patriotism. Nationalistic fervour has its place and it should be demonstrated when witnessing your flag.

o **Is this a world first?**

Yes. No other country has ever embarked upon such a transparent and democratic process to select their flag. Some vexillologists say they would not be surprised if other countries in the future follow suit.

Some Australians are envious of the process. If we decide to change our flag then that will leave only two independent countries within the Commonwealth, Tuvalu and Australia, out of 53 nations that will still be using the Union Jack on their official ensign.

o **Why did the panel select the four designs they did?**

Every panel member saw every design, which numbered more than 10,000. They invited a number of cultural (including tikanga), Vexillology (the study of flags), and art and design advisors, to provide confidential technical feedback on the designs under consideration. These advisors focused on ensuring any proposed designs were workable and that there were no impediments in the choice of proposed designs. We believe a potential new flag should unmistakably be from New Zealand and celebrate us as a progressive, inclusive nation, connected to its environment, with a sense of its past and a vision for its future.

o **Do you agree with the Red Peak Design being included in the first referendum?**

It is a positive development as it offers another option for the voting public. It provides those with an appreciation of an abstract design an option in the referendum. This design also adheres more strictly to the majority of other flag designs that represent countries, which may explain why many people feel it looks ‘more like a flag’.

o **What do Vexillologists think?**

In September I attended the International Congress of Vexillology in Sydney. It consists of the world’s experts in flags, and assembles every two years to discuss all matters relating to flags. Much of the focus was on what we are doing. Vexillologist Ted Kaye was particularly intrigued with the process we embarked upon when it came to asking the public “What do you stand for?” By posing such a question, it provided the opportunity for the public to articulate what principles are important to our country and that those values might be reflected in our national flag. This is a process that, at times for many other countries, has been lacking when deciding upon their flags as they tend to be selected by legislation, royal or presidential decree, or by revolution. The final message vexillologists conveyed was that it is vitally important that people view a flag in reality, flying from a flagpole.

o **Are the eyes of the world upon us?**

Yes. The level of media exposure our country has had from the exercise has been colossal, with articles appearing in the vast majority of major international television networks, newsprint and radio. Having recently travelled to Europe, the first question asked by foreigners upon realising where I was from is what I thought about changing our flag. In conversations with Brits from London, opinions fell into two camps; one camp couldn’t understand why we would want to get rid of the Union Jack after all England had done for New Zealand, and the other group couldn’t understand why a country at the bottom of the South Pacific Ocean still used the Union Jack when we live thousands of miles away and hadn’t had much to do with Mother Britain since the conclusion of World War II.

o **Is a flag a logo?**

One observation I made during my travels of Europe is the love certain countries exhibit for their flag. England, Switzerland, Italy and Germany all took great care in flying their flags from their houses. They also use their flag as a marker of identity and on products sold that originated from their country. In every souvenir shop in London were products that had the Union Jack stamped all over them, be they an umbrella, a teddy bear or a replica of Big Ben. Similarly, Switzerland plastered their Red Cross on every box of chocolates, army knife and watch. This leads me to believe that the more a people connect with their national flag, the more inclined they are to use them in everyday life; from using the flag as a logo on products to displaying national pride in their own homes.

o **Should people ‘rig’ the vote if they don’t want the flag to change?**

No, I don’t think so. People should not dismiss their democratic right and have their vote disallowed by not completing their voting papers correctly in the first referendum. People who want to support the current New Zealand flag have the opportunity to do so in the second referendum. I would urge people to vote properly in both referendums.

o **Are we going to reach a consensus?**

No. There will be five alternative flags and only one can be the winner. However, given that the first referendum is preferential voting (it will ask you to rank the flags in order) that could mean that your second or third option might become the most popular alternative, rather than your first preference. The fact of the matter is that regardless of what referenda process is selected, there are going to be those who may not be happy with the outcome. For those who find themselves in this category I would encourage you to remember that this is the most transparent and democratic process for selecting a flag that has ever taken place and to ask yourself the question before the second referendum; “Would you rather stick with what we have or would you rather see the alternative option become our new flag?”

o **Do you think we will repeat this process if the flag doesn’t change?**

This is a question that requires a crystal ball and no one knows the answer. However, consider this. What will happen if Scotland decides to vote for independence in another ten years? Much debate ensued during the Scotland Referendum last year about what would happen to the Union Jack if Scotland decided to part ways from the United Kingdom. Does that mean that all Union Jacks are to remove St Andrew’s Cross? Would that mean that we would have to change our flag? The other reason why we might change our flag is if we become a republic.

In his speech, Mr Mulholland urges everyone to take part in discussions and voting.

“Whether we stay with our current flag or change it to the most popular alternative, it is important that everybody has their say. After all, this process is not only a national first, but a world first. This is quite literally, history in the making.”
