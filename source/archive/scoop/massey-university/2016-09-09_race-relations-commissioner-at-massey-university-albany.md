Race Relations Commissioner at Massey University, Albany
========================================================

**Friday, 9 September 2016, 11:58 am**  
**Speech: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

**Race Relations Commissioner at Massey University, Albany, Auckland  
20 September for annual Peace Talk**

_"We just need to look around the world right now to see what happens when racial intolerance and racism is normalised. We think New Zealanders are better than that..."_

The public is invited to hear Dame Susan Devoy speak on the new Human Rights Commission initiative #ThatsUs, a digital platform for collecting stories of migration and experiences of racism in New Zealand.

_"Many people don’t think racial intolerance or racism is a problem: often because they do not experience it themselves. By raising the voices of those New Zealanders who face racial intolerance in their everyday life: we’re hoping other New Zealanders will take the time to listen. We suspect many of us don’t realise when something we say is unfair or biased: but we would if someone pointed it out to us."_ - Dame Susan Devoy

Hear Dame Susan speak to this issue and have your opportunity to participate in the conversation during Question & Response.
