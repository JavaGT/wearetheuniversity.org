**Diwali and Cultural Festival at Albany campus**

  
Cultural performances, traditions and treats will enliven Albany’s campus with the first Diwali and cultural festival to be held on October 9.

The festival will feature stage performances, food stalls and henna decoration.

“We love the opportunity to welcome the community onto campus and celebrating special events like the Diwali and cultural festival is a wonderful excuse,” says campus registrar Andrea Davies.

“Auckland has become such a culturally diverse city, so it’s a chance for people to sample aspects of different cultures that have become such a part of New Zealand.”

The Diwali and cultural festival is being organised by staff from across the university, and one of the organisers, librarian Tom Vadrevu, says it celebrates the diversity of staff and students at Massey.

“We have students from over 100 different countries across the globe, and all the different student associations have been invited to set up food stalls and to stage performances depicting the unique cultures they represent,” he says.

Presented by Massey University and supported by Radio Humm FM, the festival will run from 11am to 3pm at Student Central, with food stalls, performances and displays from the diverse cultural community at Albany. It is free for anyone to attend.
