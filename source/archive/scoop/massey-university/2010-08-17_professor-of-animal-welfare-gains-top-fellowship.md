Professor of animal welfare gains top fellowship

Professor Kevin Stafford has been made a fellow of the Australian College of Veterinary Scientists. The fellowship recognises him as a specialist in the field of animal welfare science, ethics and law.

The college conducts examinations of professional proficiency for veterinarians in Australia and New Zealand, and Professor Stafford is the first New Zealander, and one of two Australasians, to be named a fellow of the college's animal welfare chapter.

Professor Stafford sat two written, one practical and one oral examination in Australia last month before being awarded the fellowship.

He has been active within the college for more than 10 years.

Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences head Professor Frazer Allan says the fellowship is “a significant achievement for Kevin, Massey University and for the veterinary profession within New Zealand".

“It cements Massey's already significant reputation in animal welfare at a time where animal welfare is of increasing importance to the economy.”

Professor Stafford is the co-director of Massey’s Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre. Its work has contributed to the establishment of New Zealand’s global pre-eminence in animal welfare science.
