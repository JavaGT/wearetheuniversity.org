Police dog back home in Hawke’s Bay

Stabbed police dog Edge left the University’s veterinary hospital this morning with his handler Constable Dave Whyte.

Constable Whyte says he has nothing but admiration for the team of Massey vets and nurses who have been treating Edge (Ed) since Tuesday evening. Edge was flown to Palmerston North from Hastings after being stabbed twice in the chest by a man police confronted on a farm at Maraekakaho, Hawke’s Bay, on Tuesday morning.

“It was really looking grim for a while, and I didn’t think he was going to make it, especially as at the scene of the attack he was totally unresponsive and bleeding profusely,” Constable Whyte says.

“But from the moment we got here, the vets have given us confidence, with frequent updated of Ed’s progress. It’s great to be kept informed.”

Specialist soft tissue veterinary surgeon Barbara Kirby says she expects Edge to make a full recovery after surgery, several greyhound-blood transfusions and a course of antibiotics to fight infection.

Ms Kirby says that the donor greyhound was selected because, as a sporting dog, it had the high red blood-cell count suitable for the physically fit and active 26 month-old Edge. At this time his blood-count is at a normal level.

Edge will convalesce under the care of local Hawke’s Bay veterinary staff, and will spend his recovery time with his handler and family at their home. During his time at Massey Edge has enjoyed his celebrity status, with many visits from veterinary students, and a special visit yesterday from Deputy Prime Minister Michael Cullen.
