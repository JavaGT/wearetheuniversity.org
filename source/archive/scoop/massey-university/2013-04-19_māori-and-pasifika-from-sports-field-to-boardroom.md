Māori and Pasifika – from sports field to boardroom

Māori and Pasifika players are well represented in our national sports teams, but the same is not true when it comes to senior roles in sports management, says a Massey University PhD student.

Ryan Holland, who will receive his doctoral degree at a Massey University graduation ceremony next month, undertook this country’s first formal review of Māori and Pasifika in sports governance with the support of Sport NZ.

While those of Māori and Pacific descent make up nearly half the players in high profile teams like the All Blacks and Silver Ferns, their representation across all sports in governance roles is just over 5 per cent.

“We really celebrate our Māori and Pasifika players, but their value is very much seen in the here and now, in what they can do as a player on the field,” Mr Holland says. “We don’t look to the contribution they can make in the future as coaches and sports administrators.”

Mr Holland, who oversees operations for the Basin Reserve Trust and is of Niuean descent, says his PhD research had a lot of personal significance for him.

“I wanted to understand the underlying reasons why there were so few Māori and Pasifika in sports governance. It’s a complex issue and while I didn’t come across any out-and-out racism, race and culture were at the heart of the problem.”

Mr Holland interviewed two distinct groups for his study – chief executives and chairs of national sport organisations to get the “outsider” view; and Māori and Pasifika board members to get the “insider” view. While both groups acknowledged the absence of Māori and Pasifika from the boardroom was cause for concern, the perceived reasons why were very different.

“Non-Māori and Pacific chief executives saw the issue as a simple lack of experience, but they didn’t recognise the cultural reasons why this might be the case. With such low participaition levels, those of Māori and Pacific descent don’t have many role models to inspire them or mentors to encourage them.

“And there are a whole lot of cultural reasons and pressures why they might not aspire to governance roles. Most Māori and Pasifika get their first taste of sport leadership through being players and feel most comfortable when they are active at the grassroots level because of the close connections with their local community.”

Succeeding in the higher levels of sports management, he says, often means focusing on individual ambitions rather than those of the community, and this can cause conflict.

Mr Holland says some cultural stereotypes still exist within the sector that lead Māori and Pacific candidates to be overlooked for governance roles.

“There’s a perception, and you see this all the time in the media, that people of Māori and Pacific descent are naturally physically gifted, but lack discipline. They can be seen as unsuitable, or not a good fit, so there’s definitely still an old boys’ network operating.”

To address the low numbers of Māori and Pasifika on the boards of sporting organisations, Mr Holland says change will need to be driven by Sport NZ. But Māori and Pasifika candidates need to step up to the plate as well.  
“I think people need to be identified at the grassroots level and given opportunities to develop leadership and governance skills through workshops and mentoring. We have a good programme of coaching certificates in New Zealand – there’s no reason we shouldn’t create a similar pathway for Māori and Pasifika to develop governance skills.”

Mr Holland’s other recommendations include introducing internships for Māori and Pasifika within national sporting organisations, building programmes that connect Māori and Pasifika sport governance with community development and educating boards on the value of diversity and cultural awareness.

“Getting more Māori and Pasifika on boards will give these groups, which are so important to New Zealand sport, a voice. It will lead to closer connections with their communities and increased levels of involvement at all levels – and that makes good business sense,” Mr Holland says.
