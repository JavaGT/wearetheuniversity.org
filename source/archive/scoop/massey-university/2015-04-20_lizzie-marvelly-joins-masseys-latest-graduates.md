**Lizzie Marvelly joins Massey’s latest graduates**

Singer-songwriter Lizzy Marvelly will join Massey University’s latest list of graduates when she crosses the stage on Thursday to receive a Bachelor of Arts in English and Psychology.

She is one of 1205 students receiving their degrees in six ceremonies spanning four days at Takapuna’s Bruce Mason Centre.

Twenty-five PhDs and 197 master’s degrees will be conferred, with one of the PhD candidates, Sione Vaka, the first Tongan male nurse to receive a doctorate in Nursing.

Ms Marvelly, who recently sang the national anthem at the Cricket World Cup final, will also perform at the first two graduation ceremonies on Tuesday.

“I’m looking forward to performing at graduation – and to attending my own!”

She is the first arts-focused student to be included in Massey’s High Performance Programme, which is usually the domain of athletes and professional sportspeople.

She has been hard at work on her latest project, the online media environment Villainesse (www.villainesse.com) which aims to empower young women aged 16-25 by featuring their writing, videography, art and photography. “I hope it will become a global space to foster debate, critical thinking, creativity and a modern-day sense of sisterhood,” she says.

Commonwealth Games 400m sprinter and hurdler Zoe Ballantyne will graduate in the same ceremony with a Bachelor of Communications.

It will also be an auspicious celebration for the College of Health, alongside Mr Vaka’s graduation the first cohort of nursing students from the Auckland campus will also graduate. Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Health Professor Paul McDonald says the College is going from strength to strength as stronger connections are being made with communities in New Zealand and internationally.

“100 per cent of the nurses graduating passed their registration examinations, and all were hired within weeks of completing their final course,” Professor McDonald says. “This is very pleasing as Massey University’s nursing programme is New Zealand’s number one ranked nursing research programme.”

Māori and Pasifika graduates will also be honoured with ceremonies to acknowledge the special place the students hold in the University. The Māori celebration on April 22 at 6.30 pm and the Pasifika celebration will be held on April 23 at 6pm. Both will be held in the Sir Neil Waters Lecture Theatre foyer.

Massey streams its graduation ceremonies live on the internet so family and friends can watch the ceremonies from anywhere in the world. Following the ceremony, the videos are made available on Massey’s YouTube channel, where graduates can create a custom link to the exact moment they crossed the stage and share it. Check out the graduation website or share this link with anyone who wants to watch it live. http://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/student-life/graduation/graduation-live/graduation-live---albany.cfm
