Inaugural NZ Schools Japanese Trivia Quiz
=========================================

**Friday, 19 June 2015, 2:49 pm**  
**Press Release: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

**Inaugural NZ Schools Japanese Trivia Quiz – June 19, 6.30pm-8.30pm (simultaneously in seven cities from Auckland to Invercargill)**

Nationally there will be:

• 364 intermediate and high school students  
•  
• 42 schools  
•  
• 94 teams  
•  
• Seven cities/towns  
•  
This fun event is one of the strategies aimed at getting more kids interested in studying the Japanese language (and other languages too) - a decline in the number of NZ students learning other languages is a big concern among language teachers.

The NEW ZEALAND SCHOOLS JAPANESE TRIVIA CHAMPIONSHIPS is taking place simultaneously across NZnext Friday at seven venues, with 42 schools taking part overall (both intermediate and secondary). It's a quiz event (like a pub quiz minus alcohol) based on general knowledge about Japan. More info here.

The event is organised by NZAJLT (NZ Association of Japanese Language Teachers) and JSANZ (Japanese Studies Aotearoa NZ) and funded by the Japan Foundation. Trophies have been donated by the Embassy of Japan.

Teams will be in dress-up, and prizes will be given not only to quiz winners but also the best dressed team. The IPC drum team will also perform.
