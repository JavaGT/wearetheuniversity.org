New director of external relations appointed

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey has made his first new appointment to the University’s senior management team, recruiting Sue Foley as director of external relations.

Mr Maharey says he is extremely pleased to have attracted such a highly-skilled and experienced practitioner to the role.

“Sue Foley has an extensive background in journalism and public affairs and is widely acknowledged as one of the best communicators in New Zealand. We look forward to working alongside Sue as we enable more people to see and hear of the University’s achievements.”

Ms Foley is currently general manager corporate affairs at KiwiRail, formerly Toll New Zealand. Her career has included working as chief of staff for TV3 News, chief of staff for the Leader of the Opposition, overseeing marketing and communications for the 2000 America’s Cup Village, time as a senior public affairs consultant at a leading New Zealand agency and as an award-winning television journalist.

She takes up the new role at Massey on November 10, where she will lead communications, marketing and alumni activity.
