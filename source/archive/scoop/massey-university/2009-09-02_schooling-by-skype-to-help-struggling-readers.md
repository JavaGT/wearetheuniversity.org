Schooling by Skype to help struggling readers

Literacy Professor Tom Nicholson is trialling a new approach to help struggling readers using the software application Skype over the Internet, and says it has the potential to help many others.

“Tutoring with Skype has enormous potential to lift reading levels of children who don’t have access to one-on-one tutoring,” says Professor Nicholson.

Skype allows users to make voice calls over the internet and using a web camera enables face-to-face dialogue. Discussions with school principals have prompted Professor Nicholson to look at developing a nationwide scheme for children with no access to reading tuition.

For several years he and a specially trained group of tutors at the Albany campus have been providing after-school reading clinics to pupils aged seven to 15 to improve reading speeds and comprehension. However, many more children who need help live too far from centres with clinics like Massey’s.

He plans to expand his programme, in partnership with schools, to provide after-hours access to their computers for those who use the programme. He is also seeking sponsorship from telecommunications companies for Internet access and to train more tutors.

The clinic at Albany currently has about 10 places left for its usual reading programme between now and December.
