Massey sociologist Professor Paul Spoonley has been awarded a Royal Society of New Zealand Science and Technology medal for his scholarship on race relations in New Zealand.

  
Professor Spoonley is the author or editor of more than 20 books on sociology, biculturalism, racism, ethnic relations and international migration. He was awarded the prestigious medal for his work as a researcher, commentator and “leader of initiatives to encourage collaboration across disciplines and institutions to increase opportunities for researchers in the social sciences,” according to his citation at the society’s awards ceremony in Wellington last week.

  
Professor Spoonley, Regional Director (Albany) and Research Director for the College of Humanities and Social Sciences, says the award is a tremendous honour. “It represents 30 years since I came to Massey. In that time we’ve made a conscious effort to ensure our sociology teaching and research is relevant to New Zealand society.”

  
The society also praised Professor Spoonley for his role as “a commentator in the media concerned to promote attitudes that contribute to the development of an inclusive, just and equitable multicultural New Zealand society rooted firmly in its bicultural heritage”.

  
The New Zealand Science and Technology medals recognise and honour those who have made exceptional contributions to New Zealand society and culture through activities in the broad fields of science, mathematics, social science and technology.

  
Earlier this year Professor Spoonley published a biography of prominent Maori scholar and leader Dr Ranginui Walker titled MataToa (Penguin New Zealand). Last month he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to the University of California, Berkley, where he will study Latino migrant children and compare them to Asian and Pacific migrant children living in New Zealand.
