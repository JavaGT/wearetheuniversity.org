Research grants of $16.3 million for Massey energy, planning and environment projects

Three Massey University projects were today awarded a total of $16.32 million in government science funding over the next six years.

The projects involve restoration and enhancement of coastal ecosystems in partnership with Mäori, developing a better urban and regional planning model particularly for Auckland and Wellington, and producing a highly efficient photovoltaic cell within seven years that can be built into a roofing material and fully power a house.

Massey University received two of the largest grants and was the largest recipient among the universities. Public and private sector research organisations shared in just over $136 million allocated by the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology.

Foundation chief executive Murray Bain says more than $12m a year is going to projects covering infrastructure, communities and energy, and nearly $15m a year to improving environmental resilience.

The research will help shape policies that will lead to an overall improvement in the health of our communities, Mr Bain says. New Zealand's environment is under increasing pressure and subject to international agreements and intense scrutiny. \"It is important that the foundation's research investment delivers high quality outcomes to provide sustainable, environmental resilience."

Massey Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says he is delighted with the funding, which reinforces the University's position as a leading research university. "The funding is for work that has the potential to make a real difference, which is always our aim."

Massey Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Nigel Long says all three projects symbolise the high standards of research excellence the University is known for, the connections it maintains with local, national and international partners, and the responsibility it takes for innovative responses to social, economic, cultural and environmental issues.

High Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics $5.76m  
Project leader: Professor Ashton Partridge, Institute of Fundamental Sciences

This project aims to produce by 2016 an all-plastic, recyclable, high efficiency photovoltaic cell that can be incorporated into a roofing product and which is capable of providing the total average energy requirements for a household.

The world is facing a major challenge in meeting the growing demand for energy, and securing an affordable energy solution that does not compromise our environmental responsibilities, says Professor Partridge.

"This bid is aimed toward answering that challenge. The beneficiaries will, in the first instance be New Zealanders, with access to cheaper, cleaner energy, and an assurance of supply.

"It will also have significant impact on reducing the effects on the environment associated with generation and transmission of the grid-tied energy solutions. In the longer term, it will play a significant role in meeting a very real global need for clean, sustainable energy."

The research is based upon intellectual property and knowhow from research organisations and industry in New Zealand and the United States. Collaborating partners include two of New Zealand's largest research organisations focusing on nanomaterials – the Massey-based MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology and Auckland University’s various research centres involved in materials science and engineering.

  
Manaaki Taha Moana ($6.6m)  
Project leader: Professor Murray Patterson, Centre for Ecological Economics

The project aims to restore and enhance coastal ecosystems that are important to Ngāti Raukawa and Tauranga Moana iwi through a better knowledge of these ecosystems and the degradation processes that affect them.

The research team will work closely with iwi/hapü in the case study regions to develop tools and approaches to facilitate the uptake of this knowledge and its practical implementation. Mechanisms will also be put in place to facilitate uptake amongst other iwi throughout New Zealand.

The research involves a partnership between Tauranga Moana iwi, Ngäti Raukawa, the New Zealand Centre for Ecological Economics (a joint venture of Manaaki Whenua and Massey University) and the Cawthron Institute. The iwi/hapü-based teams are a blend of established and emerging researchers led by Dr Huhana Smith, Shad Rolleston and Carlton Bidois.  
We anticipate the results of the research will provide favourable outcomes for coastal ecosystems and their services in the case study areas. The data and knowledge generated by the research will have the following immediate benefits for the participating iwi:  
Improving the understanding of the causes of the degradation of coastal ecosystems and what identifying what can be done about it.  
Producing action plans for improving coastal ecosystems in their rohe.  
Empowering participating iwi in resource management planning, by arming them with robust data on coastal ecosystems and the causes of their degradation.  
Capacity building in applied coastal ecosystems research.  
Benefits will also flow to other iwi and others through transfer of the research to other parts of New Zealand.

Seventeen agencies have confirmed they will "co-fund" the research with an additional $390,000 per year.  

Sustainable Pathways phase two  
Project leader: Professor Murray Patterson, Centre for Ecological Economics

The aim is to develop an integrative (economic, social, environmental) scenario modelling capacity in New Zealand to enable planners and communities to more fully appreciate options for the future of their cities and regions.

It builds on the earlier Sustainable Pathways phase one by introducing two state-of-the-art modelling methods – mediated modelling and spatial-dynamic modelling. It is designed assist local, regional and/or national decision-makers in forecasting and assessing future pressures on our cities and settlements.

Auckland and Wellington are the two case study regions. There are also strong linkages into other cities and regions through an advisory group and two linked programmes.

There are three inter-connected objectives – mediated modelling led by Associate Professor van den Belt, spatial dynamic modelling, and embedding scenario modelling into urban planning practice.

The research will provide urban planners with state-of-the art modelling methods to robustly and comprehensively plan for the future of urban areas. This will assist in delivering a number of favourable outcomes, particularly for Auckland and Wellington, including better land use and transportation planning, better infrastructure and growth management, improving the competitiveness of the Auckland economy, better economic, social, environmental.

The team has considerable wealth of knowledge, expertise, models and un-matched comprehensive regional databases that link economic activity to the environment. The programme is a collaborative one between the New Zealand Z Centre for Ecological Economics (a joint venture between Massey and Landcare Research, Market Economics Ltd, and Research Institute for Knowledge Systems (Netherlands).
