**Occupational English Test launching at Massey**

Massey University is now an official testing venue for the Occupational English Test (OET) – an international English language test to assess the language and communication skills of healthcare professionals.

OET tests health practitioners from the following professions: Dentistry, Dietetics, Medicine, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Optometry, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Podiatry, Radiography, Speech Pathology and Veterinary Science.

Director of Professional and Continuing Education (PACE) Andrea Flavel says the University is committed to providing services and offerings that meet the needs of the communities on the North Shore and wider Auckland area.

“By offering the Occupational English Test at Massey, we are enabling health care professionals to demonstrate their English language proficiency for professional registration and employment purposes,” she says.

“The OET, which is owned by Cambridge English Language Assessment and the Box Hill Institute, has a unique and proven 30 year pedigree in New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. The decision to add the test to our suite was an easy one to make.”

Massey is the second university in New Zealand to become an official testing venue, the other being the University of Otago. “If the venue proves to be successful in Auckland, there is the potential of opening testing venues at Massey’s Wellington and Manawatū campuses in the future,” Ms Flavel says.

The official launch of the venue is on Monday, September 26 At Massey’s Auckland campus in Albany. The first test is set to go ahead on the Saturday, October 15.
