Iwi Creativity on show

Iwi Creativity an exhibition showcasing the work of 13 Mäori students at the College of Creative Arts begins at the Wellington campus next Friday (10 October).

The exhibition will be held at the Great Hall and begins with an official launch at 6pm. It will run for a week and will return for the college’s Blow festival in November.

Iwi Creativity is held annually to celebrate the success of Mäori art and design students and highlight the contribution the University makes to the creative arts sector.

Students involved in the exhibition are studying a range of disciplines, from graphic design, spatial design, fashion, sculpture, textile design, performance design, time-based media and photography.

The exhibition was first held in 2006 to provide an opportunity to publicly display students' design work.

The work is put on display during the exhibition and at other official Massey functions. The exhibition was extended last year to include Mäori students from the Auckland campus, post-graduate Mäori students and a visiting indigenous artist.

Students taking part in this year’s exhibition are:  
Ranga Tuhi (Ngäti Maniapoto, Waikato), Amy Miller (Ngäti Maniapoto, Tainui), Vance Steele (Moriori), Kirsty Woods (Ngäti Hauiti), Khamara Thomson-Baker (Ngäti Mutunga), Waimateo Familton (Te Arawa), Jamaine Fraser (Te Arawa), Casey Schwass (Te Arawa, Te Ati Awa, Ngäti Awa, Ngäti Tama), Ruth Browne (Te Atiawa), Lyn Garrett (Te Atiawa), Jessica Sanderson (Te Atiawa, Ngäti Kahungunu) Monica Hall (Turanganui), and Esther Riddell (Ngäti Porou).
