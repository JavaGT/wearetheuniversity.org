**Top student-athletes honoured with Blues**

Tae kwon-do champion Estelle Speirs and rower Hamish Bond won the top awards at the Massey University Blues Awards ceremony in Palmerston North last night.

Mr Bond was named BNZ sportsman of the year while Ms Speirs, a tae kwon-do champion, was named BNZ Manawatu sportswoman of the year.

Mr Bond is a third-year Bachelor of Business Studies student. He and fellow Massey Student Eric Murray are the current world champion men’s pair rowing team. They have won several gold medals at world cup events this year and were named team of the year at last year’s Halberg Sports Awards.

Mr Bond also won the extramural sportsperson of the year award, sponsored by the Extramural Students’ Society.

Ms Speirs is in her final year of a Bachelor of Sport and Exercise. Last year she competed at the tae kwon-do world championships in Argentina, captaining the New Zealand women’s team. The team won the gold medal for specialty technique, and finished second overall. At this year’s Asian championships, she was named best overall female competitor. Ms Spiers said she dedicated the award to her coach, Dave Ballard, who died two weeks ago.

The Massey University Students’ Association award for team of the year was won by the University A rugby team. The team had its most successful season since 2004, winning the Centennial Shield and the Hankins Shield in Senior One club rugby in the Manawatu competition. The team contributed six players to the Manawatu Turbos and a further nine players to other Manawatu representative sides.

The outstanding contribution award was presented to Professor Ian Warrington, who has been instrumental in the development of sport at Massey. Professor Warrington is a former chairman of the Massey University Blues selection panel, was chairman of the Palmerston North Amateur Swim Club, and is currently a member of the Manfeild Board Trust as well as being patron of the Massey University Rugby Football Club.

Footballer Andy Barron was guest speaker at the event. Mr Barron was one of a handful of amateur players at this year’s FIFA World Cup, where the New Zealand team was unbeaten. He told Blues recipients of the importance of education to top athletes.
