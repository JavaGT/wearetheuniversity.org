Universe of learning at Wellington Open Day

  
From futuristic 3D printing to explorations in theatre, film and creative writing, to what’s new in sports science and the intrinsic and market value of a BA degree, Massey’s Wellington campus Open Day tomorrow offers brainfood for all tastes and interests.

Presentations, displays and hands-on workshops and demonstrations of the Wellington campus’ diverse range of degrees – including sciences, health, food technology, nursing, sports and exercise science, design, expressive arts, communication, business, humanities and social sciences and much more – are all part of the programme.

Campus tours invite prospective students, their families and friends to view laboratories, libraries and lecture theatres, and to sample campus services such as cafes, recreation centres, theatre spaces and student learning support services.

The Wellington campus is home of the School of Art and the School of Design, the latter ranked by global design organisation Red Dot as 4th best in the Asia/Pacific. It is also where New Zealand’s oldest and most respected journalism school is based, and where you can see a state-of-the-art design facility offering digital sound, animation and filming suites, as well as the campus’ own Digital Fabrication Laboratory and Open Lab enterprises.

As part of Open Day activities, information sessions for distance learners, international students and Māori and Pasifika support networks, as well as sessions on cultural and sporting activiities and student welfare will be run in the morning and afternoon.
