**Zonta honours top designers**

Industrial design student Amy Robinson has been awarded this year’s Zonta Design Award of $5000.

Ms Robinson finishes her four-year design degree at Massey’s Wellington campus this year and plans to further explore micro-architecture, interiors and environmentally-neutral living by completing a one-year Masters programme in 2009 in Europe.

Until then she is looking for design work in Melbourne.

“Seeing the world, experiencing different cultures and exploring new methods of design will be of great benefit when I return to New Zealand”, she says.

Ms Robinson, who attended Nelson College for Girls, beat four other finalists for the supreme award.

The runners-up were: Jo-Ann Harris, who specialises in visual communication design and was sponsored by Saatchi and Saatchi, Lauren Skogstad (interior design, Limited Editions Interior Design), Mira Stanton (fashion and textile design, Rembrandt) and Shelley Jacobson (photographic design, Image Lab). Each received $1000.

Zonta is an international club of businesswomen. The annual awards honour the top women graduates from the University’s School of Design. The overall award recipient is asked to develop and implement a proposal that assists young women who are thinking about design as a career or who are already studying design.

Securities Commission chairwoman Jane Diplock presented the awards.
