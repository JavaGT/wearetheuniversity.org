Third-year veterinary science students at Massey University have again been snapped horsing around in the nude.

For the ninth year in succession, students have stripped off and posed  
behind a variety of props, including horses and other farm animals for  
the Barely There calendar. The photos were shot around Massey’s Manawatū campus and farms, as well as locations in Wellington and Tauranga.

Most of the proceeds from calendar sales will help fund the Halfway Day  
celebrations that mark reaching the midpoint of what is effectively a five- year degree. Ten per cent of the funds raised will go to the New Zealand Riding for the Disabled Association.

Student Nadine Hahn said it was a fun way to get to know her classmates. “It’s something you hear about in first year that absolutely terrifies you, but when it comes time to do it it’s actually not as bad as you thought."

Ms Hahn says they chose the Riding for the Disabled Association because it shows the positive influence that animals can have on people’s lives. “It is a charitable organisation that provides opportunities for anyone with a disability to enjoy safe, healthy, stimulating, therapeutic horse riding and horse-related activities.”

The students aim to sell 2500 of the calendars that run from July this year to June 2015. They can be purchased for $15 at www.vetcalendar.co.nz .
