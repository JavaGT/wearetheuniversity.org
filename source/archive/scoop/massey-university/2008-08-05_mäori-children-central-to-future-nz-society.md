Mäori children central to future New Zealand society

Children’s Commissioner Dr Cindy Kiro will present a lecture next Wednesday in Wellington to highlight the importance of Mäori and Pacific children to New Zealand society in the future.

Entitled, Challenges for the Future – Opportunities for Mäori, the lecture is being held as part of Massey’s Te Mata o te Tau (Academy for Mäori Research and Scholarship) lecture series.

The lecture will cover the demographic changes that will see the status of Mäori children change. “New Zealand society will become more dependent on an increasingly small population of children, a larger portion of who will be of Mäori and Pacific descent, while the rest of the population ages,” says Dr Kiro.

“This is occurring during a time when we are grappling with international issues such as climate change, the rise of religious fundamentalism and associated security risks from this, and with changing technology. There are also considerable challenges within whänau, Mäori communities and New Zealand society in dealing with issues that shape opportunities for Mäori children and young people, including violence and poverty.”

Dr Kiro has a PhD in social policy and has worked as a social worker, researcher and manager.

The lecture will be held at Massey University, 6pm, 13 August 2008, Room 4B06 (Gate Entry E) Tasman St.
