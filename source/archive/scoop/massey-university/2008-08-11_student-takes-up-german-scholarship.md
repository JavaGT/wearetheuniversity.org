Language studies student takes up German scholarship

Second-year language studies student Anna Mansell (pictured) faces sitting her Maori language exams in Cologne this year after taking up a scholarship to teach in Germany.

The 20-year old, who is studying extramurally towards a Bachelor of Arts in Maori and German languages, leaves this week for nine months in the small town of Erkrath, near Düsseldorf.

Ms Mansell, whose mother is German, says she cannot wait to get there.

“My grandparents live there and they’re very excited to be seeing me again. I’ve been in touch with a couple of families in the town who are keen to host me while I’m there.”

Ms Mansell will work 12 hours a week at a secondary school, teaching English, with the German Academic Exchange Service paying her a monthly allowance and contributing towards airfares.

She will continue her studies while in Europe.

“That means I’ll have to sit exams in German and Maori language later in the year in Cologne, which should be interesting.”

Senior German lecturer, Dr Ute Walker, says the teaching scholarship is a fantastic opportunity.

“It’s great for language learners because they don’t have to be fluent speakers,” Dr Walker says. “Anna will get work experience through teaching at the school but more importantly will gain cultural exposure while in Germany. It will provide opportunities should she wish to go back and work there after finishing her studies.”
