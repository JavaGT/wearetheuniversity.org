**Mass uprising a world record for Massey students**  
   
A rainbow chain of 423 arm-linked Massey University students rose up simultaneously in a Guinness World Record breaking event at the Manawatū campus yesterday.

In a show of carefully coordinated timing and strength, students broke the current world record of 118 armed-linked people to stand up simultaneously by an outstanding margin.

One of O’ Week’s highlights, the world record attempt attracted hordes of mostly first year students. Participants had to practice the slightly tricky move of crouching back-to-back in two long rows, locking arms with the person next to them then lifting themselves to a standing position in sync with the crowd.

Before the attempt, they watched athletes demonstrated the best technique to ensure mass success in this year’s world record attempt, which has become a highlight for O’ Week for the past four years.

The current world record is 118, achieved by Charotar Education Society in India, on 8 March 2016.  
   
Organiser Jane McLaughlin, from the Manawatū Campus Events team, says this year’s theme was chosen because it represents what can be achieved through team building and inclusiveness and is a fun, quirky way to make new friends in the first week of campus life for Massey students.

Alicia Jopson, a first year Food and Technology student from Morrinsville, said the event was fun, with the hardest part practising the link, lock and lift action before the official attempt.

Residential Assistant Kamie Veikoso, a third year Bachelor of Arts (Education) student said the event was ‘cool! It was great to be part of something involving so many people and to break the record.”  
   
The event was monitored and filmed – including drone footage – in accordance with Guinness World Record rules, which call for participants to be officially counted using an official clicker. Independent witnesses were Margaret Kouvellis, Tony Jensen and Vaughan Dennison.

  
In previous O’ Weeks, Massey students have broken world records in apple bobbing, water sliding and gumboot throwing. This week’s was by the far the largest margin they surpassed the current record by.   
   
MC Andy Whitson, from Palmerston North’s JAM: Ideas That Spread recruitment agency, infused the event with his humour and energy in the build-up to the mass uprising. A Fonterra milk tanker added to the carnival atmosphere with regular toots and free milk prizes. Red Frogs local church chaplains also attended to provide support for students.

O’ Week activities still to come include: Opportunity Shop Ball, Rainbow Tea for the LGBTI student community, volleyball competition, toga party, quiz night and come down picnic.
