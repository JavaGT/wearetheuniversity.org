Peter Snell’s road to wellness

Physical activity and exercise are under-utilised tools in the effort to improve the health and wellbeing of all New Zealanders. For many Kiwis the physical activity of daily living has seriously reduced to levels which could see life expectancy retreating for the first time. Obesity-related deaths are more than twice the annual road toll, yet effective interventions can take a few minutes a day. Knowledge is the new ‘currency’ of wellness.

Dr Peter Snell, champion New Zealand health scientist and sporting icon, joined by respected Massey University Professor in Maori health and development, Chris Cunningham, will discuss how the disciplines of exercise science and public health/Maori health can be combined successfully to support the maintenance of wellness and the treatment of disease in an “ageing, browning” New Zealand.

This is Dr Snell’s only public lecture in Wellington.

Dr Snell is a Massey University Foundation Visiting Fellow in Health and Exercise Science, and recent recipient of an Honorary Doctorate from Massey University. He is also Associate Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern and Director of the University of Texas Southwestern Human Performance Centre in Dallas. He is currently engaged with Massey University researchers in the development of a research programme in Public Health and Exercise Science.
