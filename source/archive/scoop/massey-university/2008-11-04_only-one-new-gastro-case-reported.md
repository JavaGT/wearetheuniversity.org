Only one new gastro case reported

Only one new case of gastroenteritis has been reported at Massey’s Manawatu campus in the past 24 hours. Staff are increasingly optimistic the outbreak is under control, but the additional measures including extra cleaning, hand sanitisers and wipes and an alternative exam venue will remain in place until at least Saturday.

Regional registrar Dr Sandi Shillington says that this morning only three students used the alternative exam venue, provided for students who had been unwell but now felt well enough to write their exams. Many students are applying for impaired performance consideration for exams sat while they were unwell or soon afterwards, and medical staff are now assisting with this process. The last exam of the year will take place on campus on Saturday.

Around 155 students and a few staff have now been affected by the gastroenteritis outbreak, which started with the first affected students becoming unwell in the early hours of Friday morning. The University’s management plan was enacted and extra staff remained on campus throughout the weekend to care for students and manage the outbreak.

The University is awaiting the results of laboratory tests to ascertain the nature of the outbreak. Public Health medical staff have been extremely positive about how well the University has managed the situation.
