**Business entries among best in awards history**

This year's entries in the Wanganui Business Awards are among the best judging convener Dr James Lockhart has seen.

Dr Lockhart is one of three judges on the panel, all of them linked to Massey University, which is sponsor of the awards, to be announced on Saturday night.

The College of Business Associate Pro Vice-Chancellor has been involved in the awards for six years since their inception and is excited about naming the winners on Saturday night.

“The high quality of the entries has taken me by surprise, as well as the time and effort put in, and the competition has been extremely tight,\" Dr Lockhart says. "Not one of the entries has even mentioned the recession; they’re just getting on with it. One business has even increased its turnover by more than 100 per cent over the last year."

As well as Dr Lockhart, this year’s other judges were the University’s former senior lecturer in human resources, Barrie Humphreys, and accountancy lecturer Lindsay Hawkes. The University has sponsored the supreme award and is also the naming rights sponsor for the first time this year. This recognises its role as the "local" university, and its expertise in business teaching and research.

“We are always very pleased to be involved in the awards and very keen to support, recognise and assist the business community in Wanganui. It is thriving and there are a whole lot of exciting initiatives going on, which are giving the area a real focus and a push,” says Dr Lockhart. “We’re proud to be increasing the awareness of business achievement in the region by celebrating local business success across a range of categories that directly contribute to the region’s growth and development.”

Awards will be given out in 10 categories at the War Memorial Hall and the supreme award chosen from the category winners.
