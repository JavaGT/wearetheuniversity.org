Māori staff PhDs a boost for College of Business

Te Au Rangahau, the Māori Business Research Centre, based in the College of Business management department, last night celebrated the completion of doctoral studies by three staff members.

Director Annemarie Gillies and research associate Marianne Tremaine will graduate at the ceremonies in Palmerston North tomorrow, while another Te Au Rangahau research associate, Shirley Barnett, has just passed her PhD oral examination and will graduate during the May graduation week next year.

The trio were presented with korowai (cloaks) specially designed to reflect their personalities.

Dr Farah Palmer, a former Director of Te Au Rangahau and now research associate, says the three new doctorates double the number of Māori staff with PhDs in Massey's College of Business, New Zealand's largest business school.

“One of the objectives of Te Au Rangahau was to develop the capability of Māori staff within the college and to provide opportunities to advance research skills and writing,\" Dr Palmer says. "The successful completion of three PhDs is a significant achievement for Te Au Rangahau and a resounding success for the centre and for the individuals involved."

Ms Gillies (Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāti Awa, Te Whānau-ā-Apanui, Te Arawa) completed a PhD called Kia Taupunga te Ngakau Māori – Anchoring Māori Health Workforce Potential” last year. Ms Tremaine (Kāi Tahu) also completed her thesis, Her worship the mayor: Women’s leadership in New Zealand local government, last year. Shirley Barnett (Ngāti Tūwharetoa) submitted her PhD thesis in management on Understanding guest retention: An examination of New Zealand accommodation establishments this year.

Dr Palmer says it was celebration for friends, colleagues and whānau of a milestone achievement. "Our wāhine Māori have overcome many personal and professional challenges to get to this point, and all three of them give new meaning to the word ‘multi-tasking’. We are very proud of them and will enjoy this time to reflect on what they’ve accomplished."

Dr Palmer, Dr Manuhuia Barcham and Dr Guy Scott are the other Māori staff of the college with PhDs.
