Manawatū to mark International Dance Day
========================================

**Manawatū to mark International Dance Day**

International Dance Day will be marked in Palmerston North on April 30 with an event organised by Massey University's School of Humanities and in association with Te Manawa.

Twelve free 45-minute dance classes led by volunteer instructors will run from 10.30am-3.30pm at Te Manawa. They will include styles such as Jazz, Ceroc, Scottish, Zumba, among others.

Organiser Dr Gina Salapata, a senior lecturer in Classical Studies, who will be running the Greek dance session, says the event will celebrate multiculturalism. She cites a Japanese proverb: \"We’re fools whether we dance or not, so we might as well dance."

Dr Salapata says: “the classes will suit anyone over the age of 10. Dancing is good for the body and the brain, and a great way to socialise.”
