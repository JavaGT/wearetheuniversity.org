Engineering students mix creativity and complexity
==================================================

**Press Release: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

**Engineering students mix creativity with  
complex solutions**

Complex engineering problems and their solutions will be on display in an exhibition that caps four years of study for engineering students at the Wellington campus.

Observe, Invent, Realise will be held at the Holiday Inn on Wednesday and showcases the students’ self-directed solutions to a wide range of complex engineering problems in both the real and virtual worlds, including projects that bridge the two.

In addition to the work itself, students have had to defend their methods and progress in front of their peers, public and a panel of engineering academics and professionals.

A range of mechatronics projects will be on display along with five multi-media projects that provide a first opportunity to see work from the Multimedia Systems Engineering major.

The projects range from web design to a new computer game that is best viewed wearing provided 3D glasses.

This is the first year that the University has held an engineering exhibition in conjunction with its annual BLOW09 creative festival.

The exhibition runs from 3pm – 7pm tomorrow at the Holiday Inn, 75 Featherston Street Wellington.
