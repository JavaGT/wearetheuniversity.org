**Massey and Hawke’s Bay to formalise partnership**

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey will lead a high-level Massey University delegation to Hawke’s Bay next week to cement links with local mayors and chief executives.

The Hawke’s Bay Regional Council will host Massey’s senior leadership team and key staff on Wednesday afternoon when they will sign a Memorandum of Understanding. This will formalise a longstanding relationship with has a focus on agri-food research and teaching.

“Hawke’s Bay is strategically important for Massey. We want to be the university of choice in the Bay and we are seeking to strengthen our presence by formally partnering on projects with industry and local government to develop the region, as well as on initiatives involving schools.” He says professorial lectures delivered by key staff last year, including Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Maori and Pasifika) Professor Sir Mason Durie and Professors Glynn Harper and Jacqueline Rowarth were well received and more are planned this year.

“We have been working hard in Hawke’s Bay in the last couple of years around issues to do with food, agriculture and land use. Our meeting on Wednesday will include updates on key projects and initiatives including irrigation and farm business performance.”

Mr Maharey says local boards and industry can benefit by partnering with Massey. “We live in a knowledge-based world, and the region is faced with a whole series of issues, including young people leaving, land use and managing water – regions have the opportunity to call on our experts in these areas.

“Hawke’s Bay has significant links with Massey, particularly through our research and teaching in areas such as food science, agriculture, veterinary science, horticulture, environmental management and business. These areas are integral to Hawke’s Bay’s economy”.

Mr Maharey says his senior leadership team looks forward to meeting local leaders during its week in the Hawke’s Bay, as well as to holding its annual two-day strategic planning workshop.

More than 3500 Massey graduates live in the Bay. Each year up to 200 local secondary school students enrol at Massey’s campuses and many others enrol with the University’s distance-learning programme.
