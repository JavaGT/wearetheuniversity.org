Lahar research gets funding from communication company

Investigating the recent “clockwork” lahar on Mt Ruapehu has netted postgraduate student Mark Dittmer a research grant from communication firm Senate Communication Counsel.

Mr Dittmer, a Masters student from the Department of Communication and Journalism, says it was fascinating to study 11 years of communication and issues management connected with the lahar.

“When the lahar swept down Ruapehu in March this year, there was a collective sigh of relief and praise for all the agencies involved. However, it’s important to remember the controversy that has surrounded this issue for years.”

Mr Dittmer describes the Tangiwai disaster, caused by a similar lahar in 1953, as “a spectre that dogged those charged with managing the build-up of water in the crater lake following Ruapehu’s 1995 eruption”. There was criticism of the Government’s decision not to bulldoze the crater rim, leading to media coverage and public concern.

“Management of public relations issues and reputation was an important part of managing the lahar, because all the stakeholders needed to be brought on board to work towards solutions.”

Senate Communication Counsel supports research that aims to increase knowledge and understanding of communication and reputation management, and promote communication research and evaluation. Up to two grants a year are available to postgraduate students attending Massey or Victoria Universities.

Senate Communication managing partner Neil Green says the decision to support Mr Dittmer’s research was an easy one to make. “The topic, and the role stakeholders played in the management of the lahar, make for a fascinating study,” Mr Green says. “Mark’s application had identified the range of issues involved and promises to be a very interesting piece of work. We look forward to supporting the development and promotion of his study.”

Mr Dittmer will use the $1500 grant to visit and interview key people from agencies managing and communicating about the lahar. The scholarship also gives him the opportunity to work with Senate Communication Counsel partner Marjory Embleton to investigate the role stakeholder communication played in the lahar’s management.

The title of his thesis, The Clockwork Lahar, comes from a press interview with a Ruapehu District Council worker who said the lahar ‘”went like clockwork”.

“It’s a great topic,” Mr Dittmer says. “The lahar has caught New Zealand’s attention for the past 11 years, and now it’s an excellent example of issues management in action.”
