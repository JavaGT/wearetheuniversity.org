Mouthguard design eases detection of concussion

Rugby may be over for another season but industrial design student Spencer Buchanan believes he has created a device that makes it easier to identify and manage concussions in the sport.

His prototype mouthguard Nerve features microelectronics, including motion sensors, within the middle layer of the design. The data received from the mouth guard is linked to a sideline iPad that accumulates the player’s percentage of concussion risk based on an algorithm. It identifies where on the head a player has sustained an impact injury while also providing previous concussion history and pre-season baseline tests.

Mr Buchanan, who suffered several concussions playing rugby and snowboarding, says his design allows sideline medical staff to make more accurate decisions as to whether a player should continue playing on after suffering a head knock.

“My design picks up impacts missed by the human eye and transfers the data to side line staff,” he says.

“It allows the sideline doctor to rapidly decide with the benefit of accurate real time data if a player needs to come off the field for rehabilitation to minimise the possibility of second impact syndrome \[multiple injuries in a game\].”

His design is part of the annual Exposure exhibition of work by final year design students at Massey’s College of Creative Arts, exhibiting now till November 21.

Mr Buchanan has been in contact with professional rugby doctors and a medical researcher who has had experience with testing wearable technology on players. They were interested and excited about his design.

“Wearable technology is an emerging trend in contact sport and this design adds something new to it.”

The mouthguard is designed to be custom-made to fit the individual requirements of players and its microelectronics are laminated within the design to prevent any health and safety concerns too.

Mr Buchanan, who is originally from Warkworth, says treatment of rugby injuries has come a long way in recent years and he applauds measures such as the mandatory stand-down period for any player concussed.

“I love the game and it hasn’t stopped me playing the game, I just think the issue of concussion could still be managed better.

“Clinical assessment over-rides any technology but this helps sideline officials and management make informed decisions.”
