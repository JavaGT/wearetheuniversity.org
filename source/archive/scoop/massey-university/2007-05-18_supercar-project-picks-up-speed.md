Supercar project picks up speed

After four years in development, New Zealand’s supercar is going on show before international car fans in the Middle East next month.

Named in honour of New Zealand’s only Formula One world champion, Denny Hulme, the Hulme.F1 is an eye-catching racing machine designed for road use.

Design team coordinator Professor Tony Parker, is hoping to generate interest among buyers.

He will accompany the car to shows in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, for brand development and marketing.

“These are prime opportunities to test the market and attract investors for this revolutionary F1 road car,” says Mr Parker, who heads the University’s Industrial Design department.

“We will be launching a collectors’ limited edition print (pictured) to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Denny Hulme’s Formula One World Drivers' Championship.”

This has been signed by eight Formula One world champions and 20 other drivers, all who raced against Denny Hulme in Formula One between 1965 and 1974.

Launched in 2005 as a concept car, the Hulme.F1 is being fitted with General Motors’ latest high-tech LS7 V8 engine this year, to test basic componentry.
