**New social work book gives students valuable virtual experience**

A new book from Massey University Press will help social work students make better informed decisions about where to do work placements, and which area of practice to pursue once they graduate.

_Social Work in Aotearoa New Zealand – Exploring fields of practice_ is the latest offering by Dr Kathryn Hay, Dr Michael Dale and Lareen Cooper from Massey’s School of Social Work. The book, on sale from today, will be officially launched at Massey’s Social Work in Changing Times: Towards better outcomes conference held on the Manawatū campus later this month. The three-day conference is part of the School of Social Work’s celebrations to mark the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Bachelor of Social Work, the first to be offered by a New Zealand university.

The book includes links to 37 video clips of social workers explaining heir fields of practice. QR codes and URL links appear at key points throughout the book, giving immediate links to the videos and other websites and resources. The book also includes graphics of social work theories and models, selected transcripts from the interviews and photographs of the social workers in their organisations.

Dr Hay says the book is designed to help social work students make informed decisions about where to undertake the minimum 120 days of field placement required during their study.

“Our book introduces students to five fields of practice in Aotearoa New Zealand. Based on the current policy and legislative climate in which social workers operate, it gives inspirational, up-to-date and unique insights into social work environments, including working with youth, youth justice, women’s health, community faith-based work and adult mental health. Together, the book and the accompanying videos allow students to get a real feel for life as a social work graduate.”

Dr Hay says the book is a unique and vital work for first and second year students. “It’s colourful, engaging, dynamic, and most importantly, relevant. This is a significant addition to the current literature available to students on social work practice in Aotearoa New Zealand, and provides a fresh approach to more traditional textbooks.”
