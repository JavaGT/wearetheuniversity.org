Students from the College of Creative Arts registered five gold wins, three silver and seven bronze at the awards at a function at the Auckland Museum.

The gold winners include Tim Cox, who earlier this year won a top design industry prize, the James Dyson Award, for his design of an ultrasound tool set designed to quickly measure the commercial worth of forests. This same design won the gold award for student product design at BeST.
