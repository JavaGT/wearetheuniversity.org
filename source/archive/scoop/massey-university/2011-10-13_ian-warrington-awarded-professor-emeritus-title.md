Ian Warrington awarded professor emeritus title

Dr Ian Warrington has been awarded the title Professor Emeritus by the Massey University Council's honorary awards committee.

The committee considered Dr Warrington's service to community and professional organisations, his contribution to research and his continuing advocacy for Massey as an institution for study and research were significant. Additionally, the committee noted he is highly respected, nationally and internationally, in the field of horticulture.

Professor Warrington, of Palmerston North, grew up in Hastings, enrolled at Massey in 1965, graduating with a first-class Master of Horticultural Science degree in 1972 and a Doctor of Science degree in 1989. He had a 30-year career with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and became known nationally and internationally for his research work on horticultural crops.

His roles at Massey since 2002 include Professor of Horticultural Science, Deputy Vice-Chancellor and acting Vice-Chancellor prior to the arrival of the current Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey. His most recent role at Massey was as Manawatu regional chief executive, until he retired in May last year. He remains closely connected with the University, including in contract roles and serves on the boards of the BioCommerce Centre and Manfeild Park.
