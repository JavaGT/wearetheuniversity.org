An agreement will be signed between Massey University and Te Wänganga o Aotearoa tomorrow aimed at providing more integrated tertiary education opportunities for Mäori.

Discussions between the two institutions have been in progress for more than a year. Both have agreed that Mäori educational advancement cannot be fully progressed without the creation of pathways that will facilitate entry into higher education and lead on to lifelong learning with expanded career options.

The agreement will be signed by Te Wänanga o Aotearoa Te Pouhere (chief executive) Bentham Ohia and Massey Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey at Massey's Manawatu campus.

It will cover all three Massey campuses – Albany, Manawatu and Wellington – and its internationally-recognised distance learning programme, and the more than 11 campuses and 80 delivery sites run throughout New Zealand by Te Wänanga, which is based in Te Awamutu.

Massey Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasifika) Professor Sir Mason Durie says the agreement represents a major step towards a collaboration that will benefit students, maximise resources, and share expertise.

"By working together and jointly planning for the future, Te Wänanga o Aotearoa and Massey University intend to transform the tertiary experience so that the best possible educational outcomes are within the reach of more Mäori," Sir Mason says.

Mr Ohia says Te Wänanga o Aotearoa is focused on whänau transformation through education. “Mäori have diverse educational requirements, from certificate to master's and PhD level. The priority for this partnership is to provide pathways for each institution’s respective students to ensure they are able to reach their fullest educational potential.”

He said the priority for Te Wänanga o Aotearoa was to work with a range of quality tertiary providers to help lift the educational performance and opportunity of Mäori – an outcome that benefits New Zealand.

**Background:** Te Wänanga o Aotearoa is one of the country’s largest tertiary institutions, providing education to more than 35,000 students. It is a tertiary education provider for all New Zealanders, driven by Mäori principles and values. The institution provides a comprehensive range of programmes from certificate to degree level in study options that includes teaching, social services, computers, te Reo Mäori, trade training and small business. More than half of Te Wänanga o Aotearoa students are Mäori. The institution works with a low to no-fee model across a range of delivery methods, including classroom based, noho marae, distance learning, and full and part-time study options.
