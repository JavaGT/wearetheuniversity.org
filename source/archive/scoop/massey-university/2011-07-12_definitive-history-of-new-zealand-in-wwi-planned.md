**'Definitive' history of New Zealand in WWI planned**

Professor Glyn Harper has stepped down from his role as director of the University's Centre for Defence and Security Studies to lead the production of a definitive history of the nation's involvement in the First World War in time for the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign in 2015.

The project aims to produce nine volumes about different aspects of the 1914-18 war, researched and written by Professor Harper and other top New Zealand military historians.

Professor Harper will remain at Massey, which is leading the project in partnership with the New Zealand Defence Force and the Royal Returned and Services Association. More details will be announced next month at a formal launch in conjunction with the NZDF and the RSA.

Nick Nelson has been appointed acting director of the centre, which is part of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Mr Nelson has been a lecturer at Massey since 2009. He was previously in the New Zealand Army and held the rank of lieutenant colonel. His research interests include organisational psychology, the psychology of terrorism and insurgency, and sports psychology.
