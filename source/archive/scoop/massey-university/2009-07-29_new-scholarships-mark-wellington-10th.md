New scholarships mark Wellington 10th

Scholarships worth a total of $20,000 are being offered to mark the 10th anniversary of the University's Wellington campus. They will be available to school leavers and postgraduate students studying full-time on the campus next year.

Sponsored by The Dominion Post newspaper, there are eight scholarships. Six of $2000 are available for school leavers studying accounting, business studies, communication, health science or nursing. Successful applications will be selected based on academic merit and contribution to school and community activities.

Two scholarships of $4000 each will available to postgraduate students in creative arts or the Master of Engineering programmes. Selection will be based on the likelihood of academic excellence in the proposed field of study.

Wellington regional chief executive Professor Andrea McIlroy says the university is delighted to be able to offer the scholarship. "My sincere thanks to The Dominion Post management for their support in what has become an extremely positive relationship," Professor McIlroy says. "As a destination campus our students come from all over New Zealand so there can be an additional travel expenses on top of the costs they face making the transition from school to first-year university study.

“The substantial postgraduate scholarships could make the difference to whether a student continues at university or seeks a job. Postgraduate study involved expenses ranging from buying course materials to more travel expenses arising from the necessary research work.”

Scholarship application forms can be downloaded from the scholarships and awards website: http://awards.massey.ac.nz or obtained by writing to the Scholarships Office, Massey University, Private Bag 11-222, Palmerston North.
