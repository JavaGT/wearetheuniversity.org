**Massey expands worldwide education**

Massey University has announced major new plans to develop the international education market under the banner of Massey Worldwide.

Building on its base as one of the first universities in the world to launch distance and online learning, Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says Massey will now expand its teaching and research activity internationally to secure tertiary education as a major export earner for New Zealand.

Further details about Massey Uniuversity Worldwide will be outlined at the initiative’s launch at 5.30pm on Tueday February 25.

Mr Maharey says Massey already attracts a large number of international students to New Zealand, but there is a rapidly growing demand for high quality programmes delivered by an internationally-focused university in their own country.

“Advances in technology mean a transformational change in education is taking place. There is enormous growth in demand from students for education from countries that cannot meet that requirement themselves. Massey is well positioned to meet this demand because of our long history of online education and our strong relationships with many corporations, governments and educational institutions developed worldwide over many years.”

Massey already provides online, face-to-face and distance education to a number of international partners including: the MBA programme to Qatar Airways pilots which has been tailored to have an aviation focus; a $10m World-Bank funded project working with public health, biosecurity experts and veteriarians in South Asia to better manage the spread of animal-to-human diseases; development of a Spanish language programme taught online for Australian students enrolled at the University of New England (UNE) in Armidale, New South Wales, with tutorials run at UNE.

Mr Maharey says the university will now take up the opportunity to increase its high quality, niche educational offering to overseas students in the university’s key areas of expertise such as agriculture, business studies, emergency management and design.

“Massey has been educating New Zealanders and other international students through a flexible and blended learning model for many years. These plans will build on our expertise to provide tailor-made programmes to numerous international partners, increasing Massey and New Zealand’s international earnings offshore substantially.’

He says Massey would also look to further develop on-line programmes to suit international students studying overseas; work with New Zealand businesses seeking to expand offshore through capability building; bid for more internationally-funded research projects and make use of emerging technology and innovative delivery platforms – like Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) – to extend the university’s international reach and profile.

“We have provided education offshore for many years and this initiative is aimed at taking our people, their expertise and knowledge to the rest of the world. Using new technology we now have the technology, the experience and faculty to deliver our programmes anywhere anytime,” he says.

**Massey University Worldwide will be launched at 5.30pm on Tuesday February 25, level B of Te Ara Hihiko, The College of Creative Arts building, Block 12, Tasman St, Wellington campus. Parking is at Entrance E on Tasman St.**
