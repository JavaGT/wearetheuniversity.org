Pacific Peoples report welcomed

Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Warrington welcomes the review, Pacific Peoples in New Zealand, issued today by the Human Rights Commission.

The review, by Race Relations Commissioner Joris de Bres, considers the controversy that followed publication of a discussion paper on national immigration policy and the economic contribution of migrants to New Zealand. The paper and associated news releases were written and made public three months ago by Dr Greg Clydesdale, a senior lecturer in the Department of Management and International Business.

Professor Warrington says the review appears to be a thorough and thoughtful examination of the issues that arose following publication of reports about Dr Clydesdale's research.

"Massey University is firmly committed to the principles of academic freedom but equally firmly committed the highest standards of research, professionalism and ethical behaviour," Professor Warrington says.

"The University did not release Dr Clydesdale's material to the media and never endorsed the content of it. It understands and regrets the hurt caused in some communities as a result of what was reported, but also notes the commissioner's finding that many reports were inaccurate."

The University acknowledges receipt of complaints on the matter. They are currently under investigation. It is not appropriate to comment further until the process is complete.

In a statement issued in May, the University's acting Pasifika Director, Sione Tu’itahi, said Dr Clydesdale's report did not recognise the wider contribution of Pacific people.

Mr Tu'itahi says Massey's Pasifika Strategy – a first for any New Zealand tertiary institution and official policy of the University – reflects its commitment to the socio-economic wellbeing of Pasifika peoples.

Mr Tu'itahi will be speaking at the diversity forum in Auckland today, where the commission's report is being made public.
