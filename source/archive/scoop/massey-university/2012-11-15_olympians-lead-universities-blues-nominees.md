Olympians lead Universities Blues nominees

Olympic gold medallists Lisa Carrington and Hamish Bond and Silver Fern Laura Langman are among the 67 student-athletes to be awarded New Zealand Universities Blues this year.

The awards, on December 6, are sponsored by ASB Bank and will be hosted by Massey University at its Wellington campus. Students from six universities will be presented Blues at the event.

As well as the Blues presentation, a number of major awards will also be presented.

Nominees for sportsperson of the year include Massey University’s Lisa Carrington (kayak), Hamish Bond (rowing), Storm Uru (rowing) and Glenn Snyders (swimming), and Waikato University’s Nathan Cohen (rowing), Laura Langman (netball) and Duncan Grant (rowing).

Nominees for Māori sportsperson of the year are Lisa Carrington, Storm Uru and Kayla Sharland (hockey) all of Massey University.

Other major prizes include the distinguished performance award and an award for outstanding performance at the 2011 International University Sports Federation Summer Universiade.

Massey Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says the Blues recipients are a particularly strong group this year.

“We look forward to hosting the event that will acknowledge New Zealand's leading student-athletes in this Olympic year. It’s great to have ASB Bank on board to assist in celebrating what has been a fantastic year for university sport.”

ASB’s Executive General Manager for Culture and Community Linley Wood says the Universities Blues provide a great opportunity to recognise top young New Zealand athletes who are achieving at an international level.

The New Zealand Universities Blues are awarded to student-athletes that have excelled both academically and in their sport. They have been awarded in New Zealand since 1919.
