Instant graduate display too good to resist

Prospective students get the lowdown on life at the university's Wellington campus tomorrow, but if it's anything like last year it will not be the fashion, film, robotics or music that captures the imagination most.

What the young people really flocked to was a cut-out display that enables them to be photographed as they might look in three or four years time when they graduate in gown and mortarboard.

Last year’s display was so popular it went missing before the day was finished.

"We had our backs turned for a few minutes," events coordinator Christine McGonigal recalls. "One moment it was there, the next it was gone. We think it might have ended up in someone’s student flat.”

The open day runs from 8.30am to 4pm with year-13 pupils from schools throughout the lower North Island and upper South Island expected to attend. For further information, check the massey.ac.nz website or phone 0800-MASSEY.
