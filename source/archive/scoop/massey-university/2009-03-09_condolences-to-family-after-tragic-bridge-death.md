Condolences to family after tragic bridge death

Massey University has expressed sincere condolences to the family and friends of Catherine Mary Peters, an 18-year-old first-year student who died last night after an accident at the Ballance Bridge in the Manawatu Gorge.

She was one of a group of students from the Massey University Alpine Club who travelled to Ballance yesterday to take part in a bridge swing event, run by a commercial company based in Palmerston North. The club is one of many that are affiliated to the Massey University Students’ Association.

Police say she fell about 22m from the swing at about 2.45pm onto rocks in the riverbed, sustaining serious injuries. She died in Palmerston North Hospital last night.

Members of her family travelled to Palmerston North today and were met by senior Massey staff, who are providing full support.

University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says Massey staff are providing support and counselling to the other students present during the incident, many of who live in the halls of residence.

“The University is shocked by this incident and has conveyed its condolences to the family. We will work closely with them to give them all the support we can. We will also work closely with students and the students association to ensure they have the support they need.”

Massey University Students’ Association President Matt Poucher says the entire student union expresses its deepest sympathy to Catherine’s family and friends. “The Alpine Club is one of our oldest clubs with an excellent safety record. Obviously we will provide any support we can to the students involved.”

The Alpine Club President Jackson Wong said club members, who met today to share their grief, were spoken to by a counsellor from the Massey staff.

“This is a devastating event and our thoughts and condolences go out to the family and all those that have been effected by this tragedy,” Mr Wong said.

“We are devastated by this tragedy and our thoughts go out Catherine’s family and the group involved,” said Crag Adventures Director Alastair McWhannell.

“Health and Safety has always been our most important concern when conducting these exercises and we have never had an incident in our nine years running bridge swinging.

“All the participants are fully harnessed in specialist safety equipment.

“We are working with Police and Health and Safety officials who are conducting a full investigation. Given the ongoing inquiry, we are unable to comment further at this time.”

This statement was released today by Catherine Peters’ family:
