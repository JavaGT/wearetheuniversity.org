**Orientation Week In Full Swing At Albany Campus**

Students arriving for the 2013 academic year at the Albany campus have been enjoying a range of activities across the campus, in between classes.

On Tuesday, Ultimate Games Day offered a range of giant-sized activities, including giant Jenga, giant Twister and giant Connect-4. The inflatable water football pitch gave a welcome relief from the summer sun.

Wednesday’s activities include Clubs and Market Day, with over 50 students clubs showing the variety of opportunities available. Stallholders from the Coatesville Market will also ply their wares.

On Thursday, Kiwiana Festival Day will showcase Māori cultural performances, a pavlova eating contest, bungy trampolines, Power zorbs and lots of fantastic New Zealand music.

Albany campus registrar Andrea Davies says Orientation week is always a great start to the year, and the colourful stands and activities supported by generous sponsors makes a big difference.

“The atmosphere is just buzzing, and it’s wonderful to see all these new faces joining in with the activities. Orientation week just seems to go from strength to strength every year.”
