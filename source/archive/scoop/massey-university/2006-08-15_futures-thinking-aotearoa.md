The housing market, the balance of payments and New Zealand's foreign debt - exploring the linkages

This presentation by David Tripe of Massey University's Centre for Banking Studies looks at the banks' lending on housing, and at how the steady increase in this may relate to New Zealand's balance of payments deficit and the steady increase in private sector foreign indebtedness.

David Tripe is Director of the Centre for Banking Studies, and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Finance, Banking & Property at Massey University. Prior to joining the Centre in early 1994, Dr Tripe worked in a number of New Zealand banks, gaining experience of a number of facets of banking.

Dr Tripe publishes a quarterly newsletter reviewing the financial performance of New Zealand banks. Other areas of interest and publication include financial institution efficiency, competitive conditions in the New Zealand banking market, issues arising from the foreign ownership of the New Zealand banking system, New Zealand bank supervisory policy, securitisation, payments systems, and bank risk management. He is also interested in comparisons between the New Zealand banking system and that of other countries, particularly Australia.

The Centre for Banking Studies is a specialist teaching group at Massey University, focusing on research on the New Zealand banking sector. The Centre often acts as source of expert commentary and advice on banking issues.
