Big increase in science spend will make NZ rich

Massey University Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey has called for a dramatic lift in public and private investment in research, science and technology.

Speaking at the Australasian Research Management Conference in Christchurch today, Mr Maharey said that the argument in favour of investment in research science and technology had been won and it is time to make it a priority for major new investment.

“For many years the argument against investment in these areas was that not enough people – meaning voters – would support it. Scientists and research organisations were told to get out and explain what they did and why it matters.

“This has been done – and done very successfully. Universities and Crown Research Institutes do an outstanding job of getting their message across. The Royal Society and other leading science organisations have become very proactive. The media science hub provides science stories for the media and this has resulted in more science being reported.

"Individual scientists have become much more prominent. We now have a Chief Science Advisor to the Prime Minister. John Key has spoken frequently about his support for science. Business has lobbied and is lobbying for more investment in these areas. The list goes on and leaves you wondering just what else is there to do.

"We have reached the tipping point where the argument can no longer be sustained that science needs to convince us of its importance. What are we going to do – delay investment until every single New Zealander says they are convinced?"

Mr Maharey, a former Minister of Research, Science and Technology, said that investment had lifted in recent years and that the Government was to be complimented for putting more funding into science this year.

“But what we have done is not enough. It is time to double public funding and triple private sector funding. This would bring New Zealand up to the OECD average. We should be near the top of the OECD because it is only through science, research and technology that we will create the base for a step change in New Zealand.

"We have been asking ourselves why, as a nation of only four million people blessed by an abundance of natural resources, are we not rich. The answer is that we have not invested enough in the things that will change us – science, research and technology."
