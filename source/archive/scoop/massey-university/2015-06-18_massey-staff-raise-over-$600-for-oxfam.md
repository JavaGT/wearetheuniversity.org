**Massey staff raise over $600 for Oxfam**

A fundraising morning tea held recently at Massey University, as part of a national fundraising drive, raised more than $600 for Oxfam.

Organised by Jane Terrell and Vanessa van der Ham from the Centre for Teaching and Learning based in the library, the morning tea offered a variety of baked goods supplied by team members.

More than 40 Massey staff members supported the initiative, which will go towards supporting some of the poorest people in the world.

Manager of the Auckland campus Centre for Teaching and Learning Ken Cage says he is proud of what the team managed to achieve.

“We originally set out to raise enough money to organise a technical organic agriculture course for 20 tea farmers, to provide a healthy and profitable alternative to fertilisers and pesticides.

“We ended up raising almost double our original target. $600 can provide 10 families with enough organic rice to grow for an entire year and create a sustainable food source and income,” he says.
