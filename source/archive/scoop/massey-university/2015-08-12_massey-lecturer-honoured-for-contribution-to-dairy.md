**Massey University lecturer honoured for contribution to the Dairy Industry**

School of Food and Nutrition senior lecturer Rod Bennett has been awarded the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology Distinguished Service Award for the Dairy Industry.

The award was made in recognition of Rod’s 19 year contribution to the Dairy Industry/Fonterra Graduate Training Programme that has seen hundreds of students awarded the Master of Dairy Science and Technology, with many going on to highly successful and illustrious careers.

Rod Bennett says it is an honour to be given the award. “I’m chuffed. I have worked with a lot of good people in my career, and it’s very satisfying to see former students succeed in theirs.”

More than 55 people nominated Rod for the award, including graduates and supporting personnel of the Dairy Graduate Technical Programme.

Among mention, was the value Rod added to the programme, with fellow staff and students saying he is a “highly supportive and knowledgeable figure, who can be relied on for support and guidance”.

The award recognises long and exceptional service and/or contribution to a food industry sector in a scientific, technical, teaching, marketing or managerial role, and is specifically for industry personnel approaching or in retirement.
