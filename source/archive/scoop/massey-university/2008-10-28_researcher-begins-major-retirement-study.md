Researcher begins major retirement study

A Massey University PhD student is beginning research that will shape social policy aimed at improving the lives of the next generation of retirees.

The New Zealand Retirement Planning Survey will make up the major part of Jack Noone’s Doctoral research. The survey is funded by the School of Psychology, the Ministry of Social Development, and the Retirement Commission. His research will be supervised by Dr Christine Stephens and Dr Fiona Alpass.

Early next month, 3000 people aged between 50 and 60 will receive a questionnaire which Mr Noone says will examine their attitudes towards retirement and retirement planning.

“The survey looks at how they are preparing in terms of their future lifestyle, health, finances and their psychological preparations,” Mr Noone says. “The project goes beyond financial planning – it looks at all the different ways people are planning for retirement.”

He says the results of this study will uncover more information about how and why people plan for the future. “It will inform social policy aimed at increasing the well-being of the next generation of retirees, the baby boomers.”
