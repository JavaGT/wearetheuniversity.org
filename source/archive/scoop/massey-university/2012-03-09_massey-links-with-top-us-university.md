**Massey links with top US university**

Massey University has signed an agreement strengthening ties with one of the leading international agricultural universities in the United States, the University of Missouri.

Massey Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey and the University of Missouri’s Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, Professor Thomas Payne, signed the memorandum of understanding at the Manawatu campus on Wednesday.

The agreement will boost collaborative research and student exchanges between the two universities. Study abroad programmes and the exchange of existing faculty and staff are also included in the agreement.

Mr Maharey says the agreement will give Massey graduates a broader perspective on the industry. “The University of Missouri is known as a world leader in agriculture and engineering,” he says. “For Massey University to help New Zealand achieve, it must produce globally-informed graduates and this partnership will help do that. It will also provide our researchers the chance to not only learn from counterparts in Missouri but share their world-leading research with those in American agriculture’s heartland.”

While on campus, Professor Payne and his colleague Professor Bryan Garton visited the No.4 Dairy farm, the Riddet Institute, the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences and the Hopkirk Research Institute. They also met with a range of Massey University researchers who spoke about their current research activities.
