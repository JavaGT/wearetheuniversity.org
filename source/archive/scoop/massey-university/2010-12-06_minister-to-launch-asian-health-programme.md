Minister to launch Asian health programme
=========================================

Minister to launch Asian health programme

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce will tomorrow officially launch an international education programme under which the University will train Asian public health specialists and veterinarians in methods of countering the threats of global epidemics such as bird flu, swine flu and Aids.

The World Bank chose Massey as its partner for the $5.2 million programme. It is the first of its kind in the Asia-Oceania region. It is also the first time the bank has contracted an organisation to deliver a programme. Normally it deals only with governments.

The bank administers the Avian and Human Influenza Facility, a multi-donor trust fund financed mostly by the European Union that supports influenza-related operations in various countries.

Sixty-seven health professionals from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Nepal are currently working towards one of two Massey qualifications specifically developed for the programme – a Master of Veterinary Medicine (Biosecurity) and a Master of Public Health (Biosecurity).

They are in New Zealand this week for a series of study workshops and will be present at the launch at Te Papa in Wellington at 12.15pm. Future teaching will be delivered in Asia and on-line.
