**Cats and lilies a toxic mix**

A Massey University veterinary researcher is warning people that lilies, popular at Easter, can be deadly to cats.

Dr Kathleen Parton, from the Institute of Veterinary, Animal and Biomedical Sciences, had published widely on toxicology in animals.

She says lilies of the _Lilium_ and _Hemerocallis_ genus, which includes the Easter, Christmas and Stargazer lilies, are potentially deadly to cats.

“Cats have a tendency to eat the flowers or leaves of these lilies,” Dr Parton says. “But they’re very poisonous and cats can then develop acute renal failure very quickly.”

Even brushing past a plant is dangerous, as pollen can rub off on the fur, then can be eaten. “Drinking the water the plant is in can also lead to poisoning,” she says.

If an owner suspects their cat has been poisoned, it is important to seek help from a veterinarian immediately.

“The first 18 hours are critical, without treatment the cat will begin to drink a lot of water, indicating kidney failure, and die within a few days,” she says. “Early signs of poisoning include vomiting, not eating and depression, which appear within a few hours of eating the lily.”

Dr Parton says if at all possible, keep lilies away from cats entirely.
