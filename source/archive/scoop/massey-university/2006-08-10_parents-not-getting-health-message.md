Parents not getting health message

An award-winning researcher in communications has found that although children are regularly exposed to positive health messages at school, many may be getting different signals at home about healthy living.

Marketing communications researchers Jacinta Hawkins says public health campaigns may need to use different communication strategies for different communities. She says although there are calls from many quarters to increase the quality and quantity of education in schools and healthy eating and exercise, there is often a gap between school learning and what children are learning at home.

Her research shows that getting the message on healthy eating and exercise through to some parents, is a major hurdle for public health campaigns.
