**Distance learning expertise sought by Australia**

Massey University is a founding member of a new research consortium with four Australian Universities.

The Distance Education Hub includes the University of New England in Armidale, Charles Sturt University, Central Queensland University and the University of Southern Queensland.

With the aim of supporting research into best practices for distance learning, it is backed by the Australian Government's Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Department through a $A3.5 million diversity and structural adjustment fund. It was launched last month at the New England campus, from where it will be hosted and directed.

The hub is governed by a steering committee consisting of partner universities, with Associate Professor Mark Brown representing Massey on the committee. In addition, a reference group made up of leading people in the field will provide external review, feedback and advice.

Dr Brown, the University's Blended and Distance Education director, says the invitation to join the Australian-based research consortium is a reflection of Massey’s reputation in the international distance education community. "Massey brings a wealth of experience to DEHub and, in return, we look forward to participating in a number of collaborative future-focused research projects," he says.

“A new generation of design and delivery technologies are now challenging traditional approaches to distance learning and DEHub allows Massey to learn from the experience of other major providers. Massey can also play an important role through the consortium by contributing to new conceptions of blended and distance education throughout Australasia.”

The funding includes support or an international conference to be held next February. For more information: http://www.dehub.edu.au/
