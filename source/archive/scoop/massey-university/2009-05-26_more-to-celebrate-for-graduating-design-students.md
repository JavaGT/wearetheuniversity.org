More to celebrate for graduating design students

Three Massey students, who graduate this week, have won the top three places in the graphic design category of the Australasian Student Design Awards.

First place in the category went to Sarah Bowie for her book design; second place went to Richard Payne for typeface and video design; and third to Kate Arnott for a system of visual communication design.

A supervisor for two of the graphic design students, Annette O’Sullivan, says it is “a great result for Massey’s Typography programme. Both projects are the result of a lot of research from surrounding subject areas.”

Ms Bowie, 22, who won $1000 worth of art and design supplies, said her win was completely unexpected. “I didn’t think I’d get a look in, let alone be placed first.” Her entry was for the design of a book called Matiu /Somes: The Inhabitants, a history of the Wellington Harbour island.

Gerbrand van Melle, who supervised, Mr Payne's project, said he submitted it because of its difference to other entries. “That’s one of the qualities of these entries – such a variety of work.”

Fellow College of Creative Arts students Morgan Terry and Samantha Harwood were runners-up in the exhibition design section of the awards while another student, Andy Florkowski, was placed third.

All three place-getters graduate from the Michael Fowler Centre on Friday with a degree in Bachelor of Design. More than 600 Massey graduates will have their degrees conferred during separate morning and afternoon ceremonies. For the first time Pasfika graduands are to recognised at a function on Wednesday evening with Maori graduands similarly honoured on Thursday.
