Employers must adapt to older workers’ needs

**Employers must adapt to older workers’ needs**

Employers will need to consider more flexible work schedules and reduced hours to accommodate the needs of an expanding older workforce, according to Massey University researchers.

It’s one of the trends identified by leading researchers from Massey University’s Health and Ageing Research Team, who will present their findings from a health and retirement survey at a seminar on ageing and health in Wellington on Thursday.

Flexible work schedules were rated as important by 60 per cent of older workers, with phased in retirement and reduced work hours also highly rated, says Professor Fiona Alpass, one of the key researchers.

“However, less than half reported that their employers offered these arrangements,” Professor Alpass says. “Flexible work arrangements present a potentially important focus for the future if older workers are to be encouraged to extend their working lives.”

Such arrangements are not only good for older workers, she says, but they can also be very beneficial for employers. “They can lower staff absenteeism and turnover, increase loyalty, and help maintain institutional knowledge”.

Professor Alpass, who is based at the School of Psychology at the Manwatū campus, and Dr Judith Davey, from the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University, will present findings from the 2013 Health, Work and Retirement survey, outlining the potential policy and labour market effects on older workers.

The July 23 seminar will provide national research stakeholders and other interested parties with an overview of how results from the survey may inform social and policy interventions for the health and wellbeing of the older New Zealand population. The latest study comes under the _Enabling Participation by all Older People: Targeting Past and Future Predictors of Ageing Well_ project, funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.

Dr Mary Breheny, from Massey’s School of Public Health, and Dr Sally Keeling, from the University of Otago, will present commentary on the policy implications of new research from life-history interviews of older New Zealanders, with a focus on the effects of early life health and work experiences on wellbeing in later life.
