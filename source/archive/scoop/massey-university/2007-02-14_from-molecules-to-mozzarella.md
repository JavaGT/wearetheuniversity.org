From molecules to mozzarella

Milk proteins, and their roles in complex food systems such as cheeses, are the focus of a symposium underway at the Riddet Centre at the University’s Palmerston North campus.

Milk Proteins II: From Molecules to Mozzarella will consider a range of key topics, including the nutritional attributes of milk proteins and the benefits they offer in food products.

Symposium organiser and Riddet Centre researcher Dr Abby Thompson says the presentations will offer insights and opinion from internationally renowned experts, as well as the latest findings from talented emerging scientists.

Keynote speakers include Professor Patrick Fox, who will deliver live presentations via a video link from the University College in Cork, Ireland. Professor Fox will give an overview on the origins of dairying, the evolution and classification of mammals and the evolution of lactation.

Among presentations from Riddet Centre researchers is a discussion by PhD student Sylvia Chung on the effects of dairy proteins and on satiety, or feeling full after eating.

The symposium is organised by the Riddet Centre, Massey University, and Fonterra. The Riddet Centre is a partnership between Massey and the Universities of Auckland and Otago, with core strengths in nutrition, food functionality and food processing.
