Professor of Fine Arts wins prestigious award

A quest to document the unique qualities of Antarctic light, space and atmospheric phenomena, has seen Professor of Fine Arts Anne Noble granted a United States National Science Foundation artists and writers award.

For Professor Noble, Director of Research for the University’s College of Creative Arts, the award plays a critical role in her completion of a major photographic project, WHITE LANTERN, which has already attracted international critical acclaim and is to be published in book form as well as exhibited widely around the world.

Professor Noble says she is “absolutely delighted” with the award. “There were 90 applicants and only seven awards granted and only one to an applicant from outside the United States.

“It means I will have six weeks in Antarctica in November and December, and all the logistical support necessary to complete WHITE LANTERN in regions as diverse as the Ross Sea region, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, Siple Dome and the South Pole.”

Professor Noble leaves for Antarctica on 31 October. She was first there for two weeks in 2002 as a New Zealand Antarctic Arts Fellow and returned in 2005 with funding from Creative New Zealand to photograph tourist sites on the Antarctic Peninsula.

Already well known in New Zealand and collected by major galleries nationally and internationally, Professor Noble is achieving an international reputation for her Antarctic work. Bill Fox, a world expert on Antarctica, cited her photography as one of the most original representations of Antarctica globally. He published her Antarctic work in his book Terra Antarctica (2004) alongside eminent United States photographers Stuart Klipper and Ty Milford.

Professor Noble’s work exploring the representation of Antarctica features in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia and Te Papa Tongarewa, as well as other national and regional museums. It is regularly sought by curators internationally for inclusion in exhibitions related to art and climate change.

Last year Professor Noble was accorded a major solo exhibition at the Musee du Quai Branly in Paris. Her work Ruby’s Room was sought as the keynote exhibition of a new international photographic biennale instigated by Musee du Quai Branly to coincide with Paris Photo, the largest photographic event in Europe. Audiences for her work in this context were significant, with visitor numbers in excess of 200,000.

The book and exhibition WHITE LANTERN is similarly destined for international audiences. The book will be published in 2010 and exhibitions are planned for New Zealand, Australia, Germany and the United States.
