Mathematics education research in New Zealand took a big step forward with the launch of the Centre for Research in Mathematics Education (CeRME) at the Auckland campus. The launch was part of the Making Waves and Opening Spaces symposium.

Co-directors Professor Glenda Anthony and Professor Margaret Walshaw say the new centre is well-positioned to provide innovative responses to contemporary mathematics education issues nationally and internationally.

“The work of the Centre for Research in Mathematics Education is to build on our strong tradition of collaboration with international and national researchers in ways that enable us to contribute to scholarly debates, both in the research and professional field,” Professor Walshaw says.

Professor Anthony says in the New Zealand context in particular, a focus on equity and cultural responsiveness underwrites their research projects, both in the teaching and learning of mathematics across formal and informal contexts, and in the professional education of teachers.

At the symposium, 50 participants from across New Zealand engaged in discussions led by international mathematics specialists Professor Robyn Jorgensen from the University of Canberra, and Professor Elizabeth Warren from the Australian Catholic University in Brisbane.

Associate Professor Roberta Hunter and Dr Jodie Hunter from the Centre shared their findings from the Developing Mathematical Inquiry Communities project, aimed at making a difference in priority learners within a range of national settings.

The Centre is part of the Institute of Education at Massey University, and brings together specialists in mathematics education to work on a common theme: the place of mathematics education and its transformative potential in New Zealand, the Pacific region and the world.
