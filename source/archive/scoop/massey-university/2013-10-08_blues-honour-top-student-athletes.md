**Blues honour top student-athletes**

World champion rowers and sailors, a New Zealand rugby player and a reigning Olympic champion are up for major awards at the Massey University Blues Awards celebrations to be held Auckland later this month.

The Blues Awards, presented in association with BNZ, are presented to students in recognition of their outstanding achievements in both sport and academic studies. Previous recipients include Hamish Bond, Lisa Carrington, Simon Child and Juliette Haigh.

Sports presenter Hamish McKay will be master of ceremonies at this year’s event, on October 17 at North Harbour Stadium in Albany, and Olympian and Massey student Sarah Cowley will be guest speaker.

Ms Cowley, a Bachelor of Communication student, represented New Zealand in the heptathlon at the London Olympics in 2012 and is now competing in the high jump, as she sets her sights on a gold medal at the next Commonwealth Games. She will share her experiences as a high-performance athlete juggling academic studies.

This year’s nominees for BNZ Albany Sportsman of the Year award include New Zealand men’s hockey player Hugo Inglis, pole vaulter Nicholas Southgate and triple jumper Phillip Wyatt. The nominees for Albany BNZ Sportswoman of the Year include footballer Erin Nayler, triathlete Sophie Corbidge and surf life-saver Laura Quilter.

Nineteen student athletes will be presented with Blues this year in sports ranging from archery and badminton to netball and Paralympic swimming. Awards will also be presented to recipients of Prime Minister’s Scholarships.

Many of those receiving Blues are members of the Massey Academy of Sport, which provides individually tailored athlete support, sport scholarships for academic fees, travel funds for assistance with international competitions, gym memberships and training gear, and practical seminars on the latest developments in the sporting world.

BNZ spokesperson Rob Campbell says the bank is excited to continue its involvement with the awards.

“At BNZ we recognise it is hugely important that we take every opportunity to celebrate excellence in sport and academia and we are very proud to partner again with our friends at Massey University."

Tickets for the event are available to members of the public from masseybluesawards.ac.nz
