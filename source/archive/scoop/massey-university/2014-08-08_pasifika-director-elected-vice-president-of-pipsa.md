**Pasifika director elected vice-president of PIPSA**

Massey University’s Pasifika director Associate Professor Malakai Koloamatangi has been elected vice-president of the Pacific Islands Political Studies Association (PIPSA).

“PIPSA is the only association of its kind for political scientists and associated academics and practitioners working on the Pacific in the world. It is exciting to be part of,” says Dr Koloamatangi.

PIPSA is a leading international academic body devoted to the study of the Pacific Island’s states and territories, their societies, politics and systems of government, and international relations.

It was established in 1987 in Hawai’i at a meeting of Pacific Islands scholars who recognised the need for coordinated research and other activities to develop a greater understanding of the region. Members include academics, aid workers, business people, the clergy, military officers, public servants and politicians.

Dr Koloamatangi was born in Tonga and grew up in Auckland. He holds a Bachelor of Arts, a Master of Arts and a PhD from the University of Auckland.

His research interests include democratisation, democratic theory and practice, international political economy, Pacific politics and economic development and the universality of ideas. He is often called upon to speak about Pacific Island matters in the media.
