First concert appearance for new NZSM appointment

Violinist Martin Riseley, who has just been appointed Head of Strings at the New Zealand School of Music, makes his debut concert performance on August 9.

Dr Riseley will be accompanied by noted Christchurch pianist Deidre Irons for the concert at Victoria University's Kelburn campus in Wellington. On August 12 they will perform a second concert at Christchurch's Music Centre Chapel.

Dr Riseley has been concertmaster of the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra in Canada for the past 15 years. He gave his first solo concert when he was 10 and, after graduating from the Canterbury School of Music, went to New York’s Julliard School in 1989, studied with famed pedagogue Dorothy DeLay and gained a Doctorate of Musical Arts in 1996.

Highlights of his career include involvement in the Mozart Bicentennial celebrations at the Lincoln Centre in New York and a season in 2002-2003 as interim associate concertmaster of Canada's National Arts Centre. A year later he was guest concertmaster of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.

He was a regular performer at the Ottawa Chamber Music Festival, playing with artists such as Andrew Dawes, Amanda Forsyth, Andres Diaz and the St Lawrence String Quartet.

In September he will offer master classes, workshops and a short concert for Auckland schools and a brief concert appearance to coincide with the Massey University Albany campus Open Day on September 12.

The New Zealand School of Music is jointly run by Massey University and Victoria University.
