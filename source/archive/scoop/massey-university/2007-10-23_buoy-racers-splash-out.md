Buoy racers splash out

Industrial design students will put their skills to the test tomorrow as they race inflatable human-powered watercraft around Wellington’s Frank Kitts lagoon.

Events include a race to assemble their craft, a four-lap relay and a “Splash and Dash” speed trial.

Industrial design lecturer Brandon Syme says the event will mix fun and practical learning.

“The students have to integrate aesthetics, ergonomics and mechanics into a working design. But the real test will be to see how well their craft navigate the race course.”

Industrial design is taught at Massey’s School of Design in Wellington. Founded in 1886, the Wellington School of Design is New Zealand’s oldest and most prestigious design school.

  
What: Canvasland Watercraft Challenge 2007 – teams of Massey design students build and race inflatable human-powered watercraft  
When: Wednesday 24 October, from 11am  
Where: Frank Kitts Park lagoon Wellington waterfront
