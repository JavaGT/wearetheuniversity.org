Microbrewery to host craft brewing course

New Zealand’s first residential short course in craft brewing will be held at the Manawatu campus in November.

Dr Peter Aldred and Dr Frank Vriesekoop from the University of Ballarat in Australia will run the course.

Institute of Food, Nutrition and Human Health head Professor Richard Archer says craft brewers have been clamouring for a short course since the University’s microbrewery was opened in April last year.

“The Brewers Guild of New Zealand has been particularly keen that we mount a good short course,” Professor Archer says. “This is it!”

Course participants will learn about brewing raw materials, malting and malts, hops and hop utilisation, brewery engineering, fermentation and sensory evaluation, yeasts and spoilage organisms, hygiene and sanitation. The course includes field trips and a final course dinner.

Ballarat University has been teaching brewing since 1971 and its short course is popular with Australian brewers and maltsters.

“Ballarat and Massey together can offer a hybrid course tailored to New Zealand craft and microbrewers,” Professor Archer says.

The first course will run from November 6-11, starting with an introduction and initial sensory evaluation session. It is limited to the first 16 people registering.

Participants will stay in at the Institute of Sport and Rugby facilities.
