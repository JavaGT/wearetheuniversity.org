Hunt on for Massey Journalists

Wellington's School of Journalism at Massey University is on the hunt for old graduates.

The search is on to find up to 2000 journalists who trained at the school between 1966 and today.

They are wanted for the 40th anniversary celebrations of the school, the oldest surviving journalism training institution in the country.

Organiser Alan Samson says it's expected to be the biggest gathering of journalists the country's yet seen.

\"We're very excited. We've already had a huge response from all over the world. It's going to be a fantastic occasion."

The big celebration is set for Sunday June 4, Queen's Birthday, at Massey University's Wellington campus.

Many of New Zealand's prominent journalists started their careers here – including former broadcaster Judy Bailey, Fair Go's Kevin Milne, Investigate editor Ian Wishart, broadcaster Kerre Woodham, Morning Report's Sean Plunket, senior business reporter Fran O'Sullivan, APN senior manager Rick Neville, Fairfax New Zealand senior manager Don Churchill and TV3 investigative reporter Melanie Reid. Alison McCulloch, part of a Denver Post Pulitzer prize-winning team for its coverage of the Columbine massacre, was also a graduate.

Fulltime courses started in 1966 when it was part of Wellington Polytechnic, although part-time courses actually started a couple of years earlier.

To celebrate, there'll be Sunday dinner at the Great Hall in the old Museum Building on Buckle St. (June 4), complete with an exciting international speaker, who will be announced shortly. Also there'll be a fun debate, and continuous journalism-related movies and documentaries. Participants from different years are encouraged to use the occasion as an excuse for organising their own reunions.

Graduates can find out more at http://j40.massey.ac.nz.
