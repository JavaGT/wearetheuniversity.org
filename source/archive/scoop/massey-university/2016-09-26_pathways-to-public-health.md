Pathways to public health
=========================

**Pathways to public health**

The School of Public Health is hosting its first Public Health Symposium this Friday, - a forum for dialogue, debate and sharing of research and practice to improve public health in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Head of the School of Public Health Professor Roger Hughes says the symposium is an opportunity to showcase the diversity and practical relevance of public health research spearheaded by Massey researchers and their New Zealand collaborators.

“The symposium will attract public health practitioners, researchers, community leaders and staff from relevant Ministries. This is also an opportunity for us to recognise the enormous contribution our community and sector partners make when we team up to investigate solutions for public health problems.

“We have some of the world’s best public health researchers in New Zealand, working on public health solutions for some of the really big challenges of our time, such as obesity, environmental degradation and maternal and child health,” Professor Hughes says.

The theme is _Building Capacity for Public Health Gain_. Speakers include Professor Philippa Gander from the world-class Sleep/Wake Research Centre on sleep as a public health issue, Professor Barbara Burlingame on sustainable food systems, and Associate Professor Marewa Glover on vaper-driven smoking cessation.

Keynote speaker Sir Mason Durie, a driving force in launching Massey’s School of Public Health in 2013 during his career at Massey, will present _Pae Ora: Māori Health Horizons and the Public Health Workforce._ Sir Mason’s lecture will challenge the public health community in New Zealand to make measurable inroads in advancing the health and wellbeing of Māori.

Professor Hughes says it is very appropriate “given Sir Mason’s immense contribution to elevating awareness of Māori health issues in New Zealand.”
