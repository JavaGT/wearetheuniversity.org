Collaborative treatments showcased for nurse educators

A pilot study by Massey University School of Nursing staff and regional public health specialists, investigating how to reduce the high rates of skin infection in children, is being presented at a nurse educators conference in Wellington.

Massey, Whitireia Polytechnic and Capital & Coast District Health Board, in conjunction with Eventuate Ltd, are organising the Australasian Nurse Educators Conference 2013 at Te Papa, Wellington from today till October 11.

The annual conference attracts nurse educators from through Australia and New Zealand who are keen to both present their innovations and research as well as be exposed to current educational practice within the nursing profession. The conference features internationally renowned speakers from the healthcare sector, and a series of presentations from senior educators and more.

One of the topical presentations addresses efforts to reduce the high incidence of skin infections and infestations in children, which are particularly high within the Māori and Pasifika populations. The study was developed collaboratively between Massey’s School of Nursing and Keeping Well Regional Public Health to roll out a regionally developed protocol for the management of skin infections and infestations in children in the Wellington, Hutt and Wairarapa regions.

“Such infections are particularly noticeable in at need populations where there are sub-standard living conditions and overcrowding,” professional clinician Thomas Gorte from the School of Nursing says.

The main objectives of the programme were to develop a training package to facilitate nurses’ ability to accurately assess children and, most importantly, to intervene early to administer therapy such as antibiotics under a standing order or authority from a doctor, he says.

“Whilst we were very mindful it was a nursing course there was also a strong element of having to get the GPs on board too,”

More than 130 registered nurses have completed the pilot programme.

  
An evaluation survey of the registered nurses who attended the short course showed that 96 per cent were pleased with the face-to-face component of the course and more than 80 per cent who had engaged with the online component of the curse had completed it successfully.

Such professional development appeals to both health professionals and health institutions Mr Gorte says, as it was responsive to current health concerns, could be instigated in a timely manner, used a flexible approach to learning and, ultimately, could reduce health care costs through early intervention.

Other presentations at the conference include two from the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology investigating the effect of the Canterbury earthquakes on nursing education in the region and a study assessing the attitudes of Generation Y registered nurses toward the profession, their day-to-day work and career.

The Australasian Nurse Educators Conference 2013 is being held at Te Papa, Wellington, from Wednesday October 9 to Friday October 11.
