Business scams explained to school students

Recent international financial scandals have highlighted the fact that exercising good judgement is often just as important as following professional rules, says Accountancy Professor Paul Dunmore.

Professor Dunmore, a specialist in auditing and corporate governance, will be giving advice in a lecture to year-13 secondary school economics and accountancy pupils visiting the Manawatu campus this week.

Nearly 200 pupils from schools throughout the region will get a taste of university lectures aimed at helping their studies and offering real-life learning.

He and other lecturers will present analysis that is relevant for their NCEA internal assessment and scholarship exam. Students will not only get the benefit of a heads-up to help them with their exam, they will also find out more about the role corporate governance, accountancy and auditing plays in major frauds.

“It’s topical and students need to understand the role of board, shareholders and management, and that being an accountant is not just about doing what the boss wants,” says Professor Dunmore.

He will also analyse the financial statements over recent years of New Zealand company Restaurant Brands. “It’s interesting because I’m sure all of them would have eaten at KFC or Pizza Hut at some stage, and because it’s a real company, not just one created on paper as an example,” he says.

Manawatu Commerce and Economics Teachers' Association secretary Jenny Scott, a teacher at Palmerston North Girls' High School, says the lectures are valuable for in a variety of ways. “We’ve worked closely with the University to pitch it at the right level for the students and to make it relevant to the work they do at school. It’s also good for them to be on campus and to get a taste of student life,” she says.

Other lecturers are Business and Economic Research Ltd economist Ganesh Nana and Massey's Professor Anton Meister and Stuart Birks.
