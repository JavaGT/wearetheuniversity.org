Do milkshakes fill the gap?

A Massey PhD student is looking for participants for her research into the effects of dairy proteins and peptides on satiety. Based in the University’s Riddet Centre in Palmerston North, Ms Sylvia Chung is researching the theory that protein is more filling than either carbohydrate or fat, which may help facilitate weight loss over time. She says protein, and its relationship with satiety, is gaining more interest with the re-emergence of the popular high protein diets.

“Dairy product consumption has been associated with the maintenance of healthy body weight in humans,” Ms Chung says. Her research will investigate the effects of whey protein, naturally present in milk, and a popular dietary protein supplement, on satiety and weight management.

Ms Chung requires 50 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 to drink four different types of milkshake followed by a lunch meal, on four different days, and then answer questions regarding their sense of satiety. The Riddet Centre is a partnership between Massey University and the Universities of Auckland and Otago, with core strengths in nutrition, food functionality and food processing.
