Olympic pair have a mind for gold

**Olympic pair have a mind for gold**

While a gold medal is the immediate priority for Olympians Hamish Bond and Eric Murray when they head to London next month, both are also thinking about life after sport.

Murray, a Massey student and Bond, a graduate, say education is vital to continued success, and Massey University has helped them achieve their academic goals.

The Games will cap a four-year cycle in which the pair has not been beaten but Murray, who is studying a Bachelor of Communication, says they will not be taking anything for granted.

“I guess it adds that little bit of extra pressure but we’re always pushing ourselves, always trying to go as fast as we possibly can and complacency will never slip in because we’re always trying to work as hard as we possibly can so that we do beat everybody in the world – that’s all you can really ask to do.”

Bond, who graduated with a Bachelor of Business Studies this year, says Massey’s flexibility was what attracted him to the University, after starting out at Otago. “I was required to relocate up to Cambridge for rowing, and if I wanted to continue studying I guess I had the option to go to Waikato or study extramurally through Massey, and I chose that option purely for its ease.

“Our training times are not flexible and lecture times are not flexible so that doesn’t work too well so that was my principal reason for going to Massey.”

Murray says juggling sport and study is difficult, but Massey makes it easier to cope, with lecturers who understand that assignments fit around training and competing. “With the exams, to be able to sit them overseas is just fantastic. I think it’s really special for us to be allowed to do it.”

The world champion rowing pair are just two of dozens of Massey University students and alumni competing at the games. You can follow their progress, read insight and commentary from the University’s academic staff, and watch video content at Massey’s dedicated Olympics page:
