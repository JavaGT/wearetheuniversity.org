**Māori Book Award finalists announced**

The shortlist of New Zealand’s top Māori books for 2014 has been announced ahead of this year’s Massey University Ngā Kupu Ora Aotearoa Māori Book Awards.

The 15 books cover a wide variety of topics from a biography of renowned politician Parekura Horomia (_Kia ora Chief!_) to a book on Māori root vegetables (_Rauwaru, The Proverbial Garden)._  
The finalist list is split over six categories and features histories on Māori farming, Māori in Nelson and Marlborough and urban migration. There are three illustrated books on Māori art along with a book documenting the country’s wharenui or meeting houses and two books of poetry.

Massey University Māori language lecturer and judge Dr Darryn Joseph says he was pleased to see that at least one of the three finalists in the Te Reo Māori section, _Ka hoki tāua ki te whare huri ai ē!_  
is completely in Māori, while another finalist has half its articles in te reo.

“This gives weight to the notion of Māori as a living language not just an official one.”

Now in its seventh year, Assistant Vice Chancellor Dr Selwyn Katene says Massey University’s commitment to Ngā Kupu Ora Aotearoa Māori Book Awards is an indication of the importance of Māori literature.

“When you look at the depth of this year’s entries and the important issues they discuss, you can see why we need to nurture Māori writers”, he says.

Another judge, Massey University Library Kaihautū Māori (Māori Services Manager) Sheeanda Field, says it’s vital we encourage Māori authors.

“It’s Māori writing about Māori, in a Māori way and with a Māori voice, that’s really important.”

Winners of the six categories will be announced at a ceremony at Te Papa in Wellington on September 10.
