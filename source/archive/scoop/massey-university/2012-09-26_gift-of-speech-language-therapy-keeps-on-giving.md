Gift of speech language therapy keeps on giving

**Gift of speech language therapy keeps on giving**

When two Massey University speech language therapy students volunteered to help with a community-based intensive group therapy programme, they had no idea they’d become the recipients of a gift from one of the clients on the course.

Before his stroke, North Shore resident Randolph Stockwell was more used to the high-flying world of international banking and US politics. He can happily recount experiences in that life, including his job as personal assistant “carrying Ronald Reagan’s luggage” before Mr Reagan became President of the United States of America.

Mr Stockwell’s life – and his ability to communicate – changed immeasurably after his stroke when he became one of the six people each day that develop aphasia. Aphasia is an impairment that results in the inability to express or understand spoken or written language due to disease or injury to the language area of the brain. Strokes are the most common cause of aphasia, followed closely by head injury.

The intensive group therapy sessions Mr Stockwell attended were held at the Speech and Language Therapy Clinic at the Albany campus. Led by clinical educator Ms Patty Govender, and now in its second year, the intensive group therapy sessions work by bringing together a group of individuals with aphasia for intensive one-on-one sessions with a speech language therapy student, followed by group sessions.

Group members and their families can learn new communication techniques and work on new strategies that will help them communicate with their families and friends again. Working together in a group environment, they share stories and encourage each other to improve.

Mr Stockwell was so impressed by the progress he made at the group therapy sessions, he wanted to show his gratitude to the Speech and Language Therapy team. His kind donation enabled two speech language therapy students to attend the bi-annual Aphasia Conference.

“We were delighted with Mr Stockwell’s generous donation,” says Patty Govender. “It’s always rewarding to watch the progress our clients make with group therapy, and we weren’t expecting this at all. Attending the conference was a highlight for the two students.”

Associate Professor Helen Southwood, Head of the School of Education at Albany and Director of the Speech and Language Therapy Programme, says the donation was very welcome. “Mr Stockwell’s generosity enabled the students to gain further knowledge by attending the Aphasia Conference. We were delighted to be able to assist him with his treatment for aphasia, and we plan to do more group therapy sessions again next year.”

  
The aphasia group therapy programme is one of a number of community-based programmes offered by the Speech Language Therapy Clinic at Massey University’s Albany campus.

The Speech and Language Therapy degree is a four-year course that combines academic coursework with supervised clinical experience and on-site placements. Places are limited, and applications for the 2013 study year open soon.
