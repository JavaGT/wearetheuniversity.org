**Arts and design students exposed**

Massey’s College of Creative Arts launches its annual celebration of New Zealand’s next generation of designers and artists tomorrow, at Exposure 2007.

At the Wellington campus 1000 guests will tour student projects in the fields of fine arts, advertising, digital media, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, fashion design, textile design, illustration, and photography.

Founded in 1886, the Wellington School of Design is New Zealand’s oldest and most prestigious design school.

Massey’s School of Fine Arts was established in 1999 and brought together New Zealand's first photography department—formerly Wellington Polytechnic—with the latest and most innovative Fine Arts programme.
