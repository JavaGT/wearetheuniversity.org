Institute of Education hosts delegation from Thai Government

  
Closer educational ties have been forged between New Zealand and Thailand, with a recent official visit to the Albany campus.

Massey University’s Institute of Education hosted a delegation of senior officials from Thailand’s Office of the Permanent Secretary, Prime Minister’s office, Office of the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education and several government departments at Albany campus on October 29.

Miss Churirat Sangboonnum, Deputy Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Education and Dr. Somphoc Nopprakoon, former Deputy Secretary-General of Office of the Civil Service Commission led a delegation consisting of 41 senior administrators to visit New Zealand from October 29 to November 2.

The group also consisted of representatives from other government departments including Thailand’s Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Energy, Central Institute of Forensic Science, Ministry of Tourism and Sports, Ministry of Energy, and Ministry of Commerce.

The group made their first stop at Massey University’s Albany campus where they were hosted by the College of Humanities and Social Science’s Institute of Education.

Director of the Institute of Education Professor John O’Neill says the visit was a great honour.

“It was a privilege to host an important group of senior officials and educators. It was a great opportunity to share experiences and teaching methodologies. I look forward to further collaboration and to building an ongoing relationship.”

Other presenters included senior adviser Jane Mulryan from the International team, with Professor Claire McLachlan, Associate Professor Mandia Mentis and Associate Professor Roberta Hunter from the Institute of Education.

The visit was part of the senior executive development course of the Ministry of Education and served as knowledge exchange about the development of teaching professionals at Massey University, and the role Massey plays in the promotion of New Zealand's education. Both groups hope to establish networks and further cooperation between Thai and New Zealand educators building on the successful agreements that the Institute already has with several Thai universities.

  
Massey University has strong links to Thailand. In 2002 The King of Thailand His Majesty Bhumibol Adulyadej was presented with an honorary doctorate of Sciences from Massey University. The honorary degree was offered in recognition of the King’s contribution to agriculture and sciences. He is well known for his agricultural initiatives that have benefited the people of Thailand, including co-operative farming, irrigation, re-forestation, watershed development and farmers’ welfare.
