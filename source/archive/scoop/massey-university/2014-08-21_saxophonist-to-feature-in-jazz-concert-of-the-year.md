Saxophonist to feature in Jazz Concert of the Year

Saxophonist to feature in Jazz Concert of the Year

  
Renowned US saxophonist Eric Marienthal is the special guest at Massey University’s Albany Jazz Concert of the Year, which kicks off at 8pm on Sunday August 24.

The line-up includes New Zealand jazz legends Rodger Fox, Frank Gibson, Alberto  
Santarelli, Mark Baynes, and Phil Broadhurst.

“This is going to be an unmissable night of fantastic entertainment,” says Phil  
Broadhurst. As New Zealand School of Music Head of Jazz Studies, Mr Broadhurst is a pianist, composer and educator. “We have such a stellar line-up this year, and tickets always sell out quickly.”

Mr Marienthal started his professional career in 1980, with famed New Orleans trumpeter Al Hurt. Then Chick Corea personally selected him to join the Chick Corea Elektric Band, where they recorded six CDs — two of which were Grammy Award-winners.

As a performer, he has collaborated with top recording artists, including Elton John, Barbra Streisand, Stevie Wonder, Burt Bacharach, BB King, Pattie LaBelle, The Rippingtons and The Gordon Goodwin Big Phat Band. Mr Marienthal has also published instructional music books, gives masterclasses, and is always performing – either on tour or in the studio as a sought-after recording artist.

As well as being one of New Zealand’s leading jazz artists, in 2001 Mr Broadhurst was the first jazz musician to be appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit (MNZM) for services to jazz. In 2013 his eponymous quartet released Flaubert’s Dance on the Rattle label, and it was a finalist in the Tui Awards for Best Jazz Album.
