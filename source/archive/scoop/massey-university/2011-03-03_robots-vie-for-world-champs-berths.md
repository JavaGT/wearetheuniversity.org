**Robots vie for world champs berths**

After almost a year of tinkering, more than 60 teams will pit their robots against each another in Auckland this weekend at the national Vex robotics competition.

Winning teams will be chosen to go to the world championships in Florida, from April 14-16.

Vex robotics involves teams designing, building and maintaining robots that compete in a game called Round Up in which the robots stack rings on goal posts. Points are awarded for “owning” a goal while bonus points are given if the robot can also hang off a central ladder.

The teams have been mentored assisted by engineering students from the School of Engineering and Advanced Technology at Albany.

Senior lecturer in mechatronics, engineering and industrial management Dr Johan Potgieter, the event manager in New Zealand, says the concept began two and a half years ago, with 12 teams competing.

“The numbers have been growing ever since,” Dr Potgieter says. “Pupils learn skills in engineering and robotics and the contact they have with Massey’s students shows them an educational path to becoming an engineer.” He says the charitable trust that runs the competitions is also working to introduce curriculum into schools around the programme.

A regional event was held in Manawatu last month, with two teams qualifying for the world championships. They were _Palmy Tungsten_ of Palmerston North Boys’ High School, consisting of Matthew Sutherland, Dale Saxton, David Wetman, and _Arabeit_ of Wellington Home Educators that comprises James Greenwood-Thessman, Elliott Kortright, Caleb McDonnell and Nathaniel Stewart.

Two New Zealand teams combined to win the world championships last year, and they have also been selected to travel again to the United States.

The final day of competition, on Sunday, will be broadcast live on Stratos TV.
