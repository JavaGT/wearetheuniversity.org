Health by Design: new public lecture series at Massey
=====================================================

**Wednesday, 6 March 2019, 11:52 am**  
**Press Release: [Massey University](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Massey_University)**

In the first of a series of public lectures, entitled Health by Design, Associate Professor Ian Laird will speak about Prevention through Design (PtD) – the integration of hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design and engineering stages so that risks of injury or illness are prevented.

“Designing out hazards is seen as one of the most effective means of preventing occupational injuries, illnesses and fatalities,” Dr Laird says.

“It’s a transdisciplinary process and although this concept is well known, there hasn’t yet been a concerted effort to achieve broad implementation of it, particularly in relation to noise exposure and prevention of noise induced hearing loss.”

Dr Laird says some PtD principles have been successfully applied to noise reduction in the construction and mining industry but have not yet been applied extensively within the agricultural sector. “The research I will discuss utilises PtD principles and applies them to control noise exposures commonly experienced in agriculture.”

His presentation examines two New Zealand-based case studies which highlight how the acoustic assessment methodologies can be used to inform and drive the PtD process.

“The first focuses on an all-terrain vehicle extensively used in farming operations here and internationally. The second case study involves sheep shearing equipment. Noise sources are identified and, in both cases, the PtD process is illustrated to design out the excessive noise,” he says.
