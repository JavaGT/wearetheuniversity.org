Students offered bursary support in economic crisis

New Zealanders hit by the world financial crisis are eligible for 50 new $1000 study bursaries established by the University to enable them to enrol in the second semester and improve their employability by up-skilling.

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey says anyone whose employment has been effected by economic downturn – or is likely to be – may apply when they enrol or immediately if they are a current student, either internal or extramural.

\"We felt it was important to recognise that many people are either having to review their career paths or face uncertainty," Mr Maharey says. "We wanted also to provide an incentive to people to grow their knowledge and their skill set and use, what will inevitably be a temporary downturn in employment prospects, as an opportunity to ensure they are better placed to take advantage when the climate improves."

Applications for the bursaries close on June 15. All applicants must be either New Zealand citizens or permanent residents, enrolling extramurally or internally in full or part-time study and must show a willingness to complete their intended programme of study.

Courses offered for semester two, which begins on July 13, include undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the arts, health sciences, business, biological sport and exercise science and computing.

Applications forms can be obtained from the University website (www.massey.ac.nz) or by phoning the 0800-627-739.
