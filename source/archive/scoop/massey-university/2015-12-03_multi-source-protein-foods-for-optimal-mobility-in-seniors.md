Multi-source protein foods for optimal mobility in seniors

**Multi-source protein foods for optimal mobility in East Asian seniors**

A group of Massey University’s top scientists at the Riddet Institute have been awarded almost a million dollars of research funding to create foods that will keep the elderly active and independent for longer.

The money comes from a total of $7million research investment funding from the High-Value Nutrition National Science Challenge to build the science behind innovative new foods.

The project between Goodman Fielder and the Riddet Institute hosted by Massey University, will explore bringing together unique combinations of proteins to create foods that will naturally stimulate muscle function.

Project leader and rising young scientist Dr Simon Loveday says an ageing population is a global issue, particularly for some of New Zealand’s largest trading partners in East Asia, including China, Japan, Taiwan and Korea. “The number of people over 65 is predicted to more than double between 2015 and 2050. There is a growing demand for foods that support wellness among East Asian seniors, yet few food products address this demand.”

Working alongside Dr Loveday are colleagues Dr Sharon Henare, Distinguished Professor Harjinder Singh, Head of Massey Institute of Food Science and Technology and Co-Director Riddet Institute, and Distinguished Professor Paul Moughan, Co-Director Riddet Institute. The team will work with Goodman Fielder’s Research and Innovation Senior Manager, Dr Shantanu Das.

Dr Loveday says, “Many Asian populations are relatively unfamiliar with dairy foods, which have historically been unaffordable, unavailable, or unappealing due to lactose intolerance. But now these factors are changing. Incomes have risen dramatically in the last 20 years, milk is more widely available in Asia and low-lactose dairy ingredients are common.

“Older East Asians are accustomed to soy-based foods, and consume relatively low amounts of dairy. The unfamiliar flavour of dairy foods and the lack of awareness about their health benefits for seniors are among the key barriers to increasing dairy consumption. We will address these barriers by underpinning the development and marketing of premium high-protein food products that augment soy protein with New Zealand milk proteins to naturally stimulate muscle function in older people.”

This project builds on a long-standing research collaboration between Goodman Fielder and the Riddet Institute that has already created a number of IP protected technologies for developing high-value premium food products.

Professor Harjinder Singh says this is an exciting project that utilises the world-class, unique capability in food structure and digestion developed in the Riddet Institute over several years. “It provides a challenging interface between food protein formulation and delivering specific nutritional and health outcomes for our major export markets in Asia. This is also an excellent example of the role of Riddet CoRE in developing strategic Research and Development partnerships with industry to deliver economic outcomes, and training our bright young scientists to take on leadership roles.”

Pro-Vice Chancellor of Massey’s College of Health, Professor Paul McDonald says Asia has a big and rapidly growing problem with diet-related diseases such as heart attack, stroke, diabetes and cancer. “Therefore nations and consumers will insist on products which prevent disease and enhance health. Dr Loveday and his colleagues will help New Zealand grow food exports by meeting this demand for more nutritious food products in Asia.”

High Value Nutrition is one of eleven National Science Challenges with an $84 million budgeted investment over the next ten years, aimed at establishing New Zealand as an international leader in food-for-health and helping grow exports by $1billion by 2025.

**Dr Simon Loveday BIO:** Dr Loveday is a food scientist with nine years experience in food protein chemistry and functionality research, encompassing food materials science, food microstructure characterisation, reaction kinetic modelling in food systems and protein digestion dynamics. He has published or co-authored 26 journal articles, and worked with industrial clients including Fonterra, Zespri, General Mills USA and BASF Germany.

**Background information on the Riddet Institute:** The Riddet Institute, a Centre of Research Excellence hosted by Massey University, leads the world on protein digestion. Distinguished Professor Paul Moughan’s team has developed methodologies to measure true ileal digestibility, lysine availability and the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) now considered global best practice and endorsed by FAO and WHO. Another world-leading figure at the Riddet Institute is Distinguished Professor Harjinder Singh, whose contribution to dairy science has been recognised with major international awards including the William C. Hanes Award (USA) and the Marschall Rhodia Award (USA) and ADSA International Dairy Foods Award (USA) Professors Moughan and Singh have each published more than 300 peer-reviewed journal articles, and in 2012 they were jointly awarded the Prime Minister’s Science Prize, the most prestigious science honour in New Zealand. They have extensive experience in working with the food industry in New Zealand and globally.

**Project name:** Multi-source protein foods for optimal mobility in East Asian seniors (MultiProMo)  
**Project dates:** January 2016 to January 2019
