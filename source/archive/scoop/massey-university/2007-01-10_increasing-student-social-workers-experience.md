Increasing Student Social Workers’ Experience

A memorandum of understanding signed today between the School of Sociology,

Social Policy and Social Work and the Child, Youth & Family Service (CYFS) will give social work students greater experience before they step into the workforce.

Under the agreement, up to five students in the Bachelor of Social Work and Masters of Social Work programmes will become involved with the service’s lower North Island service centre next year.

Professor Robyn Munford, who coordinates the University’s social work  
programme, says the agreement is a significant event in which both parties will benefit.

She says that as part of the agreement CYFS staff will be invited to attend lectures and workshops from the Massey staff, and there are opportunities for join tresearch ventures.

Students will work with CYFS staff who have had training in supervising students, and who have had a minimum of three years social work experience.

The school will also ensure students have up-to-date theoretical knowledge and skills before they begin their placement.
