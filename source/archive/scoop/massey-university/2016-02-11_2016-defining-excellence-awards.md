**2016 Defining Excellence Awards**

Tickets are now on sale for the 2016 Defining Excellence Awards, which recognise Massey University’s researchers, teachers and graduates that have achieved major successes in their careers, or have made outstanding contributions to their communities.

Director of development and alumni relations, Mitch Murdoch, says Massey has over 130,000 alumni spread across the world. “They are innovative, entrepreneurial and creative. They are achieving great things and are testament to the excellent teaching and research capability of Massey.

“Some of them achieve great things at a very young age, some give selflessly to extremely worthy causes, and others make outstanding contributions in their chosen field of work. We want to celebrate and recognise these high performing New Zealanders.”

The awards will be presented at a black tie gala dinner at the Rendezvous Hotel in Auckland hosted by singer and comedian Jackie Clarke.

The university’s most prestigious award, the Sir Geoffrey Peren Medal, will be presented to alumnus Professor Graham Le Gros, in recognition of his career in medical research.

Alumna Traci Houpapa will be presented the Distinguished Alumni Service Award for her work raising the profile of Māori agribusiness across the primary industry sector.

This year’s Distinguished Young Alumni Award is being presented to entrepreneur JD (John-Daniel) Trask, who graduated with a Bachelor of Information Sciences from Massey in 2004, and helped set up the highly successful Givealittle website.
