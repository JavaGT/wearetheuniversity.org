**Massey study backs findings of Pacific rugby players’ exploitation**

Former Fiji rugby professional and Massey University MBA graduate Koli Sewabu says exploited Pacific rugby players are being denied some of their human and employment rights.

The problem of widespread abuse of Fiji and other Pacific nations’ rugby players – in both union and league - as the result of unethical sports agents, was reported this month in England’s _Daily Telegraph_ newspaper. The claim has been backed up by a Massey University study of Pacific athletes based in other countries.

Research undertaken by Dr Rochelle Stewart-Withers, School People Environment and Planning, Dr Sam Richardson, School of Economics and Finance and Koli Sewabu a Master of Business Administration graduate and ex-professional Fijian rugby player, highlights the same issues.

The Telegraph reported that some players from Fiji - ranging in age from 14 to 17 years old - were signing contracts in France.

Many players, the paper said, were being exploited by international player agents and clubs offering only short-term contracts, and producing substandard paper work and incorrect visas. Players also reported not being paid, or having to wait months for wages and, as a result, were living in substandard conditions.

The Massey study interviewed more than 100 professional and semi-professional Pacific Island athletes based in the UK, France, and Japan.

The study, carried out in 2013, argues for a regulatory framework and accreditation of agents.

“At the moment, there is no regulatory framework that can provide a structure to ensure players’ welfare is well managed and protected. Flaky agents continue scouting of players who can gain them profit rather than looking out for the welfare of players,’’ Mr Sewabu says.

Findings from the study also indicate that there have been instances where agents charge more than the standard commission allowed, in addition to minimal or no insurance for players.

“If we are to protect players’ rights and reduce exploitation we need to consider a holistic approach that addresses well-being of players and their families,” Mr Sewabu says.

This includes financial literacy and education as well as personal and professional development.

They also say that the Islands unions need to set up an efficient database or player management system to track players’ profiles and status.

Proper career pathways need to be established to ensure player wellbeing and protection from exploitation. The study also recommends better player representation and mentoring.

Island rugby players contribute to their nation’s economy in the form of remittances. Money sent “back home” raises the socio-economic status of most families, Mr Sewabu says. A better structure should be implemented to ensure players’ savings are maximised, thus creating a multiplier effect to their families and communities, he says.
