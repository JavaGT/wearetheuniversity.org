Why the 21st century needs more arts grads

Why the 21st century needs more arts grads

Robots will boom; life will be more digitised; reality TV will sink to new lows amid urgent global economic, security, inequality, population and environmental issues.

As the fast changing, complex 21st century unfolds, the need for people educated to think critically, rationally, ethically and with empathy is crucial, say Massey University academics.

Finding ways to convey to a wider audience the value and benefits of studying arts subjects (humanities and social sciences) – and the contribution of graduates to economic and social wellbeing – has long been a challenge in New Zealand, says politics lecturer Professor Richard Shaw.

To fill the void, Massey’s College of Humanities and Social Sciences aims to put some heat into the issue with a public debate this week, jointly organised with the Wellington Chamber of Commerce.

Titled _Arts21: Relevant. Engaged. Contributing_, the symposium brings together thought leaders from education, business and the humanities and social sciences for a lively debate about why we need more people with analytical, creative, cross-cultural and communicative skills for the turbulent times we live in.

“In terms of any national debate about the place of the humanities and social sciences, it’s been very piecemeal, very reactive and fragmented,” says Professor Shaw, who is spearheading the event. “This discussion will be proactive and upbeat.”

“We want people, particularly at this point in history, who can listen – given what’s occurring in the UK and US. These are clear examples of why we need people who are tolerant, who can listen to other points of view and who can construct rational arguments.”

**Arts and sciences both vital**

He emphasises that the event is an opportunity – in a public forum with a wide and diverse group of opinion shapers and stakeholders – to consider “the strong case that the disciplines of the humanities and social sciences have a critical role in fostering economic and social wellbeing”.

And though arts and sciences are often seen as being at loggerheads when it comes to the politics of funding, he says the debate about value should not an either/or scenario. “It’s not a competition – they are complementary. We do need to be able to consider the humanitarian and ethical aspects of science. Also, many of the great issues of our times – the reasons for and consequences of climate change, for example – can only be fully understood by combining knowledge from the arts and the sciences.”

Arts21 promises to be “a constructive conversation”, says Professor Shaw. “We want to talk about the value that critically-minded, rational people can make in economic terms. We would like to catalyse it, to provide a point of focus.”

**BA refreshed to meet 21st century challenges**

Professor Shaw says Massey has anticipated change with its future-proofed and redesigned Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree launched this year. The restructured degree has new core papers on culture, identity and citizenship designed to help prepare graduates for a changing world of work. The degree was refreshed after extensive research and input from employers, businesses and former students.

“Whether you have a BA majoring in linguistics, philosophy, classical studies, or history, psychology, sociology, or politics – to name just a few – you’ll be versed in critical, analytical methods and with a highly-developed sense of empathy, creativity, curiosity and ethics. These may be called ‘soft skills’ but they are essentially lifelong skills applicable to many jobs and roles in life, especially in leadership.”

Nearly 50 per cent of current jobs are at risk of digitisation, and the employees of the future will require creativity and social intelligence, says Professor Shaw.

**Marsden Fund recognition of arts research**

Further positive signs for the contribution of the arts also includes the recent Marsden funding round, which saw five grants awarded to humanities and social sciences, and two to sciences at Massey. “This signals a promising trend in terms of a greater recognition of the relevance of arts research by one of our most prestigious academic funding bodies,” says Distinguished Professor Paul Spoonley, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences.

“For a changing New Zealand in a rapidly changing world, we need to understand how our communities, ideas and people are changing,” he says. “This Marsden funding will help add to our knowledge and our ability to adjust to this change. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences is very committed to generating and providing new knowledge that adds to our understanding of New Zealand and its place in the world.”

Humanities and social sciences scholars received grants for projects on customary land use and prosperity in the Pacific; the dynamics of inter-generational Chinese migrant families in New Zealand; exploring Māori justice concepts through a Western philosophic lens; the implications for democracy of how Kiwis understand issues of inequality; and the impact of World War Two conscription on New Zealand society.

Arts21 will be facilitated by Radio New Zealand Nights’ host Bryan Crump. Panellists are Distinguished Professor Paul Spoonley (Pro Vice-Chancellor, Massey University College of Humanities and Social Sciences), Nicola Legat (founding publisher, Massey University Press), John Milford (chief executive, Wellington Chamber of Commerce) and Hannah August (writer, reviewer and commentator). Massey University Vice-Chancellor Hon Steve Maharey will give a keynote address and the event will conclude with questions, networking and nibbles.

Arts 21: Thursday 17 November 2016, 5pm to 7.30pm at Soundings Theatre, Te Papa, Wellington
