Nursing workforce study wins funding

An international study addressing nursing workforce and health issues has been awarded funding of $233,414 from the Health Research Council of New Zealand.

Associate Professor Annette Huntington and her New Zealand research team have been invited to join a trans-Tasman, longitudinal study of the nursing workforce.

All nurses in New Zealand are being invited to participate.

Dr Huntington says, “For the first time health workforce planners will have access to accurate and up-to-date information about New Zealand nurses’ health, wellbeing and workforce participation.

“As 90 per cent of the nursing workforce is female we will also uncover comprehensive information about New Zealand women's health."

The Nurses’ E-Cohort Study is a collaborative venture between the University of Queensland and the University’s School of Health Sciences. It uses on-line questionnaires and secure databases to collect and store information provided by New Zealand nurses.

Once nurses sign up to participate in this electronic study their patterns of workforce participation, health and wellbeing will be tracked over time. This will provide valuable information to guide policy and planning, which is critical to ensure a robust health workforce at a time of aging population and increasing demand for and complexity of health care.

The Nurses’ E-Cohort Study was launched in March with assistance from the University of Queensland.
