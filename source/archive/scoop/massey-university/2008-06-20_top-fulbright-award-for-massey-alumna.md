Top Fulbright award for Massey Alumna

Massey alumna Fiona Miller has been awarded one of three prestigious Fulbright scholarships for PhD or MBA study. The Platinum Triangle Award, worth $100,000, is for a promising New Zealand graduate student to complete a Masters degree at a United States university.

Ms Miller gained a Bachelor of Applied Science (with Honours) at Massey in 1998 and will use the scholarship to complete a Master of Business Administration at the University of California, Berkeley.

She is one of 10 Massey students, staff and alumni among the 66 Fulbright scholarships awarded today.

Luke Di Somma, who holds a Bachelor of Music (with Honours) from the New Zealand School of Music, has been awarded a General Graduate Award. He will complete a Master of Fine Arts degree in Musical Theatre Writing, specialising in composition of musical theatre and opera, at New York University.

Amanda McRaven from Free Union, Virginia is currently using her US Graduate Award to complete a Master of Philosophy degree in Community Theatre at Massey. She is specialising in the portrayal of myths in a multicultural theatre performance.

A senior lecturer in Sport Management and Coaching at Massey University, Sarah Leberman, has used her Senior Scholar Award to research the roles of women in sports leadership at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in Minneapolis.

Brian McDonnell, a senior lecturer in Media Studies, has been awarded a Visiting Lectureship in New Zealand studies. He will teach a course in New Zealand film and literature at Georgetown this year.

Five Massey University lecturers have been awarded Fulbright Travel Awards, given to academics, artists or professionals to visit the United States so they may present papers, give lectures or collaborate with colleagues. Isabel Castro and Susan Cunningham from the Ecology Group will present a series of seminars on kiwi and conservation in New Zealand in San Diego, California.

Huia Tomlins-Jahnke, an Associate Professor of Maori Education and Graeme Wake, an Adjunct Professor of Industrial mathematics have used their awards to give lectures in the United States. John Psathas, a composer at the New Zealand School of Music, undertook a three-week professional and academic tour of the United States.

The Fulbright programme offers New Zealand students, scholars, artists and professionals the opportunity to study, teach and research in the United States. Scholarships are also given to their American counterparts to study here.
