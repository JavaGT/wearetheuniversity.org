**Star studded line-up for 25th Blues Sports Awards**

Some of the biggest names in sport will receive 2015 Massey University Blues Sports Awards this week – but who will be named Sportsman and Sportswoman of the Year?

The awards, now in their 25th year, are the highest sporting accolade given in the New Zealand tertiary system, and part of a tradition dating back to 1922.

2015 Blues recipients from the Albany campus include Tall Black Mika Vukona, Black Stick Gemma Flynn, paralympian alpine skier Corey Peters and yachting gold medalist Jo Aleh.

Gemma Flynn and Jo Aleh are also nominees for the Massey University Distance Student Sportswoman of the Year, along with:

Abby Young – Football  
Zoe McBride – Rowing  
Mary Fisher – Swimming  
Molly Meech – Yachting

Massey University Distance Student Sportsman of the Year nominees:

Corey Peters – Alpine Ski Racing  
Mika Vukona – Basketball  
Matthew Cameron – BMX  
George Worker – Cricket  
Alistair Bond – Rowing  
James Hunter – Rowing

These awards are for students studying via distance learning. They highlight Massey University’s longstanding reputation for providing the highest level of flexibility, tailored to the life of the high-performing athlete. As a result of this dedication, Massey was the first in New Zealand to be named an athlete-friendly university by High Performance Sport New Zealand.

BNZ Bank has been a principal sponsor of the Blues since 1995. The BNZ Trophy is presented to the top performing Sportsman and Sportswoman from each of Massey’s three campuses in Auckland, Manawatu and Wellington.
