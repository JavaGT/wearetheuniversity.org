PhD graduate develops new hearing device

Research undertaken, as part of Robert Thorne’s doctoral thesis, has led to the development of a prototype of an inexpensive hearing assistance device. “My research has led to a new way to build ultra high quality inexpensive hearing assistance devices for kids, teenagers and older people, as all have different needs,” says Dr Thorne.

Dr Thorne began his doctoral research in 2001, and has been developing the device for the last four years. “It will improve a person’s hearing and quality of life. I found out talking with older people that they were paying $7000 Australian for hearing aides that didn’t work. What I did was reverse the algorithms and built an inexpensive device that you can plug into mobile phones, that give people hard of hearing, a better and less expensive alternative for $200 Australian,” says Dr Thorne.

He travelled to Wellington from Brisbane today to attend a special ceremony to honour Mäori graduands before the main ceremony tomorrow where he will be conferred with a Doctor of Philosophy in Health Science.

“The major work is now in the public domain, so everyone can access the research and the applications. The hearing assistance device is something I would like to complete but with the recession funding is zero.”

Dr Thorne (Ngä Puhi, Ngäti Kahu) is the principal consultant for a Brisbane-based noise measurement company. He has lived in Australia since 1985 and has been working in the area of public health and environmental management for 30 years. He was involved in the development of noise management legislation in Queensland that is being adopted throughout Australia.

He says to put it simply the Australian legislation states that you are entitled to be free from noise in your home, noise is not allowed to disturb your sleep or your relaxation inside your home. “There is immediate redress and those responsible have to reduce the sound. New Zealand doesn’t have anything like that, it’s what keeps us in business.”

Dr Thorne (60) has given evidence at hearings discussing the Makara wind farm based on his doctoral research. He will also be involved in upcoming hearings at the Turitea wind farm that will affect Massey’s Manawatu campus.
