=============================

**Northland visit to discuss synergies and educational needs**

Vice-Chancellor Steve Maharey will spend three days visiting Tai Tokerau (Northland) educators, politicians, business leaders and iwi to hear how the University can support the region educationally and through research.

Mr Maharey says it has been a priority to meet people from the region face to face and talk with them about the role Massey can play in their plans for the future. “Our Albany campus makes us the nearest University to Northland. We want to find out from the local people how we can better meet their needs and also let them know what we have to offer.”

With Mr Maharey will be three members of his senior leadership team: Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mäori and Pasifika) Professor Mason Durie, Assistant Vice-Chancellor (External Relations) Sue Foley and Albany campus Regional Chief Executive Professor John Raine.

Professor Durie says the main aim is to listen to needs of the people in the Tai Tokerau (Northland) region. \"We want to find out about the research and education plans the region has and see how we can align our programmes and research to support these."

The visit begins on Monday at NorthTec in Whängarei, where Professor Durie will deliver a presentation on health horizons.

On Tuesday they will meet Te Rünanga o Ngä Puhi Nui Tonu in Kaikohe followed by meetings with iwi and business people in Whängarei. On Wednesday the visit will conclude with a meeting with Whängarei District Mayor Stan Semenoff.
