Creative campus on show at open day

A creative lampshade-making contest, free music, and a chance to ride a Segway scooter were popular options for hundreds of prospective students at today's Wellington campus open day.

Future students from as far afield as Stewart Island and Cape Reinga packed the campus from 8.30am. Most were intent on collecting information for study next year, as well as checking out facilities and accommodation options.

Presentations from various colleges and staff were popular throughout the day, and The Thomas Oliver Band provided entertainment at lunchtime, with many of the 1500 visitors stopping for a free meal and a chat in the sun.

Student liaison adviser Marjon Williams says open day is always busy and an important tool in making decisions for students.

“It really helps to see the buildings and get a feel for the campus in person,” she says.

The Palmerston North campus open days on 6 to 9 August, and Auckland's last Saturday were also well attended.
