**Māori music and creative media scholarship launched**

Massey University’s School of Music and Creative Media Production has announced a new Māori scholarship for study in 2019.

The scholarship, for study starting in Semester 1, is open to prospective students who identify as being of Māori heritage and show evidence of leadership and creative potential in the disciplines of animation, visual effects, film and television, web and interactive, games, music practice, music industry and music technology.

Worth $10,000, the scholarship is for applicants who intend to enrol in full-time study for a Bachelor of Creative Media Production or a Bachelor of Commercial Music degree offered by Toi Rauwhārangi – College of Creative Arts. The scholarship can be spread across all three years of the degree for those that don’t qualify for fees free, or applied over two years.

All Bachelor of Commercial Music applicants must attend an audition (music practice) or consultation (music industry, music technology), which provides an opportunity to demonstrate their creative potential and commitment. The pre-enrolment audition or consultation is part of the entry procedure for the Bachelor of Commercial Music.

Senior lecturer and kaihautū Māori, Warren Maxwell says “building cultural diversity and acknowledging creative leadership within our programmes will inevitably create ripples of whanaungatanga (connections) into many facets of the wider community. Tertiary study is all about the pursuit of knowledge ( Te Pae o Angitu) and giving back to the community through those endeavours; this is a very Māori concept at its core. It is a great opportunity to be able to offer this scholarship to Māori students who understand and exemplify these values. Kia mahara tonu ngā angitu o Tāne! Remember the success of Tāne!”
