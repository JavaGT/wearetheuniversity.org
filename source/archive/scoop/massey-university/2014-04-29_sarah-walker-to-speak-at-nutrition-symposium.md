============================================

Sarah Walker to speak at nutrition symposium

  
Olympic BMX silver medallist Sarah Walker will share insights into her success at a nutrition symposium being held at Massey University’s Albany campus  
this Saturday.

Ms Walker, who won a silver medal in 2012 in London, and won the BMX women’s world championship in the elite and elite cruiser events in 2009, will answer questions about her drive to succeed and the hard work that goes into performing at an elite sporting level.

Speakers at the one-day symposium will present evidence-based research on the dietary requirements athletes need to support physical activity and elite performance in competitive sport.

Topics also include special group nutrition among groups ranging from female athletes to the military and the link between vitamin D and muscle function.

Senior lecturer in human nutrition Dr Pamela Von Hurst says the research presented at the symposium will be of interest to people throughout the sport nutrition sector, from sports physicians and personal trainers to secondary school physical education teachers and sport scientists..

“We’re delighted to host a number of international speakers, including Dr Greg Cox from the Australian Institute of Sport and Dr Helen O’Connor from the University of Sydney. Closer to home, Jeni Pearce is one of New Zealand’s leading sports dietitians and, as the lead performance nutritionist for High  
Performance Sport New Zealand, she has helped young athletes across a wide range of sports.”

It isn’t just the sporting arena that will be covered either. Major Nicola Martin from the New Zealand Army will provide an overview on the complex nature of feeding the military, and the approaches the Army Health Services use to enhance and protect the health of New Zealand soldiers.
