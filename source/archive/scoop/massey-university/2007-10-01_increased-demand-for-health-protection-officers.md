### Lahars and floods increase demand for health protection officers

Lahars and new risks from climate change are accelerating demand for health science professionals, says an environmental health expert.

When Ruapehu blows its top or Northland gets flooded, environmental health officers are there to protect people from environmental hazards.

Climate change exposes people to hazards such as extreme weather events, says environmental health lecturer Dr Beatrice Dias-Wanigasekera.

A new risk is the possibility of vector-borne diseases becoming established in New Zealand, such as malaria or dengue fever carried by mosquitoes. Establishment of new and emerging pathogens, new epidemics, and recurrence of past epidemics are other hazards due to climate change.

With more floods, droughts and other health hazards, demand is so high for environmental health graduates that most land jobs while in their final year of study.

In response, the University's Institute for Food, Nutrition and Human Health has launched a new programme in human health and the environment on its Wellington campus. Study can be in a mixed mode, with a combination of extramural and internally taught papers.

Dr Dias-Wanigasekera says every day is different for Environmental Health and Health Protection Officers. The role is challenging, people oriented and focused on promoting human health and well being.

"These officers face a huge range of challenges from managing natural hazards, assessing drinking water and food quality and safety, dealing with chemical spills, and harmful microbes.

"People have increasing expectations of their environment being safe, whether the issue is lahars, toxic chemicals, unsafe food, or excessive noise," she says.

Laws such as the Resource Management Act, the Building Act, the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act, and the Food Act are evidence that the community demands protection from hazards.

"A Health Protection Officer's job is to keep us safe from harmful environmental effects."

Massey also offers a Graduate Diploma in Environmental Health, aimed at people already in the workforce.
