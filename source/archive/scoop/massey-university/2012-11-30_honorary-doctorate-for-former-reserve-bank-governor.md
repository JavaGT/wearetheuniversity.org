**Honorary doctorate for former Reserve Bank Governor**

Former Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard was awarded an honorary doctorate from Massey University at a graduation ceremony today.

Dr Bollard, from Wellington, is a former Treasury secretary, Commerce Commission chairman and Institute of Economic Research director. He stepped down as bank governor in September after a decade in the role, and from January will head the secretariat of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, based in Singapore.

He was awarded a Doctor of Commerce (honoris causa) in recognition of his outstanding service to the nation in the field of economic policy. New Zealand Post chairman and former deputy Prime Minister Sir Michael Cullen introduced Dr Bollard at the afternoon graduation ceremony.

“I’m really pleased, honoured to receive this award, and I appreciate it very much coming from Massey,” Dr Bollard said.

The head of Massey University's College of Business, Professor Ted Zorn, said the University's recognition of Dr Bollard is well deserved.

"New Zealand's banking system and economy have come through the Global Financial Crisis in better shape than most of the developed world, and that is due in no small part to Dr Bollard's decisive actions as Governor of the Reserve Bank," Professor Zorn said.

"In his new role at APEC, he will no doubt continue to make a significant contribution to the sustainable economic growth of our region, and his association with Massey will be a source of pride for everyone within the College of Business."
