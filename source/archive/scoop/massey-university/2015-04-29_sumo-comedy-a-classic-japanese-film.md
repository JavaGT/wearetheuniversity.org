Sumo comedy a classic Japanese film
===================================

**Sumo comedy a classic Japanese film**

The May 4 screening of Japanese films at Massey University’s Auckland campus should prove a welcome respite from the cooling autumn nights.

The free films are brought to New Zealand with the kind permission of The Japan Foundation and the Consulate-General of Japan, and are shown in Japanese with English subtitles.

Directed by Masayuki Suo, Japanese comedy “_Sumo Do, Sumo Don’t_” is a classic from 1992 – dubbed “A giant comedy with giant pants” — the story focuses on the attempts by student Shuhei (played by Masahiro Motoki from the Academy Award-winning film Departures) to pass his university grades. Blackmailed by his professor into joining the sumo wrestling team in order to pass his grades, Shuhei begrudgingly accepts, knowing it’s the only way for him to graduate.

The sumo team only has one other member – the rather pathetic Aoki who hasn’t won a single bout in four years. Together they draft a motley bunch of wrestlers, including a sad-sack named Tanaka, Shuhei’s brother Haruo who has been wrestling in drag, and a foreigner named Smiley who refuses to wrestle without his underpants.

**JUNE SCREENING**

The next film screening will be held on June 8, after the Queen’s Birthday holiday. _Always – Sunset on Third Street 3_, is based on the long-running manga _Sanchōme no Yūhi_ by Ryohei Saigan, and directed by Takashi Yamazaki.

It is set in 1964, the year Tokyo prepared to host the Olympics. Buildings and highways are being constructed at a feverish pace, and excitement fills the air. Amidst all the change and commotion, the people of Third Street carry on with their lives, as colourful and vibrant as ever.

Novelist Ryunosuke Chagawa has married Hiromi and the two now share a happy life with Junnosuke, the young boy he had taken in who is now in high school. Chagawa’s candy shop has been renovated to include a small restaurant, which Hiromi runs. Hiromi is also pregnant and the family prepares to welcome a new addition to their household. One day, Hiromi discovers a telegram that Chagawa had hidden. Who sent this telegram? What is the surprising identity of this new rival writer? Will Mutsuko’s affections be returned? And what future awaits the people of Third Street?

Preceeding the main feature is a short 15-minute documentary on life and culture in Japan, which starts at 6.15 pm. The films are screened in the Atrium Round Room, on the ground floor of the Atrium Building on the main campus, and bookings are not required. Parking is free and available on campus. Please feel free to bring your own snacks.
