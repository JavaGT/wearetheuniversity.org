Anti-VSM Petition Collects over 3,000 Signatures
================================================

**Anti-VSM Petition Collects more than 3,000 Signatures**  
  
The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) has collected more than three thousand petition signatures from Dunedin students against Sir Roger Douglas’ Education (Freedom of Association) Amendment Bill.

The Bill, which would radically change the membership structure of Students’ Associations away from a universal/opt-out system to an Australian-style voluntary/opt-in system, has come under fire from students across the country for its endangerment of student services.

“Most of our services would wither or disappear altogether if Douglas’ Bill becomes law,” says Dan Stride, a member of this year’s OUSA Executive who organised the petition.  
“Also, Otago students decided back in 1999 that they wanted a universal system of membership. The Government should respect our democratic choice.”

Stride is delighted at the support his petition has received. The 3206 signatures represent almost 16% of all students enrolled at the University of Otago, and more than 18% of all students studying at the University’s Dunedin campus.

Copies of the petition have been sent to Prime Minister John Key, Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce, Chairman of the Education and Science Select Committee Allan Peachey, and Opposition Leader Phil Goff.

With submissions closing on the 31st March, the Education and Science Select Committee is due to report back on the Bill on 28th May.
