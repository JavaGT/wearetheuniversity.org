Public Out In The Cold Over Fee Freeze
======================================

**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

University of Otago students are protesting moves to exclude the public from the University Council’s fee stabilisation decision.

“The University has played fast and loose with the laws on exclusion of the public all year and cannot continue to exclude the public whenever they face an unpopular decision,” said Ayesha Verrall, President of the Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA).

“There is a clear public interest in this decision given the major implications for students, the economy and the community if fees increase,” said Ms Verrall

“People who feel threatened by public opinion should not be placed on University Councils in the first place – they are governing the University on behalf of the public and must be accountable to the public,” said Ms Verrall.

OUSA has consistently challenged the Council’s interpretation of the Official Information Act and its habitual exclusion of the media and other interested parties.”
