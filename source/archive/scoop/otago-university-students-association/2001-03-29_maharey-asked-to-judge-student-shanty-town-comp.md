Maharey Asked To Judge Student Shanty Town Comp

Maharey Asked To Judge Student Shanty Town Competition

The Otago University Students’ Association is running a student shanty town competition on Saturday 31 March to highlight the poverty caused by the removal of the Emergency Unemployment Benefit (EUB) three years ago.

When the National government removed the EUB Steve Maharey called it a “mean spirited attack on students”, but since becoming the Miniter of Tertiary Education he has not reinstated the EUB. Otago students hope he will include it in the upcoming budget so students can avoid another summer of poverty.

“We hope that the shanty town will provide a visual reminder of the poverty experienced by students who unlike other unemployed people are not entitled to a basic income,” said Ms Verrall.

“The shanty town may also remind Mr Maharey that he supported the reinstatement of the EUB while in opposition”.

“We are hopeful Mr Maharey will accept our invitation, especially after he turned down our invitation to live like unemployed students for a week and go without his income.”

“About 75% of students are effected by this policy and the up coming budget is a chance to change this”, said OUSA President Ayesha Verrall.
