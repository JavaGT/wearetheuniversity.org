Otago University and its Students Friends Again
===============================================

**Otago University and its Students Friends Again**  
  
The Otago University Students Association Executive has resolved to withdraw the Appeal of the High Court Judicial Review of the University’s Code of Conduct at an Executive meeting on Tuesday night. The Notice of Abandonment was filed yesterday.

OUSA President Harriet Geoghegan said that the decision was made after the Executive considered the costs of the appeal – both financial and in terms of relations with the University.

“The ongoing disagreement between the University and the Students’ Association has been a real cause of tension and has severely impacted our ability to make progress on issues that affect both the University _and_ the Students. With the proposed changes to the Tertiary Education Sector we need to work together now more than ever.”

The Students’ Association challenged the legality of the University’s Code of Student Conduct in 2009. Justice Gendall ruled that the code could legally cover off-campus conduct which impacted on the University's standing and reputation.

Geoghegan said that while technically the Association ‘lost’ the Judicial Review, it was very important to clarify where and how the Code applied, so students knew what conduct was covered and what legal consequences they would face. Furthermore, the Association questioned the legality of the University excluding students from Appeals Board hearings on Code of conduct cases

“The crucial outcome we are looking for is that students are welcomed back to sit on the Appeals Board so students are fairly represented. We are working with the University to settle this without having to go through the court system.”  
The appeal was lodged at the end of 2009 by the 2009 Executive in order to keep the window open to later make the decision on whether or not to proceed.
