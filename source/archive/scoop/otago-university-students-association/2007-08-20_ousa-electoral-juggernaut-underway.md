FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

  
OUSA Electoral Juggernaut Underway

Polls opened this morning for in this year’s Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) elections. Otago students have until 4pm on Thursday 23 August to cast their votes online at www.elections.ousa.org.nz.

OUSA pioneered online voting five years ago. “Voting online is great,” says OUSA President Renee Heal. “It’s exactly what students want: it allows us to vote at anytime of the day, from our flats, a University computer, the University of Otago Wellington or the University of Lyon when on exchange. Voter turnout has been consistently higher since voting went online.”

This year’s elections are well-contested with 37 candidates vying for 16 seats on the student executive. Six candidates are battling it out for the full-time position of president. “Watching them brings back fond memories of my time on the campaign trail this time last year,” says Heal, who is not seeking re-election. “I wish all candidates the best of luck. Next year’s president has a tough battle keeping student issues on the general election agenda,” she continues.

The main Otago campus is awash with campaign material as candidates try to woo student voters. “Candidates will continue campaigning right throughout the polling period, as they are allowed to under the rules” says Heal. A key part of their campaign is a live presidential debate on OUSA-sponsored debate tonight at 10pm on Scarfie TV on Dunedin’s Channel 9.

Those elected on 23 August take office on 1 January 2008.
