PPL “Priority” But No Action
============================

**Thursday, 24 May 2001, 4:44 pm**  
**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) is disappointed with the complete neglect of money put aside for Paid Parental Leave in the budget, which was announced today.

“It is disappointing to see that this Government, which has promised so much, has in reality, delivered nothing within this budget for Paid Parental Leave.” said Katie Grace, OUSA Women’s Rights Officer.

The Government announced that Paid Parental Leave was a “priority”, but that issues still needed to be discussed before any action could be taken on the issue.

Ms Grace sees this as proof, “that having a female Prime Minister does very little to improve the position of women in New Zealand.”

“Paid Parental Leave can not be ignored as previous governments have tried to, it seems clear that the fight for Paid Parental Leave will have to continue until the present Government follows through with it’s promises.” concluded Ms. Grace.
