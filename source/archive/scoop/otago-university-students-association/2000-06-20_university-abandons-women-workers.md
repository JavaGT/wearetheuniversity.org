University abandons women workers
=================================

The University of Otago Women's Group is angry that the University Council has decided to contract out their remaining in-house cleaners.

"The University has proved itself once again, to care more for profit than for quality service. Their attitude towards good workers with long track records is appalling and that a large proportion of the workers are female." said Claire Barton, spokesperson for the Group.

"The University has bought into the traditional discrimination of work considered female dominated. Contracting out workers will mean that they lose money in an already low paid job." said Ms Barton

"The University's main reason for contracting out is to create a larger profit. This ignores the fact that the workers shall now have to work at inconvenient times, such as late at night, creating a safety hazard for them." said Katie Grace, spokesperson for the Group.

"The cleaners fear the loss of jobs to save money and the possibility of worse working conditions." said Ms Grace

The WRC wants the University Council to reconsider their decision but they refuse to do so the WRC urges the University to ensure that despite the change, that no jobs are lost and the cleaners are able to retain the way in which they work.
