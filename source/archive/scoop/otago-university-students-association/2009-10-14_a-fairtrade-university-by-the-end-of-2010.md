FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

A FairTrade University by the end of 2010

The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) launches its Fairtrade My University campaign at this Thursday’s OUSA Market Day.

“We are putting our stick into the ground” says organiser, OUSA Executive member John Philipson, “and saying that by the end of next year, this will be New Zealand’s first official Fair Trade University.”

Otago University would then join over 70 United Kingdom Universities in committing to fair trading practices in the consumption of commodities.

OUSA’s launch consists of free hot chocolate and chocolate giveaways, information, and gathering of interest for a pressure group.

“The steps toward becoming a fair-trade university are not hard. All the University needs to do is commit to offering fair trade options in meetings, in staff rooms, and in all cafes, and to publicise this commitment.”

Philipson notes a Fairtrade University of Otago would be in good company. The University of Edinburgh, Queens University, and the London School of Economics and Political Science were among the earliest converts to Fair Trade practices.

“OUSA was directed by its members to adopt fair-trade practices (by Student General Meeting resolution) and we want to encourage the University to follow suit.”

The Fairtrade my University launch takes place from 10am to 2pm this Thursday (15 October) on the Union Lawn.
