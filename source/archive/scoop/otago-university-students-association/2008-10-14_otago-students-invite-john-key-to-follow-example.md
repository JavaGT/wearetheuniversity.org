Otago Students Invite John Key to Follow Example

Otago Students Invite John Key to Follow in the Footsteps of Helen Clark

The Otago University Students Association (OUSA) is joining calls for the National Party to reveal their policy on student allowances.

Mr Key will be visiting Dunedin on Thursday and OUSA is inviting him to follow Helen Clark’s highly successful visit to Otago University with an announcement of his own.

“Over 1000 students gathered to hear the Prime Minister on Monday and they really liked what she had to say. I’m sure students would be thrilled to hear National’s plans for students allowances” said Otago University Students Association President Simon Wilson.

With the election just 25 days away and students across the country preparing for exams there is concern that any delayed announcement from the National Party will be missed by the majority of students.
