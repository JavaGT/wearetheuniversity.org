Student Earnings Take a $700,000 Hit

_For immediate release_

**Student Earnings Take a $700,000 Hit**

Students in Otago struggled to find work during 2013 and that’s resulted in a $700,000 drop in earnings for the region’s students throughout the year. Figures released by the free student recruitment and placement service - Student Job Search – show that numbers were down in all key areas. 

“Seeing such a big drop from 2012 to 2013 is disheartening for students, especially with the cuts to student support.” Says Ruby Sycamore-Smith, 2014 OUSA President. “Students want to work, and if the jobs aren’t there then it‘s going to make for another tough year.”

The figures show students earned $7,353,136 in 2013 down nine percent from $8,051,814 in 2012. Students placed in work and the weeks worked also took four and five percent reductions respectively, while the average earned per placement also decreased four percent from $1,848 to $1,766.

“The Dunedin North electorate has the third highest rate of part-time employment in New Zealand, and at the back bone of this are students.” Says Sycamore-Smith, “We’ll continue to promote the Student Job Search service in 2014, now let’s hope the economy picks up.”

Student Job Search is a free service for students and for businesses or individuals to list jobs from one offs to full time. More information can be found at www.sjs.co.nz
