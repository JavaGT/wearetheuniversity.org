OUSA Supports Student Actions
=============================

**Monday, 17 June 2002, 3:00 pm**  
**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

Otago University Students' Association (OUSA) today announced its support for secondary students actions for teacher pay increases.

"It is wonderful to see secondary students taking actions to support their teachers, whether it be direct action or emotional support" said Katie Grace, Education and Welfare Vice-President.

Secondary students last week timed walk outs of their classes, and have been supportive of their teachers actions.

"While we can understand that this is disruptive, it shows that secondary students understand the issues and want to be as supportive of their teachers as possible" Ms Grace said, in response to NZTA calls of the walk outs being 'anarchy'.

"But we do agree that the government must react, and work towards a solution that is acceptable for PPTA members"

"We are willing to support these students in their actions, and help them if possible, it is a great chance for secondary students to tell the government what they want." Ms Grace concluded.
