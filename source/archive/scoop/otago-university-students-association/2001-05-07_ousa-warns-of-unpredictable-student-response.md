OUSA Warns of Unpredictable Student Response

  
The Otago University Students’ Association fears student responses to tuition fee increases could resemble those of the 1990’s.

“Students are under the impression that a decade of escalating tuition costs is over. If the University is seriously contemplating fee increases then students will undoubtedly be angry,” said OUSA President Ayesha Verrall.

“Tuition fees are already incredibly high and continuous increases are unsustainable. The University must cease looking to students every year for additional income.”

“A University that has completed such ostentatious capital works projects will struggle convince the community that it is too poor to maintain current fee levels even with Government compensation,” argued Ms Verrall.

Otago medical students have also received support from the New Zealand Medical Association on the basis that high medical student fees have adversely affected the medical workforce.

“Council should remember it has obligations other than maintaining a balance sheet, and these must be considered carefully.”
