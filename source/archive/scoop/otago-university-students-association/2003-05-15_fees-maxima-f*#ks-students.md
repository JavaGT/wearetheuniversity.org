Fees Maxima F\*#ks Students

The Labour Government has just reneged on all its promises to New Zealand Students.

The Labour government has announced the Fee Maxima Levels for 2003-2006. The levels set break all the election promise of making Tertiary Education more affordable.

“The Labour government has done nothing but force tertiary institutions back into the 1990s, where institutions increased student fees to compensate for lack of government funding, and students reacted by occupying registries and taking to the streets,” said Nick Lanham, Otago University Students Association President.

“The Labour Government has wiped their hands of the responsibility of Fees setting-placing this back in the hands of individual institutions.” Campaign Co-ordinator Catherine May said today.

“We just got screwed” Campaign Co-ordinator Phil Baskerville added.

With the new levels, Otago University students could see fees increase by up to 42 percent.

“Students will suffer and Dunedin’s economy will suffer, simple as that,” said Mr Lanham.
