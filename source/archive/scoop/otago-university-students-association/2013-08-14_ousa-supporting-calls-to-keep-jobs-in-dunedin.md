**OUSA Supporting Calls to Keep Jobs in Dunedin**

The Otago University Students’ Association is today supporting the moves by the local council and the wider Dunedin people to fight to keep Invermay in Dunedin and promote the need for more support for job creation in Dunedin.

“We’re passionate about keeping and creating jobs in Dunedin.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “For students Dunedin doesn’t need to be a part time home, there should be more incentives and opportunities to stay and make Dunedin home.“

“Invermay is a significant part of the local knowledge economy providing a place for students to study and work with top researchers in their industry.” Said Mr. Hernandez, “With 60 joint research projects in the last five years it’s clear that there’s significant knowledge transfer between the blue skies university and the applied sciences institute that is Invermay.”

“This is just another chunk chipped away Dunedin’s knowledge economy.” Said Mr. Hernandez.
