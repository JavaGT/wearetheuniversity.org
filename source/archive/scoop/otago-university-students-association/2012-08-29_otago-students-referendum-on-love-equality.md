**Otago Students’ Referendum on Love Equality**

The Otago University Students’ Association has announced its referendum and 2013 Executive election period for this September. And if the current Executive led by outgoing President, Logan Edgar, have anything to do with it students of Otago University will be able to have their say on the same sex marriage bill currently in parliament.

“The Executive will be asking the students for their opinion on the same sex marriage bill by asking whether the OUSA should or should not support a change in the law in our September referendum,” said Logan Edgar, OUSA 2012 President, “We have a long standing commitment to love being equal, so we want to know if students agree that also means marriage equality.”

The Queer Support Coordinator works through the OUSA Student Support Centre to support diverse queer and questioning students at Otago University.

“OUSA provides a queer support service as part of it’s role in student support and after being asked by one of our clubs, the Executive voted unanimously to ask the students what they thought on the bill,” said Edgar, “Oh yeah we’re also holding an election.”

The elections for the 2013 Executive positions will start with the nomination period from 17th - 20th September. The election period itself will run from 9am on the 24th until 4pm on the 27th of September. The referendum will run alongside the election and will seek to answer a number of questions put forward by the Executive and any students or OUSA affiliated groups that wish to submit a question for consideration.

“I really do encourage any student who wants to get some hands on experience in the real world while helping make sure Otago stays epic, to step up and getthemselves nominated,” said Edgar, “It’s a great way to meet and represent a huge range of students and I had a hell of a lot of fun over the last year and a half. I came to Otago for a degree but true to the Otago experience and my time with OUSA has made me life ready.”
