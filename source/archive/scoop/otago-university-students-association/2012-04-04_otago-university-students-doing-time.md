Otago University Students Doing Time

**For Immediate Release**

  
**Otago University Students Doing Time**

The Otago University Students’ Association is spearheading a move to get students giving back to the Dunedin community during a weeklong volunteering effort from the 16th-22nd of April.

“At OUSA’s core is providing the ultimate student experience.” Says OUSA welfare officer, Francisco Hernandez. “Students’ want to help out, and we’re providing a way for them to give back and show how much Dunedin means to us.”

“It’s not just a way to help the city we call home while were studying, but it’s a great way to meet new people, add something to your CV and step out of the student zone for a little while.” Says Shonelle Eastwood, OUSA Student Support Advocate.

OUSA is also running a food bank collection at the OUSA Market Day on the 19th of April. The aim is for those who don’t have the time to volunteer but have a spare can of baked beans or even a wee jar of Marmite, and want to do a little bit of good.

“It’s a bit of fun because we’re taking on the Vice Chancellor and her crew in the Staff versus Students food bank drive.” Says Hernandez. “But it’s all for a good cause, and not just for students as the food collected will go toward the Dunedin City Combined food bank.”

OUSA, thanks to Scarfie Card creator, Aaron Thomson is currently in talks with volunteer Otago, the SPCA and other organisations on a range of tasks including eco fencing on the Peninsula.

OUSA is calling for Dunedin organisations that need a bit of help for an hour or a day to get in touch about how their volunteers can help.
