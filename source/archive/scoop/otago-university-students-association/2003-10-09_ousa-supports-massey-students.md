OUSA supports Massey students

The Otago University Students’ Association has come out in support of the Massey University Students’ Association, after Massey students occupied their University’s registry in protest at fee increases for next year.

“This action, and the one carried out by Victoria Students recently, illustrate the depth of anger felt by students over these unnecessary fee increases, and our fee setting is coming up soon… “ Said Mr. Nick Lanham, OUSA President.

“Calling for an end to unfair fee increases for tertiary students, is simply demanding an end to using fees to strip mine New Zealand’s young people, and to halt the rationing of access to education by wealth, good on ya’ MUSA!” said Catherine May, OUSA Campaigns Coordinator.

Approximately 10 students were arrested at the occupation protesting fee increases of 3.5% for next year, including Fleur Fitzimmons, New Zealand University Students’ Association Co-President, and Andrea Grant, MUSA President.

The Otago University Council will be holding its fee-setting meeting on Nov 11th.
