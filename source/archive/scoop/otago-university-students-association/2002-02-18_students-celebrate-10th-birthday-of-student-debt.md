Students to Celebrate 10th Birthday of Student Debt

Streamers, singing, cake and party hats will be on campus tomorrow for what student leaders are calling one of the saddest birthdays the country has seen – ten years of student debt.

“It’s been ten long years, and New Zealand has seen the baby that was the student loan scheme in 1992 grow into the monster of student debt” said OUSA Campaign Coordinator, Kyle Matthews. “Graduates fleeing the country, people having trouble getting mortgages, debt scaring young people off enrolling in institutions. It’s all coming home to roost now.”

Otago university and polytechnic students will celebrate the tenth birthday of the student loan scheme tomorrow on campus, as part of the orientation events outside Registry at 1pm. Students will be signing a giant birthday card which will be sent to Minister of Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey.
