Students Say SJS Service Improving

**Students Say SJS Service Improving**

The latest figures from Student Job Search show that while the numbers of students placed in work since the peak of 2011, the past three years have seen placements and the amount earned until the end of May remain steady.

“It’s good to see the amount earned by students to 31st May has managed to stay around 2.9 million dollar mark,” said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President. “The service is still proving the best way for students to make money while studying, and students are showing the service is improving.”

Student Job Search has continually improved its marketing and communication efforts since the regional office based at the Otago University building was closed with the service moving to an all online platform.

“The transition period for moving online is over and the service is now pushing new ideas and strategies to connect with students,” Said Sycamore-Smith. “The social media campaigns are especially pushing student involvement and providing opportunities for students to interact with the service.”

The online approach is paying off and the latest OUSA student survey shows more students are satisfied with the service, and more believing it is an important service for the students’ association to be involved with.

“Now we need to ensure more businesses and people in our community know that the services is free and ready to be used!” said Ms. Sycamore-Smith. “I believe there is more work out there, and we know students are willing and ready to get involved while they’re in Dunedin.”
