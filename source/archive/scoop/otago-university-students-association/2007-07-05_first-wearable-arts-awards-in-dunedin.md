LONG-LEAD RELEASE

First Wearable Arts Awards in Dunedin  
Free to enter. Free to watch. Free to enjoy

As part of launching its new logo and brand, the Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) has organized its inaugural Wearable Arts Awards.

This spectacular show will be held in the prize winning Link building on campus. Event organisers are certain that the first Wearable Arts Awards to be held in Dunedin will be a huge success and an event not to be missed.

“This event is the first of its kind in Dunedin. It is an excellent way to showcase the talent of Dunedin students, and to promote OUSA’s new look,“ said OUSA President Renee Heal. “We are confident that this will be an absolutely dazzling event, not to be missed.”

There has been a buzz of interest, with artists, designers and creative students creating pieces in the theme of OUSA’s new colours, green and grey. At last count there were 15 entrants, with 18 creations entered in the show.

This landmark event is to be held at 6pm on the 12th of JULY – entry is free and competition is hot – so don’t miss out!

Reporters wishing to attend the Wearable Arts Awards should contact OUSA Events Manager, Vanessa Reddy (vanessa@events.ousa.org.nz), to ensure priority seating for filming and photographic purposes.
