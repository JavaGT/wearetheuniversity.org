**OUSA Art Week sells for $3,000**

The 5th annual OUSA Art Week concluded on September 21 selling 56 of the 200 pieces on display making $3,000 for the student artists.

“Art Week was a fantastic experience for art lovers and artists,” said Laura Madden, OUSA Events Manager, “The feeling of selling one’s work for the first time is quite special and experientially very important.”

The programme of events was very well supported throughout the week by students and Dunedin art lovers.

“The OUSA is very proud to work with student artists and artists more broadly. This has become much more of a Dunedin event, with the sheer size of it meaning we will have to carefully manage next year,” said Laura Madden.
