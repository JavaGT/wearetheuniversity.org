Clock Strikes On New Executive Structure
========================================

**Monday, 2 August 2010, 4:35 pm**  
**Press Release: [Otago University Students' Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association)**

**Clock Strikes On New Executive Structure**  

As soon as the clock struck 9am today, Otago University Students Association (OUSA) opened nominations for its 2011 Executive under a new structure as voted by the majority of students who participated in an online referendum.

The new structure sees the OUSA Executive reduced from 17 positions to 10.

“The new structure increases OUSA's ability to represent and advocate for its members” says OUSA President Harriet Geoghegan.

\"We can have as many representatives on the executive as could be imagined, but if our internal structure isn't functioning efficiently then we would be doing them a disservice."

“Under the current structure it can be difficult for representatives to bring all issues of their constituents to a full Executive meeting, and this structure ensures all issues can be fully discussed by people best placed to make good recommendations.”

”The representation structure will be strengthened next year by the establishment of eight committees - welfare, education, postgraduate, policy, finance and expenditure, recreation, communications and events.”

Nominations for the new positions are open now and close at 4pm this Friday August 6th.

A list of old positions and new positions is attached.
