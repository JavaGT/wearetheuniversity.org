Students Welcome AUS Exam Marks Decision

Students in the midst of exam swot today breathed a sigh of relief as the Association of University Staff announced the withdrawal of an impending delay in the release of semester 1 exam marks.

“We fully support university staff in their bid for a decent wage, and we are delighted that AUS has decided on a more student-friendly course of industrial action” said Otago University Students’ Association president Steven Sutton.

The withholding of exam marks had threatened to make students the meat in the sandwich between underpaid staff and underfunded universities, but today’s announcement put students in a much less awkward position. “This decision is definitely a positive development, and we hope it is a sign that this dispute can be settled amicably before the strike action due in July” concluded Mr Sutton.
