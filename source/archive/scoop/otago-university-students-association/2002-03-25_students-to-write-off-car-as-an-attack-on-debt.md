Students To Write Off Car As An Attack On Debt

Students To Write Off Car As A Symbolic Attack On $5 Billion Of Student Debt

Joint Media Statement of: Otago University Students Association and  
Otago Polytechnic Students Association

  
Otago students will take to a car tomorrow with sledgehammers as a symbolic attack on five billion dollars of student loan debt. The ‘Big Write Off 2002’ is being organized by the University and Polytechnic Education Action Group to highlight the high level of debt that students face, and the lack of government support that has caused it.

“With the government releasing a discussion document on student support in May, it’s time for the country to wake up to the fact that students are discriminated against. Current policy states that parents should still be paying for twenty-four year olds, when they’ve been driving for eight years, voting for six, and could have been killed at war. What sort of bizarre ‘student support’ scheme is this?” said Otago Polytechnic Students Association Vice-President Michelle Watt.

“Our calculations indicate that $5 billion of student debt is sixty thousand BMW Series 3 Convertibles. Since debt is something that students feel powerless about, we’ve arranged a classic European car for them to vent their frustration on. It may only be symbolic of their debt, but the car is going to get the bash” said Otago University Students Association Campaign Coordinator Kyle Matthews.

The event will take place opposite the Student Centre on Harbour Terrace, Tuesday 26 March, 1pm, and include a BBQ and prizes for students who give it a go.
