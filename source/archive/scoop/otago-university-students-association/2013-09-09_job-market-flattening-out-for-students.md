Job Market Flattening Out for Students
======================================

**_For Immediate Release_**

**Job Market Flattening Out for Students**  
The latest Otago student job figures from Student Job Search show that at least part of the market is settling out in Otago. August’s figures show that the number of students placed in the year to date are up 1% to 2367 compared to the first 8 months of 2012.

“It’s pleasing to see that more students who are looking to supplement their income during study are getting the opportunity to do so,” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “But it’s early days yet and we can only hope that the numbers continue to increase as the summer period gets closer.”

The increase is the best result Otago has had in recent months with figures being down throughout the year and other figures such as the amount earned and worker weeks still being in the red for the year so far.

“We want to be optimistic that spring will see more opportunities for students as one off jobs that come with the better weather begin to come up again,” Said Mr. Hernandez. “We certainly encourage any homeowners looking for a tidy up outside, or busy businesses coming up to the Christmas rush who need short term extra help to list their jobs for free with SJS.”
