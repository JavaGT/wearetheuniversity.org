**Students welcome Michael Woodhouse Ministerial appointment**

The Otago University Students’ Association has welcomed the ministerial appointment of Michael Woodhouse.

“The OUSA congratulates Mr Woodhouse on his ministerial appointment”, said OUSA President Francisco Hernandez.

“This is good news for Mr Woodhouse personally but it is also good news for Dunedin and students."

“Having a Dunedin based Minister in the decision making mix will help ensure Dunedin specific issues are heard well. His appointment to the difficult Immigration portfolio is also good news as there are complexities for our international students that Mr Woodhouse will be able to deal with.”

“We wish Mr Woodhouse a successful time as a Minister”, said Francisco Hernandez.
