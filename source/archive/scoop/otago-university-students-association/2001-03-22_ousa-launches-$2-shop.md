The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) will start screening two-dollar movies for students every Tuesday from next week announced President Ayesha Verrall.

“OUSA has worked on the $2 Tuesdays idea so students can enjoy a quiet night away from the library with a $2 film and $2 coffee afterwards,” said Ms Verrall  
The first film to be screened will be ‘The Cell’, a mystery with stunning graphical effects that stars Jennifer Lopez.

“The films are screened at cost so we are depending on big audiences to see them continue,” said Ms Verrall Movies will be screened in the Medical School’s Red Lecture Theater on Tuesdays at 8pm and will cost $2. Ticket holders can obtain their $2 coffees from Fuel Café.
