Students to Sleep Out in Octagon to raise funds for Dunedin Night Shelter

This Friday 29th of July at 7pm, over 100 students will fill the upper Octagon in Dunedin, to raise awareness of the issue of homelessness, and raise funds for the Dunedin Night Shelter Trust. The Dunedin Sleep Out is into its second year as an event, and was originally conceived as a collaboration between the Dunedin Night Shelter Trust,the University of Otago Volunteer Centre and OUSA (Otago University Students Association).

Last year the event raised over $12,000 for the Night Shelter to help purchase its premises at 18 Lees Street, and brought the issue of homelessness in Dunedin to the forefront. University Volunteer Coordinator Sze-En Watts says the event is a fantastic example of what students can do for their community.

“The event is about more than spending a freezing night in the Octagon. There will be performances from amazing local musicians, fun activities for the participants and awesome support from the wider community.”

Teams of students sign up for the Sleep Out and ask friends and family to sponsor their night in the Octagon. The Dunedin Night Shelter Trust are delighted with the support from both students and the community.  
Chairman Dave Brown says the event is a highlight for the Trust.

“The students on the organising team have so much energy and so many ideas, and I know the event will be a great success.”

People can support the students’ efforts by contributing donations online here:
