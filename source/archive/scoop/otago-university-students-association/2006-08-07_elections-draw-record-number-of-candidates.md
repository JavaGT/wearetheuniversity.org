Elections Draw Record Number Of Candidates

Nominations for the 2007 Otago University Students’ Association Executive closed today with a record 57 nominations having been received. “We set a target of 30+ candidates for this year’s elections” said OUSA President Paul Chong today. “But we left that target in the dust twenty candidates ago” he continued.

Mr Chong noted that OUSA made a huge effort this year to publicise the nominations to the student community. “Past experience shows that there is a correlation between the number and quality of candidates and voter turnout” he said. “I’m expecting a real jamboree of an election” said Chong.

This year’s nominations include seven presidential candidates. Those vying for the top job on campus include two incumbent Executive Officers, Michael Baker (General Representative) and Holly Lawford-Smith (Post-Graduate Representative) and former OUSA vice-president Renee Heal. Incumbent clubs representative, Honor Lanham, is the sole candidate for vice-president.

Voting for the 2007 student executive starts on 21 August and finishes at 4pm on 24 August. All voting will be online at www.elections.ousa.org.nz, as has been the case for the past four years.
