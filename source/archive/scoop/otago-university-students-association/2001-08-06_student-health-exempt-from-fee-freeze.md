Student Health Exempt From Fee Freeze
=====================================

**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

Otago Students are celebrating the news that the University of Otago’s Student Health Service will be exempt from the government’s fee freeze deal.

“The exemption means Student Health will be able to maintain its funding through a small levy increase rather than doubling the per-visit charge,” explained Ayesha Verrall, President of the Otago University Students’ Association.

“Many students view the levy as ‘health insurance’ and prefer to pay up front for the guarantee of being able see a doctor or councilor throughout the year,” said Ms Verrall.

Ms Verrall is very pleased the government has responded to OUSA’s call for the exemption, “Student Health is an essential support service for students and the government has allowed the service to remain accessible.”
