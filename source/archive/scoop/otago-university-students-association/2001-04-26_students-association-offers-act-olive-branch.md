For immediate release

Students’ Association Offers ACT Olive Branch From Money Tree

  
In light of the ACT Party financing schemes made public by the Sunday Star Times, the Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) is considering offering the ACT Party ONE MILLION DOLLARS in the hope that their tertiary education policy will improve.

“After years of lobbying left wing parties for free education, we decided to change our strategy,” said OUSA President Ayesha Verrall.

Ms. Verrall emphasised that this offer has nothing to do with the controversy surrounding ACT party financing recently.

“Recent events have not necessarily led us to believe that a donation of this size could make free education palatable to the ACT Party hierarchy” assured Ms. Verrall.

“Traditionally ACT’s tertiary policy has left a lot to be desired, however we are hopeful that our donation might merely coincide with a change in direction by the party”

The Association is preparing the 101 cheques for $9, 999 to be sent to the ACT party.
