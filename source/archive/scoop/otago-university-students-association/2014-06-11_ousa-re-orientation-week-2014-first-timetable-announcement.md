OUSA Re-Orientation Week 2014 - first timetable announcement
============================================================

**Press Release: [Otago University Students' Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students'_Association)**

**OUSA Re-Orientation Week 2014**  
**9-12 July & 22 July**

The annual Re-Orientation timetable of events associated with the Otago University Students’ Association has been announced today, with tickets also on sale from today via the OUSA Main office.

“We’re working on creating another great line up for the Re-Orientation period that includes not just music events but food, clubs and even features one thousand special student priced tickets for the English Premier League game,” said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President. “We’re excited to provide Otago students with another week of diverse and exciting entertainment with a flavour to suit all tastes.”

Student favourite **Illuminate Paint Party** is back with a new layout including being alcohol free and the team will be installing a new safety matting to the Forsyth Barr Stadium’s eastern slab.

“The event is hugely popular and we believe that it will once again be a massive event with students always ready for a great night out in the paint!” said Sycamore-Smith. “Due to the demand from students we’re happy to align with the franchise again in a safety and ticketing agent role.”

Along with the staple OUSA events that include **Market Day**, **Clubs Day**, the **Dunedin International Food Festival** is back for its winter session featuring all the best food from around the world brought to Dunedin by OUSA’s international clubs.

“With over 15 different stalls catering food from across the globe, the Dunedin International Food festival is one of the most popular events OUSA runs,” said Sycamore-Smith. “It’s a chance for Dunedin to get a taste of the cultures that reside in the city and also provides a really important income for our international clubs.”

OUSA has also sought out the expertise of local event promoters **Dirty Ol’Knights** who have secured international drum and bass producers **_The Prototypes_** with support from Kiwi favourites **_Optimus Gryme_**, **_K-Lab_** and other local acts.

More events are scheduled to be announced by June 30th.

Tickets are available from the OUSA main Office.
