Isn’t If Freezing Down There?
=============================

**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

University of Otago students are holding a Big Fee Freeze party to mark the conclusion of a three-month campaign against fee increases.

“We’re bringing truckloads of snow from Central Otago to campus and holding snow eating, snow wrestling and snowboard jumping competitions to mark this event,” said Ayesha Verrall President of the Otago University Students’ Association.

“Through research and submissions students have shown the University that the fee freeze is financially viable and academically desirable. Now we’re showing Council that the fee freeze is cool,” said Ms Verrall.

The Big Fee Freeze will commence at 1pm on Tuesday 21 August and will include snow-type prizes and giveaways.
