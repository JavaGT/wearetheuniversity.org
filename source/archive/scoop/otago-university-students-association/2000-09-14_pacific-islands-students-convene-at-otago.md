Pacific Islands Students Convene At Otago
=========================================

**Thursday, 14 September 2000, 10:05 am**  
**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

The 2000 Pacific Islands University Students Fono, will be hosted by Otago University Students on Friday and Saturday, 15 – 16 September.

Fono 2000 promises to be the largest yet, due to the increase in attendance and commitment from Students Association members, of New Zealand University Students Association (NZUSA).

The Fono provides a great opportunity for both the Universities and the Students’ Associations to embrace and celebrate the diversity amongst their Students, throughout New Zealand.

“Otago University Students are hosting the first Fono of the new Millennium, this is a great honour for our Students”, says Andrew Campbell, President Otago University Students Association.

Otago University was chosen to host Fono 2000 in the hope of assisting to raise the profile of Pacific Islands Students within both the University and Dunedin.

With the support and assistance of the Pacific Islands Community within Dunedin, this Fono will be a great first step to a Pacific Millennium.

Fono 2000 also brings with it the possibility of greater input and participation of Pacific Islands culture within the current Dunedin community.

1999 saw the First ever, Pacific Islands University Students Fono, hosted at Auckland University.
