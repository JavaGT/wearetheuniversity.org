Biggest and Best Orientation for a Generation

The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) has hosted the biggest and best Orientation for a Generation” said OUSA President Logan Edgar.

“Everything was supersized this year: the bands, comedy, hypnotist, sports day, parent Ori, academic advice, market day – everything was massive”, Logan Edgar said.

“To make it work we have hundreds of volunteers and staff: technical crew, Forsyth Barr Stadium staff, Red Frogs, the Are You OK? Team, and OUSA staff and volunteers. However none of it would have been possible without OUSA Events management from Dan Hendra and Kitty Brown”, said Logan Edgar.

“We also need to thank the Dunedin City Council and the University as well as the citizens of Dunedin. We are proud of creating pro-social events that contribute to a better Dunedin. The police do a good job but can be a cagey lot sometimes so it was good to seethem talk about how well organised our events were – chur”, said Logan Edgar.
