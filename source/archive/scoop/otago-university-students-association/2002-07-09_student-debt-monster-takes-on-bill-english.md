Student Debt Monster Takes On Bill English
==========================================

**Tuesday, 9 July 2002, 11:42 am**  
**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

The Student Debt Monster, launched at a march in Dunedin on Saturday, was out in force again today, following National Leader Bill English throughout Dunedin.  
“We wanted to let voters know that National’s tertiary policy falls short of adequately addressing the student debt problem,” said Roz Connelly, President of the Otago University Students Association.

“National’s tertiary policy does nothing for current students. There is no movement on reducing fees or the introduction of a universal living allowance. These are the two key causes of debt,” said Ms Connelly.

The Debt Monster will be out again in Christchurch tomorrow, meeting Labour Education Minister Trevor Mallard, at 1pm in the Christchurch College of Education Students’ Association common room, Dovedale Ave.
