**Queerest Tea Party and MP’s Visit Highlights of OUSA Diversity Week**  
  
OUSA Diversity Week, currently underway on Otago University campus, offers a range of activities for students to attend.

The annual highlight of the week was today’s Queerest Tea Party, on the OUSA Lawn.

“The Queerest Tea Party allows everyone to come together and celebrate diversity whilst drinking tea and eating cake. It’s also a chance to say ‘hey, we might identify differently in terms of our sexuality or gender, but there’s nothing to be afraid of. Come drink some tea with us’ ” says OUSA Queer Rep, Rosalin MacKenzie.

On Thursday, Greens MP Kevin Hague will present prizes for the Diversity Week Short Story and Poetry Competition and will address interested staff and students as the Green Party’s Rainbow Issues spokesperson.

“This is a fantastic opportunity for staff and students to come along and meet Kevin and to discuss the contemporary challenges for Rainbow politics” Says James Burford, OUSA’s Queer Coordinator.

Other Diversity Week events include a Queer Yoga and Creativity Workshop, a seminar on Queer (ing) Politics and Future, a Respectful Conversation exploring questions of sexuality with University Chaplain Greg Hughson, and Parfait at 12 Below: UniQ’s night out.

OUSA, along with the OUSA-affiliated UniQ, organise OUSA Diversity Week every year in order to celebrate and explore the gender diversity of students on campus.  
“Diversity Week is to affirm and celebrate (not just tolerate) the diverse queer\* whānau” says Rosalin.
