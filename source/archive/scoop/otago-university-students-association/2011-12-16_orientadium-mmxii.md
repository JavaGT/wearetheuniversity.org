Orientadium MMXII
=================

**Friday, 16 December 2011, 5:02 pm**  
**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

The Otago University Students’ Association is proud to announce  
**ORIENTADIUM MMXII**  
February 20-25, 2012

This February, OUSA take over the brand new Forsyth Barr Stadium to present the biggest Orientation Week the country has ever seen, hosting top flight New Zealand music legends and a selection of our funniest comedians.

“Otago University is known for having the best mix of top notch study and fun.” says OUSA President Logan Edgar. “Our team has sorted out the ultimate student stadium experience, and we’re ready to host the biggest O Week in New Zealand ever!”

OUSA Events Manager Kitty Brown says she is delighted to take advantage of such a great new venue for Orientadium MMXII. “We’re using Forsyth Barr Stadium as much as we can with the West Stand being used for seating during the comedy and hypnotist shows, and the East Stand will have the seats removed to make a huge dance floor for the live music shows”.

**Shihad** have been forging their reputation as this country’s greatest stadium rock outfit since before most Otago undergraduates were even born, and they will be mining their two-decades-plus back catalogue at Orientadium MMXII. Rock n roll history lessons this good should be made compulsory.

Hip-hop heroism abounds when Harlem-based superstar **David Dallas** brings his full live band to Dunedin for the very first time, sharing the stage with heavyweights **PNC & P Money** and rap’s enigmatic _enfant terrible_ **Home Brew.**
