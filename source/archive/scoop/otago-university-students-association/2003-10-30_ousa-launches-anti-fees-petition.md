OUSA Launches Anti-fees petition

As part of it's anti-fees campaign The Otago University Student's Association has launched a petition to gather signatures from those opposed to the potential tuition fee increases for 2004.

" We want the University Council to see a tangible expression of the level of opposition and anger that students feel about the proposed fee increases," said Mr. Nick Lanham, OUSA President

"We call on students and concerned members of the public to sign the petition, because tuition fees and student debt are NOT just student issues, their issues that have serious consequences for the wider community," said Catherine May OUSA Campaign Coordinator.

OUSA is aiming to get at least 3000 signatures on the petition, and will present the petition to the University Council around the fee setting period. There will be students gathering signatures around campus until Nov 10th, and copies will also be available to be signed at the OUSA offices on Cumberland St.
