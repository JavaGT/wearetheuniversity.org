Otago Students Warn Against Capping Enrolments

The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) is expressing their concern over the decision by the University of Auckland to cap entrance numbers.

“Auckland University failed to consult their number one stakeholder – students,” said OUSA President Renee Heal. “While they argue that they have been forced into this decision by Government policy, they have known this for a long time and should have taken the time to engage with those who will be most affected by this.”

Amidst reports that other Universities – including the University of Otago - may consider capping entrance numbers in future, OUSA warns that the process must be open and fair.

“There is a delicate balance between ensuring students receive a quality, well-funded education and ensuring that students retain access to that education,” said Heal. “The process from here must consider how we reconcile these two very important priorities, ensuring that groups that are already under-represented in tertiary education are not further marginalised.”
