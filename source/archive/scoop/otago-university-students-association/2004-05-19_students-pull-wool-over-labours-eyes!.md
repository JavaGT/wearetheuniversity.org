Students Pull Wool over Labour’s Eyes!

Students Pull Wool over Labour’s Eyes!

As part of a national day of action students from both Otago University and Otago Polytechnic rallied today encouraging the Labour Government to enact A Living Allowance for All Students in this year’s budget.

As part of a national day of protest, students were calling upon the Labour Government to deliver on their promises of making tertiary education fairer for students, by enacting a Universal Student Living Allowance.

“Its time for Labour to deliver. They have to stop taking students for granted, and pulling the wool over our eyes with pathetic improvements to the current unfair system.” said OPSA President Rachel Dibble today.

At least a third of the current $7 Billion of student debt is made up by living costs borrowing. Students are the only people in New Zealand who have to borrow money to live when they are out of work.

This just isn’t fair in a country like New Zealand. Labour has talked for too long, and done nothing to fix the horribly unfair student support system in this country.” said OUSA President Andrew Cushen after today’s march. “Budget 2004 must include a Living Allowance for All Students – it’s the only fair solution.”

Students let the Government know how serious they are about this issue, by pulling the wool back over Labour’s eyes today – as they covered Labour Minister Pete Hodgson’s electorate office in “wool” during today’s protest.
