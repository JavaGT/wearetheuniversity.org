St David Street Bridge – TRIUMPH!!!

St David Street Bridge – TRIUMPH!!!

The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) is delighted by the University of Otago’s decision to abandon its controversial proposal to build a new St David Street Bridge. The University will be relinquishing its Resource Consents for the project, after pressure by OUSA, and the wider Dunedin community.

“Thank goodness the University has finally seen sense on this stupid proposal.” said Andrew Cushen, OUSA President. “To build a new bridge at a cost of nearly a million dollars, when the current bridge is more than ample, has always seemed ridiculous – at last the University themselves agree.”

The University has previously ignored the concerns of all significant stakeholders in pursuing this project. Students, alumni, staff and the wider Dunedin community have all condemned the proposed new bridge, with the University choosing to ignore them all until this point. This has undoubtedly damaged the community’s perception of the University.

“All along, OUSA has questioned the merit of constructing a new bridge at St. David Street. This project has never had any merits – it was simply an arrogant waste of money. Hopefully the University will now investigate reallocating those funds towards more useful purposes – purposes that will enhance teaching and research at Otago.”

“The University has finally made its first sensible decision regarding this project, after years of making the wrong ones. We are delighted that common sense has finally prevailed.” said Cushen.
