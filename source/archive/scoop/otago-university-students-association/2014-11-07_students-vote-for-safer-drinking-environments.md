**Students vote for safer drinking environments**

The OUSA Referenda held 3-6 November 2014 show students want continuing support from OUSA to help organise Hyde Street Keg Party and the Dunedin Craft Beer & Food Festival and also to oppose the Dunedin City Council’s proposed Local Alcohol policies.

“The OUSA referendum results show that students want to be drinking in safer environments, and more drinking in unregulated environments will occur if the DCC’s proposed Local Alcohol Policies go ahead in their current form,” says President Elect Paul Hunt.

“We have our verbal submission next Wednesday and it is great to know we have the continued support of our students.”

With a total of 1133 votes, 72.2% of voters said they support OUSA’s opposition to the DCC’s proposed 1am one way door policy, 3am as the latest closing time, a ban on shot sales after 12am and an 11pm clearance of outdoor seating areas.

77.05% said they believed OUSA should continue to be involved with and assist with organising the ‘Hyde Street Keg Party’ and 68.4% believed OUSA should continue to be involved with and organise the ‘Dunedin Craft Beer and Food Festival’.

“The Dunedin Craft Beer & Food Festival is a high quality event that models good practice drinking environments and promotes local businesses. OUSA will continue to support events which facilitate student engagement with the wider Dunedin community,” says Hunt.

Also in the referenda, 76.79% of voters believed OUSA should apply more funding towards student groups such as faculty clubs, social cause groups, sports teams, international clubs and student volunteer groups.
