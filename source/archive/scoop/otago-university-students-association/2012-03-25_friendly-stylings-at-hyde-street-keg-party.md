Friendly Stylings at Hyde Street Keg Party

**Friendly Stylings at Hyde Street Keg Party**

The 2012 Hyde Street Keg Party continued its tradition of being a friendly event. “Scarfies party mean, but Hyde Street shows we party with a lot of love”, said Logan Edgar President of the Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA).

“From our perspective everything went according to plan. We had almost no glass on the street, all the free food, water and safety teams operated well”, Logan said.

“The police wisely implemented the discussed contingency of a one way policy from just after 3pm as there were too many people there and we wanted the closing to be as smooth as possible. It allowed us to shut down the music and then shut down the party as planned just after 6pm. The police did an awesome job right from the planning stages to on the day”, Logan said.

“It’s a credit to the scarfies who live in Hyde Street who came together to plan this event and agreed to support a comprehensive harm minimisation approach to the day. It shows what can happen when communities are part of the planning process with authorities. And of course they were all out there doing the traditional 8am street clean this morning”, Logan said.

“There are so many people and organisations that contribute to making the event work not least our own volunteers, staff and the ‘Are You OK’ personal safety team who do everything from reminding people about the glass ban to looking after people who haven’t fared too well over the day. Cheers to the University, Student Health, St John’s, Red Frogs, Campus Watch, the DCC, ALAC and even a few of the local businesses that contributed to this day”, Logan said.

“There are things we need to get better like keeping people off roofs and ensuring alcohol sales at nearby outlets are all seen to be above board. I’m sure the debrief will identify what we need to do to ensure a good 2013 Hyde Street Keg Party and the OUSA will be there to work with the students and authorities to make it happen”, Logan said.
