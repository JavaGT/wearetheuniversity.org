**OUSA: Melting Mid-Winter Away**

The ferris wheel is being constructed; bars of chocolate, bottles of cream, and kilos of hot chocolate powder are being deliciously fused together; and, in registered kitchens, groups of international students are creating delectable delicacies of food.

OUSA’s Carnival, Market and International Food Festival are almost here.

“We are expecting thousands of students and members of the public to visit the OUSA lawn tomorrow to enjoy everything we have put on” says Vanessa Reddy, OUSA Events Manager.

The daytime Carnival Market contains all the fun of the carnival with a ferris wheel, chairoplane rides, blow up bouncy-castle, shooting gallery, and a host of market day stalls. OUSA is giving away free mugs, filled with fairtrade hot chocolate – as both a warming ‘gift’ for visitors, and its contribution to the Chocolate Festival. There is also live entertainment throughout the day and into the night.

The International Food Festival – the largest student food festival in the country – is alone expected to attract thousands of visitors.

OUSA is selling food festival ‘food tokens’ through its main office throughout the day so people visiting the night-time food festival can spend their evening eating rather than queuing. Unused tokens can be redeemed for cash after the event.

“This is OUSA’s favourite time of the year. Winter in Dunedin is always a celebratory time and our members love the Carnival and Food Festival.” said Harriet Geoghegan, OUSA President.
