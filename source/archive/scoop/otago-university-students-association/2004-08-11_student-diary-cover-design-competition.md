Student Diary Cover Design Competition

Otago Polytechnic Students' Association and Dunedin College of Education Students' Association are producing their own student handbook diary for 2005, after many years of successfully sharing the publication with the University Students' Association.

To give the new publication an OP/DCE flavour the organisers are inviting students to enter designs for the cover. "The 2005 Diary will be unique to the OP-DCE student experience and reflect both OPSA and DCESA's characteristics and services we provide." said OPSA President, Rachel Dibble.

OPSA & DCESA are hoping for a cover that symbolises students' experiences at Otago Polytechnic and/or the College of Education - but are not limiting ideas to this concept. It is hoped this competition will become an annual feature.

Entries are open to all OP and DCE students. The wining design will be printed on the cover of 5000 diaries. The concept is similar to the phonebook cover. Entries can be paintings, photos, digital art, in fact anything image based.

"Though OP has the country's best and oldest School of Art, the competition is open to all OP and DCE students, and anyone could be the winner." said Rachel Dibble.

Entries close on 1 October. Entry forms can be picked up from the OPSA office upstairs in the Student Centre on Harbour Tce, or from mbaxter@tekotago.ac.nz.
