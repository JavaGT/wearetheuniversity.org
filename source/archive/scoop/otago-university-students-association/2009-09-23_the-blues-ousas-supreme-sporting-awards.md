FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

The Blues: OUSA’s Supreme Sporting Awards

The Otago University Students’ Association Blues Awards are being conferred this Saturday at a special awards dinner in the Otago Museum atrium.

Blues will be given to those students who have most excelled in the sporting field this year.

In 2008 the supreme sporting awards were taken out by rugby players, while the Otago University Squash Club was made Club of the Year. Who are the top performers in 2009?

OUSA welcomes back to Otago for one night our keynote speaker, Hamish McDouall. Hamish endeared himself to Dunedin when he won Mastermind while studying here. He has since returned to undertake a law degree, knocking off a biography about Chris Cairns at the same time.

He has most recently written a book of the top 100 New Zealand films of all time, and is practicing law in Whanganui.

He has also written the Great Kiwi Sports Quiz Book.

“The nominations for the Awards reflected a wide range of sporting achievements by Otago students” says OUSA Clubs and Societies Representative Dan Stride, noting that choosing a Sportsperson of the Year was a particularly tough decision.

The evening begins at 6:30pm in the Atrium of the Otago Museum. Tickets for anyone wishing to attend are $60.
