Postgraduates To Join OUSA
==========================

**Wednesday, 25 July 2001, 11:59 am**  
**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

Postgraduate students have voted overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Otago University Students’ Association in an electronic referendum on membership.

“85% of postgraduate voters supported joining OUSA to ensure better representation,” said OUSA President Ayesha Verrall.

Ms Verrall describes the result as, “Good news for postgraduates who have suffered through lack of representation and wonderful for an association that now represents a united student body,” said Ms Verrall

“I will be meeting with postgraduates to discuss how their needs can be met within OUSA and on University committees,” said Ms Verrall.

The referendum result is subject to confirmation by the returning officer.
