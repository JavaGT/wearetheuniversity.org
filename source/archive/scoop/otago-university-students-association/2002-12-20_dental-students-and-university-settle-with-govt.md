Dental students and University settle with Government

The Otago University Students’ Association President Rosamond Connelly is very pleased with the settlement reached between the Government and the University of Otago over an underpayment of dental tuition subsidies.

“Dental students who were studying between 1995 and 1999 were lumbered with grotesquely large debts and it is excellent to see some of that money being refunded,” said Ms Connelly. She stresses however, that due to Government underfunding of Tertiary Education, dental students and others still have to suffer the burden of large student loans.

Students were particularly upset when the Government decided to appeal the high court decision, which had deemed the previous Government’s decision to reduce dental subsidies unlawful. “This settlement insures that students get the money owed to them, however the University has had to settle for less. Given the outlay that is required to bring the Dental School up to scratch, this is a real shame,” said Ms Connelly.
