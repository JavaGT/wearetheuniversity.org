Fewer dollars, fewer Allowances
===============================

**Fewer dollars, fewer Allowances**

After a tough year for student job hunters in 2013 which saw a $700,000 decrease in student earnings, the New Year has started off slow with a further small decline in income over the first two months of 2014 compared to 2013.

“We’re concerned that the impact of further reductions in student allowance availability will mean more students will need to work to make up the difference.” Said Ruby Sycamore-Smith, OUSA President 2014. “We see tertiary education and training as a right for all, there needs to be support for those who just simply don’t have the time to work on top of study.”

After three years of increases and a peak of $8.1 Million in earnings in 2012, 2013 saw a significant decrease in jobs and income earned by students.

“It is still early in the year, but if these figures are a continuation of the trends we saw last year we are concerned that fewer students are be able to find work when they need it.” Said Sycamore-Smith. “This is a great service which is free to both employers and students, it can cater for just about any job type, and if it’s seeing decreases in usage it is a real concern.”
