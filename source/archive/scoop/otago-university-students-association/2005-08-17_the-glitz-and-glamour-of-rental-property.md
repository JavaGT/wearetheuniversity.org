The Glitz and Glamour of Rental Property

Time to dust off your tuxedo and practise your red carpet smile, because OUSA is proud to announce the celebrity-studded swish and swanky event of the season – the inaugural OUSA Landlord of the Year Awards Ceremony, 4pm this Friday at the Gazebo Lounge in the University Union.

Attending the glittering ceremony will be the 10 Landlord of the Year nominees, Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin, members of the City Council, University Council and OUSA executive, and of course assorted local celebrities, paparazzi, and high-society hangers-on.

“This event will be all class” said Landlord of the Year Co-ordinator Aine Ni Bhroin. “It’ll have the excitement and glamour of the Oscars, but without all the cocaine in the toilets.”

Up for grabs will be the coveted Landlord of the Year prize, along with all the prestige of being North Dunedin’s finest landlord. Although there can be only one winner on the day, Aine assured all contenders that it is an honour just to be nominated.

“All these hard-working landlords should be proud of themselves – they’re the cream of the crop” said Ms. Ni Bhroin. “We hope that landlords all over Dunedin rise to the challenge set by these fine men and women.”
