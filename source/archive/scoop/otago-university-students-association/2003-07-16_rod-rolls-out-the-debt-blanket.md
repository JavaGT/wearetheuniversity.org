Rod rolls out "The Debt Blanket"

Tomorrow, July 17th, at 1pm outside the University Union building, Rod Donald Green Party Co-Leader and MP will discuss his party's position in regards to student support and tertiary education funding in New Zealand, as well as helping the Otago University Students Association launch The Debt Blanket.

Students will be invited to come and write down how much they owe the Government in Student Loan debt. Once the blankets are full, the amount of debt they represent will be tallied, and blankets will be presented to Dunedin North Labour MP Pete Hodgson.

"During the recent energy crisis, not only were we all paying more to keep warm, but for 70% of students the money that they pay to heat their homes is money they have borrowed from the student loan scheme, because they are ineligible for student allowances. Students are the only sector of the New Zealand adult population who have to borrow to eat, keep warm and put a roof over their heads," said Mr.Nick Lanham, OUSA President.

"Pete can wrap himself up in our debt and keep warm!!" said Catherine May, OUSA Campaigns Coordinator.
