MEDIA RELEASE

7 November 2001  
For immediate release

Knowledge Wave has Dangerous Undertow

  
Students are dismayed that the Tertiary Education Advisory Commission’s report into tertiary funding has suggested restrictions on student numbers.

“With chronic government under-funding and the ridiculous student loan scheme our tertiary education system is in crisis. The proposal to limit our high participation rate is an attack on the only aspect of the system where New Zealand compares favorably with other nations,” said Ayesha Verrall, President of the Otago University Students’ Association.

“This report follows a failed review of student debt by the Education and Science Select Committee and draws into question the government’s credibility in addressing the crisis in tertiary education”, said Ms Verrall.

“Restricting the places in courses is completely out of step with the notion of tertiary education as an investment in New Zealand’s future”, said Ms Verrall.

“High cost courses such as medicine and dentistry already restrict entry.

Further restrictions only deny citizens their right to informed participation in society and restrict the skill base available to employers,” said Ms Verrall.
