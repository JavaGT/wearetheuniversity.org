Thursday 25th April 2013, 1.30pm  
Otago University Memorial Walk, Dunedin

For the second year running the Otago University Students’ Association is proud to be working with the University of Otago and the Otago University Medical Company to host the ANZAC service on campus this ANZAC day.

“For OUSA it’s about remembering those who have served and being thankful for the work New Zealand does in aid of peace.” Said Francisco Hernandez, OUSA President, “Last year we saw a big turn out and we’re hoping to grow it so those who cannot make the dawn service have a place to meet and to remember.”

The OUSA Anzac Day Service will be held at 1.30pm at the University of Otago this Thursday the 25th of April, in front of the Clock tower.

The service will be led by OUSA President Francisco Hernandez and the Tumuaki of Te Roopū Māori, Gianna Leoni.

The Anzac Day address will be delivered by Brigadier Dr. Brian McMahon, a distinguished Otago alumnus who served in the New Zealand Defence Force for over 40 years.

Ataturk's tribute to the soldiers who fell at Gallipoli will be shared in both Turkish and English by Dr. Murat Genç and Vice Chancellor Harlene Hayne. University Chaplains Greg Hughson and Mark Chamberlain will share prayers/karakia.

Wreaths will also be laid on the Leith Bridge by University and student representatives after a procession along with University’s memorial walk.

The service is open to the public and all are welcome to meet for refreshments after the service in the Otago University Link.
