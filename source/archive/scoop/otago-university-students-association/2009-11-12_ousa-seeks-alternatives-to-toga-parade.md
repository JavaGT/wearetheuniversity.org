FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

OUSA seeks alternatives to Toga Parade

The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) has confirmed its mid year decision to remove the Toga Parade from its Orientation programme. The decision was made after the April release of an independent report into this year’s event, conducted by ex University Proctor Ron Chambers.

The Toga Parade was established so the community and students could meet and greet each other in a colourful way.

“Our members paraded down George Street in togas as a way of showing the city the vibrancy and life students bring with them” said OUSA spokesperson General Manager Stephen Alexander, “once in the Octagon, the Dunedin Mayor welcomed students to the Dunedin community that they would be part of for the next three or more years.”

“The ‘welcome’ seems to have turned more to tit for tat disorder between the proudly parading students and some members of the community, so the decision was taken to end it. We want Dunedin to feel happy and proud of the new student intake.”

OUSA sees the ritual of welcome by the community as a necessary part of bringing students to Otago and is seeking to find other vibrant and interesting ways to do this.  
The Association welcomes input from the wider Dunedin community about how best to welcome students.

“It’s important that our members realise they are part of a wider community.”
