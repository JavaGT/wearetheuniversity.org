Students Expect Action from New Tertiary Education Minister

The Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) welcomes the appointment of Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson as the new Minister for Tertiary Education and however they warn that he will be kept very busy addressing the needs of students and the tertiary sector.

“Students have been waiting a long time for Labour to deliver on their promise of affordable education for all,” says OUSA President Renee Heal. “A fresh face in the Tertiary Education portfolio gives them a huge opportunity for action in this very important area.”

“Students are taking on an increasing amount of debt and Government spending on student support is actually decreasing, so it’s now time for action. Students will be looking to the Minister for strong leadership and urgent progress on improving access to student allowances”, said Heal.

“OUSA has a long and positive relationship with the Dunedin North MP, and we look forward to continuing our constructive relationship with the new Minister, and wish him well in his new role”, concluded Heal.
