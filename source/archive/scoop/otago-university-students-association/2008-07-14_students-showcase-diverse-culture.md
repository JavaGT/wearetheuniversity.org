FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Students Showcase Diverse Culture

This Tuesday the 15th of July the Otago University Students’ Association (OUSA) is presenting it’s first ever International Cultural Night. Student groups from Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Brunei, Samoa, the Cook Islands (and lots more) will be displaying a dazzling array of cultural dances and performances. The event is sponsored by ANZ and supported by Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin. The Cultural evening is being held at the Dunedin Town Hall. Tickets cost $15, with all profits going to the Otago Community Hospice.

“It’s great that ANZ and the Mayor are supporting this event and that the Otago Community Hospice will benefit. International students love a chance to give back to their host community and they see this as a really good cause” says OUSA International Students Rep, Darren Lee.

“It’s an opportunity for students, families, and citizens of Dunedin to catch a glimpse of the cultures from Asia and the Pacific. OUSA is proud to have very active cultural student groups affiliated to us and their participation in this event reflects the cultural and ethnic diversity of students.” Continued Mr Lee.
