_**OUSA Announces Supreme Supervisors**_

The Otago University Students’ Association tonight announced the supervisors that made their mark on their postgraduate students at the annual Otago University Students’ Association Supervisors Awards.

“OUSA acknowledges the importance of quality supervision in graduate research degrees (thesis Masters and PhDs), and has instituted these annualawards to recognise and celebrate excellence in this role,” said Maria Pozza, OUSA Postgraduate Representative.

The awards have been running for a number of years and prove popular with many students wanting to show their supervisor how valued their work is.

“It’s a real step up from the old a bottle of wine at the end of the thesis,” joked Miss. Pozza, “It’s an award from their students honouring the fact that many supervisors often goabove and beyond the call of duty in their support.”

“In academic life a supervisor isn’t just a lecturer they’re an experienced researcher,” said Miss. Pozza, “A great supervisor uses that knowledge to mentor their students not only with research but in paper preparation and the whole range of skills an aspiring student needs to get their work recognised in academia.”

The OUSA Supervisors Awards will be held tonight August 1st 2012, at 5pm in the Gazebo Lounge in the University Union.
