OUSA’s Clubs Day: Touting for Members
=====================================

**OUSA’s Clubs Day: Touting for Members**

  
New and returning Scarfies will be able to pick and choose from up to 100 clubs to join at OUSA’s Clubs Day tomorrow.

Sports, spiritual, cultural, political and academic clubs abound at Otago University and most are affiliated to the Otago University Students Association (OUSA). Among the many clubs people will encounter are WTF Taekwondo, the Indian Cultural Association, Meditation and Alpine sports.

The kendo club is giving a demonstration of what its new members can expect to be involved in, at 11am.

Visitors can also take part in Zumba demonstrations.

“For students Clubs Day is a fantastic opportunity to find out more about the clubs on campus, direct from those most passionate about them” says OUSA Club Development Officer Lee Griffiths.

Affiliated clubs receive funding, access to meeting rooms, lots of support, and membership drive help such as Clubs Day from OUSA.  
Some of the largest and oldest clubs at Otago University are affiliated to OUSA – such as the Rowing Club and the Rugby Club.

“OUSA has a small but dedicated team to assist students with clubs, ensuring students can create and participate in the social and sporting experiences that they want to see on campus.”

Clubs Day is held in the Union Hall tomorrow (14 July) from 10am to 4pm.
