OUSA says VUWSA's OK!!

The Otago University Students' Association is standing behind the Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association's actions in forcing the closure of the Victoria University Council's fees setting meeting today. The closure was a protest against probable fee increases for 2004.

"Government funding to tertiary institutions has been increased, and increasing fees is just going to lead to increasing the debt burden on students. We back VUWSA, and NZUSA, and are prepared to take action ourselves if the Otago University Council tries to raise fees for next year, " said Mr. Nick Lanham, OUSA President.

" A 5% possible fees increase is 5% too much, we call upon our Council to set an example to the rest of the University Councils of New Zealand, and set fees for next year at or below their 2003 levels," said Catherine May, OUSA Campaigns Coordinator.
