Students Rockin’ and Enrollin’ Thursday at re:Fuel

Students Rockin’ and Enrollin’ Thursday at re:Fuel

Students and young people will have the opportunity to enrol to vote in style this Thursday 4 August, at a free “Rock Enrol” party being held at the Otago university pub re:Fuel by the Otago University Students’ Association.

The evening will be hosted by celebrity MC Nandor Tanzcos of the Green Party. Local bands Gestalt Switch, The Irie Eyes, the DDTs, and Operation Rolling Thunder have all agreed to help out, and will be entertaining the crowd from 8:30pm. In a late addition to the line-up, local soundsystem Captain Bultaco’s Indie Disco will be spinning indie electro and rock’n’roll tunes.

“This is a great idea” said Gestalt Switch lead singer Ashley Gestalt. “Because the young people love Gestalt Switch, and Gestalt Switch love voting. So when you get us all together it’ll be one big party, with the young people and the Gestalt Switch and the voting, it’ll be a beautiful thing.”

Entry is free, but punters will have to check that they’re on the roll at the door. Electoral roll contractors will be on hand to pounce on anyone who’s not enrolled.

“This is going to be a fantastic night” said Otago University Students’ Association President Steven Sutton. “If you’re already enrolled it’s a night out on us. And if you’re not, what better time to enrol than at a party?”

Thursday night’s party is part of an ongoing OUSA campaign to increase the voter enrolment and turnout rates in North Dunedin, particularly in the problematic 18-24 age bracket.
