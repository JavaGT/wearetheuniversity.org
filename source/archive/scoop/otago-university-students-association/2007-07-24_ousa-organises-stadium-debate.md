### OUSA Organises Stadium Debate

The Otago University Students Association (OUSA) has organised a public debate on campus so that students will have a chance to become more informed on the issues surrounding the proposed Awatea St Stadium.

The debate will take place on Wednesday the 25th of July at 1pm in the Main Common Room of the University Unions. It will be between Councillor Lee Vandervis and former All Black Josh Kronfeld.

OUSA has invited students to come along, listen to the experts, ask questions, and express their opinions on this important issue.

"Proponents of the new Dunedin stadium have argued that students will flock to games and events held at the proposed stadium, yet consultation with that key stakeholder group has been minimal," said OUSA President, Renee Heal.

"OUSA has organised a debate so that students can become well informed on this issue. Students need to be given the chance to weigh the arguments and make an informed decision. OUSA hopes that tomorrow's debate will give them this opportunity."

The debate will take place at 1pm in the University Union Common room on Wednesday the 25th of July.
