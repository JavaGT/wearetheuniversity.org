MEDIA RELEASE

For immediate release

Frozen Fees for Scarfies

University of Otago Students are celebrating their Council’s decision to hold fees at current levels in 2002.

“It is wonderful to see the University Council take this opportunity to ease the burden on students. An academically credible institution cannot continue to present massive financial barriers to learners,” said Ms Verrall.

Ms Verrall says she is, “ecstatic and exhausted after three month of campaigning for the fee freeze”.

“Lobbying council, writing an alternative budget, the postcard campaign and last week’s fee freeze event clearly paid off.”

“This was a difficult decision for the University which highlighted the continued need for greater government funding,”

“There remains a lot to be done to combat the ever-increasing levels of student debt but freezing fees is a positive step,” said Ms Verrall.
