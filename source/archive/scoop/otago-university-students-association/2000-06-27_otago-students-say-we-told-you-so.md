Otago Students Say “We Told You So”
===================================

**Tuesday, 27 June 2000, 3:40 pm**  
**Press Release: [Otago University Students Association](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Otago_University_Students_Association)**

The Otago University Students Association (OUSA) feels vindicated today in their long struggle to highlight the negative effects of the student loan scheme.

A report from the Controller and Auditor General released today outlines the failings of the previous Government for failing to undertake any research into the long-term effects of the student loan scheme introduced in 1991.

“Graduates, current students and students associations have long known the effects of the student loan scheme. We have independently conducted research into these effects, published the findings and taken to the streets over them. Finally we are vindicated for our efforts”, said Andrew Campbell OUSA President.

“The complete failure of the previous government to undertake any form of research into the student loan scheme highlights their pure idiocy. Only a blindly ideological government would undertake such a scheme without analysing its effects”, said Campbell

Total student debt now exceeds 3 billion dollars. Research done by the national students association (NZUSA) has shown the difference in repayment times for men and women, and the Auditor General’s Report refers to a survey undertaken by OUSA in 1999 of bank manager declining loans and mortgages on the basis of student loan debt.

“OUSA is glad that our research has been acknowledged. However it is the responsibility of Government to ensure their policy is sound, not those most adversely effected by it”, said Campbell

“Though we feel a sense of “we told you” so about this report, what we want to see is the Government undertaking research in key areas of the loan scheme”, said Campbell

“The evidence is out there, now we need the loan scheme removed and a far more sensible policy implemented such as Universal Allowances,” said Campbell
