Women to march to take back the night in Dunedin

Students attending the Tertiary Women's Focus Group (TWFG) Conference in Dunedin will be ‘taking back the night’ for women by marching down to the main street of Dunedin.

"By taking part in this march, we are demanding a night free from discrimination and a world without rape and violence,” said Rachel Dibble Otago Polytechnic Students' Association President and Co-organiser of the march.

"Women in Dunedin and New Zealand in general are not safe when walking our streets at night." said Renee Heal, co-organiser of the march and the Education/Welfare Vice President from Otago University Students' Association (OUSA). "This march highlights the need for safe streets and homes for women.”

"This march is campaigning for change on a local and national level for and links in with our international "Thursdays in Black" T-shirt campaign: Demanding a world without rape and violence " said Viki Yates, the co-Women's Rights Officer of OUSA and co-organiser of the march.

The march will leave from Dental School and proceed along George Street at 7:30pm culminating in one minute of silence in the Octagon and a candle vigil until 9pm.

All women and supportive men welcome on the march.
