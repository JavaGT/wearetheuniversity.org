Otago Students Welcome the End of Means Testing
===============================================

Otago Students Welcome the End of Means Testing.

Today well over 1000 students gathered at Otago University to listen to Prime Minister Helen Clark.

Her announcement of the phased introduction of a universal allowance was met with applause from the crowd.

“The crowd loved it, they were thrilled to hear that Labour has been listening to students’concerns” Said Otago University Students’ Association President Simon Wilson.

Labour’s plan will see allowances completely phased out by 1 January 2012. Currently only around a third of students receive an allowance, the remaining two thirds are forced to borrow to live.

“Means testing of parental income was always a ridiculous way to judge whether a student needed an allowance. Its great to see that the end is in sight” Said Wilson.

Students are the only group in New Zealand society who are currently forced to borrow to live. Across the country students are celebrating the end of this backwards system.
