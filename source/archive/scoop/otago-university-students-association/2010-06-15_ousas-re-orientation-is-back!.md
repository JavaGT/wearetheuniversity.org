OUSA’s Re-Orientation is Back!
==============================

**OUSA’s Re-Orientation is Back!**

After a one year stint as ‘Take 2’, OUSA ReOrientation is back!

From Nero to P-Money, from carnivals and international food to illuminated paint partying – everyone and everything that is ‘so hot right now’ is going to be at OUSA’s ReOrientation in July.

"Our previous experiences of ReOrientation have shown us that what our members like best in winter is to put everything that’s going on in their lives aside for a while and just have lots of fun - and that’s exactly what we’re giving them" says Vanessa Reddy, OUSA Events Manager.

OUSA's ReOrientation kicks off on Monday 12 May with “**ManDay**”. Organised by OUSA Finance and Services Officer James Meager, it is a day devoted to things manly. Starting with man-breakfast and screening of the FIFA World Cup Final, the day progresses by way of some marathon Halo 3 action, charity BBQs, a manly debate about sports, and even an extravagant meat raffle.

Wednesday 14 May has **Nightcap** – who are touring Adam Freeland and Nero from the UK, Bang Gang DJs, Doom & Hoodrat from Australia and from New Zealand : State of Mind, Computers Want Me Dead, Truth and the mysterious Mr. Mime.

On Thursday 15 we bring back the carnival at our **Carnival Market Day** (complete with ferris wheel, gallery, rides and free hot chocolate in OUSA giveaway mugs).

"The carnival imbued everyone with happiness last year on a wintry day so OUSA know it’s a winner" says Reddy

On the night of Thursday 16 is OUSA's famous **International Food Festival** - the largest student food festival in the country.

"Our affiliated international clubs are hard at work already, preparing menus, undergoing food safety courses, and planning their stalls."

Tokens for the hundreds of expected visitors to ‘spend’ at the Food Festival will be on sale all during the week from the OUSA main office to ensure all who come on the night can be involved with eating rather than queuing.

On Friday 16 some of the **top Dunedin bands** at the moment – Honeybone, the Du Cats Kit, Cult Disney and The Exclamations – are stopping in for a concert.

On Saturday ReOrientation closes with the **Illuminate Paint Party**. For the uninitiated, here is the recipe for a Paint Party: Take one Union Hall, tape it up with plastic and drop sheets; mix in a line up of entertainment including P Money, the Upbeats and Antiform, some strobe and ultraviolet lights and tonnes of fluoro paint; give some paint to over a thousand paint party enthusiasts. Result? Crazy times!

"The emphasis of ReOrientation is on dropping our inhibitions, thumbing our noses at winter, and having good old-fashioned crazy FUN!"

Tickets for the Illuminate Paint Party and for Nightcap are on sale now, and going fast.

Four nights, one day – OUSA’s Welcome Back for students.
