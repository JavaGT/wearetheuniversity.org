Provisional University Council Bans Fees

First meeting of Provisional University Council Bans Fees

Fees were declared banned at the first meeting of the Provisional University of Otago Council meeting today (Tuesday Nov 11th), as a barrier to equitable access to tertiary education.

Students angry at the University Council's proposed 5% fee increases attending the University Council meeting today formed the Provisional University Council.

\"We've had a bloody enough of the Council's callous disregard for the way fees increases will affect students," said Mr. Frahame Gogelburg, the newly appointed Vice-Chancellor of the PUC. "We're taking the power back!!!"

"The University Council was not prepared to acknowledge students anger at the proposed fee increases, despite the presentation of 3000 signatures calling for a zero fee increase, and the outrage of students at the meeting. They have failed us and forced us to take this step," said Catherine May Secretary of the PUC.

The PUC also discussed other motions that were designed to reduce barriers to tertiary education, and that would contribute positively to the creation of a true Knowledge wave society.
