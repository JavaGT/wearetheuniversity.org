OUSA Grants top 100 in 2011

**OUSA Grants top 100 in 2011**

This year the Otago University Students’ Association gave away over 100 grants adding up to over $40,000 with the aim to help members get a leg up in extracurricular pursuits that contribute to a rounded Otago education.

“The OUSA grants scheme is designed to help as many students as possible follow their non-academic dreams to complement their academic goals”, said Logan Edgar, OUSA President.

The grants scheme has six rounds per year to assist the over one hundred affiliated OUSA clubs. Individuals are also encouraged to apply, and grants are often awarded to athletes that need assistance to travel to events abroad.

“Students can’t always afford to travel to events that help them follow their passions and talents.” said Mr. Edgar. “Otago students are lucky that thanks to past and present members we’ve been able to help out our clubs and individuals. We’re looking to maintain that tradition next year even as voluntary student membership comes into effect.”

Grant recipients comprise a range of people including a Junior Black Stick, youth workers, and international rowers. They have used the money to travel far and wide including the OUSA Debating Club which received $3000 to compete at the World University Debating Championship in the Philippines.
