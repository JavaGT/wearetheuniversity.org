Who Will Be Dunedin’s 2005 Landlord of the Year?

Nominations for the inaugural Otago University Students’ Association Landlord of the Year Award open on Monday 1 August. The Landlord of the Year Award is a new initiative by OUSA to celebrate the good work of responsible landlords in North Dunedin.

“North Dunedin landlords get a lot of stick, and let’s be frank, some of them deserve it” said OUSA Landlord of the Year Award Co-ordinator Aine Ni Bhroin. “Unfortunately, the hard work of Dunedin’s many diligent landlords tends to go unnoticed. That’s why we initiated this award, to provide some recognition to the good landlords out there.”

Students have until Wednesday 17 August to nominate their landlord for Landlord of the Year, which they can do by by visiting OUSA’s website www.ousa.org.nz, by emailing landlordawards@ousa.org.nz, or by filling in a form available at the OUSA office. The winners will be selected by a panel of judges, and the awards will be presented at a glitzy ceremony on Friday 18 August.
