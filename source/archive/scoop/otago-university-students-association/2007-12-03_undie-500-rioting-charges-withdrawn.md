Undie 500 Rioting Charges Withdrawn

**Undie 500 Rioting Charges Withdrawn**

The Otago University Students Association (OUSA) is today congratulating the police on their withdrawal of rioting charges against those charged for their alleged involvement in the events following this year’s Undie 500.

“We’ve always had faith in the court process and it’s really great to see that process is working correctly,” said OUSA President Renee Heal. “We are relieved for our members and encouraged by today’s developments.”

Those involved will now be charged with a range of lesser offences including disorderly behaviour and obstruction of a constable.

“OUSA has never condoned the behaviour of those involved, and we believe these to be appropriate charges in the circumstances,” said Heal today. “We are thrilled to see that the police have laid charges that are reflective of the events which took place, rather than trying to make an example of those involved. We have faith that the court system will decide appropriately in this situation.”

OUSA is supporting any students who may be punished under the University of Otago’s Code of Conduct – which it is advised the University does not have the legal power to implement in these circumstances - and encourages any student involved to contact them.
