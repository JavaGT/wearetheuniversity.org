North Campus Development $2.2 Million Over Budget

Spokespeople for the 'Books not Bridges' group today reacted angrily to information that the University of Otago's North Campus Development Project is already 88% over budget. The information, obtained by the Otago University Students' Association via an Official Information Act request, shows that the project, originally budgeted at $2.5 million, is now estimated to cost $4.7 million in total.

"This ongoing project is quite simply a scandal. $4.7 million dollars of student and public money going towards something of no academic purpose whatsoever. It must be stopped, and it must be stopped now" said group spokesperson Mr Kyle Matthews.

The group is calling on the University to drop the controversial stage three bridge section of the development. This will allow funds donated in the early 1990s for 'the entranceway' to be used to cover existing overruns.

"The University has recently been appealing to graduates and friends of the institution to donate money for scholarships and library books, because the university is insufficiently funded. For this senseless project to be costing $4.7 million, at the same time that the University is going cap-in-hand asking for money, is simply dishonest." said Mr Matthews.
