A great day to celebrate our teachers

World Teachers’ Day is a great opportunity to celebrate the thousands of hardworking, committed and passionate teachers in our local schools, said Labour Education Spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.

World Teachers’ Day is recognised in Australia and New Zealand on 26th October every year.

“Since becoming Labour's spokesperson for education I have visited numerous schools and attended public meetings and teachers’ forums where teachers have passionately debated the future of New Zealand’s education system.

“The Government doesn’t recognise the classroom expertise and insight that teachers bring to improving children's learning outcomes.

“Issues like feeding hungry children, broadening assessment measures so every child is learning at their potential, tackling persistent behavioural problems, greater support for children with special needs, and reading recovery support are just some of the issues confronting teachers on a daily basis.

“It's disappointing that the Government has failed to support the teaching and learning environment in ways that could make a real difference.

“Instead teachers are being driven down a narrow path of assessment, are worried about the lack of real support for learning and behavioural needs and, to top it off, are wondering if they will get fully paid each fortnight.

“The Government needs to stop kicking teachers in the guts and instead should celebrate a profession that punches above its weight.

“We don't want teachers to be the next profession that moves to Australia because of better job opportunities.”
