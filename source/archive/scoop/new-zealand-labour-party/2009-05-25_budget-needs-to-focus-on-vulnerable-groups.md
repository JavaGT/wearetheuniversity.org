Ardern: Youth Jobs Summit shows Budget needs to focus on vulnerable groups

  
Labour Youth Affairs spokesperson Jacinda Ardern says today’s successful Youth Jobs Summit in Wellington has reinforced awareness of how vulnerable groups “at the margins” are in a time of recession.

“Young people certainly fit into this category,” she said. “That is why it is so important that the Government, which has been talking up its willingness to help young people transition into jobs or further education or skills training, produces tangible financial commitment in this week’s Budget.

“The need for such commitment is becoming clearer every day. In the March quarter unemployment for those aged 15-19 years rose from 17.9 percent to 19.6 percent. Sadly the news is much worse for those aged 20-24, where unemployment jumped 7.3 percent to 12 percent. That’s an extra 10,300 young people who are now without jobs.”

Jacinda Ardern said more than 50 people, including representatives of other political parties, youth organisations, business, trade unions and the tertiary education sector, attended today’s forum.

“There was general consensus on a number of issues,” she said. These included:

• The reality that recession puts the spotlight on people who are already at the margins and who are most vulnerable.  
• Focusing on skills and ensuring that there is an ongoing platform for business, trade unions and the education sector to work together with the Government.  
• The importance of ensuring that all young people have access to skills training, and the need to adequately fund tertiary education which is experiencing high demand.  
• The need to provide support as young people move between school, ongoing skills training and employment.

““The summit also generated new ideas, such as guaranteeing employment or skills training for long-term unemployed people under the age of 25. A host of ideas emerged today during the formal sessions and the workshops, and I am looking forward to collating these and promoting debate about them wherever I can.”
