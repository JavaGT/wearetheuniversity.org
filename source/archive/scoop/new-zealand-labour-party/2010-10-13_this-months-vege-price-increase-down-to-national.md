This month’s vege price increase down to National
=================================================

**This month’s vege price increase down to National, not bad weather**

Fruit and vegetable prices rose 2.6 percent in September because of wet, windy and cold weather, but increases from October on will also be down to National’s 20 percent increase in GST, says Labour Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.

David Cunliffe said: “I am not going to blame an ex-Southlander for the bad weather, but Bill English is responsible for the GST rise which means that fresh fruit and vegetables will be subject to higher GST no matter what the weather is like.

“I also blame Bill English for the tax switch that will put thousands of extra dollars in the pockets of his well-heeled mates, while forcing a greater share of the tax burden on to low and middle-income New Zealanders who are already struggling with increased prices.

“The Department of Labour has reported that more than half of New Zealand workers didn’t get a wage rise this year,” David Cunliffe said.

”Not only is National failing New Zealanders with its lack of an economic plan to lead us out of recession, but National’s GST increase is putting the boot into Kiwis who are already the most vulnerable.

“Add to that the fact that National is stripping away the rights of workers, and people become even more vulnerable.”

David Cunliffe said Labour is committed to removing the entire 15 percent GST from fresh fruit and vegetables.

“This initiative is one of many Labour will announce over coming months to address the imbalances National is creating in our economy.

“National believes in an economy that rewards those who are already wealthy. Labour believes in an economy that gives everyone a chance to get ahead.”
