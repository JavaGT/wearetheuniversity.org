**Three years free education for the 21st century economy**

Labour’s Working Futures Plan will provide three years of free post-school education across a person’s life so New Zealanders can thrive in the 21st century economy, Opposition Leader Andrew Little announced today.

“The nature of work is changing rapidly and our education system must keep up if we are to seize the opportunities of the future. To compete in the new economy, New Zealand needs one of the best educated workforces in the world.

“Our Working Futures Plan will mean that no matter what path someone wants to take after school, be it university or an apprenticeship, they will be able to get the skills they need to succeed without being shackled with years of debt.

“This will be available throughout a person’s lifetime, so that it can be used for retraining or if someone changes career part way through their working life. It will mean our businesses will always be able to find the skilled workers they need to succeed.

“Right now, New Zealand is being left behind in the global economy. Our economy is stalled, inequality is rising and the Kiwi Dream of a home of your own, a stable income and time with family and friends is slipping away.

“Labour will prepare New Zealand for the future – with a world leading education system supporting the innovative and job-rich economy we need to get ahead.

“National has given up on the future – all they have is a recipe for more of the same. Only a Labour Government will deliver a 21st century economic strategy with the growth, education and living standards Kiwi deserves,” says Andrew Little.
