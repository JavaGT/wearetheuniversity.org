MEDIA STATEMENT

12 April 2017

**Statement on Earl Hagaman**

**“**I have seen Lani Hagaman’s statement seeking a retrial.

“I have taken every opportunity to resolve this matter and I have faced up to my responsibilities.

“My priority now are the thousands of New Zealanders who can’t buy their own home, can’t get the health care they need and who are struggling to get ahead.

“Fixing these problems means changing the Government and that is my focus.

“As this matter could be subject to further court proceedings, I will not be commenting further.”
