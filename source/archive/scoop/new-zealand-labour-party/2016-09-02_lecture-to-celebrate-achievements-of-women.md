Dame Dorothy Fraser Lecture to celebrate the achievements of women

This Monday, the fifth annual Dame Dorothy Fraser Lecture will continue the strong tradition of honouring the late Dame Dorothy by highlighting the achievements of New Zealand women, and remembering their contributions.

Professor Barbara Brookes of the University of Otago will deliver the lecture on the topic Generations of Change: How women shaped history. Her research, writing and teaching have contributed significantly to new perspectives on women’s history. She has published widely both internationally and in New Zealand on women and on health.

In the centennial year of the New Zealand Labour Party it is fitting to celebrate and acknowledge the vast history of women in the Dunedin community and hear their stories.

Dame Dorothy Fraser was the youngest person to join the New Zealand Labour Party and was a well-known community figure who gave so much back to the Dunedin South community. She spent 29 years on the Otago Hospital Board, was a Dunedin City Councillor, an Otago University councillor, Otago High School board of governors member, and chairwoman of Montecillo Trust Board.

Professor Brookes will be introduced by Hon. Maryan Street, former Labour Party MP.
