**Ministers acknowledge water quality comes second  
**

Two Government Ministers today acknowledged that any prospect of improving New Zealand's water quality will come second to intensive agriculture, say Labour MPs Brendon Burns and Phil Twyford.

Brendon Burns, Labour's water spokesman, says at today's Primary Production committee meeting Agriculture Minister David Carter mouthed platitudes about the importance of New Zealand's environmental record to our exports, but could not say what will stop new irrigation projects leading to further water degradation.

"John Key has said he wants to see new water schemes in place in Canterbury and possibly Otago next year,” said Brendon Burns. "Mr Carter suggested those time frames were too optimistic, but said no new environmental controls could be put in place anywhere near as rapidly to ensure new water flows do not lead to further deterioration in water quality because of unchecked farming practices.

"Mr Carter confirmed that the most recent assessment of dairying's impact on water quality saw it going backwards, yet he is keen to put in place new water before any tough new requirement is introduced to stop polluting our waterways."

Phil Twyford said that at today's Environment and Local Government select committee, all Environment Minister Nick Smith talked about was environmental protections already in place --- which are not stopping current levels of waterway pollution anyway.

"Dr Smith would not commit to putting on hold the new Canterbury and Otago water schemes, which the Prime Minister wants next year, until new controls are in place. He said the Government is determined to move ahead."

Phil Twyford said the Environment Minister argued that water schemes don’t necessarily have negative environmental water impacts, but can be positive.

"That's true in terms of taking pressure off aquifers but doesn’t address increased discharges of effluent and nitrates that will flow unless the Government insists it's time the environment should come ahead of new, rushed irrigation schemes."

The two MPs say: “What today confirms is that despite its so-called Blue Green agenda, the only thing crystal clear about National is that it is willing to encourage unchecked industrial agriculture growth that will make our waterways browner.”
