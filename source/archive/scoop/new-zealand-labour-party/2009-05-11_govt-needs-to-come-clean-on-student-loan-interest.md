Govt needs to come clean on student loan interest

**Government needs to come clean on interest on student loans**

The National-led Government needs to come clean on whether it is planning to change the interest free student loan system, in the light of fresh speculation about its intentions, said Labour’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson, Maryan Street.

A report this week in the well-informed _Trans Tasman_ newsletter suggests the Budget will “reintroduce some level of interest rate on student loans.” _Trans Tasman_ says the Government “regards the multi-billion dollar student loans book as a key risk to the Crown accounts,” in light of the growing number of students enrolling because of the recession.

“This is particularly alarming given the Education Minister’s refusal to clarify the issue when challenged in Parliament during the first reading of the Government’s Student Loan Repayment Bonus legislation,” said Maryan Street.

“The Education Minister, Finance Minister or Prime Minister need to confirm whether _Trans Tasman_ is right, because National has previously pledged to retain the interest-free scheme.

“During the first reading debate on the Repayment Bonus legislation, I said that it would only make financial sense for students to repay more of their loan early if the Government was intending to reintroduce interest on student loans. Anne Tolley refused to clarify the Government’s intentions at that time.

“Not only would the reintroduction of interest on student loans be a significant broken promise, it would penalise students at the very time when they are trying to get ahead and improve their skills in a difficult job market,” Maryan Street said.
