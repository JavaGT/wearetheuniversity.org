Presbyterian Support Otago’s exit saddening

**Presbyterian Support Otago’s exit saddening**

News that Presbyterian Support Otago is not challenging the Southern District Health Board’s decision to discontinue funding for its home support is saddening; say local Labour MPs David Clark and Clare Curran.

Until now, Presbyterian Support Otago (PSO) has delivered 42% of the regions home support.

“The organisation has a proud record of service in our community. It is highly-regarded by both carers and clients,” Dunedin South MP Clare Curran said.

“There has been no clear explanation from the Southern District Health Board (SDHB) as to why it is cutting the services of its largest and longest serving provider, in favour of those with no footprint or history of care in our region,” David Clark said.

“PSO has a strong network of volunteers. It is hard to imagine new providers will be able to match that aspect of service, and as a consequence, health funding in Otago is unlikely to go as far.

“We are also disappointed that the SDHB is seemingly refusing to reconsider its decision in light of a 13,000 signature petition supporting PSO, particularly as their governing legislation requires them to have regard for community concerns.

“Presbyterian Support has reneged on its plan to lodge an interim legal injunction against the Health Board out of concern for the wellbeing of clients and carers,” Clare Curran said.

“That is a telling sign that PSO has the community at heart. Going forward the primary concern for service provision must be the well-being and dignity of our older citizens.

“We respect PSO’s choice to now turn their energies to the constructive work they do delivering other contracts,” David Clark said.
