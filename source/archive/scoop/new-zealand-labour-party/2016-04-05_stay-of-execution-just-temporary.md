MP for Christchurch East

  
MEDIA STATEMENT

Stay of execution just temporary

Christchurch East MP Poto Williams is welcoming the stay of execution for the Burwood Birthing Unit, which the Canterbury District Health Board has announced will remain open until June.

“The Government should never have considered closing this unit in the first place.

“It is very disappointing that they chose to close it without providing any immediate options or future plans to provide the East with a primary birthing unit.

“The concern now is that the CDHB won’t live up to its commitment of providing a primary birthing unit in the east of Christchurch. I worry that they will be pressured out of it by a Government trying to pass on the $1.7 billion in health cuts,” says Poto Williams.
