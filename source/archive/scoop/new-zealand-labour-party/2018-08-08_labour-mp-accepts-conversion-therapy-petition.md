**Labour MP accepts conversion therapy petition**

Labour MP Marja Lubeck today accepted a petition calling for an end to so-called conversion therapy in New Zealand.

"Today, Jan Logie and I accepted two petitions signed by tens of thousands of New Zealanders calling for an end to conversion therapy in New Zealand,” Ms Lubeck said.

The petitions, from Rainbow Rodney, InsideOUT, Young Labour and the Young Greens, show New Zealanders feel strongly about outlawing conversion therapy.

"Conversion therapy is wrong and has no place in a culture that embraces diversity and accepts everyone. It doesn't work, has never worked, and it has the potential to cause irreparable harm to those subjected.

“I’m inspired to see young people working together on important issues like this facing our Rainbow community. I look forward to seeing these petitions now progress through the parliamentary process. I believe this isn’t a political issue, this is a human rights issue.

“_Sunday_’s incredible [story](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/pray-gay-away-homosexual-conversion-therapy-happening-in-nz) on conversion therapy sparked a discussion on the harm caused by conversion therapy. Conversion therapy is at odds with our values and these petitions signed by tens of thousands of Kiwis demonstrate that.”

“I’m privileged to have the opportunity to represent the Rodney community in Parliament. The determination and passion of Rodney community groups like Rainbow Rodney can help bring about positive and important change in New Zealand and this petition is an example of that.”

Notes for editors:

• Conversion therapy is [defined](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy) by UK-based LGBT charity Stonewall as “any form of treatment or psychotherapy which aims to reduce or story same-sex attraction or to suppress a person’s gender identity.”

• The two petitions will now be considered by a select committee allocated by the Clerk of the House of Representatives. The committee will then report back to Parliament. This report may contain recommendations.
