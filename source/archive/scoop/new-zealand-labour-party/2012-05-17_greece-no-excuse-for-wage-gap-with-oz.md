**Greece no excuse for wage gap with Oz**

Every month the weekly earnings gap with Australia is growing a dollar wider, Labour's Finance spokesperson David Parker says.

“New average weekly earnings figures released in Australia today show weekly wages there grew by another $3.10 a week more than average weekly pay here.

“The weekly wage gap with Australia has grown by $2216 a week since John Key has been Prime Minister, from $122.52 a week in September 2008, to $143.92 today ($865.11 in NZ, March 2012, $1009.03 in Australia, Feb 2012.[\*](#a)).

"Wages in New Zealand are not growing," David Parker says.

"They can't blame Greece for this.

"Closing the wage gap with Australia was a cornerstone of National's 2008 election promise. The Government has stopped talking about it and won't even provide a milestone date by which the wage gap will be back to where it was when they took office. Once again they are failing by even their own measures.

"Next week's Budget will have nothing to grow our economy and nothing to grow wages.

"That's why families are noticing their household budgets are stretched and it's why a record thousand people are week are getting on the plane to Australia,” David Parker said.
