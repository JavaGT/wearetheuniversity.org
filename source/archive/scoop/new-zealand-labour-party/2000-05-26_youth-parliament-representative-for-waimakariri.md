Youth Parliament Representative for Waimakariri

Youth Parliament Representative for Waimakariri named

Member of Parliament for Waimakariri Clayton Cosgrove today announced the winner of the Youth Parliament Representative for the Waimakariri Electorate as Oliver Ferris of Rangiora High School.

“Oliver will get to sit in the Youth Parliament in Wellington in August for two days. He will sit on Select Committees, ask questions of Ministers, debate in the House and answer questions put to him by the Youth Parliamentary Press Gallery,” Mr Cosgrove said.

Students were asked to submit a two hundred word statement on how they would represent the young people of Waimakariri and what issue they would address on their behalf.

“Oliver’s issue was the cost of getting a drivers licence for the first time. He argued for a reduction in the cost, as the current cost may be restrictive to young people in rural areas,” Mr Cosgrove said.

Mr Cosgrove said he and fellow judge, The Press Editor, Tim Pankhurst felt Oliver’s opinion was well thought out and he showed genuine concern for young people in his argument.

Mr Cosgrove said he was pleased with the quality of entries from both rural and urban schools in the Waimakariri Electorate and hoped the students would continue to take an interest in the way their country is run.

Mr Cosgrove said he is looking forward to seeing Oliver take his place in the Parliament in August.
