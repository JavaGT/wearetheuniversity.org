### Labour backs Sallies’ call for more action on children

Labour supports the call by the Salvation Army to put much more emphasis on children’s development and wellbeing, Labour’s deputy leader Annette King says.

The Salvation Army’s fourth state of the nation report released today points to stalled social progress in the past two years, with child poverty levels once again on the rise.

“The report paints a sobering picture of growing numbers of children falling through the cracks – and that is before the huge cuts signalled in this year’s budget. It says the recession is only partly to blame,” Annette King said.

“Labour believes that a much more coordinated approach is needed right across the government and community sector to ensure that New Zealand’s children are front and centre of social policy.

“That is the core philosophy of the new approach Labour is outlining and will take to the election.

“Children’s development and health, particularly in the first six years of their lives, will be made an absolute priority under a Labour government.

“Children will for the first time have a senior minister at the Cabinet table dedicated to putting their interests first, and Labour’s social policy spending will reflect that giving children a great start in life is one of the best investments a country can make.

“The new approach, which I first signalled last September, has been two years in the making and includes input from some of New Zealand’s foremost thinkers and practitioners in child development.

“It will work alongside Labour policies such as making the first $5000 of income tax free and removing gst off fresh fruit and vegetables.

“Labour sees its new child-centred policies as unfinished business.

“The policies will build on work the last Labour government undertook, including Working for Families, reducing the cost of visiting a GP, a huge investment in primary healthcare, getting rid of National’s market rents and the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs,” Annette King said.
