**Government sends major Canterbury contract to Australia**

The Government needs to explain why the contract for Christchurch Hospital’s new acute services building went to an Australian company instead of a local one, says Canterbury Recovery Spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“This is a real kick in the guts for local businesses. Canterbury’s businesses are doing a great job rebuilding our city. It’s a shame the Government would rather back an Australian company instead of locals.

“Our businesses are smart and competitive. They deserve to have the support of their own government.

“It is particularly ironic coming just hours after the huge Champion Canterbury celebrations – an annual event which honours outstanding Canterbury businesses.

“The Government needs to front up and tell local businesses why they apparently can’t compete with Australians,” says Ruth Dyson.
