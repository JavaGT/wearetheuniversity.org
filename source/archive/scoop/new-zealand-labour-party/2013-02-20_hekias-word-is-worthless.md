Hekia’s word is worthless

Chris  
HIPKINS  
Acting Education Spokesperson

20 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Hekia’s word is worthless**

Hekia Parata should come clean and admit that her promise to Christchurch schools facing the axe that they would remain open until the end of 2014 was worthless, says Labour’s acting Education spokesperson, Chris Hipkins.

“Last year Hekia Parata wrote to Branston Intermediate School telling it she was proposing to close it at the end of 2014. And she told a public meeting at the school that it would definitely be open in 2014.

“But now she is planning to shut the school’s doors at the end of the year. And today in Parliament she did everything she could to avoid admitting that she gave any such assurance to Branston Intermediate.

“Hekia Parata can try to hide behind the words “interim decisions” and “proposal” all she likes – but the fact is she has gone back on her word. Her word is worthless.

“Is it any wonder that 71% of those polled in Canterbury want Hekia Parata sacked as Minister of Education? They don’t trust her, and don’t want her anywhere near the education of their children,” says Chris Hipkins.
