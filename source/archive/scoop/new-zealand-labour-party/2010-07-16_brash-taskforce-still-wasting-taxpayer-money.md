Brash taskforce still wasting taxpayer money

**Brash taskforce still wasting taxpayer money**

The National Government’s obstinate refusal to disband the expensive 2025 Taskforce means that Don Brash’s meaningless committee is still costing Kiwis tens of thousands of dollars, says Labour Associate Finance spokesperson David Parker.

“Prime Minister John Key should have axed the group when he dismissed its first report in November last year,” David Parker said.

“The issue is not so much about what has been shelled out to taskforce members, however, but about why the Government is continuing to let the taskforce meet and deliberate when it is clear National is embarrassed by its recommendations and will not act upon them.”

“The taskforce’s first report more closely resembled a far-right brainstorm than a considered programme for New Zealand’s future,” David Parker said.

“It recommended scrapping NZ Super, slashing government spending by $9 billion, undermining our social welfare net, raising the pension age, cutting subsidies for health and education, and dismantling employment law.

“National is doing some of these things, of course, but even this Government is not prepared to go to the extremes Don Brash is once again advocating.

“The taskforce should be canned before it costs Kiwi taxpayers even more money. Kiwi families struggling to make ends meet should not be throwing good money after bad to subsidise a taskforce that is nothing more than a stalking horse for far right ideas.”
