Christchurch deserves best schools possible

**Christchurch deserves best schools possible**

The Labour Party will stand up for Christchurch communities as they come to grips with the Government’s education renewal plan, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.

Labour’s Christchurch MPs have again paid tribute to local schools for keeping students safe during the February 22nd 2011 quake, and for their tireless work since.

“Christchurch schools have played an incredibly important role in our community over the past two years. They’ve been the mainstay of normality for thousands of families struggling to pick up the pieces of their lives,” says Lianne Dalziel.

“Today’s announcement will come as relief to many schools as they will now be able to plan with certainty for the future. But for others that will close or merge the announcement comes as a shock and a major blow.

“This will understandably cause huge anxiety in already stressed communities.

“These school closures are not necessarily associated with quake damage. Some schools that have been left relatively unscathed are to be closed or re-located. People are reeling, and communities are gutted. This is a whole of Christchurch problem.

“But rather than seeing the closures as the end of the line, we will work positively to ensure Christchurch gets the best schools possible for the future.

“The Government’s made its decision, now we have to make it work. We owe it to our kids to ensure their schools can give them a great education – they only get one crack at school, and it has to count.

“As the Labour Leader David Shearer said at the weekend, it is Labour’s vision that our kids should get a world class education at their local school. Labour is committed to working with Christchurch’s schools and local communities to ensure they get just that,” says Lianne Dalziel.
