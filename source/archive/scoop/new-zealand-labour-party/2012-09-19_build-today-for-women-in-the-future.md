19 September 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Build today for women in the future**

Suffrage Day offers a perfect opportunity for the Government to consider the long-term consequences of the growing number of homeless New Zealand women, Labour’s Housing spokesperson Annette King says.

“It is time this Government heeded the warning signs. We know there’s already a shortage of affordable houses and we know there is not enough being built.

“Social agencies are now reporting single women - of any age - are sleeping in cars, couch surfing and in short term boarding houses. They are desperate for housing.

“We should be winding the tape forward right now to plan for affordable housing across the county for the many, many women who are going to need it in the future.

“Today’s 15 year old will be looking down the barrel of poverty when she retires in 50 years’ time if we don’t.

“That same 15 year old will probably live longer, still be paying off her student loan, and be retiring with less than her male counterpart.

“Without change, and without a real housing plan, you have a recipe for poverty for many older women.

“Continuing to look at major issues such as housing in three-year political cycles is short-sighted.

“We need to be looking at the life our teenage girls will live as retirees in 50 years’ time and we need to start building for that now,” said Annette King.
