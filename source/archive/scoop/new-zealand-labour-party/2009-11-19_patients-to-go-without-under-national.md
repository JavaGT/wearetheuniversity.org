Patients to go without under National

Media Statement

Patients to go without under National

Thousands of patients will fail to get treatment under a massive regime of current and impending health sector cutbacks, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“DHBs around the country are already preparing to turn thousands of patients away from Emergency Departments, diabetes programmes are being scrapped, and mental health funding is undergoing cutbacks.

“I agree entirely with the senior doctors who today warned that the National Government programme of cutbacks will not result in savings as more people will end up being admitted to hospital for untreated chronic conditions.

“The Government has already slashed funding and cut health promotion and prevention campaigns aimed at keeping people well and the further planned cutbacks will simply see more people going without having conditions like, the estimated 100,000 New Zealanders who do not know they have diabetes.

“Minister of Health Tony Ryall appears to have forgotten that keeping people well is meant to be the priority for the health sector, not just patching them up when they finally make it to hospital.

“It is absolutely ridiculous that programmes designed to keep people well are being dumped because of the whims of the Minister of Health.

“What is also troubling is that according the Ministry of Health chief Stephen McKernan no money will be put into frontline medical professionals salaries in New Zealand over the coming years.

“New Zealand already has a workforce crisis and cutting funding from important health programmes and failing to recognise the importance of frontline medical professionals will simply drive our doctors and nurses offshore.

“All New Zealanders should be worried by the impending slash and burn approach that the Minister of Health is taking to the health sector,” Ruth Dyson said.
