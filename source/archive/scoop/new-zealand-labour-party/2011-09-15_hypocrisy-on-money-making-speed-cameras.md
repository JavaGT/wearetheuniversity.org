Hypocrisy on money-making speed cameras

**Hypocrisy on money-making speed cameras**

National has been exposed for its hypocrisy on speed camera fines after news that hundreds of thousands more tickets are being issued and it’s collecting more cash than ever from errant drivers, says Labour’s Transport Safety Spokesperson Darien Fenton.

“National MPs slammed the previous government for the number of speed camera tickets being handed out, claiming it was just a cynical “revenue-gathering” exercise and not about safety.

“But it’s been revealed today that under National, the number of infringements last year almost doubled to 627,000. It’s reportedly about 200,000 above the four-year average between 2006 and 2009.

“The number of motorists being snapped has soared under National. Yet in the past, National MPs have complained bitterly about speed camera ticketing.

“This is what Simon Power said in 2006: “Labour’s reputation when it comes to ticketing has been on quantity not quality”. He said speed cameras should be used to encourage people to slow down rather than as merely a tool to fill ticket quotas.

“So why the sudden U-turn? Why does National now think that stinging motorists with 300,000 more fines in a year is going to reduce accident rates, particularly give police say most of the breaches were at the ‘lower end’ of offending?

“The priority should be given to placing cameras in areas where there is a history of speed-related accidents, while the suggestion from AA that signposted speed cameras would do more to improve road safety should also be considered.

“Speed kills and it’s a message that we all need to keep in mind when we are on the roads. But it’s not good enough for this Government to accuse others in the past of being focused on revenue alone when it’s collecting more than ever.”
