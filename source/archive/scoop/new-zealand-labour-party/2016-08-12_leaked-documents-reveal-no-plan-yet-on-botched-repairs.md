Leaked documents reveal no plan yet on botched repairs

Documents leaked to Labour reveal EQC has not yet decided on a plan for dealing with the thousands of fix-up repairs it still has to complete, says Labour’s Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.

“On Wednesday, EQC announced it was cutting hundreds of jobs. Now, the consultation document provided to staff ahead of the job cuts reveals the future of the remediation work is ‘to be determined’.

“EQC lists four possible options for the future of the remediation work – all of which point to a ‘lean structure’ – that means less staff than are currently being used to do the work.

“This raises real questions about how and when the thousands of second time repairs EQC still has to complete will be finished, and whether EQC is putting in the resources needed to get the job done.

“EQC has previously admitted that only half of the thousands of fix-up jobs will be completed by the end of the year. Given that EQC has botched thousands of repairs, you would have thought sorting a plan to fix up their mistakes would have been amongst the first decisions made. Instead, it’s more uncertainty and delay.

“People in Canterbury need a clear timeline and certainty about when these fix-up jobs will be completed so they can move on with their lives. The Government’s decision to slash resources at EQC is already going to mean more delays for people. They mustn’t walk away from the vital job of fixing the mess their botched repairs have caused.

“The Government needs to front up and show people in Canterbury they are committed to getting this right and that they have a plan to make it happen,” Megan Woods says.
