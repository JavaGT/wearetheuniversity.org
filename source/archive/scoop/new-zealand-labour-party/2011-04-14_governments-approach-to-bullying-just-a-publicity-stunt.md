Government’s Approach to Bullying Just a Publicity Stunt

Media Statement

**Government’s Approach to Bullying Just a Publicity Stunt**

The Education Minister’s letter to schools demanding they check their bullying policies and procedures is pointless given her own officials can and do overturn decisions made by Boards of Trustees, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Sue Moroney.

“We have seen this very situation at Parklands School in Motueka. It has been required by the Ministry of Education to re-enrol a student it had excluded after they threatened to kill a teacher and physically harmed other students - despite having followed all the appropriate procedures.

“The Prime Minister’s direction to Anne Tolley to send a letter to schools in response to escalating bullying and physical assaults amounts to a publicity stunt.

“It is a weak response which has not given schools and communities the support they need to deal with this growing problem.

“The Education Minister has stood by, while schools have been criticised for the way they’re dealing with violence and bullying. She then joined in, taking a swipe at schools, egged on by John Key even though she knows schools are at the mercy of the Ministry of Education which can overturn their decisions to exclude students,” said Sue Moroney.
