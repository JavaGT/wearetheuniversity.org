Time for Key to rein in Ryall and Tolley

Prime Minister John Key must ensure his Ministers aren’t over-stepping the mark following concerns from polytechnic bosses over Beehive pressure on wage settlements with staff, Labour’s State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson said today.

“Before some of the pay negotiations were complete, State Services Minister Tony Ryall and Education Minister Anne Tolley summoned polytech CEOs to tell them their preference was for negotiations to result in near zero settlements,” Grant Robertson said.

“This is well outside the legal process for negotiating employment agreements at tertiary institutions and it’s time the Prime Minister took control of Tony Ryall and Anne Tolley.

“The polytech CEOs reportedly felt uneasy about the meeting with the Ministers and rightly so. They have autonomy in this area and the Ministers had no right to apply pressure on the negotiations.”

Grant Robertson said the Cabinet Office Manual also makes it clear Ministers should take care “that they do not inappropriately influence officials, or involve themselves in matters that are not their responsibility.”

“On the face of it, this seems to be exactly what both Ministers have done. Polytech bosses are under enough pressure at the moment with the prospect of financial penalties for exceeding enrolment caps,” Grant Robertson said.

“They should be left to get on with managing their polytechs in the new climate and not being bullied by Ministers who seem to have little respect for the laws and processes around management of tertiary institutions.

“It’s time Tony Ryall and Anne Tolley showed more respect to polytech bosses and did business by the book,” Grant Robertson said.
