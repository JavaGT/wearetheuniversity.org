More than one in 10 Maori now unemployed

  
Unemployment rates for Maori have jumped to 11.9 percent up from 9.8 percent according the Household Labour Force Survey Labour Maori Affairs spokesperson Parekura Horomia says.

“Those figures represent thousands more Maori struggling to support their families and make ends meet.

“More than one in 10 Maori are now unemployed, yet today we have heard nothing from Maori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples about how he intends to turn this around.

“The Minister clearly has no plan to help Maori people who are suffering in increasing numbers from the effects of this recession.

“Rather than worrying about whether to travel to Fiji the Minister needs to have job retention and creation as his number priority.  
“People are genuinely suffering and need to see strong leadership and clear direction from their Government. Unfortunately they are not getting either.  
“National and the Maori Party are not doing enough to protect Kiwi jobs,” Parekura Horomia said.
