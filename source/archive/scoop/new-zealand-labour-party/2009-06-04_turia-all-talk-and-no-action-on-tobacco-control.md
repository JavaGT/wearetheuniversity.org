Turia all talk and no action on tobacco control

Associate Health spokesperson

**Turia all talk and no action on tobacco control**

Confirmation that Associate Health Minister Tariana Turia, who holds the tobacco control delegation, has never provided advice to Tony Ryall on point of sale advertising of cigarettes is appalling, Labour Associate Health Spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says.

“Smoking kills thousands of New Zealanders each year and yet Mrs Turia, has not sought to have the Government action recommendations from the Health Select Committee seeking a ban on point of sale advertising.

“Clearly Mrs Turia is all talk and no action when it comes to tackling this crucial issue.

“In a recent speech Tariana Turia referred to overseas evidence that point of sale bans is having the desired effect of cutting smoking rates amongst teenagers.

“Why then has this Minister failed to provide advice on this matter to her Government colleagues?

“I had thought it was the National Party who was failing to listen to advice on this matter, but clearly it is the Associate Minister who is not advising her Government colleagues.

“Mrs Turia has accepted the Ministerial salary and car, its time she started earning them,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.
