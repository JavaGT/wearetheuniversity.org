Let’s walk and talk Gerry

A pair of walking shoes and a few days is all the Minister of Energy and Resources Gerry Brownlee needs to learn why he should not open up Mt Aspiring National Park to mining, Labour Conservation spokesperson David Parker says.

“I have invited Gerry Brownlee to join me on a tramp of the Mt Aspiring National Park in order to enhance his knowledge of New Zealand’s conservation estate and aid him in the ‘stock-take’ he is currently under taking of mining in the conservation estate,” David Parker said.

“The Minister’s stock-take of New Zealand mineral resources in conservation areas includes the North Eastern parts of Mt Aspiring National Park.

“I have assured Mr Brownlee that all he needs is a pair of walking shoes, I am happy to provide all other tramping gear he requires.

“The Minister is currently spending thousands of dollars on a technical ‘stock-take’ when what he really needs is a willingness to walk and talk.

“The Gillespie Pass Circuit in the Mt Aspiring National Park is one of the most beautiful in the country and it would give the Minister of Energy and Resources first hand knowledge of the area affected by his decision.

“I look forward to hearing from the Minister and hope that I will have the chance to enjoy his company on this four day tramp,” David Parker said.
