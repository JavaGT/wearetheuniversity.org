Government no-show an insult to South Canterbury

Government no-show an insult to South Canterbury

  
The no-show by the Government at a public meeting in Temuka last night was an insult to the local communities, says Labour's Health spokesperson Grant Robertson.

Mr Robertson was the only MP at the meeting, called to discuss the loss of after-hours GP services in Temuka and Geraldine.

"Locals that I spoke to at the meeting are angry that they have lost these important services, and they are looking for leadership to find a solution," Grant Robertson said.

"It is disrespectful - and basic bad manners - that neither the Minister of Health nor any Government MP was there to hear the concerns and provide some much needed support to reinstating the services.

"These communities have been without their after-hours service since the middle of August.

"As has been pointed out this is a disaster waiting to happen. These are rural communities that include both young families and an ageing population. Their need for an accessible and affordable after-hours service is as great as, if not more so than some urban areas.

"At the moment there are no negotiations under way to resolve the issue.

I have urged the District Health Board to get back to good faith negotiations to restore the service. They and the doctors need to show leadership.

"As does the Minister. It is simply not good enough for him to stand on the sidelines. He was happy to trumpet the new after-hours services in Auckland, but was conspicuous by his absence here.

"The people of Temuka and Geraldine deserve better," Grant Robertson said.
