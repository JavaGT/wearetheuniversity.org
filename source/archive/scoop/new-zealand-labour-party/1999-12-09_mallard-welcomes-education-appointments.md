Mallard welcomes education appointments
=======================================

[![Labour
2000 web site](http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg)](http://www.labour.org.nz)Labour MP Trevor Mallard has welcomed confirmation today that he will be the new Minister of Education and the appointment of three associate Ministers to the portfolio.

Prime Minister-elect Helen Clark announced allocations of Ministerial portfolios at a press conference this afternoon.

Trevor Mallard will be Minister of Education, Minister of State Services, and Minister of Sport, Fitness and Leisure. He will also be Associate Finance Minister and have responsibility for the Education Review Office and Adult and Community Education.

Associate Ministers of Education will be Steve Maharey (tertiary); Lianne Dalziel; and Parekura Horomia - who was named today as a Minister outside of Cabinet.

"Steve Maharey has worked on tertiary education for Labour for more than three years now and I am pleased that he will be continuing that role. One of our first jobs within that area will be to implement our policy to stop the interest on student loans for full-time and other low income students," Trevor Mallard said.

"Lianne Dalziel has made a valuable contribution to Labour's education caucus committee over the past three years and in her role as Labour's youth spokesperson was instrumental in ensuring that young people's needs were considered in all aspects of Labour policy.

"Parekura Horomia will have responsibility for Maori education which will be a major focus of the new Government's work in education. I am determined to be part of a Government that makes real progress in closing the gaps in educational achievement and I know that Parekura shares my ambition in that area.

"While we have yet to determine all the allocation of responsibilities within the portfolio, I have already made a commitment to retaining direct responsibility for early childhood education within my own office.

"I want to ensure that early childhood education is an integral part of the education system - not just an add on," Trevor Mallard said.
