target for health cuts 100 or will it keep growing

Hon Ruth Dyson  
Health Spokesperson

Is the target for health cuts 100 or will it keep growing?

Record health spending has not stopped the National Government undertaking a record programme of health cuts, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“100 cuts to frontline services – it’s a staggering figure and means thousands of patients from those using home support services, emergency departments, diabetes and mental health services and smoking cessation are missing out on treatment,” Ruth Dyson said.

“But while cuts to frontline health services have now topped 100, Health Minister Tony Ryall and John Key continue to refer to them as ‘changes’. National’s health strategy is to cut health services and then simply lie about them.

“Today Tony Ryall released figures about health services in New Zealand and claimed they showed that more Kiwis were getting treatment. If only that were true.

“Significant cuts in mental health services are occurring around the country, the increase in elective surgery funding and operations is in part to deal with the thousands of people no longer receiving treatment through ACC and at least $12 million was cut from smoking cessation programmes in the last budget.

“We are seeing a Government that is blatantly misleading New Zealanders about what is happening in the health sector.

“Today in Parliament Health Minister Tony Ryall was asked whether or not Capital and Coast DHB would meet health targets over the next year. Mr Ryall’s answer was to say that CCDHB had received an additional $57 million in funding since he became Minister.

“Questions must then be asked if CCDHB is receiving so much additional money, why has the Chief Executive resigned rather than continuing to cut services?

“The reality is New Zealanders are missing out on home support care, they are being dumped by ACC and forced onto DHB waiting lists and money is being cut from mental health and smoking cessation services.

“New Zealanders need good quality health services, not cuts and half truths,” Ruth Dyson said.
