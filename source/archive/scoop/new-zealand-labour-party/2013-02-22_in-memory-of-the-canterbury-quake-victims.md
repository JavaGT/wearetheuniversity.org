Labour Leader  
22 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**In memory of the Canterbury quake victims**

Labour Leader David Shearer has today joined Cantabrians at a service in Christchurch to mark the second anniversary of the devastating February 22 earthquake.

“At 12.51 today we stand in silence to remember the moment when so many lives were suddenly taken and when the face of the city changed forever.

“We join with the families and friends of those who died to cherish their memory. We also remember the tremendous effort made by emergency services and pay tribute to the solidarity shown by the Canterbury community at such a traumatic time.

“Labour stands alongside Cantabrians today as they mark a tragic moment in their history but also look forward to a future full of promise,” said David Shearer.
