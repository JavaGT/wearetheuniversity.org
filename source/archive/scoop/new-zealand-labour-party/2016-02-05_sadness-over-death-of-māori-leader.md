Sadness over death of Māori leader

The death of Linda Grennell, a former President of the Māori Women’s Welfare League, marks the end of a lifetime of leadership and service to New Zealand, and Labour sends sympathy to her family at this very sad time, Labour Women’s Issues spokesperson, Ruth Dyson says.

“Linda, of Te Runanga o Koukourarata, served as President of the Māori Women’s Welfare League from 2005 – 2008 and was appointed a member of the Whanau Ora Taskforce.

“She had a courageous battle with cancer for many years but even during that difficult time, continued to work for better opportunities for all New Zealanders.

“Linda was a member of the 2005 Māori ‘granny’s’ team that walked the New York marathon, championing exercise and a healthier lifestyle for Māori women.

“She has contributed much to the understanding of the history of Māori in Canterbury, recognising traditional arts and crafts, and fostering pride in Māori culture. Linda was both a friend and colleague, and her death is a huge loss to New Zealand,” Ruth Dyson says.
