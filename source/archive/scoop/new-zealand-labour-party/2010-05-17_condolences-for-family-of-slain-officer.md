Condolences for family of slain officer

**Labour extends condolences to the family of slain Corrections Officer**

Labour Law and Order spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove today extended his and the Labour Party's condolences to the family and friends of a Waikato corrections officer who died today.

"Corrections officers work with some of New Zealand's most violent criminals ensuring that these people are kept safely away from our communities. They do a necessary and often unpleasant job and they do it well," Clayton Cosgrove said.

"In the coming weeks there will be many questions that need to be answered.

"I encourage the Minister of Corrections Judith Collins to engage openly and honestly with the family, the public and corrections organisations to ensure that this incident is fully investigated," Clayton Cosgrove said
