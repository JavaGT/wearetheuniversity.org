**Arts Council Bill disregards ethnic sector  
**

Labour Party associate spokesperson for Ethnic Affairs Dr Ashraf Choudhary is disappointed the Government has not acknowledged Asian and Ethnic representation in its Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Bill.

“It is appalling that the Minister for Arts, Culture and Heritage Chris Finlayson has asked for only the Maori and Pacific Island sector to be involved on the Arts Council Committee,” Dr Choudhary said.

“In response to my query about the lack of ethnic community representation on the Arts Council Committee, National Party list MP Melissa Lee said ‘this bill is not about ethnicity’.

“This is exactly the kind of initiative the Government should be using to improve representation for ethnic people. I am concerned that the ethnic voice is being suffocated by the National Government.

“Since this Government took office the ethnic unemployment rate has soared and migrant workers have a higher risk of being exploited thanks for the ‘fire at will’ law. Also new migrants must now wait two years before they are eligible to receive a student allowance and student loan.

“Now the Government is ignoring the ethnic voice through its internal initiatives. National’s Ethnic MPs are damaging our sector and do not speak on behalf of the community.

“I am calling for Chris Finlayson to make changes to the Arts Council of New Zealand Toi Aotearoa Bill to make to the Arts Council Committee better represent our diverse community,“ Dr Choudhary said.
