### Labour Leader Pays Tribute To Cantabrians’ Courage

Labour Leader Phil Goff says 4 September 2010 has become a defining date for hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders.

“That day changed the lives of so many Kiwis living in Canterbury, and also had an irreversible impact on the outlook and psyche of New Zealanders wherever they live,” said Phil Goff, speaking in Christchurch on the anniversary of the quake.

“The Boxing Day quake and then the deadly quake of 22 February this year destroyed much of Christchurch’s most outstanding heritage architecture, and caused a grievous loss of life.

“It could also have caused a devastating blow to Christchurch’s morale from which the city and region was unable to recover,” Phil Goff said.

“That it hasn’t done so is remarkable in itself, and says an enormous amount for the individual courage and ruggedness of Cantabrians.”

Phil Goff said Canterbury and Christchurch had survived amazing upheaval and trauma, but the process of rebuilding and recovery would take many more years before it was completed.

“We are all thinking of Canterbury today, but the reality is that this region must continue to be in the forefront of our minds and hearts for many years to come.”
