Patients go without under National’s health plans

Patients go without under National’s health plans

Patients are suffering from cuts to frontline health services under National, with elderly missing out on home support and patients losing out on $60 million of elective surgery, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“While Health Minister Tony Ryall plots his wholesale restructure of the health service and increasing bureaucracy, elderly are losing out on home support services that ensure they can remain independent and in their own homes,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Stories like that of 83 year old Jim Chalmers, who has given 30 years service to his community as a volunteer fireman, and is now having his two hours of home help cut - forcing him to clean his shower with his foot are a disgrace.

“Asked in Parliament today to guarantee that people like Jim Chalmers would not miss out on home help Tony Ryall responded, not by saying that he too was appalled by the cut backs, but by denying that cutbacks were taking place.

“The Minister of Health and the National Government are desperately trying to mislead New Zealanders into believing that they are getting better health services under their reign, while in reality the cuts to frontline health services are now numerous and are negatively impacting patients. Kiwis will believe their friends and neighbours and their elderly parents rather than this Government.

“Home support services for elderly around the country are being slashed, thousands of people will miss out on elective surgery under a plan to slash ACC funded surgery by $60 million and thousands of patients are being turned away at Emergency Departments to name just three of the cutbacks.

“Meanwhile the Minister of Health Tony Ryall has been too busy vainly and arrogantly pumping out press statements full of hyperbole to tell New Zealanders the truth about what is happening to their health services.

“The National Party promised patients they would get better, sooner, more convenient health services. But National have cut services, are in the process of creating an entirely new level of bureaucracy and have allowed GP fees to increase,” Ruth Dyson said.
