Inspiring change means more than platitudes

Women’s Affairs Spokesperson

6 March 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT

**Inspiring change means more than platitudes**

Two days out from [International Women’s Day](http://www.unwomen.org.nz/) and three years into the job Women’s Affairs Minister Jo Goodhew has failed to make inroads into many of the most important issues facing Kiwi women, Labour’s Women’s Affairs spokesperson Carol Beaumont says.

Ms Goodhew might claim she is a minister ‘interested in addressing the factors that still hamper women’s success’, yet her own ministry has failed to make any measurable impact in six of the seven markers of success she has laid out for it.

“This government is completely lacking any urgency in dealing with issues that affect thousands of New Zealand women, including low wages, domestic violence, recognition of the needs of families, sexual abuse, and paid parental leave for working mums.

“We used to be world leading on outcomes for women. Now, according to the Minister, being ‘aspirational’ is good enough.

“On matters, such as recognising the value of work done primarily by women on very low wages - caring for our elderly, for instance – Ms Goodhew has not even bothered to advocate on their behalf to her colleagues.

“Labour has made it clear that we will act on these issues. We are committed to real equality, real opportunity, and real choice for all women.
