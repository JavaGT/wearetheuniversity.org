Tolley’s calls essential programmes “hobby” courses

Education Minister Anne Tolley is trying to dismiss the contribution of adult and community education providers as “hobby” courses in order to avoid owning up to the effect of her budget cuts said Labour Tertiary Education Spokesperson, Maryan Street, today.

“Anne Tolley is applying the same shabby sloganeering to adult and community education which the National Party applied to the polytechnic sector when they were in Opposition,” she said. “This time it’s courses in stone mosaics and Moroccan cooking, but the tactic is the same.

“The Risingholme Community Centre in Christchurch which funds numerous community groups to run courses for adults and young people seeking to improve their skills and get back into formal education, may have to close because of the cuts to their funding.

“Which of these groups does Mrs Tolley think runs “hobby” courses : English Language Partners, Stopping Violence Services, the Adult Reading and Assistance Programme or the Christchurch Resettlement Services?,” Maryan Street asked today in Parliament.

“Mrs Tolley has no idea what the impact of her education cuts is going to have on Kiwis trying to improve their skills during a recession. She thinks she can ride on the lazy slogan of ‘hobby’ courses and so avoid criticism of a budget which does not invest in skills where they are needed the most and accessed most easily – in the community,” said Maryan Street.
