Labour supports Parliamentary staff protest

Labour supports Parliamentary staff protest    

  
Labour MPs joined security officers, library staff, reception workers, building maintenance staff, messengers and other administrative staff at a lunchtime rally at Parliament today to show support for their protest against a pay freeze and cuts to their redundancy entitlements.

Associate Labour spokesperson Darien Fenton told the rally that it was unfair that workers were facing pay freezes and bearing the brunt of the government’s pay crackdown in the recession. 

“But it’s even worse that your employer, Parliamentary Services is trying to cut your redundancy entitlements so the workers will be easier and cheaper to sack,” Darien Fenton told those at the rally.

  
Darien Fenton says the action by Parliamentary Service staff emphasises the need to have minimum Redundancy Protection in law so this important security protection cannot be put on the table for clawbacks whenever negotiations occur. 

“Parliamentary staff at the rally supported the campaign for my Redundancy Protection Bill by signing the petition, joining thousands of other workers throughout New Zealand as support for my Members bill builds momentum.”

Labour’s State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson told Parliamentary staff that they did a fantastic job and Labour MPs supported their actions.

“You play a very important role in upholding the democratic institution of Parliament and you deserve the respect of fair pay and fair negotiations,” Grant Robertson said.

Mr Robertson says that Labour MPs will continue to actively support Parliamentary and other Public Service workers who are facing unjustified pay freezes and reductions in working conditions.
