**National’s legacy; false economy**

Posted by [Clare Curran](http://blog.labour.org.nz/author/clare-curran/) on July 21st, 2012

Today at the National Party conference, Steven Joyce [spun the line](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10821125) that his Party was all about jobs and the Opposition was about fairytales.

His own intellectual dishonesty is breathtaking. Neither he, nor any member of his government have ever been able to articulate the source of the Kiwi jobs of the future other than in vague unsubstantiated terms

His government has instead made countless decisions which have cut skilled Kiwi jobs and resulted in the flight overseas of thousands of New Zealanders who should have been plotting their futures in our country not elsewhere.

Perhaps one of the worst things this government has done to demonstrate its disregard for Kiwi jobs, Kiwi skills and Kiwi industry is to use the purchasing power of government to buy trains built in China which do not meet New Zealand standards. In doing this they are responsible for destroying essential skills and ensured that a whole industry has been cut off at the knees.

Since the National Government came to power, 40 locomotives have been purchased by Kiwirail from Chinese company [Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Company](http://blog.labour.org.nz/wiki/Dalian_Locomotive_and_Rolling_Stock_Company) with engines from [MTU](http://blog.labour.org.nz/wiki/MTU_Friedrichshafen).

This follows the [500 Chinese built flat deck wagons](http://blog.labour.org.nz/2012/07/21/nationals-legacy-false-economy/) which have all had to have brake pad replacements before being commissioned for service.

[The Chinese DL locos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_DL_class_locomotive) are the first new diesel-electric locomotives to enter service on the [New Zealand railway network](http://blog.labour.org.nz/wiki/Rail_transport_in_New_Zealand) in 30 years.

But consider this. Kiwirail measures the reliability of locomotives by measuring the mean distance between failures (in kilometres). A failure is commonly a derailment.
