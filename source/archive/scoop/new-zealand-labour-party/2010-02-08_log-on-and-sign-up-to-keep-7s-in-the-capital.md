Labour’s Wellington Central MP Grant Robertson is asking sevens fans to sign his on-line petition to ensure the IRB’s New Zealand leg remains at its natural home, in the capital.

“Tens of thousands of rugby fans have just enjoyed another spectacular weekend in Wellington and the city is a major part of the event’s success,” Grant Robertson said.

“I’m urging Kiwis and fans from outside of New Zealand to sign the petition to keep the sevens in the capital. It’s a chance for them to let the New Zealand Rugby Union know that they want to keep the unique event that is the Wellington sevens going.

“With all due respect to Auckland and Dunedin, neither of them could provide the experience that Wellington puts on for the sevens. Being in the middle of the country makes it easy for all New Zealanders to be part of the sevens experience.

“And although we have no control over it, ‘mother nature’ always plays her part by turning on a great couple of days on sevens weekend.

“By returning every year both players and fans make it clear that the stadium and the infrastructure provided by the city are among the best in the world for the sevens circuit.

“Westpac Stadium has easy access to and from the city and trains, and on Friday afternoon the stadium concourse becomes the world’s largest catwalk.

“The city is committed to supporting the whole experience and Wellingtonians are New Zealand’s best sport fans.

“My petition will be open for two months before it is sent to NZRU Chief Executive Steve Tew,” Grant Robertson said.
