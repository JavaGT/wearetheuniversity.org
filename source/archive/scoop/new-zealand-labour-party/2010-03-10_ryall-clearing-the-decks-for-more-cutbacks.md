Ryall clearing the decks for more cutbacks

With the departure of Director General of Health Stephen McKernan, Tony Ryall appears to be getting ready for even more cutbacks in health, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“Since coming to Government Tony Ryall has overseen a lengthy roll-call of cutbacks in health, not least of which are the reduction in services to 3500 elderly in the Otago and Southland area,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Mr McKernan’s departure leaves Mr Ryall with the opportunity he has been looking for to make even further cutbacks in health without any objection from those in charge.

“Rumours have been rife for months that the newly created health bureaucracy which will be headed by National- Act Government crony Murray Horn was little more than a cost cutting exercise that will not result in new services.

“Since he became Minister, the Ministry of Health has lost its head of IT, head of nursing and now the head of the department has gone. Mr Ryall has sacked the chair of the Otago DHB and made it clear to boards that if they don’t do everything they can, including cutting patient services, to save money then they too are likely to get the sack.

“Mr Ryall confidently campaigned that he would move backroom resources to the frontline. But so far we have seen patients missing out on services, health promotion activities canned and increased unease from the medical community about what is happening.

“Just this week a nurse at Nelson Hospital said ‘the winter will be a nightmare from hell’ because of a decision not to replace staff in order to save money.

“Unfortunately the Minister isn’t listening and is simply getting ready to make more frontline cutbacks,” Ruth Dyson said.
