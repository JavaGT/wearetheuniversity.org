Today four million Kiwis start losing their grip on MRP

As of today all New Zealanders are the rightful owners of Mighty River Power, but National wants to take those rights away from more than four million of them, says Labour’s SOEs spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.

“State assets are owned by all 4,461,311 New Zealanders. National wants to take Mighty River Power from our hands and give it to the few who can afford to buy shares, plus several thousand Australians and foreigners.

“New Zealanders don’t want Mighty River Power sold, they want to keep it in their hands. They must have their voice heard in the referendum.”
