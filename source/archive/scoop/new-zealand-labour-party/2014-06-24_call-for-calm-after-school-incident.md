MP for Māngere

24 June 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT

**Call for calm after school incident**

Mangere MP Su’a William Sio is calling for calm and patience following this morning’s alleged stabbing at Pacific Christian School in South Auckland.

“Our first thoughts are with the victim and with the children and their parents.

“The school will need support and it is hoped that the Ministry of Education’s traumatic incident team is providing help for the students, their families and the teachers.

“It is unfortunate that teachers have to deal with these sorts of incidents. It is of even more concern that the children involved in this instance are primary school pupils.

“However, I would just ask that people hold off from speculation.

“Right now the school is making its students its priority,” Su’a William Sio said.
