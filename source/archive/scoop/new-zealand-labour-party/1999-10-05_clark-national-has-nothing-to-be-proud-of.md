Clark: National has nothing to be proud of
==========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

[![Labour
2000 web site](http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg)](http://www.labour.org.nz)Labour Leader Helen Clark said today that reports that many children have been turning up to school with empty bellies confirm the utter failure of the National Party’s policies.

“The Prime Minister has glibly asserted that ‘New Zealanders…are proud of what we have done.’

“Which New Zealanders is Mrs Shipley talking about? The families mired in poverty and unable to feed their school-age children adequately, as 50 percent and more of their income goes to pay market rentals on state houses?

“What about the tens of thousands of New Zealanders unemployed, or stuck on waiting lists for operations in public hospitals?

“Or was Mrs Shipley referring to the university students who under Mrs Shipley’s government have accumulated a crippling burden of debt?

“Whichever way you look at it, the record of Mrs Shipley and her government stinks.

“Far from being proud of what National has delivered, New Zealanders are demanding a complete change in the direction of economic and social policy. It’s time for a fresh start.

“With Mrs Shipley’s rag tag coalition now limping towards defeat, only Labour is in a position to deliver this change.

“Labour’s policies will reinvigorate the economy and restore a decent level of public services. That’s something we can all be proud of,” Helen Clark said.
