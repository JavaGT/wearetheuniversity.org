Media Statement

  
Education Minister in another world on National Standards

Education Minister Anne Tolley is living in another world when it comes to National Standards, says Labour Associate Education Spokesperson Kelvin Davis.

“Anne Tolley talks as if teachers are opposed to good reporting to parents. They are not, and she needs to stop perpetuating that myth if she is to gain any credibility in education circles.

“The Government’s focus should be on raising student achievement. Anne Tolley’s focus is to badmouth teachers and unions around reporting in a vain bid to earn brownie points with parents,” says Kelvin Davis.

“I challenge Anne Tolley to find one teacher who doesn’t believe parents deserve quality information about their child’s achievement.

“I challenge Anne Tolley to find one teacher who doesn’t believe in high achievement standards.

“And I challenge Anne Tolley to find one teacher who believes the Government provides them with all the conditions and resources they need and deserve to raise achievement to the level they want,” Kelvin Davis says.

“Student learning occurs through excellent teaching. The Minister should be supporting teachers to be the best teachers they can be, which means an investment in their professional knowledge and skills and providing the conditions and resources whereby excellent teachers can weave their magic.

“Anne Tolley is living in another world if she thinks that simply reporting in plain English to parents is going to raise achievement.

“Excellent teaching raises achievement and is essential. Reporting to parents is only a part of the equation,” says Kelvin Davis.
