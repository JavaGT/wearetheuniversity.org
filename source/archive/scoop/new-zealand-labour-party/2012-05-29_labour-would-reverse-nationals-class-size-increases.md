Labour would reverse National’s class size increases

Labour will reverse National’s short-sighted and damaging plan to increase our children’s class sizes when it is elected to Government, says Labour Leader David Shearer.

“There are hundreds of thousands of parents out there working hard and raising their kids the best they can. All they want is a fair deal. They expect the government to play its part in supporting them and giving their children the best start in life at school. They’re not getting that from John Key’s Government.

“Instead National is knowingly undermining the ability of schools to give their students a high-quality education by increasing class sizes. I have never heard of a government arguing in support of increased class sizes as part of improving a child’s learning. It is short-sighted and it will damage our children’s ability to learn.

“Some schools will also now have to decide what classes they will cut as a result of the Government’s action. Those classes may include reading recovery – that helps children who fall behind in their reading – as well as technology, science, art and drama.

“Parents and teachers are deeply worried by the impact this policy will have on their children’s learning. National is ignoring their concerns.

“Education should be a priority. It is fundamental to the health, wellbeing and success of our children and it is a key driver in creating a prosperous and growing economy that benefits us all.

“Labour is committed to investing in education and in our children. It’s as simple as that,” said David Shearer.
