MEDIA STATEMENT

**National’s jobs fail sends youth to Australia**

New analysis shows thousands of young Kiwis are leaving for Australia because of our failed job market, not the lure of the lucky country, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker.

“National claims that the record numbers of Kiwis heading to Australia isn’t their fault, it’s because our neighbours are doing so well. But a close look at the numbers shows that when unemployment gets worse more young Kiwis leave for Australia.

“National keeps making up excuses for the exodus. One day it’s mining in Perth. The next it’s the sun on the Gold Coast. But the truth is clear. It’s the lack of jobs here.

“The Government can’t hide behind Australia’s success anymore. National’s economic mismanagement has left 30,000 young Kiwis without a job. The figures show that what’s sends them offshore, not a desire to become Australian. Over 160,000 Kiwis have left for Australia under National and 40 per cent of them are 18 – 30.

“Every time a job is lost in New Zealand a boarding pass is printed at the airport. This is direct evidence that National is turning Generation Y into Generation OZ.

“National came to office promising they would stop Kiwis waving goodbye to their loved ones. Four years’ on they’ve failed to deliver and record numbers of Kiwis are fleeing in droves.”
