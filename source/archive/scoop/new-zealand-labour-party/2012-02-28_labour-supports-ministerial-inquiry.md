Nanaia  
MAHUTA  
Education Spokesperson  
28 February 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Labour supports Ministerial Inquiry**

Labour supports the Ministerial Inquiry by former Ombudsman Mel Smith into the employment of a convicted sex offender in the education sector, says Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.

“I’m deeply concerned at the news that a convicted sex offender has been working in the education sector. It is imperative that children are taught by people of good character and this incident will upset many teachers who are doing a great job.

“I’m sure today’s revelations will also cause concern among parents and students so it is important that a full investigation takes place.

“If there are systemic issues that need to change in order to prevent issues like this occurring in future then Labour offers its support to work constructively towards a solution.

“There will be many parties that will need to be included in this Ministerial Inquiry and we encourage them to fully co-operate to identify any critical gaps in the system.

“Our children deserve the very best teachers and learning environment in our schools.”
