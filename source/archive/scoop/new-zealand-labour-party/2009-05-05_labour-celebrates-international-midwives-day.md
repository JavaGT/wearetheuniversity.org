Labour celebrates International Midwives Day

The New Zealand Labour Party today acknowledged the work of midwives on International Midwives Day, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

This year’s International Midwives Day theme is based on Millennium Development Goal 5 – to improve maternal health. The theme set by the International Confederation of Midwives is 'The World Needs Midwives Now More Than Ever’.

“The New Zealand midwifery system is a world leader and it’s important to recognise the valuable work of these highly skilled individuals,” Ruth Dyson said.

“The important role midwives play in helping to safely deliver thousands of babies each year should not be underestimated.

“New Zealand is lucky to have so many people dedicated to a career in helping others enjoy the excitement that bringing a new child into this world gives,” Ruth Dyson said
