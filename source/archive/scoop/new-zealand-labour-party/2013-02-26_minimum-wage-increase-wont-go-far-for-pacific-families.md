Minimum wage increase won’t go far for Pacific families

**Minimum wage increase won’t go far for Pacific families**

National’s measly 25 cents an hour increase to the Minimum Wage does not give hope to those on low incomes, says Labour’s Pacific Island Affairs Spokesperson Su’a William Sio.

“Unfortunately for low income earners an extra ten bucks a week -- less tax-- is not going to go far.

“National has again shown only a token interest in lifting wages. It has given up on closing the wage gap with Australia and is abandoning thousands of families to a life of hardship.

“Four out of ten of the Kiwi children living in poverty come from working families. Today’s announcement gives them little relief.

“Struggling workers, especially those in the Pacific community, have embraced the Living Wage campaign because they know it will make a material difference in meeting soaring food, petrol and power bills.

“Labour would lift the minimum wage to $15 an hour immediately. That would put an extra $50 a week in the pockets of full-time minimum wage workers, and make a real difference to their lives.

“We are also getting in behind the campaign for a living wage of $18.40 an hour. That would buy families the basics they need.

“This Government has consistently failed the most vulnerable in our society. For Pacific families this is more of the same,” Su’a William Sio said.
