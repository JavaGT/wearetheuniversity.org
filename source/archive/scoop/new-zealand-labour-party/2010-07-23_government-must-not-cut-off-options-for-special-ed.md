Government must not cut off options for Special Ed

**Government must not cut off options for Special Education  
**

The release of the Education Review Office investigation into special education highlights the folly of the National-Act government's decree that there will be no new money for special education, Grant Robertson Labour Special Education Spokesperson said.

"Additional funding is not the only thing required to create a more inclusive education system, but it is definitely part of the solution,” Grant Robertson said.

“This report shows that it was farcical for Heather Roy to explicitly rule out additional funding when she announced the government's review of special education. There needs to be resources to support the change in the system that everyone recognises is needed.

"I certainly support the importance of better training for all teachers in the area of special education, and for more support for leadership and professional development.

“But on their own these will require additional resourcing, let alone the costs that schools and families face in supporting students to simply be at school.

"The findings of the ERO report match with the experience for many parents and students that I have worked with. While many schools provide a supportive environment for students with high needs, some parents and students struggle to navigate their way through the system, and do not always get appropriate support.

“This places additional pressure on families who are already have enough to deal with.

"We are all now anxiously awaiting the outcome of the Minister's review. There is certainly a need to improve coordination and efficiency, but I hope that the Minister will not use the review as an opportunity to push the ACT party's ideological approach to education, but rather will support positive change, including seeking additional resources where that is needed," Grant Robertson said.
