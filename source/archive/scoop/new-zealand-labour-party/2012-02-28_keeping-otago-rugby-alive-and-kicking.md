**Keeping Otago rugby alive and kicking**

Dunedin Labour MPs Clare Curran and David Clark have swung in behind the beleaguered Otago Rugby Football Union, saying the province has a fine and long rugby tradition.

After over 130 years of supporting rugby in the region, the ORFU announced yesterday that it was unable to manage its debt of over $2.2 million and would apply to the High Court for liquidation on Friday.

“We believe Otago can and should have functioning rugby teams at the highest level,” Clare Curran said.

“The important priorities right now are to ensure that our community supports local clubs, that our kids continue to play rugby and that the clubs continue to function.

“Any moves to develop a rescue package which would ensure Otago has a team competing in this year’s ITM will also have our support,” Clare Curran said.

David Clark said the unexpectedness of yesterday’s announcement would have taken many people by surprise.

“However, hope remains. We note that last year the National Union contributed to a bailout for Rugby Southland,” he said.

Despite the grim news both MPs are committed to supporting the on-going future of rugby in the province and are encouraging the community to do the same.

“Local clubs are hugely important, not only because they keep our kids involved in the sport, but because they act as focal points for our communities,” said Clare Curran.

“The support of the NZRU has been great,” David Clark said. “I would really encourage the community to get involved and help keep both local and bigger events running.”
