Elderly will suffer from cuts to home support

Elderly will suffer from cuts to home support  

Elderly will be the first to suffer from cuts to home support services, Luamanuvao Labour Associate Health Spokesperson Winnie Laban says.

“A number of DHBs including Southland and Otago are considering cutting home support services in an effort to save money and Labour expects more to follow suit.

“These cutbacks will be disastrous for elderly, some of whom rely on these services in order to stay in their own homes and to lead relatively independent lives.

“Tony Ryall promised that he would improve frontline health services, but it has become increasingly clear that the current Government does not see home support services as either frontline or essential.

“A reduction in home support services will leave those people who rely on this essential service vulnerable and with few options for support.

“Elderly deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, not as a drain on resources, which is clearly the message these DHBs and the Minister of Health are sending.

Winnie Laban said financial arguments for reducing home support services were critically flawed.

“Providing support for someone to stay in their own home is always going to be a less expensive option than providing 24 hour a day seven day a week residential accommodation.

“Without home support more elderly will have to look at the option of residential care.

“The elderly deserve more than to have their health compromised because of a call for financial restraint from a Government that promised better health care. Instead all National are delivering are cutbacks and broken promises,” Winnie Laban said.
