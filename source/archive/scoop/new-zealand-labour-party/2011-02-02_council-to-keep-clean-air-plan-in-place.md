**Council to keep clean air plan in place**

“Moving deadlines have not deterred Otago towns from trying to clean up air pollution by 2013 maximizing the health benefits for residents sooner rather than later,” Labour Environment spokesperson Charles Chauvel said today.

“The Government announced they were loosening the timeframes around deadlines to improve air quality in our towns, but some councils have decided they are going to stick to plans created in 2004 to clean up air quality by 2013.

“These plans have been in place since 2004, and councils have gained momentum and support for their implementation. It doesn’t make sense to slow that momentum by shifting the goal posts at such a late stage

“The Governments move to put off the deadline for air quality standards could be fatal for hundreds of New Zealanders who could have been saved from respiratory failure by the proper implementation of the new standards.

“NZIER has found that the delay could lead to 635 avoidable deaths and unnecessary hospital admissions.

“Even the Government acknowledges that the new timetable will slightly reduce the health benefits of the policy.

“Their argument that a delay will save in costs is out weighted by the strain on the health system and the fact it could cost the economy more than one million sick days.

“I would like to congratulate Otago regional councillors and the residents of the many Otago towns for leading the way in cleaning up air standards and encourage many others to stick with their plans to improve their local air standards by 2013.
