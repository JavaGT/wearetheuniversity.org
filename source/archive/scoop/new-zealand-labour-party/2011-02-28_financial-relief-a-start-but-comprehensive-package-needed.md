Financial relief a good start but comprehensive recovery package needed for Canterbury

  

The temporary financial assistance for those caught up in the devastating earthquake is a good start but a comprehensive, flexible recovery package is needed to secure the city's future, says Labour  
Leader Phil Goff.

"We're already seeing true Kiwi spirit and our 'can do' attitude at its best with New Zealanders pulling together and looking after each other in this time of crisis.

"The six week wage and job loss support announced by the Government will help ease the immediate pressure on those affected. But what is needed is a cohesive, comprehensive long-term plan that is flexible and can adjust to peoples' needs as they change from week to week - month to  
month.

  
"The first priority is still very much rescue and recovery. Right across Canterbury, a huge number of people are grieving for the loss of friends, family and work colleagues. There are still a large number of  
people missing and many families are still waiting for the bodies of their loved ones to be brought back to them.

"We also need to look after people's basic needs - providing power, clean water, a working toilet and money to pay for food and fuel.

"Beyond that though, we need a plan to rebuild this beautiful city and its surrounding areas. We need to develop a robust economy that will support its hundreds of thousands of residents into the future.

"New Zealanders have already shown they have the true grit needed to recover from disasters like the one we're experiencing in Canterbury.

"In 1931, Napier was rocked by a devastating quake. Hundreds were killed and injured. But a stunning and vibrant city rose very quickly from the rubble through hard work and the sheer determination of all New Zealanders. The same can happen in Canterbury."
