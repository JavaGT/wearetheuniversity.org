Dalziel Concerned Alcohol Package Will Be Timid

**Dalziel Concerned That Alcohol Law Reform Package Will Be Timid**

Labour's Justice spokesperson Lianne Dalziel is concerned that Simon Power’s soft launch of the alcohol law reform package today indicates there won't be enough in tomorrow's package to meet the demands of the communities that are bearing the brunt of the harm caused by alcohol.

“It sounds to me that the government is planning to tinker with the law rather than make the substantial changes the Law Commission called for,” said Lianne Dalziel.

"This will be very disappointing to the thousands of New Zealanders who submitted to the Law Commission.

“At the same time I announced the Law Commission review as Associate Minister of Justice, I introduced a bill which addresses a number of issues that the Minister has signalled - in particular Local Alcohol Plans that would give communities a say over licensing decisions.

“If the government is only planning minor advances on that Bill then we have to ask why they have kept it languishing at a select committee for over a year instead of amending it and getting on with it.

“Councils could have been setting up local alcohol plans now instead of having to wait for another bill to be drafted.

“The Minister knows that very cheap alcohol readily accessible through supermarkets (wine and beer) and countless liquor outlets (RTDs) is one of the main problems that needs to be confronted and yet there was nothing about price in today's announcements.

“The idea behind the Law Commission review was to give the government robust evidence to support the changes that are needed.

“It sounds like the government is ignoring the evidence just as they have done with their 'ridiculous' position on drink-driving blood alcohol limits.

Lianne Dalziel says tomorrow's announcements should reflect what the Law Commission and communities have asked for. But today's announcements are not very encouraging.
