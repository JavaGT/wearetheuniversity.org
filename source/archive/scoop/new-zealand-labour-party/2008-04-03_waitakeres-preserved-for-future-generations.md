Waitakeres preserved for future generations
===========================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

Hon David Cunliffe  
MP for New Lynn

2 April 2008 Media Statement

Iconic Waitakeres preserved for future generations

  
The Waitakere Ranges Heritage Bill will pass into law following a 61 to 60 vote in Parliament tonight.

New Lynn MP Hon David Cunliffe congratulated the Bill’s sponsor, Lynne Pillay, the MP for Waitakere and said today will go down in Waitakere’s history as a win for Westies, the greater Auckland area and the environment.

“With the passing of this Bill we have preserved a valuable and iconic environment for our future generations. Today makes the hard work of many dedicated people over the last 30 years worthwhile, who have protected the Waitakeres from the effects of subdivision and development and a ‘death by a thousand cuts’.

“The passing of this Bill fulfils the mandate of the citizens and councillors of Waitakere City Council, Rodney District Council, and Auckland Regional Council.

“The Bill would not have passed today without the leadership shown by its sponsor, Lynne Pillay MP, who through the Select Committee process secured the support of a critical mass of support,” said Mr Cunliffe
