Tertiary Education Spokesperson

11 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Minister must step up and support Canterbury University**

The Government needs to stop contradicting itself and give a definitive answer on whether it is committed to the continuation of a broad-based and research-intensive University of Canterbury, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Megan Woods.

“The University has been clear. It needs to know by October whether the Government is going to provide the funding it needs.

“On the one hand we have Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce committing to the [October deadline](http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8535101/Canterbury-Uni-to-run-on-empty-by-next-year) on the proviso that the university submits a business case on time.

“On the other, his colleague Bill English, in Parliament today refused, to commit to that same deadline.  
“It is not business as usual for Canterbury University, nor is this about a nice-to-have cash injection. This is about the university’s survival.

“Canterbury University, its students and the wider community deserve to know where they stand.

“This was a well-performing institution running large surpluses before the quakes. The Government should not be playing games with its future.

“National’s contradictory and hands-off approach in its time of need is doing the people of Christchurch and all New Zealanders a disservice,” Megan Woods said.
