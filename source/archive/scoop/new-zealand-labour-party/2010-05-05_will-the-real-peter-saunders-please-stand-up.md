Will the real Peter Saunders please stand up
============================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

**Will the real Peter Saunders please stand up**  
Social Development Minister Paula Bennett must immediately clear up her embarrassing mistake on the identity of a man she hired for her Welfare Working Group, Labour’s Deputy Leader Annette King says.

“When Paula Bennett announced her Working Group on 13 April she named a Peter Saunders, who after investigation is discovered to hold extreme views including a belief that 'low average intelligence and low class' are linked," Annette King said.

“But last week in the House, Ms Bennett when asked a question from Labour, said the Peter Saunders she hired had written a book entitled ‘Welfare to Work in Practice’. (see below)

“She even told us to read it.”

“This Peter Saunders is a respected Australian academic with expertise in poverty and inequality – a totally different man.

“However, today she has changed tack again and said the man she hired was the other Peter Saunders.

“Once can only hope this mistake does not reflect the standards of procedures and due diligence adopted by Ms Bennett.

“Ms Bennett must sort this embarrassing mess out,” Annette King said.
