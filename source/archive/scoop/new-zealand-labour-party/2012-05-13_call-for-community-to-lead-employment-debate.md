MEDIA STATEMENT

**Call for Community to Lead Employment Debate**

Ensuring a work-family balance – the theme of tomorrow’s UN International Day of Families - requires a community-wide focus on ‘everyone’s right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment’, Labour’s spokesperson on Employment, Pacific Island Affairs and Inter-Faith Dialogue Su’a William Sio, says.  
   
Speaking at church services this weekend Su’a William Sio called on church and community leaders to become involved with the debate on ‘work and family balance’ and to use the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as the foundation to build on.  
   
“It is the community’s responsibility to take ownership of this debate and ensure it is focused on good and productive social and economic outcomes for families, communities and our country,” Su’a William Sio said.  
   
“At the moment the discussion on employment and family balance is being driven by the Government’s political and ideological expediency which is narrowly focused, and extremely negative towards those sectors in our community most in need.  
   
“There are sectors in our community who are struggling to balance the need to find jobs that pay well to support their families, and having enough time to care and protect young or sick members of their families.  
   
“There are people working long hours but who still can’t get ahead because of low wages. Many of them believe the Government isn’t hearing their voices nor listening to their needs.  
   
Quoting Article 23, Su’a William Sio said it was becoming increasingly important to uphold the rights that ‘everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for themselves and his/her family an existence worthy of human dignity’.  
   
 “A key component is the availability – or not - of jobs with incomes that allow workers to look after their families.  
   
“While employment and income support should be at the center of this debate, we also need to be talking about other aspects of people’s lives - their personal circumstances, their quality of life, housing and healthcare needs, the roles of motherhood in caring and protecting our children and income levels needed for this, the growing inequality in communities, and the levels of poverty experienced by many families,” Su’a William Sio said.
