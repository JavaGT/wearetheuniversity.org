**Labour announces Te Atatu candidates**

Labour has announced its list of candidates for the upcoming Te Atatu selection.

Party president Andrew Little says there has been a high level of interest in Te Atatu for some weeks and the Party was always confident there would be a strong contest for the candidacy.

“These are all talented people, and each of them has a depth of experience and skills that would make any of them a good representative for Te Atatu. It won’t be an easy decision for the selection panel,” he said.

The nine nominees are:

• Nick Bakulich, small business owner;  
• Jim Bradshaw, law student;  
• Dr Michael Kidd, barrister;  
• Hamish McCracken, university lecturer;  
• Ann Pala QSM, community advocate;  
• Dr Rajen Prasad, List MP;  
• Greg Presland, local lawyer;  
• Kate Sutton, communications consultant;  
• Phil Twyford, List MP.
