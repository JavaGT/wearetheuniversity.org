Hide must censure out-of-control, bullying Garrett

Hide must censure out-of-control and bullying Garrett

  
ACT leader Rodney Hide must insist that his ill-disciplined MP David Garrett apologises to prison officers who today spoke at a select committee of their misgivings about private prisons, says Labour law and order spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.

“His bullying comments to these officers staggered everyone else on the law and order select committee,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“I don’t know where he thought he was coming from telling these prison officers that they were harming their future job prospects, but I found his comments disgusting. Prison officers do a tough job every day. They deserve better from an MP.

“His comments mirrored the arrogant and benefit-bashing tactics of Social Development Minister Paula Bennett in making public private benefit details of two women who dared to criticise government policy on tertiary student allowances,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“If David Garrett and Paula Bennett represent the face of modern democracy in this country, then we face a tough time over the next two years.

“Rodney Hide has an ill-assorted and maverick group of MPs in his party, and he must have a tough time keeping them in control. But surely it is time for him to suggest to David Garrett that his favourite mantra of three strikes and you’re out might appropriately refer to him as a repeat offender.”
