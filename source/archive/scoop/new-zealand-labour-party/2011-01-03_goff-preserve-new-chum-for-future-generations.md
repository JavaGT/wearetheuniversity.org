Goff - Preserve New Chum for future generations

Labour Leader Phil Goff today called on Prime Minister John Key to match the developers' offer of meeting half the cost of passing ownership of land behind New Chum beach into New Zealand's conservation estate.

"New Chum beach looks much as it did when Kupe arrived in New Zealand. It is one of the last remaining untouched and unspoiled areas of our coastline," Phil Goff said.

"For New Chum to be subdivided into 20 lots and built on would be desecration of a beach described by Lonely Planet and National Geographic as on of the most beautiful beaches in the world," he said.

"We can save New Chum beach in its untouched state for our children, our grandchildren and future generations, and today hundreds of New Zealanders at Matarangi called for that to happen.

"For a small investment, probably around $10million from the Crown, we can protect not only a beautiful heritage area, but also an important icon in New Zealand's branding of being clean, green and 100% pure.

"When National can invest $1.7billion in protecting South Canterbury Finance investors and pay Warner Brothers up To $95million in handouts for Filming the Hobbit in New Zealand, $10million is a small price to pay for protecting such an invaluable asset as New Chum beach," Phil Goff said.
