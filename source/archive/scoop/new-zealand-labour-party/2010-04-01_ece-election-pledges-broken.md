1 April 2010 **Media Statement**

**  
ECE Election Pledges Broken  
  
Education Minister Anne Tolley is preparing the early childhood education sector for cuts in funding that will increase costs to parents, Labour Spokesperson for Early Childhood Education, Sue Moroney says.**

**Notes released today from a meeting between the Early Education Federation and the Minister quoted the Minister as saying ‘there are some tough decisions to be made’ and ‘over the last 5 years there has been a significant shift from parent cost to government cost’.**

**Minister Anne Tolley also confirmed that the Government will not deliver on an election pledge it made to improve staff ratios for under-twos in this term of Government. That work has been pushed out beyond the next election.**

**"The Prime Minister had trumpeted early childhood education as a top priority for his Government but already it is being sidelined by an incompetent Minister who has been completely distracted by her shambolic implementation of national standards," said Sue Moroney.**

**“The Minister's proposal to introduce shorter courses for primary teachers and those with overseas qualifications to achieve an ECE teaching qualification is also on hold.**

**"Anne Tolley has already had tertiary education taken off her - her failure to make progress in early childhood education shows she is struggling with this part of her portfolio too.**

**"Quality education for our young children is a top priority for Labour and we won't stand by while the great progress we made is eroded by incompetency - neither should John Key,” said Sue Moroney.**
