National votes down $15 minimum wage

Media Statement

National votes down $15 minimum wage

Labour MP Darien Fenton’s Minimum Wage and Remuneration Bill was voted down by the National/Act Government in Parliament last night.

The Bill would have brought minimum wage rights to thousands of contractors who are currently without protection because their employment status excludes them from the Minimum Wage Act.

It would also have increased the minimum wage for all workers to $13.00 on 1 July this year, $14.00 on 2 July 2010 and $15.00 in 2011.

“This shows that National has no commitment to the lowest paid workers at a time when we need to be looking out for those most in need in these tough times,” said Ms Fenton.

“It is an opportunity missed and as a result of last night’s vote, contractors will continue to be open to exploitation and paid as little as $4 an hour.

Darien Fenton said she also sought an amendment that would require political parties to sign up to the Minimum Wage Act as a way of demonstrating their commitment to this most basic of rights.

“The National/Act government voted against this as well.”
