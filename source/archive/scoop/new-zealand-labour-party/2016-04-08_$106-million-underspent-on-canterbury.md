$106 million underspent on Canterbury

Anchor projects in the rebuild of Christchurch will be delayed because the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority has underspent it’s budget by $106 million, says Labour’s Canterbury Issues spokesperson Megan Woods.

“Treasury documents (Page 4) published today have revealed this underspend is due to delays in the land acquisition programme. Treasury says this means anchor projects will be delayed until the end of the financial year.

“This is another disaster for the Minister Gerry Brownlee who has spent most of his time attacking Treasury.

“The Minister needs to stop shooting the messenger, take a deep breath and listen to what his own Government officials are telling him.

“We’ve got to get progress in the central city and the Government needs to stop dragging the chain.

“Crown accounts paint a picture of ongoing and imbedded delay -- something needs to change,” says Megan Woods .
