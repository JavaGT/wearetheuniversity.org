**Hide’s hypocrisy stretches from the north to the south**

  
Aucklanders and Cantabrians will be surprised to hear Rodney Hide championing democracy after he has locked them out of their local government, says Labour Spokesperson on Auckland Issues, Phil Twyford and Labour’s Christchurch Central MP, Brendon Burns.

“On Monday, Rodney Hide told New Zealanders that democratic control meant ‘if the community does not like it, the community can sack them’, when just three weeks ago today, Ecan councillors found out Rodney thought democratic control meant if the Minister doesn't like them, the Minister can sack them.

“Rodney Hide also said ‘when you are regulating and controlling natural resources such as water and land, the people responsible should be subject to democratic control’ which contradicts his move to abolish the ability for Cantabrians to vote for their Environment Canterbury councillors”, said Brendon Burns.

“Rodney Hide’s confusing statements around the accountability of Council Controlled Organisations contradict the submission by Local Government NZ to the Auckland governance legislation select committee”, said Phil Twyford.

“Rodney Hide told Aucklanders that CCOs will strongly support local government transparency and accountability in Auckland, but LGNZ points out that under his model Aucklanders can't be ‘sure where accountabilities lies’ making ‘it difficult for citizens and voters to know who to hold accountable for decisions’.

“Mr Hide complained on Monday that half of the Waikato River governance board were not elected, yet in Auckland he is handing over 75% of the city’s operations to unelected boards.

“Rodney Hide’s handling of both the Auckland Super City process and the sacking of the Ecan councillors is a disgrace. Who will be next?” said Phil Twyford and Brendon Burns.
