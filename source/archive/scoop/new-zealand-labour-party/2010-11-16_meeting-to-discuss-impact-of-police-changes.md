Meeting to discuss impact of police changes

**Clare Curran MP to hold community meeting to discuss impact of police changes**

Dunedin South MP Clare Curran says there are mounting concerns around the proposed restructure of Dunedin Police, which could see officers moved out of suburban police stations and into centralised teams.

Following a meeting on Friday with Southern Region Police Chief Bob Burns, Clare Curran said she will be holding a public meeting on 1 December to involve the community in discussions about the changes.

“I am concerned that the only time South Dunedin people will see local police will be when they are racing to an incident. Dunedin needs a police presence on the streets and face-to-face interaction as part of a community.”

The proposed changes are part of a 50-page report delivered to Dunedin's 280 police staff on Thursday 5 November, looking at ways to relocate resources in the metropolitan area.

“My concern is that it could mean South Dunedin, Green Island and North Dunedin stations are being kept open by skeleton staff for the sake of being kept open, not because they will have meaningful functions,“ Clare Curran said.

“I ask are decisions to restructure our police being driven more by cost cutting than by the desire to truly address crime and good policing. I’m not pointing the finger at our local police. They are trying to make the best of things,” Clare Curran said.

“I campaigned on the importance of strong, vibrant, safe communities and I intend to honour that: the recently announced major restructure of the Dunedin police force could jeopardise this.”

According to the Police response to questions from the Law and Order committee in June, eight of New Zealand’s 12 police districts, including Southern (which includes Otago and Southland), will have fewer police by the end of 2011 than in 2009, proving how cynical National’s so-called commitment to law and order has been.

“These figures state that Southern will have 22 fewer police by the end of next year than the number of police staff funded by Labour and in place at the end of the 2008/09 financial year.”

“Yet Southern’s rate of violent offending went up 4.6 percent in 2009, and the government is still stripping 22 police from the district.

“Our police should not be put under pressure to make it look as if they are addressing crime by shuffling around the deck chairs. I hope that's not the case, but I think our community should be reassured that these changes are being proposed for the right reasons.” Clare Curran said.

Southern Region Police Chief Bob Burns has said he, or one of his team will attend the public meeting on 1 December.

“I look forward to further constructive discussions with him,” Clare Curran said.
