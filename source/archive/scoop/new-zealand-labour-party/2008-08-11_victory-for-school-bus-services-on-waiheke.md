Tizard celebrates victory for school bus services on Waiheke

Auckland Central MP Judith Tizard said today she is delighted by a decision from Education Minister Hon Chris Carter that three school bus routes on Waiheke that the Ministry of Education was proposing to axe will be retained for at least two further years.

“I have been talking to the Ministry of Education and the Minister since getting the views from Waiheke schools and parents. I have asked Education Minister Hon Chris Carter to urgently reconsider a Ministry decision to terminate three school bus routes on Waiheke Island from 2009”, said Judith Tizard.

“At a time when families are experiencing pressures from increased living costs and there is not yet a public bus service that could provide transport on an appropriate schedule for students, it is essential that school buses continue to operate on Waiheke.

"Today, Hon Chris Carter has informed me he has instructed the Ministry of Education to delay the decision to terminate bus routes on Waiheke Island for at least two years and continue to work with the Auckland Regional Transport Authority (ARTA) to reach an agreement on more suitable transport solutions for students.

“It is important on these issues that Waiheke residents are not considered just another suburb of Auckland.

“I thank the Minister for his willingness to listen to the concerns of Waiheke families and for his quick action on this issue.
