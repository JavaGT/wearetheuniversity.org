"I am concerned that National and Act hoardings at the top of Western Park and by Victoria Park have been smashed in the last couple of evenings" Judith Tizard said.

"While I am grateful for the support of many people in Auckland Central and for the fact that my hoardings and the Alliance hoardings have not been touched, I do not believe that this is an acceptable or reasonable political action."

Judith Tizard said that she understands how angry many people feel about the damage the Government has done to people in this electorate, but freedom of expression and the right to campaign openly are important too.
