### Labour Selects Dunedin North Candidate

The Labour candidate for Dunedin North in the 2011 General Election is University Warden David Clark.

Announcing the candidacy today, Senior Vice President Moira Coatsworth who chaired the selection said there were three nominees considered for selection to replace retiring Labour MP Hon Pete Hodgson.

Ms Coatsworth says Dunedin North has always been a strong Labour seat but the Party is taking nothing for granted in next year's election.

\"Pete Hodgson has been an outstanding MP for Dunedin North and for the Labour Party and his was always going to be a difficult pair of shoes to fill."

“David will be a great successor for Pete and has the full support of the local Party organisation."

David Clark says he’s privileged to be the Labour Candidate.

“It is a genuine honour to be selected as the Dunedin North Labour candidate to continue Pete Hodgson's work ”

David Clark has been Warden at Selwyn College for three years and serves on the Otago Community Trust.
