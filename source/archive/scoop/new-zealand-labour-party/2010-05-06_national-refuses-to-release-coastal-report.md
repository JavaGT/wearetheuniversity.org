National refuses to release coastal report
==========================================

**National’s refusal to release coastal report undemocratic**

Today’s release of the Board of Inquiry report into the proposed New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement is another example of the frustration caused by the Government applying undemocratic and secretive processes, Labour conservation spokesperson David Parker said.

“There is understandable public concern about the Government’s handling of this report,” David Parker said.

“It should have been released by the Government when it received it. The report and its remedies to current problems are a matter of public interest.

“The Minister of Conservation’s suppression of this report is outrageous and the fact the Government has attempted to block its release under the Official Information Act is completely undemocratic.

“This is part of a pattern of undemocratic behaviour from the Government. So far we have had the bulldozing through of legislation on Auckland, the sacking of Environment Canterbury and significant changes to environmental legislation such as water conservation orders under urgent legislation with no public input.

“There is a pattern where the National Government blatantly disregard democratic processes especially when it suits them to ignore environmental problems,” David Parker said.
