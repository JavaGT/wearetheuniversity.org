Labour’s Davis: Maori Party Needs My Help.

“The Maori Party Education Policy is full of well meaning gesture, but lacks substance, and will not make any difference to Maori educational outcomes.” says former school Principal and Tai Tokerau Labour Party Candidate Kelvin Davis.

“I share the Maori Party’s frustration at many Maori children not achieving their potential, but they almost entirely have no idea as to what is necessary to raise achievement. My track record as a Principal proves I have much to offer Maori education policy formation.”

In seven years as Principal at his previous school educational attainment in at least one curriculum area rocketed from a low of four percent success to over 80% of students achieving above the New Zealand mean.”

“I know what it takes to raise Maori achievement. My track record as a Principal proves that. A huge difference in Maori achievement could be made if the Maori Party was willing to work with the Labour Party.”
