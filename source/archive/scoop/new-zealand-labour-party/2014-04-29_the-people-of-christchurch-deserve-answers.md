Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson

29 April 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT  

**The people of Christchurch deserve answers**

As the city of Christchurch faces its third destructive flood in less than two months its people want answers, says Labour’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“Local residents are feeling really despondent and some are talking about being re-traumatised by the floods.

“It has to be a priority for the Council to now act over some of the suggestions that ratepayers and citizens have made over the past month in public meetings.

“So far the Council has not come back with any feedback on these suggestions.

“Today the Banks Peninsula has been hit by more slips, the Heathcote River has gain burst its banks and over 23 roads are closed.

“People have spent three years battling the aftermath of the earthquakes and they now have to deal with flooding. It is just too much for some people.

“The people of Christchurch need some resolutions.”
