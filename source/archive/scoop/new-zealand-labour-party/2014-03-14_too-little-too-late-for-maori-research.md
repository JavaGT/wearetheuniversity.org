Too little too late for Maori research
======================================

Nanaia  
MAHUTA  
Associate Spokesperson on Innovation, Research and Development

14 March 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT

**Too little too late for Maori research  
**  
The Maori Party has clearly dropped the ball as under their watch Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga will lose research funding beyond 2015, says Labour’s Associate spokesperson on Innovation, Research, and Development Nanaia Mahuta.

“The initial investment in a Maori CORE in 2002 saw Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga grow its research collaborations across many disciplines and strengthen Matauranga Maori.

“Now under this government all that is at risk and the 7 key science challenge criteria designed by Steven Joyce will see Maori research miss out altogether.

“It's an insult to Maori academics and the research fraternity after Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga has strengthened its capacity in the tertiary and research sector.

“It has become apparent that the only knowledge valued by this government is a mono cultural view of science and knowledge. As a nation Labour believes that diversity is a strength to be nurtured not a ball to be dropped.

“I call on the Government and the Maori Party to reverse this decision.”
