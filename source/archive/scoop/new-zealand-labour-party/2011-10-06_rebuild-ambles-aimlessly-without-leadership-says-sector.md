Rebuild ‘ambles aimlessly’ without leadership, says sector

  
A lack of leadership plagues the Christchurch rebuild and landlords and tenants eager to get back into the central city are becoming extremely frustrated, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.

“Real estate company Bayleys has called for one dedicated decision maker--- but the irony is we have that person-- mandated by Parliament, with wartime powers, a $5.5 billion budget, and a government department at their disposal,” Clayton Cosgrove said today.

“That person is Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee.

“Following a forum led by Bayleys last week a tripartite agreement between landlords, tenants and financiers was called for to escape what the sector is calling a ‘chicken and egg scenario’ which is stalling progress.

“Gerry Brownlee has wartime powers to cut through the chaff holding up the rebuild. He holds the pen over CERA’s Chief Executive to ensure the rebuild progresses. Initially we were concerned he would abuse this power. In fairness it appears he hasn’t—my fear now is that he will never use the powers Parliament gave him.

“The sector’s concerns are valid, and serious. The longer the industry is kept waiting the more likely it is they will take their investment elsewhere.

“The truth is the mandate to make the tough decisions is there. It’s fight or flight in Canterbury, and the Minister needs to take swift and decisive action to ensure capital remains in the region,” Clayton Cosgrove said.
