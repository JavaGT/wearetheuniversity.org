Labour welcomes sleepover decision

  
Labour MP Darien Fenton, Associate Labour Spokesperson is welcoming the Employment Court’s ruling that Disability Support workers are working when doing “sleepover” shifts and should be paid at least the hourly adult minimum wage for each such shift.

“This brings certainty to an issue that has been around for many years and further defines what work is and how it is valued,” says Ms Fenton.

“Disability Support workers have enormous responsibility and are vital contributors to improving the lives of disability service users living in the community. The question of whether these workers can be required to be on the employer’s premises for eight hours, available for any disturbance or caring responsibilities without any payment other than a small allowance needed to be sorted.

“This brings New Zealand into line with other countries such as Britain, Europe, Canada and the United States where similar cases have been taken with the same outcome.”

Labour’s Disability spokesperson, Lynne Pillay also welcomed the decision.

“This decision recognises the real value of the work of thousands of workers caring for those with disabilities and other people in vulnerable situations,” she said.
