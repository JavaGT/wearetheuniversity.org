Low quality courses and providers who mislead students are damaging New Zealand's export education industry, and need to be dealt with speedily, says Labour's Tertiary Education spokesperson Grant Robertson.

"I welcome the Government moving to tighten up criteria around the provision by private training establishments of courses for international students,” Grant Robertson said.

“However they need to ensure that they are not just tinkering round the edges. A clear process, with strong regulation, that gives confidence to all students, their families and future employers is necessary.

"Every student, whether domestic or international, who studies in New Zealand has a right to a quality course. It is clear that this is not always happening. While there are some high quality PTEs working with international students, there are others who are not meeting standards and a few who are just ripping people off.

"This is bad for students, but also for the reputation of New Zealand as an education destination,” Grant Robertson said.

”Education is worth many millions of dollars to New Zealand, and the industry needs far better regulation. This ranges from ensuring quality programmes to more specific matters such as regulating how PTEs present themselves in the international market.

"Those legitimate providers I have talked to want to protect the industry and will support the Government in dealing with those not meeting good standards and putting in place a system to avoid problems in the first place. If NZQA is to be given an increased role, it will need a boost in resources and capacity.

"We want to work with the Government to strengthen their proposals to make sure that all students in New Zealand are doing quality courses delivered by reputable institutions." Grant Robertson said.
