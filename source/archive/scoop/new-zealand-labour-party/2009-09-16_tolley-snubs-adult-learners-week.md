Tolley snubs Adult Learners’ Week

Tolley snubs Adult Learners’ Week

  
Anne Tolley’s lack of commitment to adult learning was laid bare in Parliament today when she admitted she’d snubbed three invitations to attend Adult Learners’ Week events, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.

“Events were held around the country to mark Adult Learners’ Week, but the Education Minister, who professes to understand the importance of adult learning, couldn’t be bothered attending even one.

“It’s no wonder she has failed to appreciate the significance of her decision to slash funding for adult and community education night classes around the country next year,” Maryan Street said.

“The decision will mean there will be no night classes whatsoever in the entire Hutt Valley next year. And the PPTA estimates only three of 11 schools in Wellington will offer them.

“It also says an informal survey has revealed a quarter of all schools currently offering the courses will be calling it quits – but believes that figure could yet be much higher,” Maryan Street said.

“Anne Tolley thinks the issue is over – but it isn’t. Thousands of people have protested around the country and will continue to do so. The Government should back down before it’s left with more egg on its face.”
