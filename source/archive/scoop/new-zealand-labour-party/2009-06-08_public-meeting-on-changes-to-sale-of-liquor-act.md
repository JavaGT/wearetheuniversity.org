**Public Meeting on changes to Sale of Liquor Act**  

Wellington Central MP Grant Robertson is hosting a public meeting at 7.30pm on Monday the 15th of June at the New Crossways Community Centre in Mt Victoria to discuss legislation currently before Parliament that will make changes to the Sale of Liquor Act.

Grant will be joined at the meeting by Labour Party Justice Spokesperson Lianne Dalziel and Wellington City Council Social Issues Portfolio Leader Councillor Ngaire Best.

“The changes proposed in the bill have generated quite a lot of comment in the community, both in support and against. This meeting will be an opportunity for members of the public to gain an understanding of what has been proposed, and to give any comments or suggestions about the legislation.” Grant Robertson said.

The main changes proposed in the Bill include:

o The creation of local alcohol plans that will local authorities, after consultation with local communities, to create rules around the sale of alcohol including on opening hours, the location and how many outlets can sell alcohol and other issues.

o Limiting the sale of liquor in any premises smaller than 150 sqm. This will have the affect of preventing many dairies from selling alcohol. While Parliament actually decided against dairies selling alcohol in 1999, the decisions of various licensing authorities have meant that many dairies are now selling alcohol.

o Preventing supermarkets from building liquor stores adjacent to supermarkets that allow them to circumvent the law when it comes to the sale of spirits.

o Increasing the fines and penalties for those who sell alcohol to minors.

o Introducing a zero alcohol limit for those drivers under 20 who do not hold a full license.

“The Bill does not deal with the issue of an age of purchase, the price of alcohol or other issues that are currently being considered by the Law Commission. These are still under discussion, but I am happy to hear from constituents on these matters as well.” Grant Robertson said.
