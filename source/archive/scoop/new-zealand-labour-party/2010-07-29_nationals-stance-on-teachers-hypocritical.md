National's stance on teachers hypocritical
==========================================

**National's stance on teacher development hypocritical**

The National Government has today launched a document asking for feedback on teacher professional development, just months after it cut funding for qualified teaching staff, Labour Early Childhood Education Sue Moroney says.

"Anne Tolley today stated 'the quality of our teaching workforce, and of school leadership, is vital to the success of every student,' however that statement is completely at odds with cutting funding for centres with 100 percent qualified staff who will be forced to let teachers go," Sue Moroney said.

"The rhetoric of the National Party simply doesn't match its actions.

"The National Government has sent a message to teachers already that it does not value their professional qualifications, dedication to their profession or the children they teach, by stating publicly that it is fine for our youngest to be taught by unqualified staff.

"Parents who have concerns about the cuts being made by the National Government should contact New Zealand Educational Institute who are campaigning to have the budget cuts reversed.

"The National Government have not been upfront the impact reducing qualified staff will have on their children. Our youngest deserve the best start for their education and they simply aren't going to get that under National," Sue Moroney said.
