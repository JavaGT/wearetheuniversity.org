Bleak Prospects For Sacked Telecom Workers

**Bleak Prospects For Sacked Telecom Workers**

Hundreds of Telecom workers are set to lose their jobs in another blow to the already weak job market, says Labour’s Communications and IT spokesperson, Clare Curran.

Telecom’s half year earnings report showed an 8.5% dip in revenue, and warned that the company was looking to significantly reduce its head count.

“Hundreds of Telecom workers will lose their jobs. My understanding is they are permanent, high-paid, high-skilled positions. They are exactly the sort of jobs the economy needs more of, not less.

“A question mark hangs over the future of Telecom’s contractors, who number in the thousands.

“My heart goes out to those Telecom workers and their families that are facing an uncertain future.

“Where are these workers going to find new jobs? Unemployment is at 6.9 per cent, and in the last three months of 2012 33,000 people gave up on the labour market altogether. Their prospects are bleak.

“The Telecom job losses come just weeks after New Zealand Post’s Datam, Mainzeal, Summit Wool Spinners and Contact Energy cut lose 400 workers between them.

“Bill English’s economy just continues to haemorrhage jobs, and National’s only response is to reform welfare. The Government has no idea how to get the economy working, and creating jobs. And it is workers and their families that are left to suffer as a result,” says Clare Curran.
