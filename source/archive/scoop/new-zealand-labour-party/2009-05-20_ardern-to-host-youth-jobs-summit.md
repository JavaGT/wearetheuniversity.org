Ardern to host youth jobs summit

The sharp increase in youth unemployment and ways to tackle it will be thrashed out at a youth jobs summit to be hosted by Labour Youth Affairs spokesperson Jacinda Ardern this weekend.

“Young workers are some of the most vulnerable in troubled economic times and the latest unemployment figures are evidence of that,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“In the March quarter unemployment for those aged 15-19 years has risen from 17.9 percent to 19.6 percent. Sadly the news is much worse for those in the 20-24 age group; unemployment has jumped 7.3 percent to 12 percent.

“That’s an extra 10,300 young people who are now without jobs.”

Jacinda Ardern says the focus of Sunday’s youth jobs summit is to look for ways to turn around that trend.

“There is a real need for an open and urgent debate on youth unemployment. The summit will be an opportunity to generate ideas to address this issue of National importance,” Jacinda Ardern said.

Jacinda Ardern says the summit will not be a political forum. Representatives from all political parties represented in Parliament have been invited.

“This summit must spark real solutions to tackle youth unemployment, and because of that I have asked a number of experts to give their thoughts on the problem.

The panel of speakers includes:  
•/Phil O’Reilly, CEO of Business New Zealand  
•/Peter Conway, Secretary of NZ Council of Trade Unions  
•/Michael Goldstein, Deputy Chair, Student Job Search  
•/Jeremy Baker, Executive Director, Industry Training Federation  
•/Benedickte Jensen, Research Director, New Zealand Institute  
•/Ed Moses, Snr Policy Advisor, UK Dept for Children, School and Families
