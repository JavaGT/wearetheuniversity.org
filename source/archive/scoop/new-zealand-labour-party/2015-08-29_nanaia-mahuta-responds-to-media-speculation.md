**Nanaia Mahuta Responds to Media Speculation**

Speculation that Nanaia Mahuta has been selected to succeed her cousin Kiingi Tuheitia as head of the Kiingitanga and Waikato-Tainui is unfounded.

Ms Mahuta has strongly rejected today’s media speculation, labelling the reports as baseless and incorrect.

“This rumour, which seems to be persistent, is completely unfounded. I am not in line to succeed Kiingi Tuheitia. This isn’t a prospect. It is not going to happen,” said Ms Mahuta.

Ms Mahuta said no further comment would be made on the matter.
