Online shoppers deserve protection this Christmas

New Zealanders deserve to have their online shopping covered by the Consumer Guarantees Act this Christmas, says Labour’s Consumer Affairs spokesperson Carol Beaumont.

“Law changes aimed at protecting online shoppers with extended warranties, auction protection and delivery protection have been put on the backburner for no good reason by Consumer Affairs Minister, Craig Foss.

“National promised to pass the Consumer Law Reform Bill early this year, but with less than four months until Christmas, the Minister is using the Government’s ‘busy legislative agenda’ as an excuse to delay the bill.

“Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders shop online every day, but with anomalies in the way online shopping is regulated, many struggle to get fair treatment.

“Labour is supporting calls by Consumer New Zealand to progress this Bill before the silly season. The Bill was introduced way back in April 2011. It has been through Select Committee and only needs to pass its third and final reading.

“This Government has rushed through all sorts of legislation, but remains noticeably lax when it comes to consumer affairs. Consumer protections in the online environment are critical. Currently our law is out of date which creates confusion for consumers.

“It is time Craig Foss took some action in his portfolio and advocated for the rights of consumers before the Christmas shopping season kicks off,” Carol Beaumont said.
