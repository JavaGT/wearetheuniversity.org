Media Statement

Funding for Special Ed only half fixed

Education Minister Anne Tolley’s partial back-track today makes it even more important to continue the campaign against funding cuts for therapists in special schools, Labour Disability Issues Spokesperson Lynne Pillay says.

“Anne Tolley has finally responded to the huge pressure from the families and schools of disabled children to reverse her decision to cut $2.5 million allocated to Occupational and Physical Therapists in special schools and units,” Lynne Pillay said.

“These families and schools must be congratulated for making Anne Tolley front up and face the facts of what these cuts could have meant for Kiwi disabled children.

“Anne Tolley has finally got back in touch with reality and reversed part of her decision. That’s why it is even more important to keep the pressure on, because she has effectively admitted she was wrong in the first place.

“Labour believes all eligible children should receive the funding.

“While I think it’s fantastic for those families with children already in school to continue receiving the support they need at their current school, what happens when they move from primary to secondary school?

“Anne Tolley said many parents have enrolled their children at a particular school because of the additional support they offer. What about the families that intend to enrol their children at those schools for the same reason?

“Under this announcement today, those special schools and special units will not be able to offer the same level of services to future students, only students who are currently enrolled.

“Every child deserves the best start in life and to have the ability to reach their full potential. For disabled children, therapy support in schools is an integral component in achieving this. Kiwi children in the future have been deprived of this right.

“Anne Tolley denying disabled children in the future to get access to therapy they will need to stay in the classroom. We need to hold her to account for this,” Lynne Pillay said.
