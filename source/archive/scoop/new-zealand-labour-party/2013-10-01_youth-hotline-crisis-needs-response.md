Youth hotline crisis needs response

Thousands of calls to crisis lines going unanswered confirms a pre-election promise by the Prime Minister to make youth mental health a priority has been put in the too hard basket, Labour’s Youth Affairs spokesperson Louisa Wall says.

Helplines around the country are struggling to cope with increasing demand for their services, with up to 60 per cent of calls from vulnerable children and young people not being answered.

“Young people are encouraged to ring these hotlines for help and support in times of distress. Many are desperate for someone to listen to them.

“To have their cries for help go answered is tragic.

“Helplines such as What’s Up and Youthline are crucial for young people unable to access other services and are especially valuable for the work they do in preventing potential suicides.

“They are run on enormous goodwill and rely on the hard work of an army of volunteers.

“That they should also have to rely on charitable donations to keep them afloat is a telling indication of where John Key’s priorities lie.

“He has been quick to offer taxpayer bailouts to several of his big business buddies, but seems less than willing to contribute to organisations that are critical to the wellbeing of our young people.

“The government needs to rethink its partnerships with groups such as What's Up and Youthline to ensure all young Kiwis get the help they need.”
