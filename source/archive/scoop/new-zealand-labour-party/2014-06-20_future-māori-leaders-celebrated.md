Future Māori leaders celebrated

  
Last night’s celebration of the 2013/2014 recipients Ngarimu VC and 28th Maori Battalion was a reminder to all who attended the importance of nurturing our future leaders, but also remembering those who laid the foundations for us today to celebrate such occasions, says Labour’s Māori Affairs spokesperson, Nanaia Mahuta.

“In commemoration of Lieutenant Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Ngārimu and the other members of the 28th Māori Battalion whose lives had been lost in World War II, the scholarships award both undergraduate and postgraduate students.

“My colleagues Meka Whaitiri, RinoTirikatene, Louisa Wall, Moana Mackey, Kelvin Davis and I were most impressed by the high calibre of applicants that applied for these prestigious awards.

“It is a proud task reading the applications of the amazing talent of rangatahi who a striving to achieve their goals in their education journey.

“This is what our tupuna fought for - the future of our rangatahi, the future of Aotearoa.

“I am sure all who were present at the awards ceremony would agree, the next generation of rangatahi and young Māori leaders are ready to take up their roles as future leaders.

“The Labour Party congratulates all recipients and their whanau on their huge achievement.

“Tenei te whakamihi kia koutou katoa kua riro nga tohu whakahirahira a Ngarimu VC me Te Roopu rua tekau ma waru.

“Whāia te iti kahurangi, Ki te tūohu koe, me he maunga teitei.

“Ake Ake kia kaha e!”
