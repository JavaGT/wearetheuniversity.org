**Neurosurgery decision a victory for Southerners**

Labour today congratulated the southern communities whose refusal to accept a downgrade of services has resulted in a decision to continue neurosurgery in Dunedin, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“Southerners in their tens of thousands turned out, refusing to accept the National Government’s decision to allow neurosurgical services to be closed in Dunedin. Today’s announcement is a direct result of their protests, petitions and the pressure they placed on the Government,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Since National came into office there have been more than 100 cuts to frontline health services in New Zealand and neurosurgery would almost certainly have joined that list if it had not been for the actions of the southern people and media.

“Health Minister Tony Ryall had taken the coward’s way out by refusing to intervene in the issue. Thankfully the people of the Southern regions displayed a lot more backbone than the Minister,” Ruth Dyson said.
