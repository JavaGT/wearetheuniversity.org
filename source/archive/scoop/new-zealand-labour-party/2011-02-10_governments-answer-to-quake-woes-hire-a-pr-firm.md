**Government’s answer to quake woes: Hire a PR firm**

Nearly six months after the earthquake, the patience and generosity of Canterbury people is almost at an end, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.

“Patience has been sorely tested by the Government’s inability to make meaningful, on-the-ground practical progress in the recovery effort for earthquake victims,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“Now the latest response is to instruct the commission to hire a PR firm.

“While I welcome any advance in regional coordination, the announcement by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Commission that it is employing a coordinator, with virtually no resources, doesn’t go far enough,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“Hiring a PR firm won’t convince earthquake victims the Government is doing a good job. And the appointment of a coordinator needs to be backed with a budget and people on the ground in Christchurch not in Wellington, bringing together the plethora of entities and agencies, including councils, in a practical way to work efficiently and swiftly and to avoid duplication.

“Even now it’s not certain what is going to happen.

“What do the people of Canterbury want? They want the big picture. They want a plan. They want a time frame and a pathway toward getting their life back.

“They have been amazingly generous and patient so far. They know there will be delays and changes. All they are asking for is sustained practical progress.

“The Government promised nearly six months ago it would take charge. That’s what Canterbury people need it to do.”
