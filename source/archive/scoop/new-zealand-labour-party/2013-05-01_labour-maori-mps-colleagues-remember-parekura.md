1 May 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Labour Maori MP’s colleagues remember Parekura**

As Labour whanau gather at Hauiti Marae in Tolaga Bay to mourn and to share memories of Labour’s Rangatira, Parekura Horomia, his Maori Parliamentary Caucus colleagues have been recalling what made his relationship with them so special.

Hon Shane Jones, Northland-based Labour List MP: “_Parekura exemplified Maori leadership. He was a big man with a big heart, someone who lived his values and his passion, using humour and an extraordinary gift of bringing people together to make his point and make his mark.”_

Hon Nanaia Mahuta, MP for Hauraki Waikato: “_During our time together as Cabinet Ministers, Parekura showed deep commitment to advancing Maori development. He understood Maori communities and the need for sustainable solutions to create jobs, and to promote education and training opportunities for rangitahi. He also had a sharp sense of humour that would cut through any forum. He will be missed by many people, as he was truly loved_.”

Moana Mackey, Gisborne-based List MP_: “Parekura was a powerful voice for the people of the East Coast. He saw issues through the lens of Uawa, of Ngati Porou, of a senior public sector manager and as a highly skilled politician. Parekura was a strong advocate for women and I will miss his support and advice. Most of all I'll miss his friendship and wicked sense of humour. It's hard to imagine the East Coast without Parekura. It will be a much lonelier place without him.”_

Louisa Wall, MP for Manurewa: “_Parekura was a beautiful man. He had a heart big enough to embrace everyone and he did this until his last days in the House. His last votes were used to support my Marriage Amendment Bill and the Ngati Whatua o Kaipara, and Waitaha, Settlement Bills. He was a wonderful mentor and leader of Labour’s Maori Caucus. I will miss making cups of tea for him and I will miss his sound advice_.”

Rino Tirikatene, MP for Te Tai Tonga: “_Parekura was my mentor. He gave me his time, his ear and his wise counsel to ease my path into Parliament through the last 18 listening months. It has been an immense privilege to gain from his strength. We will miss him deeply.”_
