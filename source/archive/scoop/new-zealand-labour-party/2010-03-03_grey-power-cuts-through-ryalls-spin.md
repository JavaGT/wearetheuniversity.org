Grey Power cuts through Ryall’s spin

**Grey Power cuts through Ryall’s spin**

Grey Power health spokesperson Dick Start hit the nail on the head when he said that politicians ultimately make the call on the latest cuts to elderly people in Southland and Otago, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson said today.

“Older New Zealanders are cutting through the management-speak of Tony Ryall when he labels 'cuts' as 'changes' and District Health Board staff using language like 'multi-faceted approach' to describe cuts for older people staying at rest homes and cuts in and stand down periods for entry to rest homes,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Two years ago National in opposition campaigned on a slogan ‘Choice Not Chance’ as it wooed older voters, but Mr Stark of Grey Power is calling it as it is - these are cuts on New Zealand's older people.

“That this is happening in Otago and Southland can be no comfort to older people anywhere in New Zealand.

“Just last week Tony Ryall told Parliament that no one will be unsafe or unable to stay in his or her home as a result of these changes.

“I would challenge him to repeat that statement replacing the word 'changes' with 'cuts',” Ruth Dyson said.
