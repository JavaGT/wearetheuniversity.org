PM-elect announces new ministry
===============================

**Thursday, 9 December 1999, 1:11 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

[![Labour
2000 web site](http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg)](http://www.labour.org.nz)Prime Minister-elect Helen Clark today announced the ministerial portfolios for the new Labour-Alliance government, confirming Jim Anderton's appointment as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Development and Michael Cullen's as Finance Minister.

Helen Clark said that the new ministerial team is a skilled and talented team containing a wide range of backgrounds and experience.

"This is the most diverse ministry in New Zealand's history. There are eleven women ministers, four Maori ministers, and New Zealand's first Pacific Island Cabinet minister. Ministers come from a wide range of occupational backgrounds.

The new government's greatest challenge is to promote sustainable economic growth. While the short term forecasts for the economy show it coming back from the recession of 1998/99, a significant transformation needs to occur if New Zealand is to maintain first world living standards in the 21st century. Dr Cullen, Mr Anderton and other ministers with economic-related portfolios have this task as their top priority.

"The whole government will work to support Dover Samuels, the new Minister of Maori Affairs, and his associates, Sandra Lee, Tariana Turia and Parekura Horomia closing the gaps which have developed between Maori and other New Zealanders. Mrs Turia and Mr Horomia are associates in key mainstream portfolios to ensure that spending on Maori needs is effective and appropriate.

"There will be a strong emphasis on conservation and environmental sustainability across the portfolios, including those of fisheries, forestry, and energy.

"Arts and culture are represented in the Cabinet by the Prime Minister, who will be assisted by Judith Tizard. Miss Tizard will also be working on Auckland issues and reporting directly to the Prime Minister in that area.

"The new Labour-Alliance government will provide strong leadership in transforming the economy and providing a new, fresh direction for New Zealand," Helen Clark said.
