Crossways Sale A Huge Disappointment

The news that the Crossways Community Centre has been sold to a private buyer is a huge disappointment and a great loss for the Mt Victoria community, Labour Candidate for Wellington Central, Grant Robertson said today.

“I particularly feel for the people of the Crossways Community Trust who have worked so hard to try to keep the centre in community ownership. The commitment and dedication they have shown on behalf of the Mt Victoria community has been remarkable.” Grant said.

St Andrews on the Terrace Church announced today that Crossways had been sold for $1.3 million to a private buyer who intends to convert the Centre into a private home.

“While a lot of people will be disappointed with the outcome today, what this campaign has shown is that there is a great sense of neigbourhood and community in Mt Victoria. I am hopeful that another site can be found that can provide the space and services that Crossways currently does.”

“I also hope that the Wellington City Council can learn from this experience that there is a desire in our neighbourhoods and communities to have a place where the community can come together. The Council should be supporting local people to help keep and develop these sorts of venues.”

“ For my part I will continue to work with the Crossways Trust, particularly around the important area of ensuring that there is accessible childcare and early childhood education in Mt Victoria. Too much effort has gone in from all parties to let go the enthusiasm and energy that has been created.” , Grant said.

ENDS
