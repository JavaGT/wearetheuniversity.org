Chauvel congratulates former Wellington College Student on essay competition success

  
Thursday, 6 September 2007

Vincent Wylie, the Youth Parliamentarian nominated by Charles Chauvel, the Wellington Regional Labour List MP, has just become runner up in the New Zealand Business and Parliament Trust Essay Competition. Vincent’s essay was titled: “Experiences of a Youth MP.” His essay highlighted how Youth Parliament showed New Zealanders the importance of helping young people to understand how decisions are made, and how young people can be involved in influencing their worlds.”

Chauvel noted the closeness of the judge’s decision: “only one point separated the joint winners from runner-up, a testament to the high quality of entries. I’m also very glad that this year’s competition received a record number of entries. The further opportunity for Youth Parliamentarians to excel provided by the Trust is valuable, and I thank the Trust for it.”

Vincent, formerly of Wellington College, is currently studying at the University of Canterbury, and will receive a $1000 cash price.

“My wholehearted congratulations to Vincent on his achievement,” said Chauvel. He further commented that “Youth Parliament experience gives young people the opportunity to have their views heard by key decision-makers and the general public.”
