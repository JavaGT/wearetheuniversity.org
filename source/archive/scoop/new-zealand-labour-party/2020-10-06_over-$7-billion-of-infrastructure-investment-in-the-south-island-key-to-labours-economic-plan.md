MP for Mt Albert

Finance spokesperson

The Labour Party will continue to build on its strong record of investment in infrastructure in the South Island to create economic stimulus and jobs.

“The impacts of COVID-19 have made it clear that we need a strong platform of infrastructure investment across the country to give regions certainty and to provide a pipeline for jobs across the country,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“A core part of our economic plan to tackle debt and rebuild from COVID-19 is infrastructure.

If re-elected, Labour will continue rolling out more than $7 billion of infrastructure investment in the South Island which will create thousands of direct and indirect jobs in every community in the region.

Our investment begins with shovel ready projects that will roll out over the next 18 months, including:

*   Climate resilience packages in Otago, Southland, West Coast and the Top of the South - $72m

> “Our prudent economic management over the past three years means we have been able to invest significantly in transport projects, schools, water infrastructure and hospitals around the country, tackling on our long-term challenges and rebuilding back better,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“We stand proudly on our record of investment in our regions and will continue to help the South Island thrive,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“As a government we will continue to invest in capital beyond this investment, particularly in health, education and through local government, but our allocated investment to date shows a pipeline of infrastructure investments that we will roll out across the South Island,” Grant Robertson said.

“We’ve managed the books wisely and have historically low interest rates, which makes our much-needed investment in infrastructure both affordable and the right thing to do,” Grant Robertson said.
