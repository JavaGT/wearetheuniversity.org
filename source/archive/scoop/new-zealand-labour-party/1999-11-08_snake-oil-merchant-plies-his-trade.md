Snake oil merchant plies his trade
==================================

**Monday, 8 November 1999, 9:28 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

[![Labour
2000 web site](http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg)](http://www.labour.org.nz)"Winston Peters is like a snake oil merchant - he refuses to tell New Zealanders what he is really trying to sell them," Labour deputy leader Michael Cullen said today.

"Mr Peters' announcement yesterday carefully avoided the real issues. What he needs to clarify is whether or not NZ First would support a budget which contained policies he claims to oppose.

"For example, would Mr Peters support a budget which sought to eliminate free doctors visit for children aged under six years?

"Would Mr Peters support a budget which proposed increases in the costs of tertiary education?

"Would Mr Peters support a budget which continued the process of reducing the married rate of superannuation from 65 to 60 percent of the average, net, ordinary time wage?

"All that yesterday's announcement confirmed was that a vote for NZ First is a vote for confusion.

"Mr Peters is very reluctant to spell out the nature of government his party would support. Presumably that's because his preferred option - National - is so unpalatable to his diminishing band of potential supporters.

"Yet again the message is loud and clear for all New Zealanders. Only casting their party vote for Labour will ensure a stable Labour-led government following different policies from the extreme agenda a National-Act government would adopt," Dr Cullen said.
