**Commitment to Canterbury not in doubt**

All Cantabrians know the passion and effort departing CERA boss Roger Sutton put into the job, Labour’s Canterbury Recovery spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“His decision to resign and choose to spend more time with his family is completely understandable. He will have been under huge stress during the seven week investigation.

“I trust that Roger's skills, commitment and contribution to our region will not be lost as a result of today’s decision. He has been a very real asset to the city,” Ruth Dyson said.
