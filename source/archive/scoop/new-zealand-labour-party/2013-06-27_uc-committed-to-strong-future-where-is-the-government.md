UC committed to strong future – where is the Government?

University of Canterbury committed to strong future – where is the Government?

  
Today’s announcement that the University of Canterbury’s College of Arts will retain all of its current programmes and see only those staff who want to leave made redundant is a huge relief, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Megan Woods.

“I want to congratulate the University for repositioning itself so well in its pursuit of future stability and growth. Today’s draft consultation documents are a result of the hard work and determination of those who wish to see the University succeed.

“Current students, as well as those considering their options for study deserve stability and surety of courses and tutors.

“The Government’s priority should be to ensure that a broad-based research intensive university is positioned at the centre of our recovery. However, what I see is the Government trying to narrow the focus of the University.

“In the initial proposal Canterbury put to the Government – UC Futures – the University sketched out a future rich in research excellence and a commitment to strengthening beyond the University’s pre-earthquake position.

“Canterbury argued that it must build on its strengths in science, technology, engineering, education and social sciences and connect better with the changing needs of business industry and our communities. The Government rejected this plan with clear instructions to focus on science and engineering.

“Of course as we rebuild our province and our economy we need to be strong in science & engineering, but science and engineering cannot succeed within a vacuum. Just look around the world and the strongest technical universities have equally strong arts, social sciences and humanities.

It is time the Government stops trying to dictate what is taught at the University, and gives it the certainty it needs around funding in the long term,” says Megan Woods.
