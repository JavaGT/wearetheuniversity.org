**Ryall confirms amalgamation by stealth**

  
Eight District Health Boards now have joint chairs or deputy chairs in a move to merge boards by stealth, Labour health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“Without any consultation with the community Waitemata, Auckland, MidCentral, Whanganui, West Coast, Canterbury, Hutt Valley and Capital and Coast DHBs have begun the path to amalgamation,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Communities have just held local body elections and Health Minister Tony Ryall should have informed them prior to those elections that boards were about to begin the merging process.

“The National Government and Tony Ryall has totally misled communities.

“Given the Minister’s duplicitous actions I am extremely concerned that the more than 100 health cuts that have already been made under his watch will now pick up pace.

“Despite Mr Ryall’s weasel words in today’s announcement, today’s announcement isn’t about ‘taking the opportunity to refresh leadership’. It’s about increasing health cuts and merging boards without bothering to consult with communities,” Ruth Dyson said.
