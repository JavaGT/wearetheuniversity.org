Don’t blame underpaid teachers for cancelled Newlands camp

**Don’t blame underpaid teachers for cancelled Newlands camp**

The announcement that Newlands College will not be holding its annual camp is disappointing, but teachers should not be blamed, according to Labour List MP based in Ohariu Charles Chauvel.

“It’s sad to see an opportunity for students engaging outside the school being lost as a consequence of the Government’s inability to come to an agreement with the Teachers' union” said Chauvel.

The cancellation is in line with the union request that staff do not work after 5pm until they reach an agreement with the Government on pay.

“The dispute between the PPTA union and the Government has been going on for far too long. The PPTA has made compromises in reaching an agreement and this situation could have been avoided had the Government also played fair.”

“Good parents and teachers put in a fair amount of extra effort for their children all the time. All that teachers are asking for is a fair go on their pay.”
