13 September 2009 Media Statement

What did you learn last week, Mrs Tolley?

As Adult Learners’ Week reached its conclusion, it is timely to ask what Anne Tolley has learned from it, says Labour’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson, Maryan Street.

“The main message emerging from Adult Learners’ Week around the country has been the plea not to cut funding to night classes,” said Maryan Street.

“Up and down the country, from Whakatane to Upper Hutt, Nelson to Auckland and at many points beyond, people have been out in the streets trying to get that message through to National MPs and the Minister of Tertiary Education, Anne Tolley,” she said.

“Learning adults produce learning children. Shutting down this avenue of opportunity for second chance education, literacy and numeracy courses, skills development and social cohesion is an act of vandalism in the education sector.

“For the comparatively small amount of $13 million, Anne Tolley is taking away a century-long tradition, a valuable community function and an opportunity for 220,000 learners every year.

“At a meeting in Upper Hutt on Thursday I learned that as a result of these cuts, there will be no night classes in the whole of the Hutt Valley starting from next year. People cannot afford to self-fund these courses and the schools cannot take the risk of offering them and not being able to break even.

“This decision makes no sense at a time of recession. Surely low-cost, locally delivered, accessible courses is just what we need to encourage young people and older people alike to upskill, gain in confidence and improve their and the country’s prospects,” said Maryan Street.

“On Saturday I went to a huge march in Auckland of people of all ages who were furious about the cuts to night classes. There were no National Party MPs at the rally and march, despite the fact that numerous Cabinet Ministers live in Auckland. If they believe in what they are doing, they should at least have the courage to front up and defend it.

“The Government has been conspicuous by its absence for the whole of Adult Learners’ Week. The Minister has had nothing to say about it. Her refusal to engage with the public on this issue makes me think she has learned nothing.

“There is still time to learn, Mrs Tolley, and reverse this short-sighted decision,” said Maryan Street.
