No Jobs, No Leadership From National

13 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT

**No Jobs, No Leadership From National**

National’s economic failure has been laid bare for all to see in the Salvation Army’s report 'She'll Be Right,’ says Labour's Employment Spokesperson, Su'a William Sio.

“The Salvation Army gives the Government a ‘D’ for its handling of unemployment – and that’s probably on the generous side. Despite promising 170,000 new jobs over four years, National has utterly failed to get the economy creating jobs.

“The latest official statistics are a roll-call of failure for National. There are 53,747 people on the unemployment benefits, 163,000 are unemployed. Maori unemployment is 14.8% and for Pasifika it is 16%.

“National has no idea how to tackle unemployment. I agree with the Salvation Army that it is time for fresh leadership to address this scourge on our communities.

“There is no leadership from John Key and his ministers, just excuses.

“John Key's jokey, blokey she'll be right attitude is self-serving. His Government’s hands-off approach isn’t helping the tens of thousands of Kiwis who desperately want to work but can’t find a job because the jobs just aren’t out there.

“Labour will provide a fresh pair of eyes and a hands-on approach to address employment,” says Su’a William Sio.
