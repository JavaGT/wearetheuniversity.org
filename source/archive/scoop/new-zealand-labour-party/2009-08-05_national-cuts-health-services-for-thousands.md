National cuts health services for thousands
===========================================

Hon Ruth Dyson  
Health Spokesperson

5 August 2009 Media Statement  
National cuts health services for thousands of patients

Health Minister Tony Ryall is approving plans that will see thousands of patients around the country having the services they receive cut, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“Tony Ryall has already signed off on plans put forward by South Canterbury DHB to reduce the number of patients it sees in its Accident and Emergency Department by 5000 a year by turning them away and sending them to GPs.

“South Canterbury DHB’s decision to cut patient services to save money is the latest in a growing list of health organisations cutting back services to meet Tony Ryall’s financial demands.

“Whanganui, South Canterbury, Southland, Otago, Tairawhiti, Taranaki, and MidCentral DHBs have all signalled cuts to patient services.

“Tony Ryall was today challenged seven times to confirm in Parliament that he would not allow cuts to frontline services to proceed. The Minister confirmed he was aware that cuts to frontline services were occurring and refused to rule out further cuts.

“So much for National’s ‘Better, Sooner, More Convenient’ health service John Key and Tony Ryall promised. Instead New Zealanders will be getting fewer services.

“These cuts in regional areas are in addition to those Tony Ryall has himself made, to mental health funding, the nationally funded ‘Lets Get Checked diabetes programme’, tobacco control programmes and cardiovascular programmes.

“In addition earlier this year Tony Ryall signed off on a 6.5 percent increase in GP fees in New Zealand, the largest increase since Primary Health Organisations were introduced.

“National has been quietly cutting frontline health services since coming to office eight months ago and there is much more to come.

“The head of the senior doctors’ union on the weekend expressed concern that the Government’s plan to transfer some hospital services to primary care ‘has serious risks of clinically inappropriate and fiscally questionable transfers’.”

“As more DHBs have their annual plans signed off, more regions can expect to see a reduction in frontline health services.

“The ball is rolling on cuts to patient services and it’s only going to pick up the pace,” Ruth Dyson said.
