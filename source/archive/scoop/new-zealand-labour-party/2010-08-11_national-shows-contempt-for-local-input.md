National Shows Contempt For Local Input

**National Shows Contempt For Local Input On Offshore Drilling Issue  
**

Environment Minister Nick Smith's call for local government to be stripped of the power to regulate offshore oil and gas operations is part of National's agenda to promote open season for offshore exploration, and shows its contempt for local democracy, Labour says.

Environment spokesperson Charles Chauvel and Energy spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta were commenting on Dr Smith's proposal that the Environmental Protection Authority, whose board he will appoint, be given these powers at the expense of local authorities.

"This Minister abolished the democratically-elected Canterbury Regional Council in order to promote National's plans for much bigger and more intensive dairying by making it easier for big farms to be given water,” Charles Chauvel said.

“Now, he wants to promote National's plans for more offshore minerals exploration by taking the power to regulate that activity away from democratically-elected local councils, and giving it to a body whose directors he will hand-pick.

"Territorial local authorities are best-placed to consult with locals about local needs and priorities.  
"Labour agrees with Taranaki District Council resource management director Fred McLay that this activity has been carried out successfully at a local level for many years, and if anything, local powers should be increased, not stripped away."

Energy spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta said Labour is concerned that National intends to allow offshore drilling to occur without proper consultation with community and iwi groups.

“The Government needs to ensure that all parties have an opportunity to be involved in any offshore drilling applications. Communities have a right to have a say on what happens in their region,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

"Labour opposes offshore drilling without adequate safeguards for local environments and local communities, and a guarantee that a fair share of profits from any extraction that ultimately occurs will stay onshore,” Charles Chauvel said

“Nick Smith's proposal will weaken the ability to deliver safeguards, and should be abandoned.”
