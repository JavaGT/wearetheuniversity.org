More uncertainty for arts organisations
=======================================

**More uncertainty for arts organisations  
**

The Government response to arts organisations that have been waiting for funding to keep afloat in this economic climate is an announcement that they will now have to re-apply to Creative New Zealand for one of two new funds, Labour spokesperson for Arts, Culture and Heritage Steve Chadwick said today.

“The review of the Recurrent Funding Programme has simply ended up as a rebranding to an Arts Leadership Investment programme and an Arts Development Investment programme.

“Organisations I have met as I travelled around the country have all wanted certainty. But so far we have seen arts organisations in Otago stripped of their funding and given no certainty for the future.

“Yesterday’s announcement was nicely worded but whether it will have a positive impact on creative endeavours in New Zealand remains to be seen.

“Organisations now have to wait and see if they are lucky enough to be chosen for funding under the new regime, creating increased uncertainty in the sector”, Ms Chadwick said.

“The Minister needs to stop dragging the chain on funding certainty and realise that the Creative sector engages positively communities.

“This should be a time when the sector can thrive given the right support from a caring government. This is like ‘Waiting for Godot’,” said spokesperson Steve Chadwick.
