Another legal highs u-turn from Nats

Labour has once again forced the Government into a u-turn with our animal testing petition of over 40,000 signatures leading to a ban on the tests for legal highs, says Labour’s Animal Welfare spokesperson Trevor Mallard.

“Last Sunday one media advisory from Labour created a massive about-face from National when they decided to withdraw all legal highs from sale, in a pathetic attempt to spike our policy.

“Today National has caved in again. Within hours of Labour announcing its petition to stop animal testing for legal highs had reached 40,000 signatures in just 48 hours, National pulled off its latest u-turn. This morning they announced animal testing will be banned for legal highs.

“Poor old Peter Dunne has been humiliated twice in seven days. Another Government minster struggling.

“This is a great victory for the thousands of New Zealanders who want to stop drug dealers testing highs on animals either here or offshore,” says Trevor Mallard.
