Joyce making work harder for Kiwis, not easier

**Joyce making work harder for Kiwis, not easier**

Steven Joyce is making it harder for New Zealand students to work by relaxing the rules for overseas students who work while studying here, Labour’s Employment spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“It’s costly being a student in New Zealand. Part time work is low paid and hard to come by but most Kiwi students need to work to pay course fees and living costs. Steven Joyce just made that harder with his announcement today.

“Mr Joyce is Employment Minister. He is supposed to improve job prospects for New Zealanders. Instead he is making it easier for international students to work here while studying, which will limit opportunities for Kiwis.

“International students are an important part of the tertiary education sector and we want to encourage them to come here. However the decision to come here should be about the quality of education, not the jobs they can do on the side

“Furthermore their opportunities should not come at the expense of Kiwi students.

“There are big risks involved in this policy. There are already anecdotal examples of people coming into New Zealand using student visas to get under the table work, often for below the minimum wage. This policy could make that situation worse.

“It is good to see today’s announced changes will improve pastoral care and create partnerships with high quality providers. However the acid will now be on NZQA to ensure that institutions using the more flexible arrangements are up to standard.

“Steven Joyce says the changes will bring ‘a net increase of jobs for New Zealanders’. That is highly questionable. International students looking for work and others exploiting the visa rules will reduce the limited number of jobs available, Grant Robertson says.
