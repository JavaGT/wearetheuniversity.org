Questions remain over the Christchurch Regeneration Bill

While Labour will support the Christchurch Regeneration Bill at its first reading, a raft of questions remain, says Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.

“This is an important measure for the city as it marks the first steps back from crisis government to a local led recovery. What is now crucial is that the people of Christchurch have their say through the Select Committee process.

“The people must be heard and Labour will be listening. We need to know exactly what the Bill means by regeneration and just how far the new structure will allow public engagement.

“Labour is also wary of the degree of control by the Minister that remains, and why Christchurch will need this overview for the next five years.

“We also want to see what the checks and balances will be on these extraordinary powers.

“Labour is also concerned that the Bill retains the hugely controversial demolition orders that have been responsible for the wholesale destruction of heritage buildings across Christchurch.

“The biggest question is whether the Christchurch Regeneration Bill will lead to the genuine local - led recovery that the people of Canterbury asked for,” says Megan Woods.
