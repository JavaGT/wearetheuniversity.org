Biosecurity cuts break Nat’s frontline promise

**Biosecurity cuts break National’s frontline promise**

The loss of 54 frontline jobs at MAF Biosecurity makes a lie of National’s promise to protect frontline public service jobs, Labour’s State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson said today.

“National’s promise to cap not cut public sector jobs and move resources from the backroom to the frontline has again been outed as pure political spin,” Grant Robertson said.

“The biosecurity jobs being axed are of officers who protect New Zealand’s primary industry and flora and fauna from serious biological threats. All New Zealanders realise budgets are tight but in times like these vigilance in patrolling our borders is vital.

“State Services Minister Tony Ryall promised frontline jobs would be safe, but that has now been broken. These biosecurity jobs are the kind of frontline positions New Zealand can not afford to lose.

“1500 public sector jobs have now been cut by National since it came to power. MAF Biosecuirty has now joined the ranks of the Tertiary Education Commission, Fisheries, CYFS, and the School Library Service in cutting jobs in the regions as well as big centres. People in areas like Nelson, Napier, Gisborne, Dunedin and Whangarei have seen frontline services cut.

“The Government says the jobs must go because the downturn has seen imports and travel levels drop, but what about when the upturn arrives and the levels rise?

“Do we have a commitment that more staff will be hired, or will fewer staff be stretched covering a much bigger workload?

“It’s becoming accepted that National’s public service promise was nothing more than PR spin and in this latest instance, National is happy to weaken the checks that keep our primary sector safe.” Grant Robertson said.
