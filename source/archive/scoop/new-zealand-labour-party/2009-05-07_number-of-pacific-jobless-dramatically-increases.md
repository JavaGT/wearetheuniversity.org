**Number of Pacific Island workers left jobless dramatically increases**

  
Unemployment rates for New Zealand Pacific Islanders have jumped to 13.1 percent up from 8.7 percent according the Household Labour Force Survey Labour Pacific Affairs spokesperson Luamanuvao Winnie Laban says.

“Those figures represent thousands more Pacific Islanders who will struggle to support their families. But despite this we have seen little if any action from the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs Georgina te Heuheu to help these people,” Winnie Laban said.

“The Minister clearly has no plan to help Pacific Island people who are suffering in increasing numbers from the effects of this recession.

“Quick action and a real plan are now needed to prevent even more Pacific Islanders from losing their jobs.”

“I recently wrote to the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs and asked her what actions have occurred since the jobs Fono she held earlier this year.  
“Her response was that a report has been written and placed on the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs website.

“That report will be cold comfort to the 13.1 percent Pacific Island people who are now without jobs.

“Pacific Island workers like all New Zealanders want certainty and jobs. National is not doing enough to protect them,” Winnie Laban said.
