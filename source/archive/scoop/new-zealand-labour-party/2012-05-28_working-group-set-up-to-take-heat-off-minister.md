MEDIA STATEMENT

**Working Group set up to Take Heat off Minister**

The Government’s sudden creation of ‘working group’ to investigate its plan to increase class sizes is just an attempt to take the heat off itself in light of a massive backlash from parents and teachers, says Labour Leader David Shearer.  
   
“Parents are horrified at the impact the Minister’s decision to increase class sizes will have on their children’s education.   
   
“Letters and emails are flooding into our offices from concerned parents and teachers around the country. No doubt Hekia Parata is getting them too and that’s why she has panicked and set up a smokescreen in the form of a ‘working group’.   
   
“In my own electorate, a couple of schools have told me they’ll lose a number of teachers. This will severely compromise the quality of the education they are able to give their students.  
   
The Minister knew all along that this would be the outcome of her funding changes. She has been driving this policy from the beginning and her attempt today to blame officials for not getting the ‘modelling’ right is nonsense. Setting up a so-called working group won’t change anything either and is just a waste of precious money that could be spent on educating our kids,” said David Shearer.

Labour’s Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta said she had spent much of the weekend fielding calls from angry parents and teachers.  
   
“The Government is ignoring the concerns of teachers and parents. Giving our children a quality education should be a top priority. Kiwi families think it is important and so does Labour. We will invest in education because it will give our children access to the opportunities they need to get ahead.  
   
“Labour opposes the move to bigger classes. We call on the Government to cancel the working group and its policy to increase class sizes,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
