Social Development and Employment Minister Paula Bennett continues to try to hoodwink the public about the number of people on benefits, Labour’s social development spokesperson Annette King says.

“In August, the same month that an additional 53,000 full time jobs were created in Australia, the number of people claiming benefits in New Zealand went up by 2133,” Annette King said.

“There are now 63,910 Kiwis on the unemployment benefit -- up 850 in a month -- and 336,333 on all main benefits.

“But instead of being upfront about the worsening situation or outlining a plan to fix it, Paula Bennett would rather issue dishonest media statements. Kiwis deserve better from their government.

“The latest statement was slipped out on Monday while all eyes were on the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquake.

“In that most recent misleading statement she said 6000 people had come off benefits in August.

“She failed to say however that the number of people that went onto all main benefits during August was more than 8800.

“She needs to put out the real facts so that New Zealanders can judge for themselves how her government is doing.

“Ms Bennett does not make the monthly summary of benefit statistics public. But it is released to the Parliamentary Library. The July and August reports are attached," Annette King said.
