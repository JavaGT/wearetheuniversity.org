Frontline health getting nothing from National
==============================================

**Thursday, 26 March 2009, 5:00 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

Hon Ruth Dyson  
Health Spokesperson

26 March 2009 Media Statement

Frontline health services getting nothing from National

  
Claims from Waikato DHB that it believes it has too many nurses make nonsense of claims from Tony Ryall that he intends to move staff to the frontline.

Labour Party Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson said she was worried that DHBs were being forced to consider cutting services in order to deliver on budgets.

“Patients come first. I find it hard to believe that any DHB could claim to have too many nurses.

“I hope Mr Ryall makes it clear when he visits Waikato DHB tomorrow that he does not expect to see any reduction in nursing numbers.

“Mr Ryall has campaigned hard on telling New Zealanders that he is moving resources to the frontline, yet we have heard from Taranaki, West Coast, Canterbury and Tairawhiti DHBs that services and in one case jobs are under threat.

“Clearly his claim of moving resources to the frontline is nothing more than PR spin and after just four months in government is proving a failure.

“As Minister he has not announced the delivery of a single new service or even explained exactly how he intends to deliver on his priorities.

“All we have had from this Minister is promises and PR spin.

“You are the Minister now Mr Ryall. It’s time to put the press releases and rhetoric away and start delivering,” Ruth Dyson says.
