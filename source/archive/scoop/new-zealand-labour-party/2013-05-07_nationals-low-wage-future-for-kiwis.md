**National’s low wage future for Kiwis**

National is delivering a low wage future to New Zealanders, and has no idea how to help Kiwi families get ahead, says Grant Robertson, Labour’s Employment spokesperson.

The latest Labour Cost Index from Statistics New Zealand shows wages grew by just 1.7 per cent over the year to March. The rate of growth has now fallen for three consecutive quarters.

“Wages are growing at less than half the rate John Key and Bill English promised. In the 2012 Budget wages were forecast to be growing by 3.8 per cent a year by now. The Budget before that predicted growth of more than 4 per cent.

“Over the past 4 years price rises have outstripped wages. People are working harder than ever, but are struggling to make ends meet.

“National keeps promising the brighter future is just around the corner, with more jobs and better pay. But it never happens.

“Labour's plan will make a real difference. We’ll back Kiwi businesses with R&D tax credits to encourage more high-paying jobs.

“We will bring down power bills, build affordable housing and create thousands of jobs in the process. And we’ll champion a living wage, so that people doing a honest day’s work take home a decent pay packet.

“That’s what New Zealand needs – a government that creates opportunities and backs hardworking Kiwis to the hilt,” says Grant Robertson.
