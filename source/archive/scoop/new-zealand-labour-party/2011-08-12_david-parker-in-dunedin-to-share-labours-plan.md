David Parker In Dunedin To Share Labour’s Plan For A Fairer Economy

David Parker is in Dunedin this Friday to share Labour’s bold plan for New Zealand, to introduce a fairer tax system, stop our valuable assets being flogged off overseas and grow the economy. David Clark, Labour candidate for Dunedin North says voters will have the opportunity to hear Labour’s economic policy direct from Economic Development and Associate Finance Spokesperson David Parker.

“We are delighted to host David Parker, one of Labour’s leading economic thinkers, and a well known Dunedin figure. “David Parker will outline Labour’s policy initiatives to ease the burden on low and middle income families, introduce a fairer tax system, including a Capital Gains Tax, pay off national debt and secure a prosperous future for all New Zealanders.

“On Friday, David Parker will be in Dunedin meeting workers at Cerebos Greggs, students and business groups, among others.

“As part of the Vote Chat 2011 series, David Parker will be interviewed in front of a public audience by Dr Bryce Edwards of the University of Otago Politics Department, at midday in Archway 4. Members of the public are welcome to attend this free event.

“This week Labour confirmed David Parker will contest the Epsom seat, giving voters in the Auckland electorate a clear alternative to the divisive and outdated policies of the Don Brash-led Act Party,” says David Clark, Labour candidate for Dunedin North.

David Parker is Labour’s Spokesperson for Economic Development, Associate Finance Spokesperson, Spokesperson for Energy and Shadow Attorney-General.
