National’s public service cap just PR spin

National’s public service cap just PR spin

  
The cuts to the public service already made by National make a mockery of the announcement today of a cap on the core public service, Labour’s State Services Spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“When it comes to the public service, National is simply making it up as it goes along. We already know there are job cuts at the State Services Commission, Tertiary Education Commission, and Ministry for Environment and the National Library. This policy is an absurd public relations exercise.”

“This announcement, combined with the 10% cuts being forced on departments by National, show that while the policy might represent a maximum number of public servants, it certainly does not create a minimum. More cuts are on the way. Once again National is set to gut the public service as it did in the 1990s.”

“The government’s own advisors have highlighted the absurdity of National’s policy. In Cabinet papers released today they have admitted that there is no way of accurately classifying frontline and backroom staff. In the end National are reduced to making this distinction based on what people are called, rather than what they actually do. That is crazy.”

“While Mr Ryall is trumpeting the exemption for corrections officers, CYFS and Work and Income Staff, his papers reveal that this is only a temporary measure. Once the recession is over, it seems we will see Social Workers spending time on administration, rather than on supporting families in need.

“John Key said his number one priority is jobs. His government is responsible for cutting jobs in the public sector, and he is clearly giving public servants the message that they are second class citizens for his government.”

“It’s difficult to take Mr Ryall seriously when he calls for cuts in communications staff. His party massively increased the salaries paid to its press secretaries, with nearly 30 press secretaries and ministerial advisors sitting in ministers offices being paid more than $110,000.

“National has approached its policy to public services on the basis of cuts in spending, rather than on providing the services that New Zealanders need and deserve. This approach is short-sighted, and it is ordinary New Zealanders who will suffer in the long run.
