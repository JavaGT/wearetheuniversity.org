**Chauvel congratulates Amesbury School appointment**

Labour List MP based in the Ohariu electorate Charles Chauvel is pleased with this week’s announcement of Dr Lesley Mumby as the first Principal for the new Primary School in Churton Park.

"My congratulations to the members of the Establishment Board, who have worked diligently in the interest of providing quality education within their own community" said Chauvel.

"I am certain that they have made a wise decision, and I wish Dr Mumby well when she takes on the new assignment".

The school is expected to open in 2012, and the tests at the school site are currently being carried out as part of the design process to locate ideal locations to place the new school buildings.

"Churton Park is one of the largest suburbs in the Ohariu electorate, and this week’s announcement is a reminder that the suburb is getting the attention it deserves as a growing suburb".

According to the Ministry of Education, 600 additional primary school aged student places will be required by 2021.
