Drip feed approach is too slow

February 2009 Media Statement  
Drip feed approach is too slow

  
More evidence has emerged that National is off target with its approach to dealing with the economic downturn, Labour Leader Phil Goff said today.

“A survey of international business has found that in these difficult times the main concern for New Zealand firms is a large drop off in demand,” Phil Goff said.

The survey by accounting and business advisory company Grant Thornton has found reducing regulations and bureaucracy rank well below concerns over falling demand for goods and services.

Its report claims “the Government should have been bolder and followed the lead of Australia with a more extensive support package for small businesses”.

This follows the opinion of respected business commentator Brian Gaynor, who in the New Zealand Herald claimed history has shown ”the big and bold approach has brought the best results”.

Mr Gaynor also said “the Australian Government’s approach to the current downturn makes our response to the economic crisis look extremely cautious and conservative”.

“National’s tinkering with small business and infrastructure has been ignoring the real concerns of New Zealand businesses,” Phil Goff said.

“They want more customers through their doors, more orders to fill and more work for their employees. National’s small but useful measures announced to date will help, but won’t save businesses that are feeling the pinch and face laying off workers, or worse, closing down.

“Figures released today show manufacturing is down and food prices are up. Treasury forecasts more than a thousand New Zealanders a week will lose their jobs. Every New Zealander is feeling the effects of the slowdown.

“Labour renews its call to deal with any party to work constructively towards finding ways to protect New Zealand jobs and businesses.

“National’s business as usual approach is going to cost thousands of New Zealanders their livelihoods, it’s time John Key realised that and changed tack,” Phil Goff said.
