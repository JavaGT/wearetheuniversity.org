**Cantabrians need a plan for the future**

While there is merit in highlighting Canterbury’s progress, Earthquake Minister Gerry Brownlee’s time would be better spent planning the days ahead, rather than chalking up his supposed achievements, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.

“It is valuable to highlight the events of the last 1000 days, but a government with vision would talk about its plans for the future, rather than romanticise the past.

“The people of Canterbury have been blunt – they want information and a comprehensive plan for their city.

“[Analysis](http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/the-rebuild/8737195/How-far-have-we-come-since-Sept-2010) of EQC building claims, roading repairs, and pay-outs paints a grim picture of progress. In many areas completion rates are below 50 per cent.

“No measure can account for the stress and strain Cantabrians are under. Communities need a plan they can bank on. The stress of facing another winter without heating, without a settlement, without consultation and without transparency is demoralising.

“Gerry Brownlee needs to stop looking back and start looking forward. He must develop a comprehensive, transparent, consultative and thought-out plan for the future,” Lianne Dalziel said.
