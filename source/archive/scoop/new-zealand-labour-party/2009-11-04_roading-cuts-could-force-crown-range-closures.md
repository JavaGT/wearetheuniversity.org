National’s roading cuts could force Crown Range closures

Tourism operators in central Otago should be very concerned at the possibility of the Crown Range Road being closed for long periods next winter because of the Government’s cuts to local road maintenance funding, Labour’s Transport spokesperson Darren Hughes said today.

“Reports suggest the Queenstown Lakes Council is heading for a major budget blowout for maintaining the vital tourist route which links Queenstown and Wanaka,” Darren Hughes said.

“The council is facing the blowout because National has taken the axe to local road maintenance funding to feed Transport Minister Steven Joyce’s hunger for major roading projects in the main centres.

“Local businesses rely on the Crown Range Road to be open to ferry goods and allow tourists to enjoy Central Otago. It’s essential to the local economy that it’s kept safe and open when conditions allow.”

Darren Hughes said the funding for keeping provincial roads safe is a shambles.

“National’s new approach is to starve provincial councils of funding necessary to keep regional roads safe. Councils want to keep roads safe - who’s going to pay for it?” Darren Hughes said.

“In the case of the Crown Range Road, the costs are likely to be shunted back on hardworking Kiwis who are already struggling to make ends meet or tourists.

“I wonder what Tourism Minister and Prime Minister John Key thinks of that?

“Tourism operators have already voiced concern about the effects long closures of the Crown Range Road would do to business.

“John Key gave the tourism industry an extra $20 million this week to market New Zealand to tourists, but what’s the point if they can’t get around when they get here?

“Steven Joyce must start listening to the councils and businesses around the country that are now facing major challenges because of National’s budget cuts for road maintenance.

“We should not be getting to the stage where a crucial tourist route is placed in doubt because the local council can’t afford to keep it safe,” Darren Hughes said.
