Too little too late for Special Education

**Too little too late for Special Education**

The long waited government’s response to the Special Education review fails to address the real challenges facing students in Special Education said Lynne Pillay, Labour Spokesperson for Disability Issues.

“The government has confirmed that there will be no further funding as a result of the Review when clearly more funding is needed – a consistent message from students, parents, teachers and therapists.

“Rodney Hide claims that more funding isn’t necessarily needed rather a positive attitude. If the Minister visited kids in Special Needs Units he would see an abundance of positive attitude.

“Over 1,500 petition for the government to reinstate a mere $2.5 million to fund physical and occupational therapy in schools to our most vulnerable children. But the government ignored them.

“This National government has failed these children and to claim it’s all about attitude adds insult to injury, said Lynne Pillay.
