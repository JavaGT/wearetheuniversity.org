**Tax man reaping little in return for extra spending**

The National Government has more than doubled the amount it spends chasing tax debt but the level of outstanding tax remains at a near record high, Labour MP Stuart Nash says.

“Answers to written questions from Labour show the Inland Revenue is now spending $90 million a year chasing tax debt, up from $38 million in 2009.

“However, the amount of tax outstanding for the past financial year is $5.03 billion – second only to 2012 when $5.06 billion was owed.

“The Inland Revenue spends $90 million chasing debt but has no process and makes no effort to return the $750 million it currently holds in overpaid taxes.

“The irony is that the IRD is using substantial unclaimed taxes to fund tax collection of those who aren’t paying. Surely, the right thing to do is put as much effort into returning overpaid taxes as they put into chasing those who haven’t paid.

“This is also a department that spent over $59 million on consultants and contractors last year; or $285 million since National came to office. That included $31 million on consultants and contractors for ‘specialist advice and project management’. It also spent a further $2.2m on property advice and $2.2m on human resources and change management services.

“Let’s hope this pricey change management advice included advising Revenue Minister Todd McLay about the type of proactive tax services New Zealanders would like to see.

“That includes developing a process to give money back as well as collect it and putting a cap on the outrageous consultants bills being racked up by his Ministry, Stuart Nash says.

The growth of the debt portfolio in 2008/09 is affected by historical factors such as the effects of rising revenue, coupled with consistent increases in the customer base. However, with the economic recession, there are a number of new influences including:

• financial pressure on customers available funds which force them to prioritise payment obligations  
• increases in bankruptcy, liquidation and receivership cases  
• our focus on investigating avoidance schemes, which generally results in increases in deferred debt while legal action is being completed

Question: What is the total amount of money the IRD is holding in uncollected tax refunds?

Portfolio: Revenue

Minister: Hon Todd McClay

Date Lodged:13/11/2014

Answer Text: Personal tax refunds can be claimed for the current tax year, and up to four prior years. For the 2012/13 tax year, the aggregate unclaimed (but still claimable) refund amount is approximately $750 million. This figure will change as each filing season progresses, returns are progressively filed, and prior years are no longer accessible.
