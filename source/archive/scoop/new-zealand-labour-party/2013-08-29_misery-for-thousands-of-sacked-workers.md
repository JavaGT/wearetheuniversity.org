Misery for thousands of sacked workers

Misery for thousands of sacked workers

More than 11200 workers dismissed under National’s 90-day trial law will struggle to find another job because their employment record will show they’ve been sacked, says Darien Fenton, Labour’s spokesperson on labour issues.

“Most employers seek some kind of reference to previous job experience, but workers sacked under the 90-day trial period will not be able to defend themselves because they can be fired without a reason having to be given.

“Being sacked without reason or process is a devastating experience, particularly for younger or more vulnerable workers often in their first job.

“It shatters their confidence and causes them financial hardship but few of their stories hit the headlines because there is no way for a worker to challenge an employers’ decision.

“The Government has never been able to include workers in its surveys on how the trial period is working because they are not on any records. The only evidence they have collected comes from an employer’s perspective.

“Sadly, things are going to get worse for workers with the Government’s planned employment law changes which will exacerbate the ‘take it or leave it’ culture that has developed in New Zealand workplaces today,” Darien Fenton says.
