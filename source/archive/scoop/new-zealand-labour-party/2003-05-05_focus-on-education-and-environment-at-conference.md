Focus On Education and Environment at Labour Conference

Princes Street Branch (Auckland University) of the New Zealand Labour Party

The raft of policy ideas on education and the environment at the recent Auckland Regional conference of the Labour Party was welcome by the chair of the Auckland University Branch Tristan Rossiter-Sheehy

"I am pleased to see that the Labour party is keen to protect the future of all New Zealanders." He said.

Of the 143 remits proposed at the conference 28 were on education including remits on civics in schools, remedial reading and Treaty of Waitangi education.

18 were on the environment and included ideas on retailers being responsible for their packaging, new reserves, cleaner fuels and waste reduction incentives.

"While we have a long way to go before these ideas are government policy but I believe this shows that we are the party of ideas and can be relied on to look out for the best interests of New Zealand, now and in the future." Rossiter-Sheehy said.

All of the remits from this conference will be forwarded to the Policy Council before being put to the National Conference at the end of this year
