PM fails to answer basic questions on economy
=============================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

Hon David Cunliffe  
Finance spokesperson

22 March 2009 Media Statement  
Prime Minister fails to answer basic questions on the economy

  
Prime Minister John Key seemed stumped by the most basic questions on jobs today – unable to say how many are being cut by government or retained by the 9 day fortnight Labour Finance Spokesperson David Cunliffe said.

“The Prime Minister told TVNZ today that ‘anecdotally’ he had heard ‘one or two’ employers might be interested in signing up to the nine day fortnight, a far cry from the hundred thousand predicted at the jobs summit

“Labour supports a strong focus on jobs. So it is disappointing that the Prime Minister cannot provide basic information about major initiatives such as the 9 day fortnight and the impact of public sector cuts

Mr Cunliffe was also disappointed that John Key confirmed that he had changed his stance from reducing government contributions to the Superfund and was now looking at suspending these altogether.

“It is simply poor economics to have a government failing to contribute to the Superfund when we have an increasingly ageing population.

“Suspending payments today will harm New Zealanders in the long run and put an unfair burden on our kids.

“The Prime Minister said today he would borrow $40 billion over the next three years, but so far we have seen little evidence of a plan to see this invested in high value programmes that create jobs and promote economic growth.

“Clearly National has borrowed billions to pay for useless tax cuts for the rich, ideology has its price – one that all New Zealanders will be paying for down the track.

“Labour will support initiatives to save jobs and promote economic growth; unfortunately we have seen little in the way of a plan to promote either of these.
