Youth job initiatives ok, but too timid

Today’s jobs and training package for young people is a step in the right direction but is not ambitious enough, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street and Youth Affairs spokesperson Jacinda Ardern said today.

“Labour has been calling for the Government to do more and welcomes today’s announcement as a good start. But in reality, it only scratches the surface of the growing youth unemployment problem,” Maryan Street said.

“The number of places to be provided falls well short of what is required.

“Up to 9000 young people will be the lucky ones to get jobs out of this package – for six months, which leaves the other around 49,000 people unemployed in the 16-24 age group in the same position they are in now. And this number is set to grow,” Maryan Street and Jacinda Arden said.

“The package also provides scant detail in terms of industry training and has a short term look to it. For example, there is no mention of apprenticeships, and it is not clear whether the new places in tertiary training will be in addition to the present numbers,” Maryan Street said.

“New Zealand cannot afford to have a timid approach to training and skills development when our international competitors are investing much more heavily in this area. Otherwise we will be left on the starting line when growth returns to the world economy.

Youth Affairs spokesperson Jacinda Ardern said: “Any initiative that creates opportunities for young people is to be welcomed, but several of these programmes are for six months only.

“The Government has acknowledged that jobs losses will continue to mount for two years more at least. Why not signal now that is it has a comprehensive plan not only to get us through the recession but to position us strongly for when it ends?”
