Arrogant Banks shows contempt for democratic process

**Arrogant Banks shows contempt for democratic process**

John Banks has shown complete contempt for the democratic process by appointing the Board to oversee the establishment of Charter Schools before the Education Select Committee has even reported back to Parliament, says Chris Hipkins, Labour’s Education spokesperson.

“There were more than 2,000 public submissions on Charter Schools – and they were overwhelmingly opposed.

“The committee only finished hearing submissions yesterday, but clearly John Banks and the Government weren’t listening. National and Act have arrogantly ploughed ahead, and to hell with the thousands who took the time to make a submission.

“New Zealanders don’t want to see schools set up as profit making businesses. And they certainly don’t want to see Government funding used for schools that employ unqualified teachers, and don’t have to teach to the New Zealand curriculum.

“The Board announced today by John Banks makes it crystal clear that the Government’s real aim is the commercialisation of the school system – not lifting student achievement.

“National and Act are obsessed with the idea that competition will somehow improve educational outcomes. Even the Treasury doesn’t believe that.

“The Government should be focused on making sure that every school is world-class, instead of wasting its time and effort on the ideological experiment of Charter Schools,” says Chris Hipkins.
