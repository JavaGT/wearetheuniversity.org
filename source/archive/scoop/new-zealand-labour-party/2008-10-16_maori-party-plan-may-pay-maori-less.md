Maori Party Plan May Pay Maori Less
===================================

Maori Party Plan May Pay Maori Less

“I hate the thought of any Maori being unemployed” says Labour's Te Tai Tokerau Candidate, Kelvin Davis, “but making Maori work for the dole is a poorly conceived idea and is more gesture than substance.”

“There are just five thousand people who have been on the dole for more than 12 months. During the last National government's time that figure was 100,000. With the recent announcement to bring forward infrastructure construction, further jobs will be created. Labour knows that the best form of social support is a job.

The problem for Maori is less about finding work, and more about gaining the skills to take advantage of the work that is out there. Labour's policy announcements to provide training to those made redundant and, those in work but looking to upskill or retrain, will help Maori immensely.

“If the Maori Party were to have their way and unemployed Maori were made to work for the dole, it could well undercut the labour market and push down wages for those Maori already in jobs.”

“A bit more depth of thought needs to go into their policy. Their work for the dole idea may hurt more Maori than it will help.”
