Budget takes Women Backwards

**Budget takes Women Backwards**

While her Government is eroding choice for women in Budget 2010, the Minister of Women's Affairs Pansy Wong is wasting time doing research that has already been done on pay equity, Labour Women’s Affairs spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“The Ministry of Women’s Affairs funding was unchanged in the budget, which is effectively a funding cut with inflation heading for 6% next year,” Sue Moroney said.

“Meanwhile early childhood funding cuts, health funding that doesn't keep up with inflation and restrictions on interest-free student loans announced in the budget will all impact negatively on women's participation in society and the economy.

"Add this to ACC cuts to counselling for victims of sexual abuse, night classes being cut and the pay and employment equity unit being closed down last year, and a pattern emerges of a Government that is ignoring the needs of women.

"Women and their families need a strong advocate in Cabinet to go to bat for them - not a Minister who sits idly by while women's choices are reduced and their lives get harder.

“Women were unfairly hit by the recession, representing 60% of the newly unemployed in the last year and violence against women has increased also.

"Women are going backwards in New Zealand and all the Minister can do is more research,” Sue Moroney said.
