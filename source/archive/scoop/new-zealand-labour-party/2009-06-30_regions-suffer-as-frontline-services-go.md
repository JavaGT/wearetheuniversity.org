Regions suffer as frontline services go

**Regions suffer as frontline services go**

National’s promise that it would shift resources to the ‘frontline’ of the public sector is empty, as staff in regions across New Zealand are losing their jobs and services cut by cut, Labour State Services Spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“Today’s announcement about 80 jobs cut at Child, Youth and Family will see jobs and services go in centres from Whangärei in the North to Dunedin in the South, and many towns in between,” Grant Robertson said.

“I am sure when National said resources would be moved from the backroom to the frontline New Zealanders in the regions did not expect these kinds of cuts in their areas.

“The cuts in the regional services of CYFS follow cuts to regional offices of Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Justice, Tertiary Education Commission and National Library.

“This will see a reduction in the quality of services provided in our regional areas. It will also see dozens more people out of work and struggling to support their families.

“This is an own goal from National. Removing ‘frontline’ staff will reduce regional services and will mean unemployment will increase.

“This is not the kind of public service New Zealand needs nor deserves,” Grant Robertson said.
