**EQC review must hear the voice of Canterbury**

The decision to review the Earthquake Commission is welcomed by the Labour Party but the voice of Cantabrians must be heard, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.

“Labour welcomes the review of EQC and will work with it. However it must focus on the lessons that can be learnt from the past two years in Canterbury. It must include Cantabrians on the review panel who understand the problems on the ground, rather than consist solely of Wellington analysts.

“It is imperative that the review produces an EQC that is sustainable in the long term and can handle any future disasters. Learning the lessons of Canterbury will be essential in bringing that about.”
