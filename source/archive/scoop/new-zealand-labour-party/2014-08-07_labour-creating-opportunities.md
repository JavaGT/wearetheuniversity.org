**Labour: Creating opportunities**

A Labour government will boost career opportunities in the cultural sector by establishing 200 new creative apprenticeships, Labour’s Arts, Culture and Heritage spokesperson Jacinda Ardern says.

Announcing Labour’s Arts, Culture and Heritage policy this afternoon she said the apprenticeships offer the kind of flexible, open-minded and innovative approach to training New Zealand’s creative industries are known for.

“They will provide a clear pathway for people wanting creative careers to gain a nationally-recognised Diploma or Certificate qualification, and will be especially useful for community arts organisations, theatres, and galleries, who may not always have the certainty, confidence and support required to take on people in an apprentice role.

“New Zealanders are strong supporters of the arts and are proud of this country’s artistic achievements. Labour wants to continue to develop the arts sector to ensure its talents continue to be valued here and internationally.

“That means we will continue to invest in Creative New Zealand, and directly support other institutions of national significance. Creative New Zealand will be structured so that it is practitioner led, includes independent top level Maori and Pacific representation and is focused on supporting artists rather than bureaucrats. It will be tasked with reviewing processes and funding criteria.

“The contribution our screen industry makes to both the economy and our cultural identity is well-known. Labour’s continued support for the New Zealand film industry includes reviewing the new incentives regime to ensure benefits to the domestic industry are maximised.”

A Labour Government will also:

• Reinstate the Artists in Schools Programme and establish a network of Children’s Art Houses

• Reinstate the Pathways to Arts and Cultural Employment (PACE) scheme, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the cultural sector through investment in tertiary education and professional development

• Provide opportunities for game and animation innovation

• Support NZ Book Month as an annual event and review the public lending right for authors

• Re-establish Archives NZ and the National Library as independent entities

• Investigate the possibility of an archive for New Zealand music

• Investigate a National Policy Statement on Heritage

“A strong arts and cultural sector is not a nice to have. It is a fundamental part of a modern, creative, high-wage economy,” Jacinda Ardern said.
