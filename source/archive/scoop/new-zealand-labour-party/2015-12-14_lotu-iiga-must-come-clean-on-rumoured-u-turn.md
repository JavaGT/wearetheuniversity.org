14 December 2015 MEDIA STATEMENT

**Lotu Iiga must come clean on rumoured u-turn**

The Government needs to tell us the truth regarding the funding of the Pasifika Education Centre, says Pacific Affairs spokesperson Su’a William Sio.

“Is it going to reinstate the $700,000 it cut earlier this year or not? I know it would be embarrassing for Tertiary Minister Steven Joyce and Pacific Islands Affairs Minister Peseta Sam Lotu Iiga to admit to a u-turn because of pressure by Labour and the Pacific community to continue funding, but it is the right thing to do.

“It would be even more embarrassing for the Government when the Auckland Council adopts a language policy with a focus on Pasifika language education.

“After all the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs signed off on PEC’s 2014-2018 strategy.

“While Sam Lotu Iiga has been extremely busy fending off the problems in our prison system he should dedicate more time to Pacific people who want a Pasifika language education.

“So far the National government continues to sit on its hands and do nothing to support Pasifika languages and the value of speaking more than one language,” says Su’a William Sio.
