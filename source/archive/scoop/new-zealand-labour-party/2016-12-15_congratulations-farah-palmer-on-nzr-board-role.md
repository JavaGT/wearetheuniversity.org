Congratulations Farah Palmer on NZR board role

Farah Palmer’s appointment as the first woman on the board of New Zealand Rugby is a huge achievement for her, the game and women everywhere, says Labour Associate Spokesperson for Sport and Recreation Louisa Wall.

“I’m thrilled for Farah. She’s a rugby great, a respected academic and a role model for all of us.

“There’s no better qualified candidate who can be a strong voice advocating Maori rugby and for the interests of women on the board of our most important sporting organisation.”

Farah Palmer has been elected as the Maori representative to the NZR board and attended her first board meeting yesterday.

“I am incredibly proud of Farah and I’m sure her achievement will inspire other Black Ferns and women rugby players to seek roles in rugby and other sporting boards across the country.

“And it won't stop at this. One in seven rugby players are women. There needs to be far greater representation of women in governance positions across the game from provincial unions to NZR,” says Louisa Wall.
