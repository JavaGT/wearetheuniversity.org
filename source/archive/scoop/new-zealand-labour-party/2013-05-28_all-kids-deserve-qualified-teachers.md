All kids deserve qualified teachers

HIPKINS

Education Spokesperson  

28 May 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**All kids deserve qualified teachers**

All Kiwi kids deserve fully qualified teachers in their classrooms, and the Maori Party has the power to guarantee they get them, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.

Labour is proposing a number of amendments to address the most dangerous aspects of the Government’s Charter School legislation.

“With Maori Party support, New Zealanders will have an assurance that only qualified teachers will teach their kids.

“You wouldn’t go to a mechanic for a hip replacement, so why does the government think kids should be forced into classrooms with unqualified teachers? Someone can be highly qualified in a particular field or discipline but that doesn’t mean they know how to teach young people.

“Just last week Education Minister, Hekia Parata, released a review of the Teachers Council which touted the need for a highly-skilled, highly-trained teaching workforce, yet the government’s charter schools legislation runs in the opposite direction.

“If the Maori Party is genuine in its concern about underachievement in our education system, it could listen to all the evidence and research that points out quality teaching is the biggest in-school influencer of student success and vote for Labour’s amendments.”
