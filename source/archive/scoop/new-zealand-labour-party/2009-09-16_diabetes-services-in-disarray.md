Media Statement

Diabetes services in disarray

Health cuts are now impacting across the spectrum for all health services associated with diabetes, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“Since becoming Minister of Health Tony Ryall has presided over the removal of healthy guidelines in school tucks shops and the axing of the obesity prevention target for District Health Boards, instead waffling about how school children kicking a ball around will prevent the tidal wave of obesity-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Tony Ryall has shown scant regard for experts like Dr Jeremy Krebs, Clinical Leader, Endocrinology and Diabetes at Wellington Hospital, who says the National government’s decision to allow junk food in tuck-shops is ‘a backward step in dealing with the growing obesity problem in New Zealand,” and a step that will mean more people with diabetes in our country’.

“His decision to ignore clinical experts comes on top of the $4.8 million slashed from the “Let’s Get Checked” diabetes programme annually to make it harder for the public to find out if they are suffering from this life-threatening condition.

“But now his cuts are impacting on those who literally are dependent on their very life for public health services.

“This week my colleague Moana Mackey told me the distressing story, of an elderly Gisborne man, who faces nine months in Waikato hospital, away from his wife and his home, because of a shortage of funding for his dialysis.

“National campaigned on a Health Policy of “Better Sooner and More Convenient”. What New Zealand has got is Fewer, Slower and Less Convenient health services.

“Tony Ryall’s management of the health service has been an exercise in vanity where he has bragged about statistics but failed real people, who need affordable and accessible health care,” Ruth Dyson said.

**Patient services cut in eight months
