Key needs to harden up over Kiwis in Oz
=======================================

**Thursday, 6 February 2014, 10:58 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

It’s time John Key stopped posturing over the plight of New Zealanders living in Australia and did something concrete about it, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.

“Everyone knows Kiwis living, working, and paying taxes in Australia get a raw deal.

“Labour under my leadership has argued strongly for movement on the matter of entitlements for Kiwis living in Australia, and will continue to do so.

“The Prime Minister, on the other hand, has done little to advance the cause. He needs to do some tough talking with Tony Abbott and not, as he’s done previously, signal his apparent concern over the issue but return home empty-handed and armed with platitudes.

“It’s estimated around 100,000 Kiwis living across the ditch can’t access student loans, emergency housing, disability insurance, or social security benefits.

“Those New Zealanders contribute fully to Australian society, yet are treated like third class citizens.

“We have a special relationship with our trans-Tasman cousins – a friendly rivalry underpins much of what we do together - and in all our endeavours we play hard, but respect each other.

“In this matter John Key should take a lead from Labour and insist Kiwis in Australia get a fair deal.”
