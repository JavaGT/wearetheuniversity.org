Nat’s Education Policy a Farce

Nat’s Education Policy a Farce

National’s Education Policy is a farce says Labour’s Te Tai Tokerau Candidate and former school principal Kelvin Davis, in response to their plans to prosecute parents of truants.

“Targeting parents of truants avoids the real issue of why kids don’t want to be at school.” Davis says.

“Prosecution of parents was tried up north a few years back. It was a time consuming process that wasn’t as effective as us as a school improving what we had control of.”

“Truancy at Kaitaia Intermediate School decreased when we improved teaching, improved teacher/ pupil relationships and improved systems for monitoring and  
following up non-attendance.

Truancy would be reduced enormously if students learning needs were met, their teachers understood them as individuals, their curriculum was relevant and exciting and their whanau were given opportunities to meaningfully participate in their education.

Improving teaching will minimise low and medium levels of behavioural and learning needs. Research time and again has proven this.”

A punitive response only serves to alienate youth further. Prosecuting parents will alienate whole families from the school system.

A sensible approach to raising achievement is for government to continue to resource teacher professional development, improve teacher selection and pre service training and resource those students with high learning and behavioural needs.
