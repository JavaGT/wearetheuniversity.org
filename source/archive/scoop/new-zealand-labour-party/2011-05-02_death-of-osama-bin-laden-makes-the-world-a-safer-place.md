MEDIA STATEMENT

**Death of Osama Bin Laden Makes the World a Safer Place**

Labour Leader Phil Goff has welcomed confirmation from US President Barack Obama that American forces have killed the terrorist Osama bin Laden during a raid in Pakistan.

“The world is a better and safer place now Osama bin Laden is gone,” said Phil Goff.

“Osama bin Laden is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks carried out around the world. He is responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people. He founded the jihadist terrorist organisation al-Qaeda and has committed his life to spreading its deadly tentacles across the globe. His death will be a major blow to that organisation and that is something that we should welcome.”

Labour’s Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Maryan Street has also welcomed the news that the world’s most wanted man is dead and can no longer inflict terror on the rest of the world.

“I particularly recognise that this will feel like justice has been done for those who suffered the losses caused by the 9/11 attacks. Almost 3000 people died in the attacks on Washington and New York and we mourn the loss of so many innocent lives,” said Maryan Street.

“But it is important that the reaction from the international community remains calm. The world will only be safer if rational minds prevail and if we can find other ways to resolve profoundly felt differences than turning to violence and terrorism.”
