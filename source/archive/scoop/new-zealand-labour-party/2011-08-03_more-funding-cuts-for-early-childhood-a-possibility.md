**More funding cuts for early childhood a possibility**

The National Government today confirmed it is considering proposals that could see further massive cuts to Early Childhood Education, including home-based care, Playcentre, Kohanga Reo and 20 hours free, Labour ECE spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“Minister of Education Anne Tolley today refused to rule out funding cuts that would further increase costs for families with pre-school children and refused to say when the Government would make decisions about the proposed funding cuts,” Sue Moroney said.

“The Government appointment taskforce has recommended to the Government that it could cut funding to Playcentres by up to 70 per cent, affecting up to 15,000 children.

“The report also recommended cutting funding for home-based ECE by up to 80 per cent, potentially affecting up to 17,000 children and their parents. The report further recommended potentially cutting funding for Kohanga Reo funding by up to 78 per cent.

“The thousands of parents and workers in the early childhood education sector deserve to know when the Government is going to make decisions and whether it has ruled out the savage cuts recommended by the National Government appointed taskforce.

“The last time this National Government cut funding to early childhood education in February that just affected one part of the sector – these proposals affect every part of early childhood education.

“Labour is urging parents to put submissions into the Government on the ECE taskforce recommendations before submissions close on Monday,” Sue Moroney said.
