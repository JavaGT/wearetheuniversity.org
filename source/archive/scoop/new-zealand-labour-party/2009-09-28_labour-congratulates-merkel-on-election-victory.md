Labour congratulates Angela Merkel and the CDU on their election victory

  
The Labour Party congratulates Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) following their decisive victory in yesterday’s Germany Federal election.

“German voters have given Mrs Merkel and her Free Democrat (FDP) allies a clear mandate to govern,” Labour’s Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Chris Carter says.

“New Zealand’s relationship with Germany is very important. Germany has the largest economy in the European Union, which is a key market for New Zealand's agriculture and value-added products.

“International visitors from Germany are important for our tourist industry, while international students from Germany and young people on the working holiday scheme all help to build strong linkages between our two countries. Labour hopes that the New Zealand Government will work closely with the new German Federal Government.

“Angela Merkel is a remarkable figure. She grew up in the authoritarian East German state, became her party’s leader in 2002, and has led the united Germany since 2005. She is widely acknowledged for shattering the ‘glass ceiling’ which saw women under-represented at the top level of German Federal politics. In global security affairs Mrs Merkel has given her people an independent and respected voice,” Chris Carter says.

“Labour is naturally disappointed that our sister party, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), has not been successful in this year’s election.

“We wish the SPD well in Opposition and will continue to work closely with SPD colleagues in international forums such as Socialist International, the International Union of Socialist Youth (currently led by Labour MP Jacinda Ardern), and other progressive forums.”
