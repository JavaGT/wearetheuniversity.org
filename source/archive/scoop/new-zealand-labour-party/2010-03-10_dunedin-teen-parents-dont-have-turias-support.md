Dunedin teen parents don't have Turia's support
===============================================

**Why don’t Dunedin’s teen parents have your support Tariana?**

Dunedin South Labour MP Clare Curran today accused Associate Social Development Minister Tariana Turia of hypocrisy and a lack of consistency in supporting a North Island teen parenting programme, while not supporting the sole Dunedin programme which now faces closure.

“When Tariana Turia visited the Heretaunga College yesterday to trumpet the success of its teen parent programme she didn’t mention that she had not supported continued government funding of Dunedin’s only teen parenting programme," Clare Curran said.

“What made it more astounding was that she used International Women’s Day as the platform to support the Heretaunga programme.

“Does she think it’s okay to have a teen parent unit in one part of New Zealand, but not in others?  
“Late last year I repeatedly asked Tariana Turia for help, having hit a blank wall with Social Development Minister Paula Bennett and Education Minister Anne Tolley.

"Initially Tariana Turia seemed supportive, but then backed away, providing the same stock answers given by the other Ministers and washing her hands of the issue.

"Dunedin’s only literacy and numeracy teen parent unit in Dunedin, is run by Salvation Army E-Plus under the Step Ahead programme

"They were advised late last year that their TEC funding for 2010 has been cut, and despite attempts to get three Ministers to pay attention to the issue, each said there was nothing they could do.

"In the last 2 years, 26 young women have gone through this course, 7 have moved into employment, 6 into further study and 13 NCEA certificates were awarded.

“It’s the only teen parenting course of its type in Dunedin and it concentrates really hard on building literacy and numeracy skills, confidence, some basic parenting and nutrition skills amongst a group of young women who generally are withdrawn, lonely, isolated and have left school because they didn’t fit in, got pregnant, or were kicked out.

“I was astounded when I saw Tariana Turia’s media release this morning saying the Hutt Valley Teen Parent Programme is a wonderful example of women empowering women to better themselves.

‘I’m pleased that the Hutt Valley programme continues to be supported. Meanwhile, the Dunedin programme, which has interim funding provided by the local Otago Community Trust, will have to shut its doors in April.

“Perhaps Tariana Turia could explain why Dunedin teen parents don’t receive her support?
