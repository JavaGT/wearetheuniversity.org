**Lazy and Uncaring Minister Fudges Questions**

Labour’s Associate Spokesperson for Labour Darien Fenton says that Kate Wilkinson’s comments at the estimates of Vote Labour at Select Committee this morning shows a lazy and uncaring attitude to her portfolio.

“When I asked about the Advisory Report on Redundancy and Restructuring (which recommended minimum notice of redundancy and compensation) the Minister said it was on her desk, but then confirmed that she had no intention of progressing it,” says Ms Fenton.

“The Minister has had the report “on her desk” since she became Minister. It’s obvious she hopes that by ignoring the report the concerns about the thousands of workers who are being made redundant without notice and pay will just disappear.

“To makes things worse, the Minister couldn’t remember if she had met with the Director General of the International Labour Organisation in her recent trip to Geneva for the ILO Conference.

“One has to wonder what the point of her visit was if she couldn’t even remember who the head of the United Nations International Labour Organisation is.”

Darien Fenton said the Minister couldn’t say what the difference between equal pay and pay and employment equity was even although she admitted she made the decision to close the Pay and Employment Equity Unit.

“The Ministers’ attitude to her portfolio is distressingly indifferent,” says Ms Fenton.

“Workers expect to see a Minister who is on top of the issues confronting them and the labour market, not one who appears to have no awareness of what those issues are.”
