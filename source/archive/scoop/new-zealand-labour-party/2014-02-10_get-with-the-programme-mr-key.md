Auckland Issues Spokesperson

**Get with the programme Mr Key**

Len Brown’s offer to kick start the City Rail Link is a no brainer and the Government should grab it with both hands, Labour’s Auckland Issues spokesperson Phil Twyford says.

“The Mayor is only reflecting a desire by Aucklanders to see the rail project up and running as soon as possible.

“National’s refusal to move on the City Rail Link until 2020 is holding back Auckland’s growth and prosperity.

“Aucklanders know the project will double the number of trains on the network and unlock huge development in the central city.

“Precinct Properties, the owner of the Downtown centre, are even offering to start digging the first section of tunnel themselves.

“What would it take to get the Prime Minister to say yes? A working bee with thousands of Aucklanders hand-digging the tunnel with picks and shovels?

“If the Government has said it will fund the project 50:50, and Auckland Council is willing to front load its share to get it started, what is the downside for the tax payer?

“John Key and his Government will be a distant memory by his preferred start for the project of 2020.

“If he refuses to budge on this, then you have to wonder whether his high profile flip flop on the City Rail Link was more about political expediency than a genuine commitment to the project.”
