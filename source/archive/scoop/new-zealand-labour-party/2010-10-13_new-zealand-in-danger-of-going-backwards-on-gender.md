New Zealand in danger of going backwards on gender

**New Zealand in danger of going backwards on gender gap**

  
Today’s Global Gender Gap report, written by the World Economic Forum, shows NZ sliding towards a lower ranking says Labour Spokesperson for Women's Affairs, Sue Moroney.

“For the first time in five years, New Zealand’s score has dropped and while it retained its fifth-placed ranking, it is now at risk of being overtaken by Ireland in next year's report unless the Government stops going backwards on wage equality for similar work, enrolment of women in tertiary education, literacy rates for females, female to male wage ratios, and women in Ministerial positions.

"The international report shows NZ has gone backwards in five key areas for women in 2010 after having made steady progress in the previous four years," said Sue Moroney.

"Changes in Government policy and a lack of economic planning are responsible for the reversal in our previous progress. National's axing of pay equity audits and their failure to develop the economy are just two examples.

“New Zealand needs to move forward, but National’s policies and lack of planning are holding New Zealand back. Just recently the Minister of Women’s Affairs Pansy Wong actually celebrated the fact that men’s wages were falling as being good for women.

“With ridiculous statements like that being made by the Minister, it is clear National have no real understanding of the issues facing women.

“The Minister of Women's Affairs needs to stop her Government from taking women backwards in pay equity, education, widening gender pay gap and Ministerial posts,” Sue Moroney said.
