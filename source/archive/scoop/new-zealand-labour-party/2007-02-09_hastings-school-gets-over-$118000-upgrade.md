Hastings school gets over $118,000 upgrade

9 February 2007

Students at a Hastings school will return to their classes this week to hear good news about new school facilities.

Bridge Pa School is getting $118,019 for capital works above and beyond what they would normally get for classrooms to cope with roll growth.

Labour MP Rick Barker says the funding is part of the Labour-led government's Schools Property Guide Programme, which this year provides $30 million for schools around the country to improve learning environments and make room for more students.

"The funding announced today means Bridge Pa School can build new facilities or upgrade what they already have. They can decide for themselves what facilities they'll build to satisfy the learning needs of their growing numbers of students.

"In the past, schools have used funding from this programme for extensions to buildings or new administration blocks, halls and gyms.

"I've spoken to a lot of parents in this area, and they generally want their children to enjoy safe, modern learning environments; the kids love it, they learn better, acquire more knowledge and skills and it sets them up for a better start to their working lives.

The Labour-led government introduced the Schools Property Guide Programme in 1999 so that schools could build new facilities as they needed them, and has provided funding to over four hundred schools.

"The big investment we've made in school property since 1999 means that instead of putting up with patched-up old buildings, schools are now using funding to continue modernising and improving their buildings," said Rick Barker.
