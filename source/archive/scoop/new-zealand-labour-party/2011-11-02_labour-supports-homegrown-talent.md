**Labour supports homegrown talent**

“Labour believes there are clear cultural and economic gains to be had from a strong domestic arts industry,” says Labour’s spokesperson for Arts Culture and Heritage Steve Chadwick.

New Zealand’s cultural industries are recognised internationally for their excellence, contributing to our national identity, economic growth and New Zealand’s attractiveness as a premier destination for cultural tourism.

“Contrary to how the arts are often labelled, home-grown talent is making a strong contribution to the growth of our economy, offering exciting employment for New Zealanders and developing high-tech creative capability,” Steve Chadwick said.

Announcing Labour’s Arts policy in Auckland today Steve Chadwick said Labour would support and expand the creative sector with sustained investment to enable arts and cultural organisations to thrive at a regional level, a national level and in a fast-evolving digital international environment.

“Labour has a broad host of policies which commit to advancing the literary sector, the fine arts, galleries and museums, the film sector and New Zealand music,” Steve Chadwick said.

Policies announced today include continued support for skills training with a revised and modern Creative Industries Apprenticeship. Labour understands the importance of facilitating links between learning and employment. This will provide real job opportunities to support those trying to make a living in the arts.

“Labour will also establish a ‘Pan-Literary Group’ to discuss and agree policy and legislation that impacts on writers, an outreach delivery system of collections from Te Papa, a revised commitment to a Regional Museums and Arts Infrastructure Fund to include applications for theatre, orchestras, film platforms and performing arts infrastructure

“Under Labour, a major focus has been supporting our musicians to expand into overseas markets. We will continue to support the successful Outward Sound programme to assist New Zealand artists to become export-ready.

“The devastation of Canterbury’s quakes has thrown heritage issues into the spotlight. Labour will review the effectiveness of the Historic Places Act legislation to ensure there is a voice for community advocacy especially in extraordinary circumstances.

“Labour has a vision and a plan for New Zealand. Central to this plan is nurturing and facilitating home-grown talent in our cultural industries,” Steve Chadwick said.
