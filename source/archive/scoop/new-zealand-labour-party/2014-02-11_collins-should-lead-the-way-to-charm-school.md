Collins should lead the way to charm school
===========================================

Judith Collins should lead by example and take herself off to the charm school ACC staff are being asked to attend, Labour’s ACC spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says.

ACC has hired Auckland University of Technology to provide training and study for staff as part of a move to improve service delivery, build trust and confidence and enhance its reputation as “an employer of choice”.

“Ms Collins needs look no further than to herself to understand why staff development has become an issue.

“ACC’s cavalier and ruthless approach towards its clients is symptomatic of the leadership from its Minister.

“Given that the attitudes of staff reflect those at the top it is only right Judith Collins familiarise herself with the etiquette expected of the workers.

“Some $2 million has already been spent on consultants in an effort to fix the Corporation’s image. This latest scheme has so far cost $1.66 million.

“ACC has a bad reputation and fixing that will take a lot of work. But the answer doesn’t lie in wasting ACC levies on consultants and courses.

“It lies in putting a stop to home support cuts for injured Kiwis, not blocking legitimate claims, investing in prevention programmes and treating people fairly and with dignity.

“Labour is committed to repairing the damage National has done to ACC by focussing on providing fair treatment and fair compensation in return for fair levies.”
