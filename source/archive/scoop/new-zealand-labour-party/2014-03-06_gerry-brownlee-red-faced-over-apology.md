Gerry Brownlee red faced over apology

Gerry Brownlee has demonstrated just how far out of touch he is with what is happening in Christchurch, says Labour’s Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“Mr Brownlee attacked Labour in Parliament this week, wrongly claiming that they had not been helping quake-affected constituents.

“The Earthquake Recovery Minister has now apologised to Labour’s Christchurch MPs. It is simply too little too late. His post rant discovery that the case of 85 year old Dot Boyd was not an isolated case beggars belief.

“We resent the fact that Mr Brownlee used this for a cheap political attack instead of stepping in and helping Dot Boyd last year when we contacted EQC over the problem.

“He should have checked his facts before he came out swinging. It is astonishing that only now he has stumbled upon a further 85 cases of elderly and vulnerable Cantabrians in rebuild limbo.

“Three years on he has yet to grasp the magnitude of the number of people who are still stranded in wrecked homes and want to move on.

That shows how far out of touch he is.”
