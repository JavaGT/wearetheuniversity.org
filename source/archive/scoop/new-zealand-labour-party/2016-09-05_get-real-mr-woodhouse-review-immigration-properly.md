Get real Mr Woodhouse: Review immigration properly

  
Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse is treating New Zealanders like fools with his phoney review, Labour’s Immigration spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says.

“There needs to be a full review of the immigration system, not, as Mr Woodhouse is suggesting, a bogus review where the outcome has already been decided.

“Does Michael Woodhouse really think people will be fooled by this? Kiwis are cleverer than he thinks they are and will see right through this sham.

“National has broken our immigration system. The problems are everywhere - in education, with tertiary fraud and the exploitation of overseas students; in the labour market, with thousands of work visas issued for jobs such as café manager and hairdresser while thousands of New Zealanders are unemployed; and in housing.

“MBIE, Treasury and the Reserve Bank have all expressed concern and the Government is well aware of the risks of doing nothing.

“However given Mr Woodhouse’s preconceived outcome of a review, that’s probably all we can expect.

“Labour supports active management of immigration to make sure New Zealand gets the skills it needs and that migrants are able to settle well,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.
