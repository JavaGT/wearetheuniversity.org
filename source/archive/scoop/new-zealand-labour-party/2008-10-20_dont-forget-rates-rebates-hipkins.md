Don’t forget Rates Rebates - Hipkins

Thousands of Hutt Valley families who are eligible for a Rates Rebate haven’t yet applied according to Labour’s candidate for the Rimutaka electorate Chris Hipkins.

“At a time when our local households are under considerable financial pressure, the Rates Rebate scheme offers some much needed financial relief,” Chris Hipkins said.

Those with an income under $21,180 are eligible for a Rates Rebate of up to $530.

Latest figures show that only 732 Upper Hutt households have applied out of an estimated 1,923 households who are eligible.

The uptake in Lower Hutt is even lower with just 513 out of an estimated 4,083 eligible households making applications.

"The rates rebate scheme is another great example of how the Labour-led government is targeting additional assistance to those most in need,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Rates rebates are available to those on low incomes and are particularly beneficial to those who have retired.

Significant increases in the maximum rebate and the number of people who are eligible came into effect on the 1st of July 2006.

"I would encourage all those who think they may be eligible for a rates rebate and haven't yet applied to check with the local council," Chris Hipkins said.

Application forms are available from local councils and on the rates rebates website: www.ratesrebates.govt.nz.
