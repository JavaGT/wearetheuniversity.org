Frontline services go in fisheries job cuts

Around 30 Ministry of Fisheries staff in Nelson, Dunedin, Auckland and Napier will lose their jobs as the National Government makes further cuts to the public service, State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“So far more than 1000 jobs are on the chopping block in the public service and the National Government isn’t finished yet,” Grant Robertson said.

“The Government has made claims about moving staff from the backroom to the frontline. However, this is nothing more than a meaningless slogan.

“In this case the Government is cutting staff in the regions who work directly with communities, and replacing them with a small central team in Wellington. That is not moving people to the frontline, and will result in poorer services for the public.

Grant Robertson said the latest round of cuts to regional fisheries jobs could potentially harm services in that area.

“Local communities should have their needs met locally, now recreational fishers, iwi and communities will have to contact Wellington to discuss their local issues.

“National seem more interested in feathering their own nest by using public service funded political advisors in their Ministerial offices than delivering increases in frontline services for New Zealanders.

“New Zealanders are struggling and now more than 1000 ordinary Kiwi’s have lost or will lose their incomes because of their short-sighted job and service cuts.

“So far the Tertiary Education Commission, Ministry for Environment, Ministry of Health, National Library, State Services Commission, Ministry of Social Development, Inland Revenue and now the Ministry of Fisheries, have either cut jobs or signalled their intention to. Clearly this makes a mockery of John Key’s ‘cap not cut’ claim.

“Its time the National Party delivered more than slogans, jobs cuts and pay rises for their own staff. Clearly there is one rule for National Government Ministers and another for the rest of New Zealand when it comes to pay rises and staff numbers, “Grant Robertson said.
