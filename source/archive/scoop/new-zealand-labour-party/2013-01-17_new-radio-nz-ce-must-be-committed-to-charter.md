New Radio NZ CE must be committed to charter
============================================

New Radio NZ CE must be committed to charter  

The replacement for long-serving Radio New Zealand chief executive Peter Cavanagh must have the same commitment to commercial-free public broadcasting and respect for the station’s charter, says Labour’s broadcasting spokesperson Clare Curran.

“The retirement of Peter Cavanagh may be seen as an opportunity by the Government to appoint a new chief executive more amenable to advertising and sponsored content on Radio New Zealand.

“Radio New Zealand is the country’s number one radio station and its thousands of listeners would find commercial content unacceptable.

“The freeze on funding and the creeping commercialisation into public broadcasting under the National Government has created intolerable pressures on Radio New Zealand and a new chief executive must be strong enough to stand up to the board and to the Government on the need for adequate funding for the nation’s only public broadcaster.

“Radio New Zealand has a mandate and responsibility to the nation to deliver the highest quality public broadcasting standards throughout all of its operations. The chief executive is responsible for protecting the whole of the Radio New Zealand institution, its values and the charter.

“Peter Cavanagh has served Radio New Zealand well for the past ten years. A candidate of the same calibre is required.”
