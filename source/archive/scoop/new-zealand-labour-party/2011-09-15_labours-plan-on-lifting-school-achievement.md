Labour’s plan on lifting school achievement
===========================================

MEDIA STATEMENT

**Labour’s plan on lifting school achievement will help Ohariu kids**

Today’s announcement by Labour to fix National Standards will help primary school children do better in the Northern Suburbs and Western Hills, according to Labour List MP based in Ohariu Charles Chauvel.

“I have visited every school in the Ohariu electorate, listening to teachers, principals and parents. Most schools are trying to do their best (with the support of parents) to work within a framework that was expensive, and rushed in its implementation, and they all agree that it has been a confusing mess”, said Chauvel.

“National promised to “smarten up the system” in 2008. This smart-alec attempt to play politics with children gets a big fail mark, particularly against Ohariu’s Government MPs Peter Dunne and Katrina Shanks. They chose to support a policy that they thought sounded good on paper, but fell apart because they failed to work with families and teachers”.

Labour will lift achievement by setting high expectations for each student according to their individual ability and providing parents with information they want in plain language about their child’s learning. Labour will require schools to use recognised assessment tools and teacher judgement to:

1\. Determine the New Zealand Curriculum level a child is achieving.  
2\. Show a child’s rate of progress between reports over the course of a year.  
3\. Identify children not achieving within the curriculum level appropriate to their year at school.  
4\. Decide and report the next learning steps.  
5\. Report this information in plain language to parents at least twice a year.

“On November 26, people have a real choice in Ohariu. They can have an MP for Ohariu that stands for higher achievement or one that just talks about it”.
