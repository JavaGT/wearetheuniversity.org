Solution proposed for traffic issues at SH1 at Waitati

CONSULTATION WITH RESIDENTS VITAL

Otago MP David Parker has proposed two potential solutions to the traffic issues confronting the Blueskin General Store on State Highway 1 at Waitati, north of Dunedin.

In a recent letter to Waitati residents Mr Parker has proposed:

1\. Reducing the speed limit to 70 kmph; or

2\. Realigning the road, with Transit New Zealand compensating the existing business and making available a safer site on the Waitati township side of the road.

Mr Parker wrote to Waitati residents about the traffic issues concerning the intersection/turn off to Waitati and the adjacent Blueskin General Store in response to a recent local petition.

“Even prior to the serious accident which occurred adjacent to the store over the Christmas period, Transit New Zealand had identified that this corner is a dangerous black spot with a history of accidents,” Mr Parker’s letter to residents said.

“The accident undoubtedly lends weight to Transit’s concerns. Nevertheless the Blueskin General Store is important to the local community. It is a considerable distance to other shops. Further, I believe that there is a strong case that petrol should be able to be purchased locally, especially since the Evansdale petrol pumps closed down,” the letter said.

Mr Parker told residents he was advocating for the issue to be resolved in one of these ways. He said it was important that residents were a part of the consultation process in deciding what to do about the traffic issues in their community.

“I am aware that Transit and the operators of the Blueskin General Store are involved in a planning process, which may bring these issues to a head. In the meantime I have made a submission on Transit New Zealand’s Ten year state highway plan in support of the second option. You can view my submission on my website at www.labour.org.nz/davidparker.

Mr Parker asked residents with further concerns to contact him.
