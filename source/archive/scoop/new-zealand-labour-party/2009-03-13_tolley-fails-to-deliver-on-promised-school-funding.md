Tolley fails to deliver on promised school funding

Tolley fails to deliver on promised school funding

Education Minister Anne Tolley must act now to ensure the $30 million she has promised to four Upper Hutt Schools is actually delivered, says Rimutaka MP Chris Hipkins.

Chris Hipkins challenged the Minister in the House today to explain why Upper Hutt College, Heretaunga College, Fergusson Intermediate and Maidstone Intermediate have yet to hear when they will be receiving the funding promised over a month ago.

“How can Ms Tolley claim that her government is ‘fast tracking’ school property funding when the schools in Upper Hutt have heard nothing from her or the Ministry of Education since the funding was announced?

“Despite their repeated enquiries, the four schools have not received any indication of how the money will be divided up, what they will be able to spend it on, or when they can expect to receive it.

“This is an unacceptable situation given the government is claiming that projects are being fast-tracked,” said Chris Hipkins.

“The Minister must reassure the Upper Hutt schools that she will be taking immediate action to address this issue. She needs to give the schools firm details on the numbers, and a concrete timeline.

“It seems that this is just another example of the Minister making things up as she goes along, and failing to do the hard yards and deliver on her promises.

“Ms Tolley needs to stop simply talking the talk, and start walking the walk,” Chris Hipkins said.
