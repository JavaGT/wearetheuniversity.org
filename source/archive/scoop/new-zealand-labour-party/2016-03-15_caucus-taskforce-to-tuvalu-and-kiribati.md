A Labour Caucus taskforce will next week visit the climate change frontline states of Tuvalu and Kiribati, says Labour’s Pacific Climate Change spokesperson Su’a William Sio.

“We will meet with the Tuvalu and Kiribati governments and communities. There is a lot of support for our fact finding mission.

“Labour also has the support of Kiribati’s former President Tong and Tuvalu’s Minister of Environment, Taukelina Finikaso, who visited the Pasifika Festival over the weekend.

“We won’t just be talking to government officials, we’ll be talking to a range of people on the ground including students and young adults about how they’re coping with climate change, and their hopes and dreams for the future of their homelands.

“Our taskforce will also explore policy ideas the Pacific nations have on climate change. How there can be migration with dignity. We will also hear about the challenges they face with accessing the UN Green Climate Fund for adaptation and mitigation projects.

“Our visit and future climate change missions are an important step towards repairing a credible New Zealand voice in the Pacific on climate change. The actions of the Key Government have undermined the reputation we once had on this crucial issue,” says Su’a William Sio.
