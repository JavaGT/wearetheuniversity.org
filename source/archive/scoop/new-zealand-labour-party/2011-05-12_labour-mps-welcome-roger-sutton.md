**Labour MPs welcome Roger Sutton**

Canterbury’s Labour MPs are welcoming the appointment of Roger Sutton to the position of Chief Executive of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA).

The four MPs Clayton Cosgrove, Ruth Dyson, Lianne Dalziel and Brendon Burns said today: “Roger Sutton is a passionate, committed and energetic Cantabrian. He understands the people and the issues we have been dealing with since September 4 last year.”

“He has shown outstanding leadership in his role as Chief Executive of Orion, with a demonstrated commitment to working in an open and transparent way with members of our community,” the MPs said.

Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove said: “The challenge now for Minister Brownlee is to ensure that the government department model that he chose for CERA can be responsive to Mr Sutton’s style of leadership.

“We all know how effective Mr Sutton is, but Gerry Brownlee needs to give him plenty of scope so he can show his initiative to best advantage,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

The four MPs said that Mr Sutton, as the Chairperson of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, has a deep understanding of and commitment to “warming and drying the homes of our residents – an issue of primary importance as we head into the depths of winter.

“We will continue to work constructively with Roger Sutton in his new role, leading the recovery of our region,” the MPs said.
