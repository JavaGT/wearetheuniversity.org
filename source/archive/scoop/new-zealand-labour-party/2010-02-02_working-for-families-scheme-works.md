The crucial importance of ring-fencing the Working for Families scheme has been highlighted by a Ministry of Social Development survey showing that the number of children in hardship dropped from 26 percent in 2004 to 19 percent in 2008, says Labour Revenue spokesperson Stuart Nash.

“Nineteen percent is still far too high, but the Working for Families scheme initiated by Labour has helped tens of thousands of Kiwi families struggling with the costs and responsibilities of undertaking society’s most important job --- raising our children,” Stuart Nash said.

“I was disappointed that Working for Families was criticised recently by the government’s Tax Working Group which complains that the scheme is distorting the tax system.

“We are talking about our country’s future. How can that be quantified?”

Stuart Nash said the survey should be required reading for anyone even considering altering Working for Families as part of a tax system overhaul.

“New Zealand is not paradise for everyone. It is our collective responsibility as a country to ensure that our children get the best chance in life they possibly can.

“They are this country’s future. Working for Families helps more than 370,000 families. Imagine what life would be like for the majority of these households without this hand up.”
