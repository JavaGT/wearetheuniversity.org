Scotland to follow New Zealand with Smoke Free Law

The Scottish Parliament is looking to introduce similar legislation to that of New Zealand in banning smoking in public places.

“It is great to see that New Zealand is taking the international lead in promoting positive health legislation. We have a long tradition of being at the forefront of reforming measures, and I’m glad to see others are following our lead with this important law change.” Steve Chadwick, the sponsor of Smokefree Environments (Enhanced Protection) Amendment Bill, said.

Scotland’s decision follows on from their neighbour, Ireland, who recently introduced a law banning smoking in all public places, including the country’s many pubs and bars.

Reports have indicated that the implementation of this law has been successful and fears that thousands of hospitality workers would lose their jobs in the wake of the smoking ban were unjustified.

“Anti-smoking legislation will have a tremendous impact on the health of New Zealanders, along with creating clean and safe work environments for everyone.  
The legislation will reduce deaths, disability, and hospital admissions due to passive smoking, reduce the number of cigarettes smoked, and help smokers stop smoking.” Steve Chadwick said.

The First Minister of Scotland’s Parliament, Jack McConnell, stated that "He was impressed by how the smoking ban worked and the enthusiasm for it in Ireland," and that "doing nothing is no longer an option.”

“In the face of so much evidence demonstrating the harmful effects of smoking and passive smoking, banning smoking in public places should be on the agenda for any government. International trends are showing that this issue is not being ignored.” said Steve Chadwick.
