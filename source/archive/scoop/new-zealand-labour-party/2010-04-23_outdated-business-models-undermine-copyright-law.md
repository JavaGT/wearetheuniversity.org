Outdated business models undermine copyright law

New Zealand’s copyright law will not address the fundamental issue of copyright infringement and unauthorised file sharing until it reflects new business models, Labour spokesperson for Communications and IT Clare Curran said today.

“New Internet business models are required to enable our innovators and creators to control and distribute their own content, to boost our economy,” Clare Curran said.

“While the Government should be commended for trying to bring groups together to tackle this issue, this Bill does not address the bigger issues at stake.

“The Government appears content to focus on a penalty regime targeting hundreds of thousands of non-commercial users, whose habits have developed as a result of the market's traditional difficulty in controlling and distributing content.

“Copyright holders should be able to protect their rights. Those who create music, films, and other entertainment should have their work protected from piracy.

“T he Copyright Infringement File Sharing Amendment Bill, which had its first reading in Parliament today, largely addresses these difficulties in a constructive way.

“But Labour disagrees with the Bill’s intention to suspend infringers’ access to the Internet. Not only is it heavy handed but it will not work – an infringer can simply sign up with a different ISP.

“It is not helped that the definition of Internet service provider (ISP) is not clarified, and many of the details, such as the amount of costs payable per infringement, are left to regulation. This will create confusion and inconsistencies.

“Instead of focusing solely on punitive measures, more effort needs to be applied to finding a balanced solution to the issues, such as exploring new business models which better protect creative industries.

“Labour believes the Government should an enabler not an inhibitor of creativity and connectiveness.

“On this basis, Labour will support the Bill to select committee so that interested parties can continue to explore constructive solutions,” Clare Curran said.
