Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson  
22 March 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**EQC privacy breach very disappointing**

The breach of 9700 people’s privacy by the Earthquake Commission is very disappointing, especially given the amount of stress Cantabrians are under, Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel said.

“On top of everything Cantabrians have faced in the past two and a half years, this is more stress for them to cope with. It’s the last thing they needed. The EQC must get in contact with those affected as soon as possible.

“I give EQC credit for fronting up to their mistake. But there is a culture of privacy breaches happening in government, following the ACC, MSD and IRD breaches. Thousands of people have had their privacy breached in the past year.

“It seems extremely lax to send such a vast amount of private information by email. Everything must be done to prevent this happening again.”
