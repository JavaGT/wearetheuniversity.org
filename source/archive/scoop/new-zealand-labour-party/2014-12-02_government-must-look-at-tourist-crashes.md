Government must look at tourist crashes  

The Government needs to stop brushing aside the serious issue of road crashes involving tourists and look seriously at measures to reduce these unnecessary deaths, says Labour’s Transport spokesperson Phil Twyford.

“Today a Christchurch court has convicted a tourist who was involved in a yet another fatal [crash](http://m.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11367562) after arriving on an overseas flight.

“The Government has downplayed the importance of crashes involving tourist drivers, but every one of these needless deaths is a tragedy for the families involved.

“While the data seems to show tourist drivers are involved in road crashes at a proportionate rate similar to the general population, in some areas like Southland and Otago the incidence of tourist crashes is much higher.

“Instead of ignoring these deaths the Government must ask what it can do to prevent them,” says Phil Twyford.
