20 May 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT

Brownlee must now go full steam ahead  

The Labour Party is welcoming the Budget allocation of $5.5 billion over the next six years to the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Fund, and says there is now no excuse for more delays to the recovery process, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.

“Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee now has everything he needs to ensure the recovery is accelerated,’ Clayton Cosgrove said.

“To start with, Parliament has given him wartime powers.

“Secondly, he has been given his own government department to take charge of the recovery process.

“And now he has a bucket load of cash to get the job done,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“There has been a degree of frustration building up in Canterbury over issues like home heating, emergency housing, and the imminent end (May 31) to the business support package that has kept businesses and jobs afloat.

“The recovery process can now go full steam ahead. The people of Canterbury will expect no more delays, no more excuses, and a rapid acceleration of the recovery process,” Clayton Cosgrove said.
