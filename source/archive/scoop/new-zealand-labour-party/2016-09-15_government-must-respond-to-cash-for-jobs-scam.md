Immigration Spokesperson

MEDIA STATEMENT  

15 September 2016

Government must respond to cash-for-jobs scam

Urgent Government action is required to halt the emerging cash-for-jobs immigration scandal that is taking hold in New Zealand says Labour’s Immigration Spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway.

“Stories of rogue immigration agents scamming thousands of dollars from migrant workers are just further evidence that the Government is failing to keep a lid on migrant exploitation.

“The immigration system is falling apart. Students are falling victim to fraud, workers are being exploited and now Immigration NZ is failing to pursue scammers who rip off people with fake job offers.

“Michael Woodhouse has completely lost control of immigration. He needs to get his head out of the sand and start fixing the system his Government has wrecked,” says Iain Lees-Galloway.
