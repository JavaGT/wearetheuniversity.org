23 June 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Government must stand by commitment**

The Government’s announcement today about the future of Canterbury land provides welcome information, but residents must also have access to free independent and expert advice to guide their decisions, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.

“People will be grateful to have more certainty about their future,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

Clayton Cosgrove said Labour MPs would now assess the government’s offers and discuss them with constituents.

“What we need to discover is whether what the Government has said today meets the acid tests – John Key’s commitment after September that no one in Canterbury would be worse off; and Gerry Brownlee’s commitment that no one would lose any equity.

“We won’t know if that’s the case until we talk to individual constituents,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“We have been saying for months that information is currency. That said, there will be many residents who remain confused or worried about their future.

“While it helps to know if you are in a red, orange or green zone, each case is highly individual,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“While the choice of 2007 rating values appears to be a fair option, there will be people who bought properties after 2007 and paid above valuation, or who have taken out large mortgages.

“There will be many more who have made improvements, and others whose judgment will be affected by personal pressures. And that is why everyone must have that free independent and expert advice – so they can make up their minds about what they want to do at relative leisure,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“It’s good that Gerry Brownlee is not shutting the door on providing such advice, but until now he’s shown no commitment to making it actually happen.

Now is the time to do so,” Clayton Cosgrove said.
