Joyce’s ICT policy woefully inadequate

**CURRAN**

ICT Spokesperson

3 June 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Joyce’s ICT policy woefully inadequate**

The Government’s ICT policy is just window dressing and is a woefully inadequate attempt to support the industry, Labour’s ICT spokesperson Clare Curran says.

“The Government’s plan to fund 350 students in four years’ time is not enough.

“The $28 million in funding is also highly questionable. Just 60 per cent of that money will go to funding students, the rest of it appears to be for flash facilities for Steven Joyce to visit.

“The ICT sector is a vibrant and growing part of the economy. Labour knows it needs support. Labour will announce our ICT upgrade in the near future as part of our Economic Upgrade to provide comprehensive solutions for the industry.

"Labour's policy will include a more focused approach to addressing ICT skills shortages, including through more skills training,” says Clare Curran.
