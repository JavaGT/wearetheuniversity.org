**Complaint laid over Tolley’s lies**

It appears Education Minister Anne Tolley has misled Parliament and the public over a Northland kura principal, now assigned by National as an ‘expert’ Student Achievement Practitioner, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Sue Moroney.

“In Parliament the Minister categorically denied any applicant to the National-led initiative, which seeks to impose ‘expert advisors’ in schools, had been previously suspended.

“Reports have subsequently revealed that the principal in question was removed from her duties at the school where she was working.

“I will today write to the Speaker and ask him to investigate a breach rivilege complaint against the Minister for misleading Parliament. Clearly the claims she made in Parliament have been shown to be inaccurate.

“At the time Anne Tolley claimed extensive research was conducted into each Student Achievement Practitioner appointed by National. She also stated no one had been employed who was a suspended principal.

“The truth is the Minister has misled the public yet again. If the Prime Minister values honestly and integrity as requisites for his Ministers he should stand Ms Tolley down immediately.

“Labour had raised concerns with the Ministry of Education around the Minister’s appointment of unqualified advisors to schools.

“The ramifications of the Minister’s actions are hugely damaging. She is rapidly losing the respect of schools, and our children’s education will suffer.

“The Minister either knowingly mislead parliament, or hadn’t bothered to get her facts straight—either way she has proven herself incompetent yet again, Sue Moroney said.
