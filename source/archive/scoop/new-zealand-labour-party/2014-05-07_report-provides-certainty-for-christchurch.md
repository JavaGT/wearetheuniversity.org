Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson

7 May 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Report provides certainty for Christchurch**

The KordaMentha Report, released by the Christchurch City Council today, finally gives residents certainty about the city’s financial situation, Labour's Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson Ruth Dyson said today.

“For too long we have been kept in the dark about costs and future liabilities.

“The report means that we need to have a robust debate about what we can afford and priorities for our City. It is not the time for short-term fixes such as asset sales but it is the time for a careful and considered rethink about what is best for our future.

“It is also critical that the Government comes to the party and acknowledges the changed information. We need a genuine partnership between central and local government if our recovery is going to be the best it possibly can be. We need to hear that commitment from John Key now.

“The report also brings into question the robustness of the Government’s figures in relation to their contribution to the rebuild and recovery.

“Gerry Brownlee was insistent that the previous council not undertake independent costings such as this. He has rejected the financial information contained in this report. I wonder how much of this rejection has got to do with the figures that make up next week's budget.

“If any predicted budget surplus is based on false figures for the real cost of the Canterbury recovery, then people will see through it and expose it for the farce that it is,” Ruth Dyson said.
