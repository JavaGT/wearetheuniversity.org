Steven Joyce is failing to make the grade

**Steven Joyce is failing to make the grade**

  
While smart governments are investing in tertiary education and the skills base of their countries – ours is heading full tilt in the opposite direction, Labours Spokesperson for Tertiary Education, Grant Robertson said today.

“The failure of Steven Joyce to adequately fund tertiary institutions has left universities with no choice but to shut their doors on hundreds of students next year,” said Grant Robertson.

“Massey, Victoria and Otago universities will cut numbers by introducing preferential standards meaning places will go to those with the highest marks. Both Auckland and Waikato Universities also plan to restrict enrolments.

“These changes will have a huge effect on school leavers who will face more uncertainty as to whether they will be able to further their education once they leave high school, some who may not get the highest marks may be forced to wait until they are 20 years old to enrol.

“Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce has admitted moving to further restrict university enrolments ‘would not be ideal to see too much of this at this time’, yet he still fails to take action.

“While Steven Joyce is sitting on his hands, countries like Australia have announced in their Budget $2.6 billion to universities over 5 years through a new, more generous indexation rate to help them meet the cost of quality teaching and research. And they are enshrining it in law to ensure funding certainty.

“The Government needs to front up and explain how shutting hundreds of students out of further education can possibly be good for New Zealand’s future.

“Giving Kiwis more opportunities to upskill, rather than fewer, should be this government’s priority. Steven Joyce’s inaction shows that it clearly is not.”
