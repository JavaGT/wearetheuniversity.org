Diagnostic Wait Times a Symptom of Squeeze On DHBs

**Diagnostic Wait Times a Symptom of Squeeze On DHBs**

The pressure on district health boards to achieve targets is resulting in some patients waiting up to 81 days for urgent ultrasounds, while some hospitals are so stressed they are turning away routine cases, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.

“Health Minister Tony Ryall came out last week with a ‘new gold standard’ target of 95 per cent of patients receiving diagnostic testing within six weeks.

“That ‘new’ target was set last year. And nothing has changed.

“For one patient in Southland, delays will mean 12 months of nausea and reflux as he waits for an endoscopy.”

Waikato-based Labour MP Sue Moroney said people in the region were being forced to wait on average 81 days for an urgent ultrasound, 31 days for an urgent MRI scan and up to 128 days if the scan is “semi urgent”.

“And routine ultrasounds are not being carried out at all.

“None of that sounds like ‘better, sooner health care’ to me. It sounds downright dangerous.”

“If Mr Ryall’s only answer to the increasing demands he is placing on our health professionals is to ‘update’ the public on his expectations, then it’s time he set himself a new gold standard,” said Annette King.
