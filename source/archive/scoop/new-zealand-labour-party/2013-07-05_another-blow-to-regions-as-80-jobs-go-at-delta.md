**Another blow to regions as 80 jobs go at Delta**

National’s failure to support the regions is in the spotlight again as construction company Delta cuts 77 jobs across the lower South Island, say Labour’s Economic Development spokesperson David Clark and Associate Economic Development spokesperson Clare Curran.

“National is neglecting the regions. A loss of almost 80 jobs is yet another blow to Otago and Southland. It comes on top of 73 jobs that were cut by NZ Post in the region last week.

“Since December 2008 7200 jobs have been lost in non-primary manufacturing in Otago and Southland, led by the closure of the Hillside railway workshops.

“The fate of the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter hangs over the region as well.

“Yet nothing is being done by this government to support businesses in the regions and create good, well-paying jobs,” says David Clark.

“There is no plan for the regions. Jobs are being lost across the country,” says Clare Curran.

“Where are these people who have lost their jobs going to go? They will struggle to find work in our region. For many, the only alternative to the dole queue is heading to Australia,” says Clare Curran.
