Dunedin South MP

2 December 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Landmark destruction must stop**

Buck passing over the future of a threatened Otago landmark has got to stop, Dunedin South Labour MP Clare Curran says.

Her comments follow reports that a contract has been awarded to allow increased quarrying activity on Saddle Hill, named by Captain Cook in 1770 and one of the region’s most important landmarks.

“This is despite months of mediation in the Environment Court, a process which appears to have achieved nothing. It’s time someone stepped in and took some responsibility over what is happening.

“On-going excavation at Saddle Hill (also known as Jaffray’s Hill) has created massive changes to the landscape and if - as has been suggested – a company has been given the green light to take the top off Saddle Hill, another distinctive feature of this site will be lost forever.

“The shape of this landmark is what makes Saddle Hill iconic – continued quarrying won’t just affect local residents, but the entire Otago region. Our landforms are part of our core identity,” Clare Curran said.

“The outline of the hill is emblazoned on the breast pocket of school blazers of Taieri College. They are the citizens of the future and they care. Many businesses incorporate Saddle Hill in their corporate logos.

“Mediation obviously isn’t working. It’s time for the buck passing to stop and for the DCC, the Environment Court and the Environment Minister to step in to prevent further destruction,” Clare Curran said.
