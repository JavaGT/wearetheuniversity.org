Monorail rejection a victory for common sense

  
Today’s decision to reject a monorail in Fiordland’s Snowden Forest is the right one says Labour’s Conservation spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“From an economic and conservation perspective this is a victory for common sense .

“The Monorail would have had a major impact on a special part of Fiordland which is a mecca for trampers and visitors to New Zealand.

“New Zealanders were loud and clear in their opposition to this, with thousands signing a petition opposing the Monorail.

“I am delighted that the Monorail has been stopped in its tracks.”
