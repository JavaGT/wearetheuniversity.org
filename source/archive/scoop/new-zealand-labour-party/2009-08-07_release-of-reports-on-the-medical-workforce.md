Media Statement

Labour welcomes the release of reports on the medical workforce

Labour welcomes the release of a comprehensive set of reports into the training of New Zealand’s medical workforce, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.  
“I will be studying in detail the reports. However, I support the need for urgent changes to be made to junior doctor training,” Ruth Dyson said.  
“The Labour Government committed to improving workforce issues in the health sector and the reports released today are, in many cases, the result of that commitment.

“In July last year Labour called on Junior Doctors to participate in the RMO Workforce Commission to ensure that changes that would improve training and workforce sustainability were made.

“While we are pleased that the reports have been released I have serious concerns about the National Government’s commitment to improving the health workforce situation.

“The Minister of Health Tony Ryall has already confirmed that he will not be making any additional money available to settle wage claims for frontline health workers.

“Labour increased salary levels for frontline medical professionals, but without a commitment to fair bargaining from the Minister during upcoming contract negotiations my concern is that frontline medical professionals will leave New Zealand for better paying positions elsewhere.

“Tony Ryall has already broken his promise to improve frontline health services, by approving cuts to health services in Palmerston North, Whanganui, Timaru, Southland, Otago and Taranaki and by cutting funding for diabetes, mental health and cardiovascular programmes.

“Frontline health services and workforce are the two main issues facing the health sector. The National Government have already broken their promise on frontline services. How long will it be until they break their promise to tackle workforce issues?”
