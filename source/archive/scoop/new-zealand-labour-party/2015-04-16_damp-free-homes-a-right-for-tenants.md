Damp-free homes a right for tenants

**Damp-free homes a right for tenants**

Labour is urging tenants to use a little known rule which gives them the right to live in damp-free rental homes.

Otago University researchers have today highlighted the Housing Improvement Regulations 1947 as a way tenants can force landlords to fix unhealthy houses, Labour’s Associate Housing spokesperson Poto Williams says.

“The researchers have [called for](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/GE1504/S00064/overlooked-law-requires-rentals-to-be-free-of-dampness.htm) landlords to comply with these regulations until a modern set of standards is established.

“Too many Kiwi families renting cold, damp homes spend winters crowded around expensive-to-run heaters.

“The Government has been dragging its heels on improving the quality of rental properties. Its trial warrant of fitness only assessed 500 state houses which were already insulated. And its insulation scheme has had owner occupiers taking nearly all of the subsidies while landlords ignored it.

“Labour’s proposed legislation to introduce minimum standards for heating and insulation was defeated by just one vote last month.

“Labour will keep fighting so Kiwi families can live in warm, dry and healthy homes,” Poto Williams says.
