Cutting edge of education hits South Island

The entire South Island staff of the Tertiary Education Commission face losing their jobs this week in a move that Christchurch Central MP Brendon Burns says represents the first major cuts to South Island public service jobs.

Brendon Burns said that after less than three weeks consultation, the 14 TEC staff, most based in Christchurch, are expected to be told on Thursday that their jobs are among 70 or more being axed at the Commission.

“This is the cutting edge of education being delivered by this National/ACT/Maori Party government,” says Brendon Burns.

“Most of the TEC staff in Christchurch, Nelson and Dunedin are frontline, working to ensure taxpayers get good value for the money provided to private tertiary providers and schools with job training and language courses.”

Brendon Burns says there are more than 100 private training organisations around the South Island offering a huge variety of courses from hairdressing to horticulture.

“These organisations are all funded for their student numbers via the TEC and engage with the South Island staff. This service and scrutiny will now be replaced by a call centre in South Auckland. Is this how the Government will deliver its promises on excellence, improved standards and accountability in education?”

Brendon Burns said National in opposition both criticised some tertiary courses being provided and promised improved opportunities for 16 and 17 year olds to train at places other than school, but now it was reducing the oversight of tertiary providers when some were gearing up to gain more public funding.

“The axing of the TEC’s South Island office may be among the first public service jobs to go but they will not be the last,” he said.
