Last chance for Govt to listen on ECan

Last chance for Govt to listen on ECan  

  
Today’s rushed select committee hearings are the Government’s last chance to listen to the public’s overwhelming opposition to their undemocratic ECan plan, says Labour’s Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.

“Throughout the entire ECan saga, the Government has steadfastly refused to hear people in Canterbury who want the right to elect their own regional council – just like everywhere else in New Zealand.

“But today Government MPs have to listen to public submissions on their plan in Christchurch. It’s their last chance to open their ears and listen to what people have to say.

“It’s important we get this right. As Canterbury rebuilds we need all agencies working together to plan for the future – on issues from transport to how we protect our environment.  
Replacing ECan’s councillors with Government appointed commissioners robs Cantabrians of their voice in that conversation.

“The vast majority of submissions received by the select committee are opposed to the Government’s plan. It’s time for them to show they are listening,” says Megan Woods.
