Shipley ignores South Island

Prime Minister Jenny Shipley's decision to avoid leaders' debates in the South Island is utterly unacceptable, says Labour's campaign spokesperson and Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson.

"Both the Christchurch Press and the Otago Daily Times gave clear notice that they planned a leaders debate but in both cases the Prime Minister alone pulled out.

"The reason is that Mrs Shipley wants to get through the campaign without actually having to meet the public. She will run a hermetically sealed campaign because she is scared of meeting ordinary New Zealanders on their own turf. She is behaving like a control freak.

"It is ironic indeed that as a South Islander Mrs Shipley has scuttled two key opportunities for public participation in the South Island."
