Minister should quit over 100% failure

Minister should quit over 100% failure  

Environment Minister Nick Smith’s resignation should resign his portfolio in protest at the way an independent scientific report shows the Government has ignored best practice advice around improving water quality, says Labour’s water spokesman Brendon Burns.

The report, from the Cawthron Institute, was commissioned by Fish and Game New Zealand. It analyses the National Policy Statement on Freshwater Management as passed by the Cabinet in May and compares it with the original policy statement, developed by a Board of Inquiry chaired by former Environment Court judge David Sheppard.

“The Institute’s analysis says rather than introducing national standards as recommended to maintain or improve water quality, the Cabinet chose instead to allow regional councils to continue to determine what was acceptable,” Brendon Burns said.

“Councils are also able to off-set water quality improvements in some areas against further degradation in other waterways. As well Cabinet refused to require resource consents for new discharges or changes in land use intensity until councils had new policies in place to protect water quality. Those new standards don’t have to be in place for another 19 years.

“The report makes a mockery of Government promises to improve water quality. Nick Smith has ripped the guts out of the inquiry advice, and, in fact as the report states, his handling of this actually means water quality across our streams, rivers and lakes will continue to get worse.

“Nick Smith is well known for political bluster but he cannot back out of this one. As a trustee of the Cawthron Institute he knows it enjoys a huge reputation. The only honourable course is to resign his portfolio and signal his own frustration with his Cabinet’s pro-growth cabal headed by the Prime Minister,” Brendon Burns said.

“Mr Key’s own reputation is also damaged by this report. He recently told the BBC our water quality was second to none, and when quoted a Massey University scientist’s opposite view, replied that was just one scientist’s opinion. The Cawthron Institute’s report on the Cabinet’s NPS adds more reputable scientists to those who say publicly that New Zealand freshwater quality is poor and getting worse.

“The Labour Party, which commissioned the Board of Inquiry’s report, is committed to implementing its NPS to ensure water quality improves and does not continue to deteriorate as would happen under a re-elected National Government,” Brendon Burns said.
