**Joyce admits tertiary education promise overblown**

Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce was today forced to admit the Government’s Budget announcement of a further $113 million for tertiary education was overblown and actual new spending is a mere $7 million, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson David Cunliffe.

“On Budget Day, Steven Joyce announced a [further $113 million](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/further-113m-boost-tertiary-education-skills) of operating funding over four years for tertiary education.

“However when questioned at select committee the Minister conceded all but $7 million of that money comes from reallocations and is not new spending.

“National has been underfunding tertiary education sector for years.

“New Zealand now ranks near the bottom of the OECD on tertiary education spending per student.

“We are behind Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland and Israel; and well below the OECD average.

“Under National total spending on tertiary education has fallen from $3.194 billion in 2009 to $3 billion today.

“Steven Joyce is effectively starving the tertiary sector and selling short our children’s future,” David Cunliffe says.
