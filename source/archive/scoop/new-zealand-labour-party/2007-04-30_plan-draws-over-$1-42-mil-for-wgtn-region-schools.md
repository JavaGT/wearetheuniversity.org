Excellence plan draws over $1.42 million for Wellington region schools

Teachers at 28 Wellington region schools are getting extra practical help to hone their skills and help local students be the best they can be.

So says Labour MP Charles Chauvel, announcing $1,423,000 over the next four years in funding for three clusters of Wellington region schools:

\- The 'SWELL' cluster, led by Brooklyn School getting $491,000, includes South Wellington Intermediate, plus Brooklyn, Berhampore, Island Bay, Owhiro Bay, Houghton Valley, Newtown, Ridgway, St Anne's, St Bernard's, and St Frances de Sales schools.

\- The 'Wainuiomata Education Leadership & Learning' cluster also gets $491,000, is led by Wainuiomata Primary School, and includes Wainuiomata Intermediate and High schools, Arakura, and Pukeatua Primary Fernlea, St Claudine Thevenet, and Konini Primary schools.

\- The 'Levin' cluster, getting $441,000 is led by Waiopehu College, and includes Horowhenua College, Levin Intermediate, and Taitoko, Koputaroa, Poroutawhao, Fairfield, Ohau, and St Joseph's schools.

The local schools are part of the Labour-led government's Extending High Standards Across Schools initiative, which encourages highly effective schools to work more closely to share successful techniques. The project is worth $12 million over four years and involves over 70,000 students at 169 schools nationwide.

"The Labour-led government wants to see schools adopt a more collaborative approach, with more effective teaching, high standards for students and assessment for learning. So schools in this programme are tailoring learning to individual students, with teachers building a picture of what children know and how they learn, helping them to assess their progress, set goals and strive to achieve them," said Charles Chauvel.

"It's about education at the chalkface where it counts – helping students achieve more in reading, writing, maths, and technology.

"We want what all Kiwi parents want – kids with clear aspirations, who love school, inspired by teachers who know they can do well and expect that they will. The aim is to make young New Zealanders better able to figure out what they need to know and how to apply their knowledge. That's what transforming New Zealand into a knowledge-based economy is all about."
