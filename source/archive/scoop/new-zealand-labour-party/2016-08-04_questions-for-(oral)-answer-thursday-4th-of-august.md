**Questions for (Oral) Answer - Thursday 4th Of August**

While Parliament might be in recess, there are still plenty of things that Ministers need to answer for. So the Labour team has put together six of the best questions that the Government should be answering today (plus a special bonus question), Labour’s Shadow Leader of the House Chris Hipkins says.

QUESTION TO MINISTERS

1\. **ANDREW LITTLE** to the **Prime Minister**: When he said that New Zealand was on the cusp of something special did he mean that house prices in Auckland would rise at four times the rate of wage increases, and with 44% of workers not getting a pay rise last year, when will working New Zealanders see the benefit of economic growth?  
2\. **GRANT ROBERTSON** to the **Minister of Revenue**: How is it acceptable that half of the employers who owe Inland Revenue contributions to KiwiSaver are not making any payment towards the $28 million that is owed, and when will he actually stand up for taxpayers to get their fair share?  
3\. **PHIL TWYFORD** to the **Minister for Social Housing**: Does she regret directing National MPs to oppose an inquiry into homelessness given increasing social concern indicated by the hundreds of submissions to the cross party inquiry on homelessness, and will she put in a submission to the inquiry, which need to be in by the 12th of August?  
4\. **STUART NASH** to the **Minister of Police**: Why has she only funded half of the number of Police required to keep up with population growth in the last year and what responsibility does her failure to resource Police properly have for the increasing rate of assaults and burglaries?  
  
5\. **ANNETTE KING** to the **Minister of Health**: What new evidence did he receive that made him do a complete u-turn on the national rollout of safe sleeping bassinets for babies, given that the research showing that these significantly reduce the number of infant deaths was the same last week when he refused to fund them?  
  
6\. **Megan Woods** to the **Minister Responsible for the Earthquake Commission:** Does he have confidence coming up to the sixth anniversary of the first earthquake, that EQC has enough resources to handle the re-inspections and remedial repairs on its books, given it previously has resorted to hiring students to complete underfloor inspections?

**BONUS QUESTION: GRANT ROBERTSON** to **the Prime Minister**: Can he confirm that Beauden Barrett is, in fact, the best first-five in world rugby, and will replace Todd McClay in Cabinet if the Hurricanes win on Saturday? (Go The Canes!)
