No time for complacency

New Zealand is well prepared to handle a pandemic, but there is no room for complacency Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson and biosecurity spokesperson Kelvin Davis say.

During the last Labour Government extensive planning and stockpiling of medication in case of a pandemic took place.

“New Zealanders can be confident that their health professionals and health organisations have been prepared in case of such an emergency, Ruth Dyson said.

Ms Dyson said she wished the students and teachers affected a speedy recovery.

“It is important that we concentrate on containment of the outbreak and the recovery of those infected. She congratulated the New Zealand Medical Association on quickly moving to work with Ministry of Health to contain the situation.

“The Government must ensure all New Zealanders are kept safe and receive treatment they need. It must not be complacent or downplay the situation.”

Ms Dyson called on all 21 DHBs and the countries’ regional public health organisations to activate and update pandemic plans immediately.

“While to date the outbreak is confined to Auckland it is important for all health organisations to be ready in case of any further outbreaks.

Labour biosecurity spokesperson Kelvin Davis urged the Government to not to only concentrate on visitors from Mexico and North America.

“With the pace of international travel these days the swine flu virus could be anywhere and everywhere with sufferers not aware that their coughing and sneezing is potentially fatal,” Kelvin Davis said.

“Warnings should not be given to just travellers from Mexico, but to all travellers and all New Zealanders,” Kelvin Davis said.
