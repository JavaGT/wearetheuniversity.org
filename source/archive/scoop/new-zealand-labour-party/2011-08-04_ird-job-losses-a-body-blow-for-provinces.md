### IRD job losses a body blow for provinces

The indiscriminate nature of National’s public service job cuts is reinforced by today’s news that nearly 200 Inland Revenue jobs are set to be axed in regional offices, says Labour’s State Services spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“If ever New Zealand needed proof that the National Government has no jobs plan then this decision by Inland Revenue provides it,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Provincial areas like Rotorua, New Plymouth, Nelson, Invercargill and Napier generally cannot compensate for these sorts of large job losses.

“That’s even more the case when the Government has no plan to grow the economy, to increase exports and create jobs,” Ruth Dyson said.

“Rotorua, New Plymouth, Nelson, Invercargill and Napier all have National MPs. These five MPs, Todd McClay, Jonathan Young, Nick Smith, Eric Roy and Chris Tremain, are all absolutely silent on the loss of jobs and services in their constituencies.

“Under National, the economy is drifting and low and middle-income Kiwis are bearing the brunt while wealthy New Zealanders pocket thousands of dollars a week as a result of John Key’s and Bill English’s tax cuts for the already well-off.

“There is a common misconception that job cuts in the public services impact largely on Wellington,” Ruth Dyson said. “That’s not so. Provincial areas are the hardest hit.

“And the harsh reality is that provincial areas are those least well-placed to absorb job losses within their communities.”
