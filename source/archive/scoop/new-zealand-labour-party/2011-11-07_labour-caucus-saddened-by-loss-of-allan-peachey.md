Labour Caucus saddened by loss of Allan Peachey

The Labour Caucus wishes to express its condolences at the news of National MP Allan Peachey's death.

"Our deepest sympathy goes out to Allan's wife Jeanette and their children," says Labour Leader Phil Goff.

"Allan was a committed Member of Parliament, who served the people of Tamaki well for six years.

"Before entering Parliament, he was the principal of Rangitoto College - the largest secondary school in the country - and it became hugely popular under his leadership.

"His unstinting commitment to education continued when he entered Parliament. Allan's leadership of the select committee is a brilliant example of an MP achieving bipartisan support for education.

"His contributions and dedicated will be sorely missed," Phil Goff said.  

Authorised by Hon Phil Goff MP, Parliament Buildings, Wellington
