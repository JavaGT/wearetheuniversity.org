Media Statement

Silver in Slalom for Kiwi Adam Hall

  
The ICP Alpine World Championships are currently underway in South Korea. The Championships bring together over 280 athletes from 25 competing nations. This year New Zealand’s only representative – Adam Hall, from Otago, won the silver medal in the slalom.

“This is a fantastic achievement for a young man”, says Labour Disabilities Issues Spokesperson Lynne Pillay, we all feel such pride in success stories like this.

Adam is an inspiration, not only to disabled people, but for all New Zealanders who set goals and go to great lengths to achieve them.

Adam will also race in the Giant Slalom, followed the Super Giant Slalom and Super Combined today after only a days rest – we all wish him the very best for the upcoming competition.
