5 May 2009 Media Statement

Goff announces changes to shadow Cabinet and portfolio allocations

Labour Leader Phil Goff has today unveiled changes to his shadow Cabinet following the departure of the Rt Hon Helen Clark and Hon Michael Cullen, and the return of Hon Damien O’Connor.

“Both Michael and Helen made huge contributions to the party and New Zealand but the time has come to move forward,” Phil Goff said.

“I have also taken this opportunity to reallocate a number of portfolios within caucus.

Phil Goff said Chris Carter will take over the role of Opposition spokesperson on Foreign Affairs.

“Chris’ track record as a strong Minister of Ethnic Affairs and his excellent knowledge interest and international contacts will stand him in good stead to take on that role,” Phil Goff said.

“Trevor Mallard will return to Labour’s front bench to take over as Labour’s education spokesperson. Trevor is an experienced and effective Opposition MP. He is ideal for the job and well respected in the sector given his previous role as Minister of Education and his intimate knowledge of Education.

Shane Jones will take on the Economic Development and Environment portfolios.

“Shane’s commercial experience, work on the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission and his qualifications will make him valuable for the Labour with his new roles,” Phil Goff said.

Nanaia Mahuta has relinquished her role as Environment spokesperson and has taken on Maori social development. At her own request for personal reasons, she has moved off the front bench.

Other changes are outlined in the attached document.

“Labour is proving to be an effective Opposition party and the regional visits being made by myself and other caucus members to reconnect with the electorate are being warmly welcomed,” Phil Goff said.

“National faces challenging times. All eyes will be on the Government’s upcoming Budget for the first signs of a comprehensive plan to get New Zealand out of the recession.

“Labour will keep the pressure on John Key and his Government to ensure that the concerns of hardworking Kiwis are being taken seriously.

“As I said last year after taking over the leadership, I will be revisiting portfolio allocations in a year’s time,” Phil Goff said.
