**National Government ignorant, arrogant and out of touch**

“The incorrect and smart alec comments made at the United Nations by Judith Collins are just offensive,” said Ruth Dyson, the spokesperson for Canterbury Earthquake recovery.

“They demonstrate a total ignorance of the facts in relation to the Canterbury quakes and a disregard for the position that many in our communities have been left in.

“Judith Collins said that the government could not be found guilty of breaching human rights because they aren't in charge of the earthquakes. What she clearly doesn't know is that it is the decisions of the Government in relation to redzone offers  which has been found in the Court to be wrong and that it is this issue which has been taken to the United Nations.

“It is not the earthquakes that are causing the grief. It is the responses and the decisions of the Government which are causing the grief. Moving towards the third anniversary of the February quake and 3 and a half years from the September quake, we know there are many people who are waiting for their home to be repaired or rebuilt, including people who have used up their life savings on rental property during this time

“People have recently been redzoned without being given any information about why their home is suddenly seen to be life-threatening. They are left frustrated and powerless, and financially much worse off than pre-quakes.

“Judith Collins doesn't know what is happening in Canterbury.  She does not understand the difference between the reasons for redzoning on the flat lands and on the Port Hills. And yet she is making statements at the United Nations about these issues.

“She has embarrassed our country with her ignorance and arrogance. And she has left Cantabrians feeling angry at her contempt for the real life for many. The National Government needs to step up to their responsibilities instead of continuing to abandon us.”
