Auckland traffic fines may be invalid
=====================================

Have you received a parking ticket from Auckland City Council since March this year? It may be invalid, says Manukau East MP Ross Robertson.

Mr Robertson has identified that invalid traffic infringement notices are being issued by Auckland City Council, following a constituent’s query over a parking fine.

The ticket, written in July, was issued under the authority of the Transport Act 1962. On 1 March this year that Act was repealed, replaced by the Land Transport Act 1998.

Mr Robertson says that expert legal opinion has deemed that constituent’s parking ticket to be invalid. And if one ticket is invalid, thousands must be.

“This is a pointed reminder that Auckland City Council hasn’t done its homework. Manukau City Council has had the forethought to print infringement notices which covered both sets of legislation, which covered it during the period where the new legislation was being introduced and the old Transport Act repealed.

“It may be only a technicality, but it’s a technicality that could cost Auckland City Council hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue. I doubt that this oversight by council management will be appreciated by its ratepayers.”
