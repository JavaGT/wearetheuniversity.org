Labour - National standards information flawed

MEDIA STATEMENT  

Comparing schools using information collected through National Standards is a waste of time, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Sue Moroney.

“The Education Review Office, which is publishing data collected through National Standards, and which will result in comparison league tables, needs to ensure parents know how flawed the data is,” Sue Moroney said.

“You simply cannot compare schools using information collected using National Standards. The information isn’t moderated and therefore any comparisons made between schools would be wrong.

“Labour will give schools the option of scrapping National Standards, and I believe the vast majority will take up that option.

“The standards are nothing more than a PR slogan. The information being collected isn’t actually standard and comparisons using the information will be completely misleading.

“National have spent the last three years fighting with education sector, when what they should have been doing was working with schools in the best interests of students,” Sue Moroney said.
