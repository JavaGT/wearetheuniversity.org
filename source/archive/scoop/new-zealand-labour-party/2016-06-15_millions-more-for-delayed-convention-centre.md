MEDIA STATEMENT

**Millions more for delayed convention centre**

The price tag for the much delayed Canterbury Convention Centre has risen again, with millions more sunk into the project without even a completed business case, says Labour’s Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.

“Under questioning at select committee today, DPMC Chief Executive Andrew Kibblewhite confirmed that $19.5 million has been spent scoping the convention centre.

“Despite all this money, the Government is still unable to confirm when construction would begin or even when a business case might be completed.

“With major delays, persistent uncertainty about the final product and the news the initial design has been scrapped, Cantabrians will be wondering what is going on.

“You’d think for nearly $20 million of taxpayer’s money, Gerry Brownlee would have more to show for it than an empty lot,” says Megan Woods.
