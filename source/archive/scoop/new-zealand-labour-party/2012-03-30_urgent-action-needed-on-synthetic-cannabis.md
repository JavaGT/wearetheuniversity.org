Urgent Action Needed on Synthetic Cannabis

**Urgent action needed on synthetic cannabis**

Urgent action is required from the Government to keep unregulated synthetic cannabis off the shelves, says Labour’s Associate Health Spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway.

Associate Health Minister Peter Dunne has today announced a new suite of substances that will be banned for 12 months.

While Labour supported this interim approach, we are concerned that the Government is taking too long in introducing a full replacement to the Misuse of Drugs Act and that the first of the temporary bans could expire before new legislation is passed, said Iain Lees-Galloway.

“The first temporary ban was initiated last August. If legislation is not passed before August this year, that ban will expire and those drugs could be back on the shelf.

“Any proposed replacement to the Misuse of Drugs Act will attract considerable public attention and hundreds if not thousands of submissions. The legislative process cannot be rushed. It’s not something we can afford to get wrong. Even now, time is running out. Peter Dunne has to get on with the job.

“What is needed is a comprehensive and scientific approach to regulating new substances. We cannot go on continually banning new substances after they have come on to the market.

“New Zealand needs a 21st century approach to drug law.”

ENDS
