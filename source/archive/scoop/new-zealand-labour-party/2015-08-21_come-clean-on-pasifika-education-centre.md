**Come clean on Pasifika education centre**

Minister Peseta Sam Lotu-Iinga needs to come clean and tell the Pasifika communities if he’s working to save the Pasifika Education Centre or shut it down, Labour’s Pasifika spokesperson Su’a William Sio says.

“I’m gutted the Pasifika Education Centre funding will be substantially cut. The Minister must say what his plans for the centre are. Will his legacy be destroying a vital community learning asset for Pacific people?

“The Tertiary Education Commission surprised the Board of Pasifika Education Centre by advising in May that instead of providing 80 percent funding, it will now provide less than five percent funding for the 2015/2016 financial year – that’s more than a $700,000 cut.

“If the centre is forced to wind up New Zealand will lose one of the oldest Pasifika education centres serving communities for decades.

“Also needs to answer why his Government is gutting the centre after his ministry signed off its 2014-2018 strategy?

“This centre is a charitable trust which exists to preserve, maintain and promote the use of Pacific languages. The Minister must save this vital community asset,” says Su’a William Sio.
