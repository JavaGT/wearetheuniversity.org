Autism support should be a priority
===================================

Grant  
ROBERTSON  
Health Spokesperson

19 July 2011 STATEMENT

**Autism support should be a priority**

The extra demands families with autistic children face in meeting the challenges of every-day life highlight the need for continuing support, Labour’s Health spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“We all know that bringing up children is an important and challenging role. For a parent of a child with autism there are huge demands, and that’s where services that provide essential support and advice – like Autism New Zealand- come in.

“Sadly that service is now at risk because of the government’s inconsistent priorities,” Grant Robertson said.

His comments follow a visit by Labour Leader Phil Goff to Hamilton today, where he met with two families who have autistic children.

“Phil saw just how committed and uncomplaining the parents were in dealing with the challenges they face. But they still need support.

“Now Autism Waikato is having to shut up shop. That’s left six staff without jobs and 760 families without the valuable support they provided,” Grant Robertson said.

“The National government has made great claims about protecting frontline services. Well, you can’t get much more frontline than this.

“The agency is being told that they don’t fit Social Development funding parameters, yet they are limited as to what resources are available from the Health sector. The Government has budgeted $5 million for autism support this year – that amounts to little more than $120 per person with autism in New Zealand.

“We all know that money is tight at the moment, but that’s a pittance. Support for organisations like Autism New Zealand should be a priority,” Grant Robertson said.
