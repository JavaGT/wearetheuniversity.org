Labour supports legislation to speed up rebuilding Canterbury

“Labour remains committed to a bipartisan approach to rebuilding the city and we will be supporting this legislation so that the people of Canterbury can get on with rebuilding their region,” Phil Goff said.

“However, Labour will be monitoring its operation to ensure it does not override legitimate rights while allowing streamlining.

“The people of Canterbury now need to get on with the job of putting their lives and their region back together and the last thing Labour wants is for people to be prevented from doing this,” Phil Goff said.

Labour earthquake recovery spokesman Clayton Cosgrove said he had already spoken with Gerry Brownlee and informed him that Labour would be supporting the legislation.

“I am pleased that Labour and National are working together to take the necessary steps to have legislation put in place. Gerry Brownlee has committed to consult with me over any changes to legislation,” Clayton Cosgrove said.  
“He has also agreed that all such changes will be scrutinised by the Regulations Review Committee. These changes will ensure that the interests of ratepayers and other Kiwis in Canterbury can be properly safeguarded, while allowing earthquake response and recovery work to proceed immediately.

“This legislation does not mean a cowboy approach to rebuilding the city but rather means that rebuilding work that needs to start now can get underway,” Clayton Cosgrove said.
