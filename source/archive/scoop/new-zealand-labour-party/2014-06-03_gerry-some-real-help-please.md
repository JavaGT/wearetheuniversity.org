Gerry some real help please

  
Reports that the rebuild of the Christchurch CBD is starting to kick in ignores the fact that it’s now well over three years since the earthquakes hit, says Canterbury Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Ruth Dyson .

“After all this time things should start to have been moving. The fact is progress has been painfully slow and many Christchurch citizens are still in a living hell.

“The comments of city leaders that Christchurch’s confidence has been dented and needs to be restored, must be listened to.

“It is great that Vodafone committed to the city’s innovation precinct this morning, but sadly many others have given up in the face of bureaucracy from CERA or delays from insurance companies.

“In the suburbs things are getting worse not better. People are now entering their fourth winter with wrecked homes and no idea when damage will be repaired. Insurance companies and the EQC are resorting to offering cash settlements to make their books and numbers look better. People are now having to do their own fix-ups.

“The insurance companies and the EQC need a wake-up call from the Minister Gerry Brownlee to help those who are facing another long winter.”
