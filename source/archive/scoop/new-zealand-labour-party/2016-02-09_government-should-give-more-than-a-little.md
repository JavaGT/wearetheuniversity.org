Government should give more than a little

The Government should make this a Waitangi weekend to remember by agreeing to meet the remaining cost of buying Awaroa beach so this beautiful piece of New Zealand will be available to future generations, says Opposition Leader Andrew Little.

  
“The Prime Minister should follow the lead of thousands of Kiwis who have already stumped up half the purchase price because they see this beach as more than just any old piece of land.

“More than 11,000 people have chipped in to the campaign because they care and they see access to as much of our coastline as possible as a birth-right. Tenders for the sale close on February the 16th,” says Andrew Little.
