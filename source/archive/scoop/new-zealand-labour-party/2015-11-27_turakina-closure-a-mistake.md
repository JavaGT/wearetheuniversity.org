Turakina closure a mistake

Turakina closure a mistake  

  
The Ministry of Education has failed Maori by allowing years of debt to rack up then closing the iconic Turakina Maori Girls’ College at Christmas, says Labour’s Te Tai Hauauru MP Adrian Rurawhe.

“The timing has been completely inconsiderate as senior students have to contend with important external exams while coping with the added pressure of closure.

“Hekia Parata has had ample time to review the books and find alternative governance structures so the failure lies squarely with the Ministry.

“The Minister said the school failed to show they had companies, people or money committed to a special fundraising plan but that’s counter to what I’ve heard in meetings with whanau, the community and supporters dedicated to keeping Turakina open.

“The Presbyterian Church has also failed the students and the Maori community by not keeping appropriate accounting records and allowing whanau to pay their bills late.

“The Government has shown a clear lack of commitment to Maori education and this decision is hugely disappointing for all the supporters and whanau,” says Adrian Rurawhe.
