Guy gets it wrong by any measure

Guy gets it wrong by any measure  

The Ministry for Primary Industries being forced to reprint rulers designed to help recreational fishers measure their snapper catch is right up there on the incompetence scale, Labour’s Fisheries spokesperson Damien O’Connor says.

“MPI is having to spend another $8000 to reprint thousands of rulers that didn’t show the country’s most popular fishing region – Snapper One in the Hauraki Gulf.

“How anyone could get that wrong is beyond belief, yet Nathan Guy has it wrong by any measure.

“The whole quota saga has been a shambles from the start, with the Government bending any which way to appease the big fishing companies while at the same time shafting recreational fishers.

“The new rules are wrong, now the rulers are wrong.

“While MPI - as usual - appear less than concerned, they should be highly embarrassed by this latest gaffe,” Damien O’Connor said.
