**National’s cuts will affect front line force**

The Police Minister’s preoccupation with cost cutting will threaten front line Police officers’ ability to prevent and investigate crime Labour’s Police spokesperson Kris Faafoi said today.

“Kiwis want their Police force strongly resourced and with strength in numbers. The deferral of the January intake at the Police College in my electorate, and further cuts to budgets, is putting that at risk,” Kris Faafoi said.

“Deferring recruitment intakes puts huge pressure on the front line. Labour exposed National’s deferment plans during the election campaign and has forced National to back down.

“Like in all areas of Government spending, efficiencies need to be found in difficult economic times. But cuts which directly affect the number of cops we have on patrol rightly concern Kiwis.

“We all want the security of knowing there will be enough cops out on the beat and that when we call for help they will come. National’s cuts could jeopardise that,” Kris Faafoi said.
