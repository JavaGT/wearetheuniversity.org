**Labour mourns loss of Sir Geoffrey Henry**

Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson, Su’a William Sio, wishes to pass his regrets to the family of former Cook Islands Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Henry, who lost his battle with cancer overnight.

“Labour is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Sir Geoffrey Henry,” Su’a William Sio said.

“He was a shining star of Cook Islands politics, and helped to form and then lead the Cook Islands Party through many years of success.

“He had an historic lineage as cousin to the Cook Islands founding leader, Albert Henry. He was a friend to New Zealand and studied here at Wellington at Victoria University.

“The last time I saw him was in 2011 during the Pacific mission and he seemed well to me then. I am sorry to hear his illness defeated him so soon,” Su’a William Sio said.

“Sir Geoffrey was a passionate supporter of rugby and was an active and happy personality.

“On behalf of my Labour colleagues I am passing our sincerest condolences to his extended family and to his surviving spouse and children,” Su’a William Sio said.
