**Labour’s Maori caucus welcomes Meka Whaitiri’s selection**

Labour’s Maori caucus have welcomed the selection of Meka Whaitiri to represent the Labour Party in Ikaroa-Rawhiti.

The selection took place today at St Joseph's Maori Girls College in Taradale, Napier, at a meeting of about 400 Labour Party members.

"We are heartened at the strong interest in this selection contest and it was evident in the high calibre of candidates that threw their name into the ring. Ultimately there can only be one candidate for this by-election and I am sure that Meka will represent her people well and be a formidable candidate" said Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta.

"I'm pleased to see another talented Maori woman standing for Labour. Meka is deeply committed to community development, rangatahi, economic development and better opportunities for all women," said Moana Mackey.

"The rejuvenation of the party membership in Ikaroa-Rawhiti is a clear sign that Maori want to see Labour back on the Government benches," said Louisa Wall.

"Meka Whaitiri is no stranger to the political environment. She has been a public servant, an adviser in a Minister’s office and is currently serving her people as Chief Executive for Ngati Kahungunu. Meka's skills will be a great asset to our Labour team," said Rino Tirikatane.

The Maori caucus are looking forward to campaigning alongside Meka Whaitiri and her people to retain the Ikaroa-Rawhiti seat.
