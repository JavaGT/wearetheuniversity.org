Labour’s plan to end homelessness

  
Labour has a comprehensive approach to end homelessness starting with the provision of emergency housing for 1000 people each year and putting an end to slum conditions in boarding houses, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.

“Labour believes that homelessness is not a lifestyle choice. That’s why we will take action to provide more emergency housing so vulnerable New Zealanders are not left to sleep on the streets or in their cars.

“We will redirect $5 million from National’s failed bureaucratic Reviewable Tenancies policy to fund supported emergency housing for 1000 people each year. We will commission a working group of government agencies, councils, and stakeholders to develop a homelessness action plan, and we will establish a licensing regime and minimum standards for boarding houses to weed out rogue operators.

“Labour will fund the provision of emergency housing through a contestable fund so agencies like Monte Cecilia and the Salvation Army can manage the houses and provide support to help people get their lives back on track and then move into more sustainable long term housing.

“Within the first six months we will also build 400 Kiwibuild homes in Canterbury ear marked for emergency housing, given the acute housing crisis there. The Government estimates there are up to 7400 Cantabrians homeless or living in temporary, overcrowded or substandard housing.

“Homelessness is a serious issue in New Zealand that is far too often overlooked. Labour will ensure it is no longer swept under the carpet,” David Cunliffe said.
