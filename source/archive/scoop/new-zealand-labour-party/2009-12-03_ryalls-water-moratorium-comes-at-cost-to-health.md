Ryall’s water moratorium will come at cost to health

A modest improvement in the number of New Zealanders drinking safe water is being put at risk especially in rural areas by Government policy changes, says Labour’s water quality spokesman Brendon Burns.

He says while the Ministry of Health’s annual survey of drinking water quality for 2007-08 shows 83 percent of New Zealanders are now drinking water judged safe – up three percent - there are some worrying trends.

The survey recorded 36 local authorities failing to act when drinking water was found to be faecally contaminated, 10 more than 2006-07, Brendon Burns said. Compliance with bacteriological standards failed in 80 zones run by local authorities, up from 62 non-compliant zones run by local bodies in 2006-07.

Brendon Burns says the Government’s move to delay meeting World Health Organisation minimum standards for safe drinking water will not encourage any reduction in these figures.

“A recent report commissioned by Local Government New Zealand shows more than 60 percent of local authorities would not have done nothing, or carried out only some of the changes required to improve drinking water quality, if not compelled to do so by 2007 legislation.

“Mr Ryall continually asserts that the provision of safe drinking water is a local government responsibility. Yet, his three-year-moratorium on meeting minimum WHO standards is prolonging non-compliance,” Brendon Burns said.

“At some point, Mr Ryall will have to take responsibility for failing to require or encourage the provision of safe water to the 17 percent of New Zealanders, most living in rural areas, who still do not have access to an assured supply.

“This cannot be dismissed simply as people getting tummy bugs. Tens of thousands of people are hit every year and water-borne illnesses such as campylobacter, giardia and cryptosporidium can make you very sick, and even cause death,” Brendon Burns said.

“Meanwhile, Mr Ryall is having Treasury apply the blowtorch to the funding already provided to assist small communities to make their drinking water safe.”
