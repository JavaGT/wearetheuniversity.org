Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 115

A regular bulletin started by the Labour Party's Christchurch electorate MPs, Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central) to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.

Description: CANTERBURY EARTHQUAKE RECOVERY PLAN Labour will:  
\* Purchase 1500 properties and sell them at cost to red zoned residents  
\* Ring-fence $100 million as compensation for home improvements  
\* Release all available geotechnical information  
\* Resolve the insurance gridlock  
\* Intervene in the insurance market as a last resort  
\* Make community engagement a priority  
\* Use youth unemployment to fill the skills gap  
\* Establish an independent insurance commissioner

CLAYTON COSGROVE: I dropped into a number of small and medium businesses yesterday, some in the construction and some in the retail sector. Generally things remain flat and businesses report that, as expected, people have put their wallets away. All report a contraction in spending at a local level as people wait for insurance companies to reengage. I visited some schools yesterday where parents and teachers are still scratching their heads as to why the Government would effectively sack 167 full time teachers, or insist schools use their operating budgets to maintain staff. Everyone is aware that eventually once the gridlock is broken families will resettle and those teaching places will be required again. The Government's move is a short-sighted cost-cutting measure.

BRENDON BURNS: Yesterday after months of trying, I was able to get Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee to meet the IconIC group (Interests in Conserving the Identity of Christchurch) which has been battling since March to ensure we save some of our heritage buildings. As we began our meeting yesterday I announced I was stepping down as co-chair of IconIC. Getting Gerry to meet the group had been an initial objective. As with the group I brought together which later became CANCern, having an Opposition politician involved may not always assist even if they are trying not to be political I did ensure yesterday Mr Brownlee had every chance to hear and be heard and I can only hope it sparks a change in Government's approach before it is too late. While the signals were not promising, at least we were able to meet him and put the case for saving some of what's left of Christchurch's heritage. Erratum. I said yesterday State Insurance was formed after the Napier earthquake. In fact it was well-established by then. However, after the Napier quake, insurers dodged their responsibilities, pointing to fine print saying fire after a quake was not covered (Napier's CBD was razed after the quake.) Only State Insurance, then Government owned, agreed to make a payment, causing unsuccessful legal action by the other insurers.

LIANNE DALZIEL: I am concerned that the powers that be still don't understand community engagement. I have received an email from a constituent about the council's decision to cancel the Spencerville Holiday programme without any notice to the people who have used this service. This is despite the fact that the council has all of their contact details on a database. Apparently the last programme did not reach the required numbers. I wonder why? This shows little understanding of the situation Brooklands and Spencerville residents have endured in the last 12 months. Many had to move out after the September earthquake and then again after February (seven months ago today), but many have now moved back and will be more than disappointed that the programme has been cancelled. People need to be supported through this difficult time and I am afraid the council has to do better than this. Community engagement means listening to the community and acting on the needs that are identified.

RUTH DYSON: A year and a bit on from its tragic demise, the Heathcote Tavern is up and running again, in a new building on the original site. This news is the buzz of the valley and will provide friendly competition for the BYO pub which has been operating, originally every Friday and Saturday night but now just on a Friday night. Both will provide great focal points for the community, alongside Upshot which still serves the best coffee! Another market has popped up - this time in Redcliffs. It's being held every Wednesday afternoon in the car ark behind the Spur. It's good to see this happening as it is an opportunity for a real win/win - for the locals who are without their local Redcliffs supermarket for a while yet and who can shop and catch up with people, but also for the stallholders, many of whom have lost a huge number of their previous customers as a result of the quakes. And the news from Statistics NZ that 28 people each day are leaving Christchurch to live overseas needs to be a big wakeup call for the Government to rapidly develop and implement an action plan to keep our skilled and passionate people in our region.
