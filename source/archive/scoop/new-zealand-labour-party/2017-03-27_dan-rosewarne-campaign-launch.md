**Dan Rosewarne - Campaign Launch**

On Saturday Kaiapoi residents headed down to 12 Carew St to hear Dan Rosewarne’s campaign launch speech. Dan said that 12 Carew St is a symbolic location to mark the start of his campaign. This was the house Ex-Prime Minister, Norman Kirk built shortly before he became the Mayor of Kaiapoi.

Dan said – “This house we stand in front of today serves as a reminder of a self-made man who rose from the working class to become the Prime Minister of New Zealand – A man who never forgot where he came from.” Dan further stated that – “Today, when there is so much uncertainty out there in the world I think it is important to look for inspiration from our people who have provided genuine leadership from the likes of Norman Kirk.”

It was also an opportunity for Dan to outline his and Labour’s vision for the Waimakariri electorate as well as highlighting some of the local issues that have been brought up while he had been out door knocking.

“Traffic congestion is a huge issue” said Dan. Dan said, “Yes you could put in a third Southbound lane on the Waimak bridge, however it no doubt will end in a congested mess further South and you are presented with the same problem you had before. There is good evidence that Canterbury wants and needs a strategic multi model transport infrastructure system that provides a range of transport options so we don’t end up with the commuter issues we see in Auckland”

Dan closed his speech by saying that “Labour is up for the battle this year. We are working hard to win back the Waimak. I am up for it. I am looking forward to meeting you all throughout the campaign and proving to you that I can be your MP!
