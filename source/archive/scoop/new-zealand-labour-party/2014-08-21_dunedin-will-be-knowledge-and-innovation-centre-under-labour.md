Labour Leader

  
21 August 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Dunedin will be a knowledge and innovation centre under Labour**

Dunedin will become a knowledge and innovation centre under a Labour Government that will back local businesses, support technology initiatives and fund dynamic regional projects, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.

“Nowhere has the National Government’s short-sightedness been more apparently than in its decision to gut Invermay. AgResearch’s facility provides invaluable contribution to the productivity of our livestock farmers.

“Labour will keep Invermay open as a fully functioning agricultural science research centre. We will continue to back Invermay both as a productivity driver for our agricultural sector and the heart of cutting edge science in Otago.

“Labour will also support innovation and technology initiatives such as the Start Up space which I am visiting today.

“A Labour Government will create 3000 more jobs in Otago by the end of our first term through our Economic Upgrades for forestry, manufacturing, fisheries, information technology and small businesses.

“And local projects such as reopening and upgrading parts of the Hillside workshop will be able to access funding through our $200 million Regional Development Fund, aimed at supporting local projects which provide an economic step-change for their regions.

“Labour will also reverse years of neglect by the National Government which has allowed the Dunedin Hospital deteriorate to such an extent that operations have had to be cancelled.

We will invest at least $250 million into a rebuild which will begin in our first term.

“And our health policy will make it easier for Otago’s 32,000 over 65-year-olds and 30,000 kids under 13 to stay healthy though free GP visits and prescriptions. Pregnant women and low-income earners will also benefit.

“A Labour Government will help Dunedin become one of our best and brightest cities,” David Cunliffe says.
