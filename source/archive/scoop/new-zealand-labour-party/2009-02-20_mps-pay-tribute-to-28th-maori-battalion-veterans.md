MPs pay tribute to 28th Maori Battalion veterans

Labour leader Phil Goff and Maori Affairs spokesman Parekura Horomia today paid tribute to members of the 28th Maori Battalion who gathered at Putiki Marae for their annual reunion.

The pair today attended the powhiri for the event, at which about 28 veterans and over 500 of their whanau and supporters are expected over the weekend.

“These men gave their all for “God, King and Country” and their bravery and courage will never be forgotten. That so many are attending this event is a demonstration of how much that contribution is honoured,” Mr Goff said.

“One man to whom particular tribute needs to be paid today is Jim Takarangi who passed away just a few weeks ago. He was a 28th Maori Battalion veteran, the national president of the battalion, and was responsible for organising much of this reunion, which had been particularly special because Putiki is his own marae.  
Jim Takarangi worked tirelessly to preserve not only the mana of the 28th Maori Battalion, but his local hapu and iwi as well.”

Mr Goff welcomed the presence on the marae of the Victoria Cross awarded posthumously to Lieutenant Te Moananui-a-Kiwa Ngarimu.

He said today’s powhiri had a particular poignancy for him because the sword awarded to Te Arawa by the Duke of York to honour the gallantry of the 28th Maori Battalion’s Lance Sergeant Haane Manahi was also brought onto the marae during it.

“The sword and other gifts of recognition were presented in 2007 after many entreaties by Te Arawa and others who believed the courageous soldier deserved further official recognition. I joined these supporters in travelling to the Palace in London to make the case, which resulted in the gifts – and it was moving today to see how the sword is treasured by the battalion.

Parekura Horomia said as the veterans became older, the annual reunions became more and more special.

“These veterans are a taonga and an inspiration. They, together with the Pioneer (Maori) Battalion of WWI, remind all of us of the huge contribution Maori have made towards the wellbeing of this country.”
