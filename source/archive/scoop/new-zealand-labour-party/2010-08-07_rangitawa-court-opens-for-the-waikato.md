Rangitawa Court opens for the Waikato

**Rangitawa Court opens for the Waikato**

Labour MP for Hauraki-Waikato Nanaia Mahuta says she is pleased to see the justice system reaching out to communities and the recognition that a Rangatahi court could work for young people in the Waikato.

  
The launch of the Waikato Rangitawa Court took place at Te Ohaaki Marae, Huntly today.

“I was particularly heartened to hear the speech from Chief District Court Judge Russell Johnson who commended the roll out of the 6 rangatahi courts throughout the country as a means of ensuring the justice system reaches out to the community in ways that those affected by it are treated fairly,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Too many young Maori are apprehended as offenders and are then locked into the justice system. I want to see the trend change and if rangatahi courts will form a critical part of that process then I am happy to support it.

“Youth advocates, community services, youth workers, drug and alcohol services, Kirikiriroa marae, and CYF are just a few of the critical partners that will contribute to the rangatahi court.

“The stark reality remains that more must be done to engage young Maori to be the best they can be in their whanau, in their communities, and in our society.

“I want to support all communities who want to stand up and make a positive contribution to the lives of young people that will see more positive outcomes.”

The rangatahi court will have its first scheduled sitting at Kirikiriroa marae, Hamilton on 15th September.
