Government limits opportunity for Māori development
===================================================

Government limits opportunity for Māori development  

  
The Government’s recent decision to cease funding for the only Māori Centre of Research Excellence – Ngā Pae o te Maramatanga – is a slap in the face for Māori research knowledge, said Labour’s Associate Research, Science and Innovation spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.

“It's clear the Māori Party have supported a funding decision which knee caps an institution that has grown the number of PhD graduates and research topics.

“Māori Innovation is key to enhancing and leveraging economic and social advancement.

“The Government cannot on the one hand talk about the huge contribution that Māori make to our country without supporting Maori knowledge and research capacity.

“This decision smacks of the short-sighted and narrow view of this Government led by Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce, which seeks to dismiss the value of Māori knowledge.

“A Labour government would support a centre of excellence for high quality Māori research to leverage the huge Māori economic base and to contribute to improved wellbeing outcomes.

“Labour is committed to growing New Zealand’s full potential as a nation and recognition of Māori knowledge is an important part of that goal,” Nanaia Mahuta says.
