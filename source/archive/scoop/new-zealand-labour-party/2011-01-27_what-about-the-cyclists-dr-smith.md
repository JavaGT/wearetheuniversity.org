**What about the cyclists Dr Smith?**

ACC Minister Nick Smith needs to pay urgent attention to cycle safety and is challenging him to set up a similar fund and Advisory Committee as he has done for motor cyclists, Labours Transport Safety spokesperson Darien Fenton says.

"It has been a horrific start to the New Year with one cyclist a week being killed on our roads so far,” said Darien Fenton.

"This is at least as bad as the rate of motorcycle deaths, but Dr Smith only acted on this when thousands of bikers turned up to parliament to protest.

"When cyclists protested in Tamaki Drive last year, the Minister of Transport Steven Joyce said reducing cycling deaths would take an attitude change. An attitude change requires education and the government needs to take responsibility.

“The two million dollars from ACC to improve motorcycle safety should be matched for cyclist safety.

"After all cycling deaths and injuries impact on ACC costs and levies too, as well as families and communities.

"How many more cyclists will lose their lives before the government acts?" Darien Fenton said.
