National Standards is a national shambles

Labour wants high standards in schools and for parents to know how their children are doing, but the Government’s process for National Standards is now National’s shambles, Labour leader Phil Goff said today.

“Anne Tolley is simply not up to the job. She has managed to get offside with everyone in the sector, like principals, whose cooperation she needs to actually raise standards. She has refused to listen to advice from parents, teachers or education experts, such as Dr John Hattie,” Phil Goff said.

“Rather than closing down Pita Sharples’ concerns John Key should have sacked Mrs Tolley rather than just demoting her.

“Dr Sharples has spoken to schools and now recognises the process is rushed and that untested National Standards pose a ‘grave’ danger to children’s education and he is clearly unhappy that he has not been adequately consulted.

“The $200,000 taxpayer funded propaganda campaign shows John Key now realises how badly this process has been run.

“He has announced this on the same day that the Government said there is no money for Te Hurihunga, a programme that actually works and makes our communities safer.

Mr Goff said the advisory panel announced today should trial National Standards before they are rolled out nationally, instead of evaluating them later. And it must be independent

“The way things have been run so far has exposed Anne Tolley and the National Party as hypocrites. They want school kids assessed but don’t want their own system to be assessed.

“The process is rushed and untested and there is a huge amount of concern that the proposed testing scheme will do more harm than good.

“The Government should take a deep breath and approve a trial which would involve a random sample of schools to road test the new standards.

“The process would be run by an independent guardians group made up of parents, teachers and academics and headed by a leading educationalist, to provide independence to the research process.

“It would include a rigorous assessment of any added value of National Standards compared with current formative assessment practices, such as AsTTle, and would cost a fraction of the $26 million the Government is spending on its wider PR campaign.

“That way, parents can be assured that the new system will not do more harm than good,” Mr Goff said.
