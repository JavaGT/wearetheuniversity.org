Factory closure end of an era for Hamilton

Today's closure of the Huttons factory in Hamilton is the end of an era which has provided incomes for generations of local families, Hamilton-based Labour MPs Sue Moroney and Nanaia Mahuta say.

"The loss of these 120 jobs will hit the affected families and the Hamilton economy hard,” Sue Moroney said.

She said the region faced a bleak future under the current Government.

"These job losses come on top of lay-offs announced at AgResearch's Ruakura campus, NZ Post, Huntly mines and Genesis Energy.”

Nanaia Mahuta said most of the Huttons staff were yet to find alternative employment.

"Unemployment has remained high in the Waikato region and this closure will only add further pressure to the job market.

"The region desperately needs a Government with a plan for economic development in heartland New Zealand."

Sue Moroney, who spearheaded a community initiative that looked for an alternative to the sale of the Huttons Factory to Hellars - which led to the closure - said it was disappointing the alternative bid wasn’t deemed acceptable to Goodman Fielder.

“That would have kept the factory operating," she said.

Both MPs are working with FIRST Union to ensure the redundant workers are supported to find alternative work and get access to financial support.
