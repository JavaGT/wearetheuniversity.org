Racing clubs again hit Eureka jackpot

**MP for Christchurch Central**

**Media Statement**  
**Racing clubs again hit Eureka jackpot**

Racing clubs are again the biggest beneficiaries of community grants pay outs by Christchurch-based Eureka Trust, causing local Labour MP Brendon Burns to say he’ll now lodge a complaint.

The Christchurch Central MP says South Island racing clubs have again hoovered up nearly 20 percent of the latest $1.3m distributed, most of it from Canterbury bars in the Robbies chain which use Eureka to channel pokie machine profits. \*

Brendon Burns will lodge a complaint about Eureka Trust with the Department of Internal Affairs.

Brendon Burns says Pub Charity made only a handful of very small grants to racing clubs and the Southern Trust approved none, whereas Eureka Trust did not decline any racing club’s application.

“But it did say no to dozens of organisations helping those in need such as Community House, the Phillipstown Community Centre, Christchurch schools and sports clubs,” Brendon Burns said.

“Hitting the jackpot is the Oamaru Harness Racing Club which got $75,000. That’s despite Oamaru not having, according to the Eureka website, any bars in the district which contribute to the Eureka Trust’s funds.

“The Cheviot Harness and Racing Club, which again has no contributing bar or club listed, got $20,000. All up, racing clubs have taken more than a quarter of a million in allocated funds.

“Eureka Trust members, who are well-paid for their task, should explain why they continue to take money out of poorer communities in Christchurch and fund racing clubs, especially those in rural areas.

“There are about 1900 pokie machines in Christchurch generating around $90m in income – more than $250 for every man, woman and child. The pokies are concentrated in lower decile areas. Morally that money should come back to those communities.

“Instead, it’s being diverted into such activities as providing stake money for racing clubs. This is gambling supporting gambling – at the expense of those who most need the money back in their communities, especially in these tough times,” said Brendon Burns.

_\* By law, 37 percent of the gross proceeds of pokie machines must be distributed to charitable purposes._
