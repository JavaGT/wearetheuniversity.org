MEDIA STATEMENT

New Zealand needs decision not delay on minimum wage

It’s clear Prime Minister John Key is unable and unwilling to make the tough calls after his decision to take the minimum wage off Cabinet’s agenda, Labour spokesperson Trevor Mallard said today.

Promises from the Government that a decision “won’t be far away” will be of little help to the thousands of workers earning around the minimum wage of $12 an hour, he said.

During the election campaign John Key pledged to reduce the wage gap between New Zealand and Australia. But when faced with the opportunity to do just that for the lowest paid Kiwis he’s balked, Trevor Mallard said.

“It’s time the Prime Minister made good on his promise.

“All the information needed to make a decision on lifting the minimum wage has been available since October,” Trevor Mallard said.

“The nine times the previous Labour Government reviewed the minimum wage, Cabinet had made final decision by Christmas.

“The pre-election caretaker convention prevented Labour from taking any action on the minimum wage last year, but nothing is preventing John Key and his ministers from taking action.

“The lowest paid New Zealanders need certainty about what they’ll earn and whether they can pay their bills. It’s time for some positive news on the economy. I’m sure all New Zealanders hope the Government can provide it.

“What they’re getting from National is indecision and delays”
