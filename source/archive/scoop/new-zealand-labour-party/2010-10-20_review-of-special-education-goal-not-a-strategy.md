Review of Special Education: goal not a strategy
================================================

**Review of Special Education: a goal is not a strategy**

  
The much anticipated review of special education has a laudable goal of creating 80% of schools as being fully inclusive schools by 2014, but is sadly lacking in any detail of how the goal will be reached." Grant Robertson Labour Spokesperson on Special Education said.

" It is heartening to see that the government has bought into a goal of more inclusive schools, but there is nothing in the announcement so far today that gives me confidence they have a plan to reach this goal, let alone a fully inclusive system."

" The funding announcement heralded today is already two years old, and many parents and their families are not getting the support they need now. A simple continuation of that funding will not make for fully inclusive schools. The announcements today are vague on how schools will be assessed as fully inclusive and what will happen if they are not meeting this goal."

" In announcing the review Rodney Hide has said it is not better resourcing but a better attitude that will make the difference in creating an inclusive schooling environment. Attitude can only go so far, resourcing is still the big issue."

" It is particularly good to see the commitment to improved teacher training and transitions between early childhood and schools and post school activity. With proper resourcing these will make an important difference.

" The report also talks about better coordination among agencies and improved systems and processes. But for many parents they have heard it all before, and it is understandable if they are sceptical about today's announcements. Moreover there will be cold comfort for parents and students if the result of this is simply a more efficient way of being told that you have not been granted funding."

" The delay until 2014 of national standards incorporating students with special needs is a testament to the ridiculous haste in which this policy was put in place, and will leave a number of students outside of the system for the next three years."

" Labour will be pushing the government for more details and a more certainty for parents, students and schools." Grant Robertson said.
