PRESS RELEASE - FOR IMMEDIATE USE

Sutton wins Labour nomination for Epsom

Kate Sutton is excited to have been confirmed as Labour's candidate for  
Epsom at next year's general election.

"It is a great honour and privilege to have been selected to represent  
Labour in Epsom. At the last election almost ten thousand people from this electorate voted to ensure Labour was returned to Government for an historic third term. I committed to working hard for the Labour vote in  
Epsom, to return Helen Clark and the Labour led government for a fourth term in 2008" Ms Sutton said.

Epsom LEC Chairman Grahame Lee observed that "Epsom voters now had the choice of a refreshing young candidate over the too-familiar faces of the past."  
Ms Sutton, who is 26, was brought up in Auckland and attended Glendowie College. She obtained a Master of Arts degree with honours majoring in Political Science at the University of Auckland, where she also served a term as the President of the Auckland University Students' Association.

Ms Sutton works as Public affairs and Corporate Responsibly Manager for Landco Land Developments, is Chair of the Tamaki Community Board and an Alumni Representative on the University of Auckland Council
