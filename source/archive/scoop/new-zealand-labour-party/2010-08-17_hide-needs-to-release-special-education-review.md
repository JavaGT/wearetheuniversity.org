Hide needs to release Special Education review

**Hide needs to release Special Education review**

  
The shenanigans inside the ACT Party should not delay the release of the review of Special Education, which is currently before the Cabinet, Labour’s Special Education Spokesperson Grant Robertson said.

"Heather Roy had been leading an important review into special education that many parents, students and schools are anxiously awaiting. It had already been delayed in the Cabinet process, it must not now fall victim to the political machinations of the ACT Party," Grant Robertson said.

“Rodney Hide needs to get the outcomes of the review out into the public eye, unless he wants to create uncertainty in the community. His reputation as a fan of education vouchers and privatisation of education will no doubt be causing many parents, teachers and educationalists considerable concern. Any further delay will raise the concern that the review is being changed to an ideological exercise.

“The creation of a more inclusive and accessible education system that supports schools to provide students and parents access to quality services is a vitally important process that must not become an ideological exercise for the ACT Party, " Grant Robertson said.
