Voting begins for Youth Parliament representative

Christchurch Central MP Tim Barnett is using online elections to select his Youth MP and is encouraging young people in his electorate to vote by visiting www.youthparliament.govt.nz online. To date 242 votes have been received since the poll opened on 2 April. Voting closes on 24 April.

Youth selected by their local MPs will go to Wellington to represent the views of their peers in New Zealand's fifth Youth Parliament to be held from Sunday 8 to Wednesday 11 July.

"This is an exciting chance for young people to understand and participate in what really goes on in government. It is a unique opportunity for a representative of youth to express their views and opinions. They will have direct access to politicians, the government structure and the public", Tim Barnett said.

The Youth MPs will have the opportunity to debate a mock Bill, raise issues of importance to them in a general debate, sit on Select Committees and ask parliamentary questions of Cabinet Ministers. Topics of debate in previous years include: tax, abortion, student loans, NCEA, sign language, terrorism, youth councils, factory farming, defence, child abuse, technology and transport.

Youth Parliament has been held every three years since 1994.
