**Cosgrove calls for advocacy support for earthquake victims dealing with private insurers  
**  
Labour Earthquake Recovery spokesperson and MP for Waimakariri Clayton Cosgrove says the Government must set up an advocacy support service to provide earthquake-affected residents with better support when dealing with their private insurers to prevent them from being shunted between their insurers and the Earthquake Commission (EQC).

“Earthquake-affected residents are faced with trawling through a minefield of information. It is causing a whole host of problems for residents who are beginning to feel the strain,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“I’ve spoken with many folk throughout Canterbury who are totally confused by the information they are being given.

“People are being treated like a pin-ball machine, bounced around between the Earthquake Commission (EQC) and their private insurer at random,” Clayton Cosgrove said. “An advocacy support service would go a long way toward helping people navigate what can be a complicated system.

”While local MPs are doing all they can to offer support and advocacy, we are being inundated with an overwhelming number of calls.

“People’s frustrations are growing. Residents want answers to their questions and they want to see real progress being made. At the moment the feedback from many residents is that they feel like they are hitting their head against a brick wall,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“Residents’ frustrations haven’t been helped by the Government’s communication strategy which, though well-intentioned, has involved sending residents a generic letter and phoning the worst affected households to read out a phone script. Those residents not contacted at all feel they have been left in limbo not knowing where they stand.

“We have been receiving many accounts from earthquake-affected residents who have been getting the run around in their dealings with their private insurers. Many residents are being told by their private insurer to speak with the EQC --- only for the EQC to tell them to talk to their private insurer, and vice-versa.

”That’s simply not good enough. It’s creating all sorts of frustration and confusion. It’s time for the Government to take action to help stream-line the process.”

Clayton Cosgrove says he has today formally requested Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee to move swiftly to set up an advocacy support service to help people having difficulties in dealings with private insurers. “While the Government has set up project management assistance for building repairs to guide people through the rebuilding process --- and this is a very positive move ---- a similar system is needed to help support people deal with insurers.”
