**Joyce needs to step in to protect student voice**

The decision to remove student representation from the Board of the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) is anti-democratic and robs students of their voice, says Labour’s Tertiary Education, Skills and Training spokesperson Grant Robertson.

"There has been a student at the TEC Board table since it was established. This surprise decision will limit the student voice at the very time that the TEC is making decisions about fee hikes at Victoria and Massey universities.

"Student representation at TEC has always been professional, and provided useful insight. It was a non-voting position, but provided an important voice,” Grant Robertson said.

"Not only is the Government stripping student representation from the Board, it’s also abolishing the Learner Advisory Committee which provided another avenue to hear from students.

“Silencing students is undemocratic. Education doesn’t come cheap and students deserve to have their opinions heard.

"Sadly, this is the latest in a series of moves by the National Government to limit the role of students. Representation has been removed from Polytechnic councils, there are plans to do the same for universities, and the introduction of voluntary student association membership has seen the student voice diminished and even silenced on some campuses.

"The TEC decision was taken without consultation and only emerged when students began to complain. Tertiary Education Minister, Steven Joyce, needs to step in and let students be heard.

“It’s not good enough. Mr Joyce needs to step in and get students back to the table,” Grant Robertson said.
