Government fees will hit charities hard

Government fees will hit charities hard  

National’s decision to ignore the concerns of charities will see the voluntary sector face hundreds of thousands of dollars in new costs if the Policing (Cost Recovery) Amendment Bill passes, says Labour's Community and Voluntary Sector spokesperson Poto Williams.

“National’s proposal to start charging charities and voluntary organisations for police background checks on staff and volunteers is deeply unpopular with the sector.

“National has ignored those concerns and the Law and Order select committee has made no changes to the Bill.

“That means groups like the Cancer Society will face charges for each check unless they get an exemption from the Police Commissioner.

“Charities and volunteer groups shouldn't be the ones paying the price for National's cuts to the police budget.

"Registered not-for-profits should be able to keep this money and use it to do good in their communities. Instead they are being used as a source of revenue for an underfunded police force,” says Poto Williams.
