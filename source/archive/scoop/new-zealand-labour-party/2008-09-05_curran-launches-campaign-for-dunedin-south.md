Curran launches campaign for Dunedin South

DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER MICHAEL CULLEN SPECIAL GUEST

Labour candidate Clare Curran will launch her campaign for the Dunedin South electorate this Sunday accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Hon Dr Michael Cullen.

Dr Cullen held the seat of St Kilda from 1981-1996 which then transformed into the new seat of Dunedin South. He held Dunedin South from 1996-1999.

Ms Curran was selected as the candidate for Dunedin South in February 2008.

She describes herself as a committed South Islander and Dunedin-ite. She grew up, and attended secondary school, in Dunedin and went to Otago University.

After 20 years away (14 in Australia) Curran returned to Dunedin at the end of 2002 with her partner Doug Lilly, a former senior public sector union official in Australia, and twin boys Callum and Riley (now aged 8). It was family ties that drew her back to Dunedin and a deep abiding sense of belonging to the South Island.

“I’m one of those Kiwis who left New Zealand for Australia. But I came back, because I know that this is the best place to be,” she says.

Clare Curran has worked for nearly 20 years in communications strategy, marketing and publications. She has extensive experience in media and issues management and in developing communications strategies. In 2003 she and her partner established a communications company based in Dunedin – Inzight Communications.

Clients have included prominent unions, environment groups, government agencies and significant community events and causes.

Ms Curran pledges to do her very best for the people of Dunedin South if elected to parliament.

“Standing for Parliament is a big deal. I’m really proud to be the candidate for Dunedin South and I’m putting all my energy into building a strong team to campaign to win the Dunedin South seat for Labour and to build our Party vote,” she says.
