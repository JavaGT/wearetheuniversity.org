Awaroa a victory for our grandchildren

The news that beautiful Awaroa beach will stay in New Zealand ownership and be open to all for generations shows how fiercely Kiwis want their country to remain in their hands, Opposition Leader Andrew Little says.

“Today’s news that the more than $2 million which New Zealanders contributed to keeping the beach in New Zealand ownership has resulted in Awaroa becoming part of our Conservation parkland shows how strongly we all feel about this issue.

“Preventing the public from enjoying our coastline while only the privileged few benefit is not the Kiwi way. Selling off our precious land to overseas speculators also hurts. But the public spirit behind this great campaign proves that we can – and want to - hold on to our natural heritage.

“I was one of the thousands of New Zealanders who pitched in to keep Awaroa and I think the Government made the right decision, after it was pushed, to top the money up. Today is a victory for Kiwis whose children and grandchildren will now be able to enjoy this amazing asset.

“Overseas investment in our land is important when it creates jobs and grows our economy but too often New Zealanders just lose out to big money offshore. Awaroa has been saved and we should all celebrate in that victory,” Andrew Little says.
