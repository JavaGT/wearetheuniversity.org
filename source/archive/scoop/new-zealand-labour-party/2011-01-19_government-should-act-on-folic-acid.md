Government should act on folic acid

**Government should act on folic acid**

Food Safety Minister Kate Wilkinson should stop ignoring the strong statistics showing that standardised folate in bread and flour would reduce Spina Bifida cases in New Zealand and save taxpayers millions of dollars, says Dr Ashraf Choudhary.

“It’s time Kate Wilkinson pulled her head out of the sand. Three slices of bread containing folate a day could save $39 million per year and most importantly could prevent up to 14 Spina Bifida cases annually.”

Labour’s Food Safety spokesperson says Australia introduced mandatory fortification after a comprehensive, rigorous safety assessment by Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). The decision to add folic acid to bread flour has paid off with significant improvements in levels of folate in Australians.

Other countries that fortify flour include Canada, the United States and Chile.

“It’s time New Zealand did the same,” said Dr Choudhary.

There is considerable support for compulsory folate in bread, including from Wellington Hospital Paediatric Surgeon Brendon Bowkett, who operates on Spina Bifida children in New Zealand.

A study Dr Bowkett, conducted with Otago University student Eamonn Deverall, showed that in 2006 there were six cases of anencephaly, 13 live births with spina bifida and about 30 terminations for neural tube defects. Dr Bowkett said these statistics could dramatically decline if folate in bread was made compulsory.

A pilot study of six teenagers with Spina Bifida and other neural tube defects also found the direct surgery and hospital costs for each child, from their birth, were $944,000.

A New Zealand Food Safety Authority investigation recommended mandatory fortification on average 130µg per 100g of bread for Australia and NZ.

The previous Labour-led Government had joined with Australia and approved moves to add folate to bread in 2007. But in 2009, the National Government pulled out of the agreement, while Australia went ahead.

“It’s important that women in their early stages of pregnancy receive enough folate to help avoid cases such as Spina Bifida and other neural tube defects. I am also concerned that the communities who make their own bread at home are not getting any folate because it is not added to the flour. It’s time this Government took action on this issue.”
