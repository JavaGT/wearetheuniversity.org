Brand New Zealand: ‘cheap and efficient’

Bill English’s branding of New Zealand as a cheap and efficient labour market may unfortunately be gaining traction, with a survey suggesting Kiwis are ‘happy’ to work longer hours for less in comparison to their Australian counterparts.

Despite The Regus Work-life Balance Index drawing its conclusions from only 54 New Zealand participants, the implications are concerning.

“Just because Kiwis are happy to keep their heads down and get on with the job doesn’t mean we can justify our low wages and long working hours.

“The goodwill and work ethic of ordinary Kiwis cannot become New Zealand’s competitive advantage,” Darien Fenton said.

“Kiwis are working harder for less, so to suggest there has been a dramatic increase in job satisfaction or work-life balance is a contradiction. As Massey University sociologist, Professor Paul Spoonley says, it is more likely that the data has been skewed by those unhappy in their jobs moving overseas.

“Workers face desperate times. If they are staying in New Zealand they are working harder because they have to. Wages are stagnant and the cost of living continues to climb.

“Bill English’s latest Budget bought no relief, demanding that we simply keep on keeping on.

“Well I have a message for Mr English and the National Government. No matter how hard New Zealanders work their efforts are not going to make up for a government with no vision and no plan,” Darien Fenton said.

“New Zealand has the potential to be a competitive high-tech, high-skill, high- wage economy, but not with a Government that continues to sell us short.”
