Brooke Loader has been selected as the Labour Party candidate for Waikato for the 2017 General Election.

“I look forward to campaigning in Waikato on the issues that matter locally – transport and infrastructure, decent housing, health, and education,” said Brooke Loader.

“The Waikato electorate is made up of many strong rural communities and I want to ensure they have an effective voice in Parliament.”

Brooke Loader is an experienced litigation lawyer specialising in Treaty of Waitangi and Maori issues. She volunteers for a number of community organisations and is a mother of one.

Labour’s President, Nigel Haworth, said: “Brooke joins our list of energetic and fresh candidates standing for Labour this year. Our focus is on electing a strong, Labour-led government in September that will rise to the challenge, back the Kiwi Dream and build a better New Zealand.”

Brooke is the final electorate candidate to be selected for the Labour Party for the 2017 General Election. Labour’s Party List will be published in early May.
