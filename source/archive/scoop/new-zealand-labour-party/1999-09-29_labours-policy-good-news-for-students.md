Labour's policy good news for students
======================================

[![Labour
2000 web site](http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg)](http://www.labour.org.nz)Labour's tertiary education policy, released this morning, was great news for students, Young Labour President Moana Mackey said today.

"The double emphasis on quality as well as access will not only ease the financial burden on students and lower the barriers to tertiary study, but will also ensure that once enrolled, the education received is of international quality," Moana Mackey said.

"In particular, the proposed graduated loan repayment system is an important first  
step towards addressing the current student debt crisis.

"Other important initiatives for young people include allowing sixteen and seventeen year olds access to student allowances, pilot programmes aimed at increasing the number of Maori and Pacific Island students participating in tertiary education, and better help for students to find work in the summer holidays.

"A generation of young New Zealanders has been crippled by National's tertiary education policies. Students will welcome the chance to vote in a Government which will not allow that to continue," Moana Mackey said.
