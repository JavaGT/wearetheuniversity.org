Prebble - a problem with the truth

ACT leader Richard Prebble has lost the plot on who has done what on Wellington Hospital, Labour health spokesperson Annette King said today.

"His latest tirade demonstrates he is still suffering from his long-term condition - terminological inexactitude.

"Firstly; there has never been a Labour-inspired proposal to shift the main hospital to Kenepuru. The only MP who has ever mentioned going to a completely different site is Richard Prebble, at the first meeting of Wellington MPs to discuss an upgrading of A&E.

"He was the one who suggested a Greenfield site.

"Secondly; Graham Kelly is not the principal parliamentary promoter of a Labour plan. Graham Kelly along with other Wellington region MPs including United's Peter Dunne have worked together to secure a tertiary hospital for Wellington. This followed the former Minister of Health's statement that he did not envisage Wellington as one of the future sites for a tertiary hospital.

"Thirdly; to suggest I have never spoken out over Wellington hospital shows a serious loss of memory by Mr Prebble. He should replay the Channel 7 TV interview, where we appeared together, from just two weeks ago.

"I've had a gutsful of the ACT leader's grandstanding on this issue," Annette King said. "He did nothing until the hospital was shifted into his electorate by boundary changes. Up until then it was left to me to co-ordinate a regional effort to secure the hospital.

"It's time that Richard Prebble grew up and stopped playing the little boy who has to tell whoppers to get attention."
