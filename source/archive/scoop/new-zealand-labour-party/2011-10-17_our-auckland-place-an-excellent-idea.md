Our Auckland place an excellent idea

The creation of a Te Papa satellite site in Auckland has enormous potential and perfectly fits with Labour's arts policy says Labour List MP based in Auckland Central and Associate Spokesperson for Arts, Culture and Heritage, Jacinda Ardern.

Her comments follow the release of a report by the Te Papa North Planning group which recommends the recent Wynyard Quarter waterfront development be considered as a "possible location for a cultural presence of national significance", and that an iconic structure be erected onsite.

"The group believes an extension of the Museum of New Zealand, Te Papa Tongarewa, would be ideal on this site. Not only would it give Aucklanders access to the museum's national collections, but it would also allow the thousands of tourists that visit the city each year to view and appreciate the country's rich traditional culture," Jacinda Ardern said.

"Part of Labour's new Arts, Culture and Heritage policy explicitly states that a Labour Government will develop outreach delivery systems of collections from "Our Place" through the National Services Unit to sites to be identified by Auckland Council and its respective regional interest groups."

"However while we support the concept of building Te Papa North on the waterfront we would also require there be extensive consultation process carried out which should include the Auckland Council, Auckland residents and the arts community," Jacinda Ardern said.

"Aucklanders have been waiting a long time for the development of their city's waterfront. Sensible planning such as that promoted by the Te Papa North Group is vital to the enjoyment of what is considered one of the most beautiful parts of our city," Labour's Spokesperson for Auckland Issues, Phil Twyford said.

"Now that significant developments in making the waterfront more accessible to the public are finally starting to take shape, it is only fair that we ensure that all Aucklanders are able to have a say on what their city will look like both now and in the future," he said.
