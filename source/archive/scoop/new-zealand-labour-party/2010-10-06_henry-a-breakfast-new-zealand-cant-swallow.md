**Henry: A breakfast New Zealand can't swallow**

Broadcaster Paul Henry is not the only one to blame for his racist remarks on TVNZ Breakfast yesterday, Labour Associate Ethnic Affairs spokesperson Raymond Huo says.

"The National Government, which is moving TVNZ away from a public broadcasting role toward a profit and rating-driven network, is also to blame," Raymond Huo said.

"Paul Henry seems to be trying his best to make racism acceptable in New Zealand through his continued irresponsible and derogatory comments, culminating in his claim yesterday that Governor General Anand Satyanand 'doesn't look or sound like a real New Zealander'.

"As an MP of Chinese descent and a former journalist I share the outrage of most New Zealanders who have been quick to denounce Paul Henry's racist comments," Raymond Huo said.

"It's sad to see that our flagship television network has resorted to 'shock-jock' tactics to drum up ratings and pull in more advertising revenue. These tactics incite racism and cause hurt, anger and insult for many New Zealanders.

"Yesterday's comments are a direct result of the removal of the TVNZ charter," Raymond Huo said. "The removal of the charter means that TVNZ now has no formal responsibility to deliver quality news programming. As a result we are seeing Mr Henry becoming more outspoken and offensive.

"Auckland University Professor Manying Ip wrote to me today expressing her disappointment about Mr Henry's comments, and asking how visible minorities could be expected to function at their optimal level when such remarks could go to air on a publicly-funded TV channel.

"This is also happening at a time when the idea has been put forward to downgrade the Ministry of Ethnic Affairs or possibly even scrap it altogether. We are known across the world as a forward-looking country, but events like these show us quickly back-pedalling under National.

"I want National, both in Government and in Opposition, to think about the consequences of their decisions on our multi-cultural society. We have come so far, but National seems desperate to take us back," Raymond Huo said.
