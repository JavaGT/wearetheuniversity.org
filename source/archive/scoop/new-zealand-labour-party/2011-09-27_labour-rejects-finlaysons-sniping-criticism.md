MEDIA STATEMENT

**Labour rejects Finlayson’s sniping criticism**

Attorney-General Chris Finlayson’s constant sniping about Labour’s attempts to resolve concerns about police search and surveillance practices is becoming tiresome and indicates he is unwilling to work with others to find a solution, says Labour’s Justice spokesperson Charles Chauvel.

“We reject the criticisms levelled at our draft amendments to the legislation. We followed the recommendations of a number of respected legal and academic experts in putting it together and we received assistance from the Office of the Clerk.

“Labour has been trying to work constructively with National, testing the need for solutions and insisting on a select committee process despite the Government’s claims there was no time for public scrutiny.

“We have tried twice to get our Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) in front of a select committee. National has prevented that. It is only interested in imposing its own fix on the problem instead of working with others.

“Labour has limited resources in Opposition. The Government has the entire public service behind it. Instead of wasting time criticising the SOP, Chris Finlayson could have better spent his time trying to improve the legislation.

“Labour wants to find a responsible and practical solution to the current situation. It’s a shame Chris Finlayson is too busy playing politics,” Charles Chauvel said.
