Student support changes will hurt new migrants

The half-baked reform of student loan and allowance eligibility initiated by Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce will adversely affect new migrants, says Labour Associate Ethnic Affairs spokesperson Raymond Huo.

“It is vitally important that new migrants are encouraged to play as full a role as possible in New Zealand society. That won’t happen if they are excluded from enrolling in tertiary education, or face unduly harsh performance measures,” Raymond Huo said.

  
“Would-be Asian students and other new migrants will be particularly affected by the two-year stand-down period for new residents accessing the student loan scheme.

“I find the changes absolutely astonishing. Mr Joyce’s tinkering will impact most severely on those who are already most disadvantaged in terms of gaining access to tertiary education --- those who are new residents in New Zealand and young Maori and Pacific people,” Raymond Huo said.

“It makes you wonder where Steven Joyce and the National Government is coming from,” Raymond Huo said.

Raymond Huo said Mr Joyce’s half-baked reforms were already controversial because many Maori and Pacific students will find it difficult meeting new performance standards (passing more than half the course in two years) in the early stages of their tertiary education.

“That alone will have a damaging impact on the way New Zealand society and our economy develops in the future,” Raymond Huo said.

“But I predict the changes will be equally devastating in terms of new migrants who want to contribute as fully as possible to New Zealand’s future.

“I share concerns that have been raised by the Labour Department about the stand-down period adversely affecting settlement outcomes,” Raymond Huo said.

“For the life of me I can’t understand how limiting the full participation of new migrants in a skilled economy is supposed to help New Zealand.

“The migrant community is confused by these changes, but nowhere near as confused as Mr Joyce seems to be. The changes are neither logical nor rational.”
