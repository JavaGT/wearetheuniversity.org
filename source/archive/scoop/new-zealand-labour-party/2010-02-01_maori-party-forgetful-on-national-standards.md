Maori Party forgetful on National Standards

**Maori Party forgetful on National Standards  
**  
Maori Party co-leader Pita Sharples is right to have concerns regarding the introduction of National Standards, says Labour Associate Education Spokesperson Kelvin Davis.

“But if he is against them, why did he and his party support them through Parliament?” Kelvin Davis said.

"One of the big problems with National Standards is that reporting on achievement and raising achievement are two different issues.

“Graham Henry can explain in plain English how well the All Blacks went against the Barbarians last year, but it will never change the final result. We lost.

“Maori students are set to lose too with the proposed untested National Standards, and the Maori Party did nothing to stop it from happening – in fact they spoke in support and voted it through.

"While no one disputes the need for high standards and parents' right to know how well their child is achieving, reporting to that a child failed doesn't improve their achievement.

“Only excellent teaching can raise achievement, and the Government’s emphasis should be on supporting teachers to be the best they can, and providing the conditions where those excellent teachers can weave their magic.

“It's all a bit late for Pita Sharples and the Maori Party to wake up to the fact that this policy they voted for may in fact disadvantage Maori students.

“Dr Sharples is trying to have his cake and eat it too. If he is against National Standards, he should explain why he and his party helped National get them through Parliament," Kelvin Davis said.
