Non-hires result of budget shortfalls

Annette  KING

Health Spokesperson

13 September  2013     MEDIA STATEMENT

**Non-hires result of budget shortfalls**  

Serious staff shortages at some of the country’s biggest hospitals are affecting patient services and forcing clinicians to shoulder unsustainable workloads, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.

“In trying to reduce deficits and maintain savings targets district health boards around the country are deliberately choosing not to replace nursing staff or fill  ‘non-clinical’ vacancies.

“What that does, of course, is increase pressure on those working in already understaffed hospitals. Nurses and other medical professionals are always willing to go the extra mile, but when overtime and extra shifts become part of the daily routine, it is unsustainable.

Mrs King said Auckland and Waitemata district health boards were the worst affected, with more than 1000 unfilled positions.

“Where boards are hiring, the average length of time to fill vacancies can be anywhere from three weeks (Canterbury) to six months (Wairarapa).

“Keeping staff to minimum levels does a dis-service to everyone – our nursing graduates, our medical specialists, and those Kiwis who need their care. The human cost is cancelled operations, bed closures, and compromised patient health.

“A recent survey by the NZ Nurses Organisation noted workload, stress, and restructuring were contributing to low morale. Add budget constraints to that and you’ve got a recipe for on-going uncertainty.

“While Tony Ryall continues to obsess over DHBs hitting targets, he is ignoring the very real pressures he is placing on them, and the resulting impact that is having on services.”
