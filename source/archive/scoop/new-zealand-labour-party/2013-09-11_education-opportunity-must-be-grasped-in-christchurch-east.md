11 September 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Opportunity must be grasped for education in Christchurch East**

The final verdict on the fate of eight schools in Christchurch East ends months of uncertainty and anxiety for parents and students, says Labour’s Associate Education spokesperson for Christchurch, Megan Woods.

“Today’s expected announcement of the creation of the Aranui super school, the continuation of Chisnallwood Intermediate and the merger of Central New Brighton, Freeville and North New Brighton schools has been received with mixed emotions.

“While some see this as an opportunity for their local communities, others are grieving the loss of a treasured community asset.

“All in all the cost of the Government’s restructure in Christchurch East is said to be $41 million.

“I want to give credit to the people from these communities who have spent months trying to make the Minister see reason over their children’s futures. They have been exceptionally generous with their time and energy.

“These local schools have been a true source of stability and routine for so many families, and their closures will be hard for many.

“Now that Education Minister Hekia Parata has delivered her final verdict, Labour will fight alongside locals to ensure the best possible facilities and opportunities for the schools. These communities deserve nothing less. Labour is committed to ensuring Christchurch East schools are places where students can build big futures.

“Labour’s focus has always been to ensure all of our children receive a world-class education. We will continue to work with communities to that end,” Megan Woods said.

Outgoing Labour MP Lianne Dalziel said she would continue to advocate for education in the east.

"When you look at the culture, creativity and talent that walks into those schools every day, these larger campuses could become places that turn that talent into careers, that sustain their families and strengthen their communities.

“This must not be allowed to be a missed opportunity.”
