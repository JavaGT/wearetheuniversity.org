Invermay Petition Tops 10,000 Signatures

**CLARK**

MP for Dunedin North  
18 September 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Invermay Petition Tops 10,000 Signatures**

People across New Zealand continue to express their disgust at the downgrading of Invermay, says Dunedin North MP David Clark, as the Save Invermay petition he instigated earlier this year topped the 10,000 signature mark just days before the 2014 General Election.

“Labour has made a clear commitment to retaining Invermay as a world-leader in agricultural research. Today, more than 10,000 others across New Zealand have endorsed that commitment”, David Clark says.

“Invermay is not being ‘downsized’ as AgResearch and Science and Innovation Minister Steven Joyce would have us believe. It is now doubtful the Invermay genomics grouping will be a functional unit if there is no intervention before the scheduled 2017 shift to Lincoln. The group is heading towards collapse.

“Last week the _Otago Daily Times_ reported the resignations of two more leading Invermay scientists, Michael Lee and Benoit Auvray. Their departure further weakens Invermay’s world-leading sheep genetics and genomics group.

“The latest news of further senior staff departures from Invermay has strengthened local opposition to AgResearch’s restructuring plans.

“AgResearch continues to sit on a critical Official Information Act request lodged more than two months ago, and Steven Joyce has yet to give a straight answer to questions put to him concerning AgResearch’s restructuring plans. Enough is enough. Action must be taken to save Invermay”, David Clark says.
