**Street heads to Washington for international seminar**

On Friday Labour’s Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson, Maryan Street, heads to Washington to attend an international seminar on _Building Sustainable Partnerships for Women’s Human Rights._

It is being run by the Center for Women Policy Studies based in Washington ([www.centerwomenpolicy.org](http://www.centerwomenpolicy.org/)) and draws together 12 women legislators, either appointed or elected, from a wide range of countries, including Kenya, Uganda, the United Kingdom, Kosovo, Georgia, Liberia, Canada, Greece, Switzerland, Barbados, South Africa and New Zealand.

The subjects of the seminar will include trafficking of women and girls, poverty and related root causes, the impact of HIV/AIDs on women and girls, and environmental policy and its impact on women’s human rights.

Women legislators from around the world were invited to apply to attend the seminar. Maryan Street’s application was successful.

While she is in Washington, Maryan Street will attend meetings with the IMF and the World Bank to discuss the profile of the global recession and any recovery, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, and the impact on international trade and trade architecture, as well as renewing contacts within the State Department, Human Rights Watch and the Free Burma Campaign.
