High Country land values will skyrocket unless Crown appeals ruling

The value of high country land will increase to the point where only wealthy buyers could afford it unless the Crown challenges an Otago District Land Valuation Tribunal ruling, Labour’s land information spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway said today.

“The Crown has until today to lodge an appeal against last week’s Minaret Station ruling which found in favour of farmers with pastoral leases on the station,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.

“The ruling essentially means formula used to set rents for the farmers using the land does not take into account factors such as location or scenic views.

“The leaseholders are essentially getting a large discount on the actual rent value for the land.”

Iain Lees-Galloway says Federated Farmers and the High Country Accord lobby group are 100% right that this is a test case for the issue.

“That’s why the Crown must appeal the tribunal’s ruling,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.

“Labour wants to work with both farmers and conservationists to find a solution that is fair for all New Zealanders.

“Low rents will only make the leases on the high country land more attractive for potential buyers and push prices up.

“Appealing the tribunal ruling will put the issue back on track for fair rental to be paid, and prevent land prices increasing to the point where only wealthy overseas investors could afford to buy.

“All New Zealanders value getting a fair go. The ruling made last week lets lease holders on high country land take advantage of the system.

“That’s not a fair go and that’s why the Crown must appeal the tribunal ruling,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.
