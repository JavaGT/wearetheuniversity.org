Message strikes powerful note

**Message strikes powerful note**

Labour’s Inter-Faith Dialogue spokesperson Su’a William Sio supports the call by the Catholic Bishop of Auckland Bishop Patrick Dunn that we ‘should promote respect for the poor and pursue a passion for justice’.

Su’a William Sio said the Bishop’s comments were made during a mass held at St Therese Catholic Church, Māngere, to celebrate the canonisation of Mary MacKillop, St Mary of the Cross. The service was organised by students of Mary MacKillop School in Māngere.

“Bishop Dunn’s wonderful message is very poignant in today’s uncertain world, and reflects the life of St Mary MacKillop when in New Zealand and her constant work to look after those in need, and her passion for justice.

“Labour shares these values as core values, and I’m sure a great many other religions also share the same values,” Su’a William Sio said.

“It should be our nation’s collective aim to pursue the aspiration of an equal society where all peoples have equal access to food, shelter, education and healthcare.”
