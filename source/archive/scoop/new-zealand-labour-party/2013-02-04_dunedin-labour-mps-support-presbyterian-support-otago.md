MP for Dunedin North

4th February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT

Dunedin Labour MPs have called on the Southern District Health Board to reassess their decision to exclude Presbyterian Services Otago from their list of providers of home help services for the elderly.

Clare Curran, MP for Dunedin South and her colleague David Clark, MP for Dunedin North have written to each board member before the board meets in Dunedin this Friday. “Presbyterian Support Otago has been serving the Dunedin and Otago communities for generations, not only in the provision of home support services but through multiple programmes which support our most vulnerable and make Dunedin a better place to live” says Curran

“The SDHB has declined to engage in discussions to help the community understand their decision, as representatives of the local community we are calling on them to engage with those affected and consider including PSO as a fourth provider as allowed by the contract

“Clients and workers deserve their voice to be heard as do members of the community which has long been served by Presbyterian Support. A fair and transparent process is needed to ensure the best outcome of all involved, in this case the DHB has not done that and is continuing to decline to engage with PSO and other interested parties says Clark

“We urge them to keep community at the forefront of this decision and to consider the wider ramifications of the change in contract. Dunedin deserves a locally based and knowledgeable provider and we believe PSO should be reconsidered to be a part of the DHBs system for supporting elderly residents in their homes.
