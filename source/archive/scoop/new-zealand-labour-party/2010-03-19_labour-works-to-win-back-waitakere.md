**Labour works to win back Waitakere**

Labour’s campaign to win back supporters in Waitakere kicks off in earnest tomorrow with a four-way contested candidate selection.

President Andrew Little says Waitakere is a battleground seat for Labour and he’s confident any one of the four nominees will be a great candidate to take Labour’s message to voters in the West Auckland seat.

“These are all talented people, and each of them has a depth of experience and skills that would make them candidates I’d be proud of. It won’t be an easy decision for the selection panel,” he said.

The four nominees are: community advocate Ann Pala QSM, List MP Carmel Sepuloni, university lecturer Hamish McCracken and List MP Phil Twyford.

The selection meeting is taking place at Henderson Hill School at 10.30am on Saturday 20 March.

This is the first contested selection meeting in Labour’s calendar for early selections. Other seats where candidates have been selected uncontested are:  
Jacinda Ardern in Auckland Central, Carol Beaumont in Maungakiekie, Charles Chauvel in Ohariu and Damien O’Connor in West Coast Tasman.

Andrew Little says the next round of selections will take place in June and July 2010.
