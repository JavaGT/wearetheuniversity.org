Mallard to meet with principals and education union over league table impasse

Labour Education Spokesperson Trevor Mallard will tomorrow meet with school principals and the New Zealand Educational Institute to discuss possible solutions to the league table impasse.

“Anne Tolley has created a stand-off between herself and schools over her insistence on obtaining information that could be used to form league tables of schools that would pitch wealthy schools against those from low decile areas

“Real education standards are important. Good standards measure progress rather than impose a simple pass or fail hurdle. They require professional support to work but schools won’t get this support by the publication of league tables in newspapers.

“Schools that need additional resources to overcome disparities should be helped to achieve greater results. Publishing league tables that could negatively affect their ability to recruit teachers and unfairly compare them to wealthier schools would do nothing to improve educational outcomes for students.

“The education sector doesn’t support the collation of this information, as evidenced by today’s confirmation from school principals that they will simply not provide the information sought if the Minister cannot guarantee league tables will not be published.

“However, the Ombudsmen who recently appeared before MPs at Select Committee confirmed that a minor law change could prevent data being compiled in a manner that would lead to league tables.

“That law change would prevent the release for publication of school level data. Parents would get information showing their child's progress, principals would get information to assist with teacher professional development and there would be clear nationwide measures of progress to hold Ministers to account.

“I will be discussing this idea with principals and the NZEI tomorrow and any solutions developed that will resolve this impasse will be shared with the Minister.

“We want to work constructively on this issue as having a stand-off between the Minister of Education and schools will not benefit either teachers or students.

“So far education professionals don’t feel as though the Government has taken seriously their concerns about league tables.

“There is an opportunity to resolve this stand-off but the Government must be willing to listen to those on the frontline of the education for it to happen,” Trevor Mallard said.
