Support For Our Part In Peace Keeping Role

Foreign Affairs Spokesperson

**Support For Our Part In Peace Keeping Role**

Labour’s Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Phil Goff is welcoming the decision for New Zealand to contribute two observers to the United Nations Mission in Syria.

“As a small and distant country, New Zealand has nevertheless played a role in the region in both world wars and currently has 32 Defence Force personnel stationed in the Middle East.

“The decision to send two observers into a conflict-stricken area comes on the eve of Anzac Day, when we commemorate the contribution and sacrifice of our troops abroad,” Phil Goff said.

“The UN mission in Syria has been mandated by the Security Council and is widely endorsed by the international community.

“More than 9000 people, mostly innocent civilians, have died in Syria since March last year. The purpose of the UN Mission is to stop the killing and help engineer a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

“New Zealand has been a participant in the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation for over 60 years. It currently has two Defence Force staff based in Damascus, another two in Lebanon and four in Israel.

“In addition we have 26 personnel serving with the Multilateral Force and Observers at North Camp in the Sinai Desert, ensuring the observance of the Israel-Egypt Peace Agreement. The current commander of the MFO is a New Zealander, Major General Warren Whiting.

“The Mission is not without significant risk. President Bashar al Assad has still not withdrawn troops and heavy weapons from Syrian cities in line with the peace plan agreed with UN envoy Kofi Annan.

“There have been alleged breaches of the ceasefire by both the current Syrian Government and the Free Syrian Army.

“However the UN Mission will help reduce the prospect of on-going conflict and save thousands of lives.

“New Zealand has been a longstanding supporter of peacekeeping under the auspices of the United Nations as part of its role in supporting humanitarian causes and being a good international citizen,” Phil Goff said.
