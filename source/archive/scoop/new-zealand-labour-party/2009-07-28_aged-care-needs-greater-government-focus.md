**Aged care needs greater Government focus**

New Zealand’s elderly deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, which is why earlier this year I proposed that MPs hold an inquiry into elderly care in this country, Associate Health Spokesperson Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said.

“Abuse in any form is not acceptable. The recent court case where a care giver was charged for putting tape over an elderly woman's mouth in a rest home is an outrage and a reminder to us all to be vigilant around ensuring safety for our elders who for many are our parents, grandparents and great grandparents,” Winnie Laban said.

“Sentencing decisions are a matter for judges, but this case has sent a clear message to those living in rest homes, their families and the people who work in the homes.

“Last month I sought a Health Select Committee inquiry into aged care, to ensure that older New Zealanders were receiving the appropriate access to health services both in the community and in residential care.

“Unfortunately the National Party voted against holding the inquiry.

“There are currently around 28,000 older New Zealanders living in aged residential care and a further 60,000 older people receive home support services.

“It is extremely important that we ensure we are doing everything possible to meet the needs of these people.

“Already the Otago DHB has signalled that it is looking at cutting home support services to make financial savings.

“An inquiry would have ensured Government funding which is in excess of $700 million a year was being targeted to the right services and that elderly were receiving the most appropriate health services at the right time,” Winnie Laban said.
