National’s economic plan – copy and paste

  
Deputy Prime Minister Bill English has confirmed that National is bereft of fresh ideas for dealing with the economic downturn, Labour Finance spokesman David Cunliffe said today.

“During question time today, Bill English was forced to concede that his much heralded infrastructure package announced yesterday included money that had already been allocated by the last Labour Government,” David Cunliffe said.

“This confirms New Zealanders worst fears that National is failing to deal with speed and magnitude of the worsening economic conditions.

“The best National has been able to do is to copy and paste Labour’s pre-election initiatives. But as good as they are, the global recession has moved on markedly since late last year.

Later in question time the Finance Minister also admitted that costings used on last week's small business tax package also included double counting of money already allocated by Labour.

“National needs to wake up and realise that every week it continues with its ‘business as usual’ approach over a thousand people will join the ranks of the unemployed,” David Cunliffe said.

“It’s time for National to come up with a real plan to deal with the worsening economic conditions. It’s ad hoc tinkering and inadequate initiatives to date are costing New Zealanders their jobs.

“It’s time Bill English shifted up a gear and came up with a real plan for the economy,” David Cunliffe said.
