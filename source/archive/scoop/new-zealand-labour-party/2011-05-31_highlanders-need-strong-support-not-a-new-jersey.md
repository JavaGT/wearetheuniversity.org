Highlanders Need Strong Support, Not a New Jersey

Clare Curran

MP for Dunedin South

31 May 2011

MEDIA STATEMENT

**Highlanders Need Strong Support, Not a New Jersey**

A change to the Highlanders colours is a dumb idea and should be scrapped, Dunedin South Labour MP Clare Curran said today.

“So much history --- 127 years --- can’t be tossed out overnight,” Clare Curran said. “Invercargill, Dunedin, Oamaru and all the towns in between should be up in arms about this decision.

“The Highlanders already have an identity. They’ve got a support base. There’s compelling reason to retain the blue and gold of Otago, the maroon of Southland and the purple and gold of North Otago.

“I’m just one of their supporters and I don’t think new colours are a good idea.

“Changing a brand is a big step. The Highlanders are part of the proud tradition of Otago and Southland. They shouldn’t be distanced from it,” Clare Curran said.

“New coaches, a new management team and a new office are one thing. So is a new stadium. But new colours are another. If the franchise is going to stay in the region then don’t distance the fans.

“If it’s not, then come clean,” Clare Curran said.
