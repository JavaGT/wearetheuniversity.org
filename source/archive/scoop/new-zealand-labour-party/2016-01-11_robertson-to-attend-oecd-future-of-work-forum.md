Robertson to attend OECD future of work forum  

  
Labour Finance Spokesperson and Chair of the Future of Work Commission Grant Robertson will travel to Paris this week to attend the OECD Future of Work Forum and to London where he will also undertake meetings and visits.

“We are at the halfway mark in terms of Labour’s Future of Work Commission, and this conference is a great opportunity to check in on the latest thinking in this area and test that against our work.

“Over 300 business people, academics, politicians, unionists, policy makers and commentators are attending the forum. Topics to be covered include digitisation, skills and labour markets in the future of work.

“All over the world countries are grappling with how to ensure the future of work is fair and prosperous for all, and they will be sharing those ideas at the forum.

“The rapidly changing nature and experience of work, driven by the forces of automation and globalisation, will have a fundamental effect on New Zealanders. An NZIER study earlier this year found that 46 per cent of jobs in the New Zealand economy will cease to exist in the next two decades. There is a real risk of growing inequality if we do not actively manage this change.

“While this kind of disruption is scary there is great opportunity for New Zealand in the new economy if we are prepared. This means looking at how we ensure access to technology, high quality and responsive education and training systems, and greater income security.

“Labour established our Future of Work Commission late last year to understand the changes that are taking place and to ensure we have the policies in place to give every New Zealander the opportunity to have decent work in the future. We have had hundreds of submissions on our issues papers and have undertaken dozens of engagements with business, workers and members of the public,” Grant Robertson said.

The final report of the Commission will be released in November 2016.
