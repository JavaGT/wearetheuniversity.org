**Smaller class sizes under a Labour Government**

A Labour Government will reduce class sizes by funding an extra 2000 teachers using resources freed up by scrapping National’s flawed ‘executive principals’ policy, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.

“We all know that kids do better in smaller classes because their teacher has more time to devote to them.

“Unfortunately with staffing for senior primary school classes based on a ratio of one teacher to 29 students, classes with more than 30 pupils are not uncommon. That’s why a Labour Government will progressively reduce this ratio to 1:26 by 2018. This gradual change will allow time to train almost 1000 more teachers.

“The picture is not much better at secondary schools where there’s an average of 26 students per class. Labour will reduce this to 23 by 2018 and train 900 more teachers. We know how crucial the college years are to young people and their parents as they prepare to move from school into the world.

“Teachers need to be recognised and rewarded for the enormous contribution they make to our society. Labour believes in professional development for teachers. That is why we will:

• Raise the standards of those wanting to become teachers by pre-screening entry into all initial teacher education programmes.  
• Set up a school advisory service to share best practice and provide mentors and advisors to teachers throughout the country.  
• Support a self-governing teaching profession through the democratic appointment of a new Education Council.  
• Redirect resources spent forcing National Standards on schools into teacher professional development programmes.

“National’s executive principals and expert teachers have divided the sector which has labelled the policy ‘unworkable’. Labour will work with educators and end this Government’s obsession with endless measurement and finger-pointing.

“A Labour Government is committed to a modern, affordable and quality public education system. This week we have announced moves to end divisive school donations and revolutionise schools and the way our kids are taught. Today we are outlining how under Labour, teachers will have enough time to spend with every student, as well as become the best teacher they can be,” David Cunliffe says
