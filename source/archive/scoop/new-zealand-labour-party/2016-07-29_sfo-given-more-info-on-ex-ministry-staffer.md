More information on the background and past activities of a former senior Ministry of Transport manager, being investigated for alleged fraud, is coming to light, Labour’s Transport Spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“Today, I have ensured that information on [Joanne Harrison’s](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/82354396/ministry-of-transport-staffer-sacked-after-stealing-750000) background, other names she may be using and contact details of family members who may know her whereabouts have been passed onto the Serious Fraud Office.

“I hope this information will aid their investigation and improve the chances of retrieving the missing money.

“Unfortunately because the Transport Minister kept the alleged fraud secret for so long, the chances of getting several hundred thousand dollars of taxpayer money back are slimmer than they needed to be.

“If Simon Bridges had been upfront about the alleged fraud in April, then the information that has come to light in the last week would have been known much earlier and the chances of locating Joanne Harrison would have been higher,” Sue Moroney said.
