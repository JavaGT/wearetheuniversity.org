Labour Leader Helen Clark said today that only a party as out of touch as National could believe it could win an election by offering people on the average wage a tax cut barely above $4 a week.

"National's economic strategy and election strategy have only one plank: a feeble tax cut.

"Very little money will go into anybody's pocket, but the overall effect is to deprive the Government of $400 million in revenue which is essential for investing in our future.

"The $400 million would clearly be better spent on investing in business and industry development, higher education and training, science and research, and beginning the process of restoring our shattered social fabric.

"Superannuitants in particular will wonder why their needs are never addressed by National.

"National's tax cuts are purely symbolic. In that they will satisfy no one. Mr Prebble who has set his sights on being Minister of Finance certainly won't be satisfied. But then nor will the vast majority of New Zealanders who are looking for a Government determined to invest in our future, not destroy it," Helen Clark said.
