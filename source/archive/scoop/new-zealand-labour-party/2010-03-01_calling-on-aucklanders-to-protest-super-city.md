Calling On Aucklanders To Protest Super City
============================================

**Calling On Aucklanders To Protest Super City Process**  

Labour MP Phil Twyford says he is taking the unusual step of asking Aucklanders to join a protest against a select committee he sits on.  
Twyford is a member of the parliamentary committee currently hearing submissions on the third super city bill. Labour and Green MPs on the committee are backing a lunch time demonstration tomorrow against the Government's super city plans.

"This Government just isn’t listening to Aucklanders when it comes to the future of our democracy,” Phil Twyford said.  
“Submissions to the select committee are heavily critical of the super city at a ratio of 9 to 1. But Government MPs led by committee chair Associate Minister John Carter don't seem to care. We have had submitters shouting at the committee in frustration.

"For the last year Aucklanders have been telling the Government that the local boards must have real powers. National has been promising this would happen but their draft powers released on Friday are a joke.  
"It is death by a thousand cuts, toothless local boards, unfair boundaries, assets being set up for privatisation, corporatisation of council operations. The list goes on.

"I'm a great believer in the select committee process. It is an important part of our democratic system. But when the ruling party blocks its ears to the people then it is time to take up your right to peaceful protest.”  
Phil Twyford said Labour and Green MPs would join the demonstration and were calling on Aucklanders from all over the region to take part and show their concern.

The rally will take place 12 - 2pm Tuesday 2 March outside the Quality Hotel Barrycourt, 20 Gladstone Rd, Parnell.
