**Christchurch on the rent rack**

A jump of 20 per cent in weekly rents in the past year is a disaster for Christchurch, says Associate Housing spokesperson Poto Williams.

“The Trade Me Property Rental Price index has rightly described the city as being a ‘ scorching ‘ rental market, with rentals now reaching a record median high of $510 a week.

“This compares to $425 a year ago and the New Zealand median of $399 a week.

“Add in the sale of state houses and you have an unfolding catastrophe for renters in Christchurch. The city has lost 12,000 homes to the quake and rents are already at a premium with workers moving in for the re-build.

“For people with large families it is worse. Christchurch has the highest rents in the country at a median $ 805 a week for a five bedroom home, says Poto Williams

“Today’s figures are a terrible indictment of the government’s housing policies which are simply ignoring the real needs of thousands on Kiwis.”
