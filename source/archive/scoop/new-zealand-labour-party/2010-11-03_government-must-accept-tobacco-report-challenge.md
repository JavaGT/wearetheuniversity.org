Government must accept tobacco report challenge

**Government must accept challenge laid down by tobacco report  
**

The report of the Māori Affairs Select Committee that recommends making New Zealand smokefree by 2025 represents a huge challenge for the National Government, Labour Leader Phil Goff.

“Thousands of New Zealanders die of smoking related illnesses each year and this report recommends some fairly common-sense approaches to getting rid of tobacco,” Phil Goff said.

“Labour supports calls to rid shops of tobacco displays and to have cigarettes and tobacco placed in plain packaging.

“During our time in Government Labour introduced the Smokefree Environments legislation that rid workplaces and bars and clubs of smoking indoors.

“National refused to support legislation removing smoking from indoor areas like bars and restaurants. So my hope that they will support these recommendations is slim.

“Last year National with the support of Labour increased the excise tax on cigarettes taking in an extra $200 million in tax revenue. However, National failed to tell the public or indeed other parties that it was planning to cut $12 million from smoking cessation services in the budget.

“If you want people to stop smoking you have to have the services available to help them.

“Labour is calling on John Key to step up and support common sense recommendations that will result in a healthier population,” Phil Goff said.
