National=less jobs

CUNLIFFE  
Finance Spokesperson  
10 November 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**National=less jobs**

National’s economic mismanagement has driven 100,000 Kiwis overseas in search of higher wages and a better life, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.

“Unless there is a change of direction more talented young Kiwis will leave, our country will get downgraded again, and our future will be truly bleak,” David Cunliffe said.

"Unemployment is up. Tens of thousands more are on the dole. People want to work, but the jobs aren't there.

“For those who are lucky enough to be in work, the income gap with Australia has widened under National’s watch from $121 a week to $153 a week.

"John Key said he would create more jobs and would close the wage gap.

"He was wrong, but both jobs and wages going backwards are the result of his policy choices.

"If National is re-elected, the same policies will drive the same results. Too many people on the dole, too many people without jobs.

"The exodus will continue, and we will have to fly across the Tasman to visit our children and our grandchildren," David Cunliffe said.

“National’s failed trickle-down, muddle-through economics and its determination to create a near slave-wage economy is obviously not working. New Zealanders are voting with their feet in droves and the rating agencies have given them the thumbs down.

“National=less jobs,” David Cunliffe said.
