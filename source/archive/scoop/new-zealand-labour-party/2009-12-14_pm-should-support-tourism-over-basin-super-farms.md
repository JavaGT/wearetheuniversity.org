PM should support tourism over Basin super farms

**Prime Minister should support tourism sector over Basin super farms  
**  
Prime Minister John Key has been challenged to oppose development of 16 giant dairy farms in the fragile Mackenzie Basin after it has emerged that resource consents for the farms have already been granted without public notification.

Labour’s Water Quality spokesperson Brendon Burns says consents for the farms running nearly 18,000 cows were apparently approved in recent months by the Waitaki District Council, with no public notification because it considered the effects were minor.

The three corporate owners are now applying for water for the farms, in a hearing in Christchurch and run by Environment Canterbury, Brendon Burns said. “The council’s approvals illustrate the need for integrated environmental planning laws.

“The past week has seen even the Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister acknowledge concerns about factory dairy farming in the Mackenzie Basin.

“That’s welcome --- but the even bigger issue is irrigating 27,000 hectares of fragile environment, much of it for dairying.”

Brendon Burns says in submissions to the Ecan water consent hearings last week, the Tourism Industry Association made clear its concerns about the Mackenzie Basin irrigation proposals.

“The Tourism Industry Association says the Mackenzie Basin is enjoying spectacular growth in guest nights compared to the rest of New Zealand. It asks the Ecan consent commissioners to carefully consider the critical importance of natural landscapes, clean air and water.

“I agree that the Mackenzie Basin is blessed with extraordinary beauty and decisions should not be made for short to medium term economic gains.”

Brendon Burns said Mr Key, who is also Tourism Minister, should support the tourism industry’s clearly-signaled opposition to further wide-scale irrigation and dairying in the Mackenzie Basin.
