Kiwis get another raw deal as Government back tracks

Kiwis get another raw deal as Government back tracks on ACC levies

National is pinching money from the back pockets of Kiwis, taking cash it doesn’t need through ACC levies to create the illusion of a surplus, Labour’s ACC spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says.

“The Government has ignored the Accident Compensation Corporation's recommendation that levies on Kiwi workers and businesses be cut by $658 million next year, instead cutting them by a lesser $480 million as indicated at the Budget.

“ACC levies cannot be used for any other purpose. National is over-taxing every New Zealand worker and the money will just sit in the bank doing nothing.

“That’s an incredible abuse of the Government’s power to demand revenue from its citizens.

“The vehicle safety rating system is nothing more than a tax on people who can’t afford flash cars. A levy reduction of a few hundred dollars is not going to inspire anyone juggling the cost of weekly bills to go out and spend thousands on a new car.

“Labour will make sure ACC provides fair treatment and fair compensation in return for a fair levy,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.
