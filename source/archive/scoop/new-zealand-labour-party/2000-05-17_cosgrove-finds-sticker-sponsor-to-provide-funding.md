Cosgrove finds sticker sponsor to provide full funding

Canterbury Police are to get a funding windfall after Waimakariri Labour Member of Parliament, Clayton Cosgrove, brokered a deal with a backer to bankroll the next print run of the yellow Under-25 stickers.

The renewal of the controversial sticker scheme was earlier seen as under a funding cloud in Canterbury even after a Crown Law opinion ruled that the scheme, which has been taken up by 50,000 Canterbury drivers, was legal.

Mr Cosgrove took the lead role in defending the scheme which critics have claimed discriminates against people under 25.

Police estimated that it would cost between $15,000 to $20,000 to fund the next print run of the stickers which are now unavailable because of intense public demand.

Mr Cosgrove said that he had now got a proposal from two Canterbury business people to fund the cost of the next print run.

He would not disclose the names of the backers at this stage as this was a decision to be made in consultation with them.

“Let’s just say that they are business people with the vision to see the goodwill that can come from the private sector putting their money back into something that helps keep our community safe,’’ Mr Cosgrove said.

“I think it’s great to see creative partnerships like this between the private sector and the community.’’

Funding for the renewal of the sticker scheme was now lined up, subject to the details being worked out. Mr Cosgrove hoped to have all the detail work completed within the next few weeks.

“It is now up to the Police to take up this offer”, Mr Cosgrove said.
