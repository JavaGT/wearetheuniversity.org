Time to focus on local issues

Labour's candidate for Mt Albert David Shearer is calling for the focus of the Mt Albert by-election to return to local issues.

"I believe we should be debating local issues and should not focusing on a candidate's personality," says David Shearer.

David Shearer was responding to the Auckland University Students’ Association meeting today.

"The voters of Mt Albert I meet are interested in talking about the issues. I am out there talking about local jobs, the Waterview motorway and the Super City.

"That's what people want to talk about and that's what I'll continue to focus on."

He said he does not believe Ms Lee is a racist.

"All candidates have accepted her apology and we should move on.
