Provincial areas yet to see the gains

While encouraging signs for the economy are emerging, job security is still a major concern for thousands of hardworking New Zealand families, Labour’s Social Development spokesperson Annette King said today.

“We are starting to see the benefits of the upturn in the international economy and that’s good news. But times are still very uncertain for many families.

“Wairarapa is a case in point. Unemployment in the Wairarapa has trebled in 18 months and it now has 481 working aged people on the dole,” Annette King says.

“That’s up from 138 people last June – a huge increase in an area of that size.

“Disappointingly, the Government’s much flaunted Job Ops scheme has found work for just 29 young people in the Work and Income central region – which is a drop in the bucket compared to the local unemployment rates.

“Earlier this month I released figures showing the number of people on benefits has soared by nearly 50,000 since National took office. The number of working age people collecting a main benefit had skyrocketed from 274,605 in November to 323,160 last month.

“The Government is simply not doing enough to help struggling families. John Key and his ministers are happy with sitting on the sidelines rather than getting involved. That has to change,” Annette King says.
