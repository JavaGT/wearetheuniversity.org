PM kidding himself on power prices

**PM kidding himself on power prices**

Despite John Key’s best verbal gymnastics he has finally confirmed that he is happy with power prices in New Zealand, and does not believe they are too high, says the Labour Leader David Shearer.

“In Parliament this afternoon I asked the Prime Minister whether he thinks New Zealanders are paying a fair price for electricity.

“He talked a lot about the Labour Party. He talked about prices in other countries. He did everything he could to avoid talking about power prices in New Zealand.

“But in the end, after three direct questions, John Key finally admitted that:

_“I think that they are paying a price which is cognisant and fair in relation to the environment we find ourselves in…”_

“It might not be the most elegant way of saying “yes” but at least John Key has now confirmed he thinks Kiwis are paying a fair price for electricity.

“John Key is completely out of touch. He should tell that to the hundreds-of-thousands of Genesis customers who woke up to the news this morning that they’re facing yet another price hike.

“That’s thanks in no small part to the increased cost of transmission, which has been driven up by the Government’s decision to take $472-million dollars in dividends from Transpower over the last two years rather than allowing it to invest the national grid. Well, Genesis consumers are paying for the upgrade work instead.

“Every New Zealander knows our power prices are out of control – they just have to look at their latest power bill.

“John Key doesn’t think there’s a problem. He’s happy to watch power companies make super profits while Kiwis worry about whether or not they can afford to turn on the heater.

“Labour will tackle skyrocketing power prices. We’ll cut the average power bill by hundreds of dollars a year and restrict future price rises,” says David Shearer.
