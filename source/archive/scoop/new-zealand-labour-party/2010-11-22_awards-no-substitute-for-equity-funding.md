The Prime Minister's inaugural Pacific Youth Awards are no substitute for the equity funding that his Government has reduced, says Labour MP Carmel Sepuloni.

"The Pacific Youth Awards given out at the Pacific Business Awards on Friday night were a nice but hollow gesture from the Prime Minister,” Carmel Sepuloni said.

“It's great to see Pasifika young people succeeding - but they are doing so despite, not because of, this Government.

"How do we support the best and brightest young Pasifika New Zealanders when the Government is cutting their support in tertiary education?

“From the declining investment in universities, including in equity funding for Pasifika students, to student loan restrictions, to the high unemployment that is hitting our Pasifika communities the hardest - the National Government has made it harder and harder for young Pasifika people to succeed.

“Handing out a few awards does nothing to change that.

"John Key's Pacific Youth Awards might seem like an effort to encourage Pasifika success - but his Government's actions prove that National is anything but committed to Pasifika educational achievement,” Carmel Sepuloni said.
