Generations written off in night class cuts

  
The Education Minister has effectively written off several generations of learners with her comments on TVNZ’s Q + A programme this morning, said Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.

“Anne Tolley’s explanation for the 80 percent cuts to night class funding was that the age of those taking part does not fit the government’s priority, because the average learner is 46 years old,” Maryan Street said.

“Statistics NZ figures show there are 1,628,020 people aged 45 plus, or 38 percent of the population. They have as much right as younger people to learn new skills, and in many cases, they are undertaking retraining after being made redundant during this economic recession.”

“There is a wave of public meetings and protests happening the length of this country, where people of all ages are challenging the night class cuts as short sighted, and sharing stories of how they gained useful new skills that helped them in the workforce.”

“In major cities and small communities people are asking why this comparatively small amount of money is being taken away from school and community based night classes which provide such a high return on investment in educational and social terms,” said Maryan Street.
