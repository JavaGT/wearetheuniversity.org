Cancer prevention calls gain momentum

  
Research showing bowel cancer treatment sucks up more public health dollars than other cancers once again highlights the need for a national screening programme, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.

A study by Otago University, which found colon cancer is the most costly cancer overall, also renews calls for a national bowel screening programme.

“Surely it is time the Government woke up to the preventable tragedy of bowel cancer,” Annette King says.

“The delay in implementing a nationwide screening programme is shameful – it is penny pinching and it is costing lives.

“Everyone, including Health Minister Jonathan Coleman has seen how successful the pilot has been.

“Labour set out a costed and affordable proposal to roll out nationwide screening starting in the regions with the highest incidence and death rates during the 2014 election.

“The Government cannot keep putting it off. There should be no more delays,” Annette King says.
