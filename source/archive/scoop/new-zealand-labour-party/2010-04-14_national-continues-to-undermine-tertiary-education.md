National continues to undermine Tertiary education

**National continues to undermine Tertiary education**

Tightening entrance standards for all degree programmes puts polytechnic students at risk of being turned away at the door, says Labour’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson, Maryan Street.

“If higher entry standards are going to be imposed on universities, they will need to be applied across the board, because degree programmes are also offered at polytechnics. Polytechnics are often home to second chance learners and older students. They may find themselves falling outside of any inflexible entrance criteria introduced as a result of the review being carried out by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority.

“It seems at a time when unemployment is high and job opportunities are low, the government should be encouraging people to gain further education, and supporting them to succeed, but instead they are determined to limit educational opportunities.

“First National cut Adult and Community Education courses, then they cut the Training Incentive Allowance for beneficiaries. National is also looking to review the way tertiary institutions are funded and now want to restrict who can get into them.

“The government’s changes to the tertiary education sector are clearly limiting the educational opportunities for those who need it the most – second chance learners, sole parents, older students, Maori and Pacific people.

  
“This latest review needs to take into account that not all learners are the same. Entrance criteria need to be flexible enough to take into account not only academic achievements but also valuable life and work experience.

“Steven Joyce needs to stop trying to make our tertiary education system as cheap as possible by cutting out not only funding , but also New Zealanders,” said Maryan Street.
