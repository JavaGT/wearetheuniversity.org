Chance tomorrow for National to back workers
============================================

**Chance tomorrow for National to back workers**

Labour MP Darien Fenton is calling on the Government to show some heart tomorrow by supporting her Redundancy Protection Bill, which gives basic redundancy protection to thousands of workers.

The Bill is to be introduced in the House tomorrow and needs the support of the National Party to pass.

“I hope for the sake of the growing number of Kiwis who through no fault of their own are struggling to hold onto their jobs, that National shows some heart and supports the Bill,” Darien Fenton said.

“The Bill is about providing all working New Zealanders with the basic redundancy protection they need to help tide them over between jobs. Kiwis want to work and with unemployment running at such high levels this has rarely been more important.

“Other countries do it, and so do most businesses that have a union onsite. It's time this right was extended to all Kiwis. It is not fair that workers, particularly those in lower paid jobs, can be sent down the road at a moment's notice without a bean, no matter how long or hard they have worked for a company.

“The Bill has broad support – from Labour, the Greens, the Maori Party, unions and community organisations.

“But for the bill to pass we need the Government's support. John Key has promised to help working families through the recession and we're calling on him to make good on that promise by supporting the bill,” Darien Fenton said.
