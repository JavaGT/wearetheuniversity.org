Fair A&E Access For West Achieved
=================================

**Wednesday, 20 June 2001, 4:51 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

“I am delighted to confirm that all Ambulance transfers from West Auckland’s A&E Center to North Shore Hospital are now free”, Titirangi MP David Cunliffe said today.

“For the last year I have lobbied hard to get West Aucklanders a fair deal on access to emergency health services”, David Cunliffe said. “The good news was confirmed at a meeting I had this week with Waitemata Health CEO Dwayne Crombie”.

“If you live on the North Shore and need extensive emergency care it has always been on your doorstep at North Shore Hospital.

“But if you live in the West and presented at Lincoln Road A&E it cost you $80 for an ambulance to North Shore Hospital when you needed it.

“That was not fair. I campaigned against it. It has now been stopped. All Ambulance transfers are now free due to a new subsidy I fought hard for in this year’s budget”, the Titirangi MP said.

“Hon Annette King our Minister of Health was strongly supportive and I want to thank her and her advisers for their support”, David Cunliffe said.

“Waitemata Health has now, after some delay last year, fully implemented the new policy and I congratulate them for doing so”, he said.
