Confidence in CERA at an all-time low

Confidence in the Government’s handling of the Canterbury recovery has hit an all-time low as we approach the 5th anniversary of the February earthquake, says Labour’s Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.

“As the slow and messy recovery grinds on, Cantabrians are losing faith in the Government’s ability to deliver. Documents tabled in Parliament’s select committee yesterday show very low levels of public confidence.

“74 per cent of Cantabrians did not have confidence in the recovery decisions being made, according to CERA’s own Wellbeing Survey.

“71 per cent of people did not have confidence in the decisions CERA was making, and 75 per cent of people were unhappy with the opportunities they had to influence decisions about earthquake recovery.

“These numbers show why CERA is feeling the need to invest so heavily in public relations work – Cantabrians are getting sick and tired of a lack of progress on the recovery, and the Government’s out of touch, top down decision making process.

“These numbers need to be a wake-up call for the Government – people in Canterbury want to see less spin and more results,” says Megan Woods.
