MEDIA STATEMENT

**Government Must Support our Gifted Children**

The Government must step up its commitment to our gifted children and increase their ability to learn and extend themselves through education, says Labour’s Education Spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.  
   
This coming week from 18 – 24 June is Gifted Awareness Week. It is an opportunity for us to focus on supporting our talented children and helping them to reach their full potential.  
   
“The achievement of all children in education is a priority for Labour. Our schools comprise of diverse learners who all deserve the best from a quality public education.  
   
“Last year the sector recommended a number of actions be taken by Government to extend the learning opportunities for those students with exceptional abilities and qualities.  
   
“Those recommendations included specific recognition of these students, the development of a strategy to advance their interests and better supporting professional leadership and development. It is important that action is taken in these areas.  
   
“What has become clear as I visit schools throughout the country is that we have a quality education system that meets the needs of most students but we also face some important challenges.  
   
“We need to be more responsive to students who struggle to stay engaged in learning and we must extend those who have unique and exceptional learning abilities.  
   
“Gifted and talented children come from all walks of life. Giving them the chance to extend themselves within the public education system will result in all our children being offered the opportunity to succeed.  
   
“The Education Minister should respond to the recommendations which are currently sitting idle in her Ministry and demonstrate that the achievement aspirations for all learners can thrive in our schooling system,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
