Labour mourns the loss of Dr Ranginui Walker  

Ko te papa e hora nei kua tarehua. E mihi ana ki te whenua e tangi ana ki te tangata. He tai papaki ki waho o Rehua, he tai mihinga tangata, he tai mate hoki. E te tohunga o te whakaiti. E te Ahorangi o te matauranga kua maunu to waka. Kua papā te kakau o to hoe ki te hīpapa o to waka tīwaiwai nō reira haere atu rā koe ki Hawaiki I whakataukitia ai e o tātou tūpuna. Nō reira haere e te kawa tūnuku, tūrangi, tūpapa I tu ai a Tane.

The Labour Party Maori Caucus joins the country in expressing our great sadness at the loss of esteemed Māori leader and academic Dr Ranginui Walker and our sympathies to his family.

“His contribution to academia, education and politics has been without peer and stands as a truly great New Zealander. In almost all debates on the future of Maori, he has been a towering voice,” said Kelvin Davis, Leader of Labour’s Maori Caucus.

“As a member of New Zealand Māori Council and in his many other roles Dr Walker fought tirelessly for Maori for decades.

“All of us in Labour will mourn his passing and his leadership will inspire another generation to step up and fill the hole he has left.

“He was a leader, a thinker and a figher. He was also humble in his service. That’s how he should be remembered,” said Kelvin Davis.
