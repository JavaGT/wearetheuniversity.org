**Labour’s Dunedin MPs pay respects to Ralph Hotere**

Dunedin's electorate MPs David Clark and Clare Curran have paid their respects to Port Chalmers artist Ralph Hotere, ONZ, who died yesterday in Dunedin aged 81.

"Ralph's works were highly sought after. His admission to the Order of New Zealand reflected his contribution to our identity and sense of place. He was a retiring man who made extraordinary use of ordinary objects.

"Ralph's Aramoana work played an important role in saving the wetlands at the Otago Harbour mouth. History shows he was on the right side of many social issues and a tireless campaigner.

Labour Leader David Shearer said earlier: “Ralph Hotere was one of this country’s most important contemporary artists. His works were provocative and thoughtful. He boldly tackled controversial political issues and challenged our way of thinking.

“We send our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Ralph Hotere as they mourn his passing.”

"His significance stretches beyond Port and beyond Dunedin, but we in particular will mourn the loss of one of this city's most loved and distinguished citizens," Clare Curran and David Clark said.
