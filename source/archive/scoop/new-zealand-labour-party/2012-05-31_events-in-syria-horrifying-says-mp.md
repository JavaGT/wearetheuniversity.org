**Events in Syria horrifying, says MP**

Labour’s Associate Spokesperson for Disarmament, Ross Robertson, has expressed his disgust at the horrific and senseless killings in Houla, Syria.

“In particular, the violent deaths of so many young and innocent children defy belief. There is no justification for it whatsoever.

“It is a horrifying example of the absence of high common international standards in the global arms trade, which is currently allowing thousands of civilians around the globe to be slaughtered each year by weapons that are sold, transferred by governments, or diverted to unscrupulous regimes, criminals, illegal militias, and terrorist groups.

“More than 1,300 legislators from around the world have signed up to the _Control Arms Global Parliamentary Declaration_ on the Arms Trade Treaty in an effort to curb such violence,” Ross Robertson said.

“Man's inhumanity to man is seemingly eclipsed only by man's inhumanity to his children. Governments must protect and safeguard their people, and sadly in Syria this basic responsibility has been consigned to oblivion.

“How much longer must the people of Syrian confront the brutal acts of the agents and sympathisers of their own government?”

“We urge all those in a position to do so, to end once and for all the terrible plight which the men, women and children continue to endure in the nation of Syria, and we urge prompt and meaningful accountability for all the crimes that have been committed,” said Ross Robertson.
