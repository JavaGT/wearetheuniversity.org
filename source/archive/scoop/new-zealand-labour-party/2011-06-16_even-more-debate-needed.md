Even More Debate Needed

Rick Barker

Senior Whip

MEDIA STATEMENT

**Even More Debate Needed**

Without reasoned compromise and significant amendments Heather Roy’s Voluntary Student Membership Bill will fall of the legislative edge, says Labour’s Senior Whip Rick Barker.

The Act MP has previously hit out at Labour’s “filibustering” during debates on the bill, but Rick Barker today reaffirmed that the bill in its current form is unlikely to be passed, and says even more debate is needed.

“Contrary to Ms Roy’s concerns that Labour is thwarting democratic process all that is actually desired is a reasoned approach to student association membership,” Rick Barker said.

“Labour welcomes ‘negotiations and compromise’ with Heather Roy to get this bill into an acceptable, durable policy that will ensure student services and advocacy continue.

“Labour remains opposed to the bill which it believes will mean the end of many services on campus and, ultimately, higher study costs to students and higher costs to tax payers,” Rick Barker said.

“I say to Heather Roy, if you want progress talk to us and negotiate. A doctrinaire approach will be met by stiff opposition.”
