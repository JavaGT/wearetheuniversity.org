Government Gambling with Kiwi Kids Future
=========================================

Nanaia MAHUTA

Education Spokesperson  
   
22 April  2012                                                               

MEDIA STATEMENT  
   
**Government Gambling with Kiwi Kids Future**  
   
The Government’s Charter School trial is risky business if we look at international evidence which shows that the outcomes for learners are variable, there are huge quality issues and inconclusive evidence about the extent to which the achievement of the most challenged learners are significantly improved, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.  
   
“The Government’s Charter School Trial will continue to shift more taxpayer money into private education models.  
   
"The Auditor-General found in 2010 that operational funding for approximately 327 integrated schools amounted to $127m. In 1999 that figure stood at $69m and National has continued to siphon off more public money into private schools. The Charter School trial will continue that trend.  
   
"Labour is committed to a well-funded quality public education system where all learners have equality of opportunity.  
   
"There are huge challenges to ensure that more young people achieve the necessary qualifications for them to thrive and pursue a career, get a trade or higher qualification to enable them to be productive citizens.  
   
"The Government’s working group on charter schools may have determined that the first schools will be not-for-profit, but that is not enough. These schools should not be able to recruit untrained teachers or siphon off students in a way that adds further competition in our most needy communities.  
   
"The Charter School trial is a distraction. The Government should instead lift achievement in all schools by looking at what works and supporting local innovations that have grown under the public education system, including trades academies and targeted initiatives for Maori and Pacific learners.  
   
"Instead the Government is set to pursue its blatant ideology and pour public money into private enterprise - proving that they are prepared to gamble with the future of our children's education,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
