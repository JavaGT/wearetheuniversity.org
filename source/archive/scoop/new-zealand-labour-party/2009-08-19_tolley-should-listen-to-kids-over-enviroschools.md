Tolley should listen to kids over enviroschools

School children from Dunedin and Wellington are calling on Education Minister Anne Tolley to reverse her decision to cut funding to enviroschools.

Primary school students from two Wellington schools will gather on the steps of Parliament today to sign a petition calling on the Minister to reverse her decision to axe enviroschools funding.

Wellington Central MP Grant Robertson, Dunedin South MP Clare Curran, Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson, Labour Education spokesperson Trevor Mallard and Greens co-leader Metiria Turei will meet with students from Thorndon and Karori West primary schools to draw attention to cuts to education for sustainability funding.

“It just doesn’t make sense that, in this time of recession, where people are losing their jobs and having to cut back to make ends meet, that a programme that teaches kids from low socio-economic backgrounds how to grow their own veges, minimise waste, be more energy efficient, how to landscape and the principles of eco-building is considered a waste of money?” Clare Curran said.

Ms Tolley has been asked to attend the event.

There are 692 enviroschools, across New Zealand with 213,550 students.

“Education for sustainability provides the academic rigour and research to the enviroschools programme.

“Across Dunedin there are 37 schools in total that are part of the programme. I’ve seen first hand the benefits enviroschools bring to schools, particularly those that are low decile.

“Teachers and schools kids are passionate about environmental education and are upset National’s decision to cut enviroschool funding,” Clare Curran said.
