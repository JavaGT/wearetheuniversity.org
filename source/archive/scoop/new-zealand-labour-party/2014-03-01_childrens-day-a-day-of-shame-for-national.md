Children’s Day a day of shame for National

Children’s Day a day of shame for National

Prime Minister John Key and his National Government should hang their heads in shame during Children’s Day tomorrow for their unwillingness to tackle child poverty, says Labour Leader David Cunliffe

“Children’s Day this year comes just days after the Government was forced to admit a stuff-up by Treasury resulted in the incomes of 300,000 low-income Kiwi households being understated by thousands of dollars each on average.

“It revealed National has been underestimating the number of Kiwi kids living in poverty by 20,000.

“National has done nothing to address child poverty. Its only answer has been a proposal to introduce performance pay for teachers. The Government fails to realise that children don’t leave their lives at the classroom door.

“Under Labour’s Best Start package, the parents of about 50,000 kids living in poverty will be $60 a week better off until their child turns three.

“This could make the world of difference to struggling families.

“Under Best Start, a Labour government will also increase free early childhood education for three to five-year-olds from 20 to 25 hours a week, build more childcare centres in needy areas, extend paid parental leave from 14 to 26 weeks and support vulnerable mums-to-be.

“Labour recognises that times are tough for Kiwi families who are yet to share the rewards of National’s much heralded economic recovery.

“Labour is committed to tackling child poverty and ensuring that all Kiwi kids get the very best start in life,” David Cunliffe says.
