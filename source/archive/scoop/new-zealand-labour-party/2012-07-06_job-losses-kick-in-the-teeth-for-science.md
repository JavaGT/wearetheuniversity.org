**Job losses kick in the teeth for science**

The loss of three NIWA staff from New Zealand’s world-renowned Lauder research centre is another kick in the teeth for our science community, Labour’s associate spokesperson for Science Megan Woods says.

“Lauder specialises in climate change research. It has an international reputation for its work in that area. Scientists from the centre were among a team awarded the prestigious Prime Minister’s Science Prize in December.

“It was a great photo op for the Prime Minister whose on-going ‘support’ for and investment in the sector is regularly trotted out by the government. Obviously that support doesn’t translate to what’s going on behind closed door,” Megan Woods said.

“These latest cuts – NIWA lost more staff last year – come just weeks after the Ministry of Science and Innovation was wrapped into Mobie. That doesn’t bode well for the future of research in this country and confirms many people’s fear that science would be lost among the plethora of departments that make up Steven Joyce’s new ‘super’ ministry.

“Despite what it says, the government is neglecting science in at all levels - from cutting funding for post-grad students through to undermining NZ’s research centres.

“Science doesn’t happen by magic. The scientific community needs nurturing and support. We all know what can be achieved when we get behind our bright minds and Labour will do exactly that,” said Megan Woods.
