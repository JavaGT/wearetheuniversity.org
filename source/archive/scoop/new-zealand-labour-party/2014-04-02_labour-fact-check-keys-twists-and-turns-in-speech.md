Labour fact check: Key’s twists and turns in speech

David  
PARKER

Spokesperson for Finance

2 April 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Labour fact check: Key’s twists and turns in speech**

John Key has yet again twisted the figures and selectively chosen his statistics, a fact check by Labour shows, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker.

“John Key has a long history of getting away with misstatements that range from an honest mistake to worse. Today Labour is calling him out with a list of the misrepresentations in his speech.

“Labour is determined to hold John Key and his spin doctors to account ahead of election year,” says David Parker.

_Key: Over the past year, for example, 66,000 more people have got a job._

Over the past two years, unemployment has fallen by only 4000 (from 151 thousand to 147 thousand)

_Key: Average weekly wages have gone up 2.8 per cent, compared to inflation of only 1.6 per cent._

Under the Labour Cost Index – the measure of wage rates, Salary and ordinary time wage rates increased by 1.6% - an zero increase in real terms.

_Key: And the economy as a whole has grown 3.1 per cent – one of the faster growth rates in the developed world._

The annual growth rate is 2.7 per cent - Key is misleading the public by using the quarter-on-quarter annual growth rate. Annual year-on-year growth is a much more robust measure of growth as it covers a broader time period (a year, rather than three months). This is the measure that Treasury uses in its forecasts.

_Key: We have had an on-going commitment to discipline around government spending and that will continue this year, next year and for as long as we lead the Government._

National has increased debt by $60 billion in office, the worst of any in government (in nominal terms) and the worst since Muldoon as a percentage of GDP.

_Key: One way to illustrate our approach is this – in the last five years of the previous Labour government, new operating spending each budget averaged $2.7 billion a year._

Every year Labour posted large surpluses and paid down debt. National has yet to do this once, after more than five years in office.

_Key: In the last five years of Labour, government spending in total went up 50 per cent._

In the last five years of Labour we introduced Working for Families, interest free Student loans and Kiwi Saver – all paid for out of growth. None of which National has repealed .

**Total Government expenses**

Labour:

$55.2b to $75.8b from Budget 2003 to Budget 2008: Increase of $20.6b (37 per cent)

National:

$75.8b to $91.0b from Budget 2008 to Budget 2013: Increase of $15.2b (20 per cent)

**Total Government Revenue**

Labour:

$57.0b to $81.5b from Budget 2003 to Budget 2008: Increase of $24.5b (43 per cent)

National:

$81.5b to $86.7b from Budget 2008 to Budget 2013: Increase of $5.2b (6 per cent)

**Net government debt (excluding Super Fund):**

Labour:

$17.6b to $10.3b from Budget 2003 to Budget 2008 (-43 per cent)

National:

$10.3b to $55.8b from Budget 2008 to Budget 2013 (+442 per cent)
