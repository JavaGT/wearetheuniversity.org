Labour Selects Wellington Central Candidate

The Labour Party today selected Grant Robertson as its candidate for the Wellington Central electorate at next years election. Mr Robertson’s candidacy was endorsed at a meeting of around 100 Labour members and supporters.

Jeremy Greenbrook-Held, Deputy Chair of the Wellington Central Labour Electorate Committee said that the endorsement of Mr Robertson was resounding. "We are thrilled to have selected Grant as our candidate, and will now focus on the campaign ahead and retaining Wellington Central for  
Labour."

Mr Robertson, 36, is a former public servant and diplomat, student leader and Prime Ministerial advisor. He currently works in Wellington as a research and business manager for Otago University.

“I am grateful for the support that the electorate organisation and the wider party has shown me by selecting me today. Wellington has thrived under a Labour led government, and I am really looking forward to promoting our vision for a sustainable future for our city and country”, Mr Robertson said.

“I love Wellington. It is the city I chose to move to twelve years ago, and it is where I have established my roots. My skills and experience will, if elected, allow me to be a strong advocate for the people of this electorate”, Mr Robertson said.

Mr Robertson paid tribute to Wellington Central MP Marian Hobbs, who will retire at the next election. “Marian has built a remarkable connection with the diverse communities of Wellington Central. Her passion, energy and commitment have been unstinting. I want to continue and build on Marian’s work across the electorate”.

“Labour is taking nothing for granted in Wellington Central. I will need to earn the respect and support of voters. I am proud of what Labour has achieved in eight years in government, and I also recognise that there is more to do to make New Zealand an even better, fairer and more prosperous place”, Mr Robertson said.
