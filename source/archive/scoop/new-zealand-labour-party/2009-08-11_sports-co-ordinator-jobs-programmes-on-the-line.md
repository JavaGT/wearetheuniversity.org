Sports co-ordinator jobs, programmes on the line

Sport fit co-ordinator jobs and programmes on the line

Sports co-ordinator jobs and the programmes they run are now on the line because of changes made today by the National Government, Labour’s Sport and Recreation spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.

SPARC currently contracts more than 400 New Zealand secondary schools to provide sport and recreation coordinators to work with students, teachers and communities to support opportunities for students’ participation in sport and recreation

“The National Party today claimed that it would be increasing sports participation, while at the same time it has made the decision to no longer directly fund sports co-ordinators.

“These jobs are often held by up and coming sports people who work part-time while supporting their own training. They're great role models for our kids and the emphasis on low decile schools was helping to target the assistance to where it was most needed.

“Given the National Government’s claim that it wants more kids involved in sport allowing schools to scrap Sport Fit Co-ordinator positions show just how shallow that aim is.

“If National are serious about getting kids active then why are they getting rid of the people who co-ordinate sport in schools?

"National's decision not to hold schools accountable for how they spend the money could result in sports money being re-directed into other school spending.

“If schools are already spending money on sport, they can simply report that in their year-end reports and pocket the extra cash for other activities. Not one extra dollar will go into kids sport if that happens.

"The government has also overlooked the fact that getting kids physically active isn't just about competitive sport. They've slashed funding for things like the Mission On Stage Challenge, which has also been a great way to get kids doing physical activity.

“The changes announced today including population based funding rather than needs based funding will lead to a real loss of focus, additional bureaucracy and a total lack of accountability, “Chris Hipkins said.
