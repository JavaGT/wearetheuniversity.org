17 February 2009 Media Statement

National sets dangerous precedent

  
The sacking of the Otago District Health Board chairman sends a message to organisations that the National government will fire anyone who discovers wrong doing, Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson says.

“Richard Thomson discovered a fraud and helped to ensure those responsible were brought to justice, his reward for this was to be sacked.

“National are clearly not interested in holding the guilty to account, but instead want to see those who discover wrongdoing keep their mouths shut.

Mr Hodgson said Richard Thomson was the second highest polling candidate in the last local body elections. This election was held well after all the essential details regarding the fraud were publicly known.

“Mr Thomson has already been held to account by the electors of Dunedin, and their judgement was to re-elect him,” Pete Hodgson said.

Mr Hodgson said the actions of Tony Ryall ignore the outpouring of support for Mr Thomson by clinicians and the people of Dunedin.

“Tony Ryall campaigned on the basis that if he became Minister of Health he would listen to frontline medical staff and give them a say in what happens at their DHB.

“Well given the overwhelming support Mr Thomson has received from frontline clinical staff, it is clear Mr Ryall wasn’t listening to either the public or the clinicians of Otago DHB.

“His breathtaking arrogance in sacking someone who helped bring to justice fraudsters should give the entire health sector cause for concern,” Pete Hodgson said.
