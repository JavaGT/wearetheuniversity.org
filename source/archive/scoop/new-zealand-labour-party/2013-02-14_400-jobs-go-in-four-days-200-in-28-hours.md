400 jobs go in four days, 200 in 28 hours

**400 jobs go in four days, 200 in 28 hours**

Four hundred Kiwis have lost their jobs in just four days, showing the Government’s economic programme isn’t working, says Labour’s Finance spokesperson David Parker.

“Between Datam, Mainzeal and Contact Energy 400 jobs have been lost in four days, with 200 gone in just over 28 hours. That’s the sort of record we don’t need.

“Recently we’ve seen Summit Wool Spinners cut 200 jobs. On top of Datam, Mainzeal and Contact Energy, that’s 600 jobs and we’re only half-way through February. That’s a shocking indictment.

“It’s no wonder 33,000 Kiwis gave up on looking for work in the last three months of 2012. Most of those are leaving for Australia. If they hadn’t given up unemployment would be above eight per cent.

“The Government has no ideas. All it can do is call for more foreign investment despite overseas companies deserting New Zealand in droves.

“The only area that’s growing in New Zealand is Canterbury and that’s due to tragedy and insurance inflows, not any act of this Government.”
