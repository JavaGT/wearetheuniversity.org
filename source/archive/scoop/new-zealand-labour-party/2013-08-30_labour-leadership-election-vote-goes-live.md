Labour leadership election vote goes live
=========================================

LABOUR LEADERSHIP ELECTION VOTE GOES LIVE

Votes are in the mail, the election rules are set and the most common questions about the election process have been addressed in Labour’s leadership election.

Labour members, including Caucus members, and affiliate members, are being offered three options to vote – by post, on line and in ballot boxes at Husting Meetings. The ballot paper (link) has been posted over the past 24 hours to all Party members who were financial at the time that the election was triggered. Mailings to affiliates and Caucus are now proceeding. Members living overseas, or who will be overseas at the time of the vote, can receive and be sent their vote online. The order of candidates on both the ballot paper and the online version has been randomised.

The Code of Conduct for candidates has now been finalised

Twelve Hustings Meetings have been confirmed

And the Party has, based on calls and e-mails to Head Office handled by Party Head Office the past week, prepared a Frequently Asked Questions document (link) which will be emailed to members and placed on the Party website.

Tim Barnett, Returning Officer, said today:

“This is a highly democratic election being conducted with a 21st century range of options to engage for our thousands of voters. With the ballot papers out our focus moves to the Hustings Meetings, and to the administration of applications from former members who wish to re-join and vote”.
