Labour confirms Soraya Peke-Mason for Te Tai Hauauru

The Labour Party has confirmed Soraya Peke-Mason as its candidate for the Māori electorate seat of Te Tai Hauauru in next year’s general election.

Ms Peke-Mason was nominated by the local Ratana Branch of the Labour Party and was officially confirmed at a ceremony held at Ratana attended by local supporters, whanau and Labour Party Executives.

Ms Peke-Mason says she’s privileged to be the Labour Candidate for Te Tai Hauauru.

“As a passionate follower of both the Ratana Faith and Movement, it is both humbling and an absolute honour to be selected as the Labour candidate for Te Tai Hauauru. I know the people of Nga Hau E Wha (Ratana Community) are delighted that the Labour candidate for the seat they call Te Arepa will be one of their own” said Ms Peke-Mason.

The Labour-Ratana alliance is a key feature of the Labour Party’s history.

“The Labour-Ratana Alliance is historical and significant and represents the binding of the covenant between Michael Savage and TW Ratana. This alliance is still as relevant today as when it was formalised in 1936”, said Ms Peke-Mason.

Politics is not new to Ms Peke-Mason, who has spent the last nine years involved in Local Government, first two terms on Ratana Community Board and now as a second term Rangitikei District Councillor for the Turakina Ward.

“Te Tai Hauauru needs a strong new voice in Parliament, and I am going to work hard to ensure that come the general election next year I will be that strong new voice”, said Ms Peke-Mason.
