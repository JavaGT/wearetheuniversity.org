4 November 2008 Media Statement

Speedy Nats break first promise before Election Day

National is off to a flying start with promise breaking, notching up its first broken promise even before polling gets underway, according to Labour’s tertiary education spokesperson Pete Hodgson.

“Three weeks ago National promised to respond to Labour’s student allowances policy by providing details of their own policy before the election.

“Not any more. Now we are told there will be no student allowances policy from National. What are they hiding from students?

“I’ve seen promises broken very soon after Election Day but I don’t believe I’ve ever seen one broken before Election Day. “
