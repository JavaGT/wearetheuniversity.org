Asset Cuts to fund Tax Cuts

Asset Cuts to fund Tax Cuts

Labour candidate for Te Tai Tokerau and former school Principal Kelvin Davis says he’s seen more imagination in a Year 5 essay competition than National’s policy for New Zealand’s future.

“The National Party has made it abundantly clear that their idea of progress is to trot out the tired old strategies of selling assets and borrowing from offshore. Maybe Key and English should spend half a day in a class of 9 year olds to gather some inspiration.” Davis says.

“New Zealanders’ state assets will be gone by lunchtime and we’ll be up to our eyeballs in debt by dinner. English’s slip about selling KiwiBank only confirmed what the Labour Government has known all along. The National Party is one leopard incapable of changing its spots. Their future is a return to their failed past.”

“This is the price hard working Kiwis will pay in order for John Key to fund his tax bribes.”

“New Zealand families know how difficult it is to get out of debt, but National plans to increase our debt to the point where New Zealanders will be paying over $1 billion extra a year, just to meet interest payments.

“A National government will cut resources to core government responsibilities such as health and education in order to service that debt. Future generations of New Zealanders will suffer both health and academic problems as a result.”
