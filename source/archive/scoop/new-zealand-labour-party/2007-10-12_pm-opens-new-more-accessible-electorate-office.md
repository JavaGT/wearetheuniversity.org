PM Opens New, More Accessible Maharey Office

Prime Minister opens new, more accessible electorate office

The Prime Minister Helen Clark is today officially opening Steve Maharey's new electorate office in Palmerston North.

Steve Maharey says the relocation marks the end of an era, after four decades of having this community facility on Ferguson Street.

"The new office on Princess Street is a huge improvement, providing an open, warm and fresh environment that is closer to the city centre and way more accessible for constituents in Palmerston North.

"More than 1200 locals came to our office for help in the past year in its previous location - I expect that figure to grow with our new site.

"The new modern facilities are highly visible, right in the middle of the city's retail area, putting our services on the doorstep of thousands of people.

"We encourage you to drop in so we can help you with a range of support, from liaising with government agencies on issues like immigration or housing, handling JP nominations, making a submission to a Parliamentary Select Committee, or even organising a petition.

"Our services are free and anyone can use them. We're open on Monday to Friday from 8.30 - 5. I'm generally in Palmerston North on a Friday, and hold clinics on Saturday mornings from 10 - 12 midday."
