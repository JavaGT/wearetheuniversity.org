National slashing more frontline jobs

National slashing more frontline jobs    
       

The Government is continuing to make cuts to frontline services with 60 jobs slashed from the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Labour State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“In just eight months the National Government have announced that up to 1500 people could be made redundant from organisations such as the Ministry of Social Development, ACC, IRD, MAF, the Tertiary Education Commission and the Ministry of Environment,” Grant Robertson said.

“The Government are blaming the latest frontline job cuts on a reduction in trade and cargo. But the reality is it was National who slashed nearly $2 million from MAFs budget.

“National has refused to allow government departments to sign up to the nine-day fortnight. Signing up for the nine day fortnight during the recession would have meant while there was a temporary reduction in cargo volumes workers would not have lost their jobs.

“If National were serious about saving Kiwi jobs it would let its own departments use initiatives like the nine day fortnight to keep people working.

“National promised to cap not cut the public service and it promised to ensure there were increased frontline resources available. By continuing cut jobs from the public service, including in this case frontline jobs, National is breaking both promises,” Grant Robertson said.
