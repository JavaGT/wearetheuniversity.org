**Sad day as Cantabrians remember first quake**

Today’s three year anniversary since the first earthquake in Christchurch will be deeply emotional as those who survived both the September and February quakes remember those who did not, Labour’s Christchurch-based MPs say.

“The two events are inextricably linked,” says Labour’s Clayton Cosgrove.

“This is a very solemn day. This will be a day when people will remember their mates, their wives, husbands, sons and daughters. Parents will hug their kids a little longer today.

“It was a day that changed the lives of Cantabrians and all New Zealanders. Cantabrians have shown grit, incredible patience and determination. Kiwis across our nation showed unbelievable generosity and compassion.

“It is also a day where we should give thanks to those magnificent and totally committed people in our emergency services, military, social services and healthcare workers.

“It’s said people show their true character in the hours of need in a crisis and this was certainly true on this day and the days that followed,” Clayton Cosgrove says.

Labour’s Ruth Dyson says although it has been three years since the first earthquake, for many thousands of Cantabrians, the nightmare is not over.

“The owners of 5000 severely damaged homes are still battling to have their insurance claims settled.

“These people are attempting not only to reconstruct their homes, but their lives and for many they cannot move on until these matters are resolved.

“Many Cantabrians continue to live in broken homes and the ongoing stress of this situation is impacting on their kids and their families. The Government must do everything they can to help these people rebuild,” Ruth Dyson says.
