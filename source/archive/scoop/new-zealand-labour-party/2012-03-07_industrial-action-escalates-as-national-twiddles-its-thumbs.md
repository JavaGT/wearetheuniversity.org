Escalating industrial disharmony sends a strong signal that Kiwis are tiring of National’s hear no evil-see no evil strategy, Labour’s spokesperson for Labour Issues, Darien Fenton says.

“We are facing another week of some of the worst industrial action we’ve seen in New Zealand for a decade, yet the Government continues to pretend everything is hunky dory.

“The National government has sent a clear message to New Zealand employers that everything is up for grabs, with substantial changes to collective bargaining and cuts to the wages of young New Zealanders on the cards.

“This has resulted in lockout or strikes of thousands of low paid rest home workers, port workers and meat workers, actions which affect not only the workers involved but their families, their clients and their communities.

“Now public servants are threatening to march and it’s clear their tolerance and loyalty has been sorely tested.

“The Minister of Labour, Kate Wilkinson, needs to send an unequivocal message to New Zealand employers that 1990’s take-it or leave-it industrial relations ended with the last National government and New Zealand expects better than this,” Darien Fenton said.
