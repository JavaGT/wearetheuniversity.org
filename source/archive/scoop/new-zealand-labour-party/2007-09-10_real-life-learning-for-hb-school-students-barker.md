Real-life learning for HB school students

10 September 2007

Hawke’s Bay school students are getting access to real hands-on learning experiences thanks to $300,000 in government funding for the Hawke's Bay Cultural Trust to provide learning opportunities outside the classroom.

Hawke's Bay Cultural Trust is amongst 21 organisations throughout New Zealand granted funding under the $2.1 million ‘Learning Experience Outside the Classroom’ initiative,' which funds 350,000 students a year to get out and about to learn new things

Labour MP Rick Barker says it is great support is being provided to Hawke's Bay school children to help them gain knowledge and hands-on learning experiences.

“With this funding, teachers get even more scope to link their classroom teaching with real-life experience, and students find learning more interesting, challenging and relevant," said Rick Barker

“Young people learn most when they can see, touch and interact with things to find out more about what they’re made of and how they work. This kind of learning increases students’ awareness of their community and gives them hugely valuable experiences that can’t be recreated in the classroom.”

"This years round focuses on the social sciences and successful organisations include museums, local government, and heritage parks.

“What's more, the initiative encourages young people to appreciate what cultural institutions can offer."

Hawke's Bay Cultural Trust has been involved in the Labour-led government initiative since July.
