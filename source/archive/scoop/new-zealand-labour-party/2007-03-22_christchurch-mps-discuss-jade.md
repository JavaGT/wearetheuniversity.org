Christchurch MPs discuss Jade

Christchurch Labour MPs and Progressive Leader Jim Anderton met with Rugby World Cup Minister Trevor Mallard today to discuss the future government support for redevelopment of Canterbury's Jade Stadium.

"We all agreed that Auckland required special consideration because the commitment to host the Rugby World Cup acted as a catalyst," said Banks Peninsula MP Ruth Dyson.

A number of issues are under consideration by government, including other cities' facilities. The Christchurch group of MPs, consisting of Jim Anderton, Tim Barnett, Lianne Dalziel, Ruth Dyson and Clayton Cosgrove will continue to work with Minister Mallard over the next few months.

"There is another fund that Vbase can apply to, the Lottery Community Facilities fund. We will be backing Vbase's bid for that funding," said Ms Dyson.

Applications for funding open 30 April. More information about the fund can be found at the Department of Internal Affairs website:
