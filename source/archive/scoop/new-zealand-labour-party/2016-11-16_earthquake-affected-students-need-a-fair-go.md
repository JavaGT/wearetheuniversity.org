MEDIA STATEMENT

Earthquake affected students need a fair go

  
The Minister of Education should step in and ensure students affected by Monday’s earthquake are given the option of sitting their NCEA exams again, says Leader of the Opposition Andrew Little.

“Up and down the country we are hearing reports from students who were upset, exhausted and stressed-out as they attempted NCEA exams that should have been postponed.

“Many students got little or no sleep on Sunday night. No matter how well prepared they might have been, they weren’t given a fair shot to show what they were capable of under exceptional circumstances. There were also students who couldn’t sit the exams at all and so missed out on the opportunity to get a higher final grade. They should be given another chance.

“The fact just over 13 and a half thousand students were affected shows how little empathy the Minister of Education has for students.

“It’s unacceptable for the Minister to side-step responsibility and attribute blame to the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. She is the Minister of Education, the buck stops with her.

“Many students rely on exams to achieve their NCEA. The consequences of not being able to do so could greatly affect their future education, training and employment opportunities.

“I call on Hekia Parata to ensure that all Kiwi kids are given a fair go. Re-schedule the exams and let these kids prove their true potential,” says Andrew Little.
