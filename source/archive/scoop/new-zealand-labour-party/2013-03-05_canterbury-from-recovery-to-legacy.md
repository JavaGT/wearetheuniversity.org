**Canterbury: From Recovery To Legacy**

Cantabrians deserve the right to drive the rebuild so that the future city that is one people feel safe in, that they’re proud of and that is a living legacy, says Labour Leader David Shearer.

“You can’t rebuild Canterbury from the top floor of the Beehive. Its future must be led by the people.

“Before I got into politics, I worked for 20 years in disaster recovery around the world and I learned that while emergencies always begin with a top-down command structure, there must be a shift over time to community-driven leadership.

“The National Government sees democracy as a barrier to its plans. It’s taking advantage of a tired, distracted and devastated city to push those plans through.

“My approach as Prime Minister will be very different.

“Under National, CERA has engulfed the functions of councils. Elections have been cancelled and appointees installed. Labour will put Cantabrians back at the centre of their recovery.

We will:  
• Commit to establishing a CERA board so that local independent voices are heard  
• Call for fresh elections for ECan in 2015  
• Establish an independent insurance commissioner to help residents resolve disputes  
• Commit to funding some test insurance cases Cantabrians have been forced to take themselves

“Labour will stand alongside the people of Canterbury. We are increasing our commitment to the region with more regular engagement including public meetings every six weeks and visits from senior MPs to discuss critical issues like jobs, housing, education and transport.

“While I have no doubt the Government is sincere in its pledge to rebuild the region, it should not be driven from the Beehive down. The voice of the people of Canterbury must be heard and respected,” said David Shearer.
