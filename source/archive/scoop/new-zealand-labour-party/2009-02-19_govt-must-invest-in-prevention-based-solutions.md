19 February 2009 Media Statement

Where’s Bennett’s support for community involvement in front-end solutions?

  
If the Government really wants to turn around the high rates of young Maori offending then it must invest in prevention-based solutions, said Labour’s Associate Maori Affairs spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.

“The introduction of 'military style’ camps is not the answer – it has been proven they don’t work. In fact the solutions already exist in some communities, they just need to be supported.

"In Hamilton there is a youth residential unit - Rongoatea - offering drug and alcohol services, and a range of other important providers like Whai Marama, Rostrevor House, Kaute Pasifika and Parentline.

“They have recently lost funding as a result of changes in Waikato District Health Board contracts. If Ms Bennett is serious about 'turning young peoples’ lives around' then she should ask the Minister of Health to investigate why community solutions like these have been shut out of the process," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"There would be many people who would agree that Maori boys relate well to the demands of rehabilitation programmes which include physical challenges. That's why jobs in the Defence Force are keenly sought after.

"But the evidence shows lumping the worst youth offenders together in military style camps often turns out more sophisticated criminals."

"Young people with multiple dysfunctional behaviours, many of whom are on a path to more serious criminal activity, need a range of support measures and so do their families. So supporting community-based services is absolutely necessary," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"I suggest Ms Bennett also discuss a more comprehensive approach with her Education and Community and Voluntary Sector Ministers – one which invests in solutions with the capacity to make a life-changing difference rather than the punitive steps outlined in the so-called Fresh Start bill.

"Keeping Maori kids in the education system longer by making the learning environment more responsive to their needs, introducing trades training earlier and better pathways to employment and training alternatives is what's needed, not a ‘lock them up for longer’ mentality," said Nanaia Mahuta.
