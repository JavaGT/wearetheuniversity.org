CUNLIFFE

Tertiary Education spokesperson

  
11 February 2015 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Further tertiary cuts evidence of ad hoc approach**

The Government has once again made ad hoc and short term cuts in the Tertiary Education sector, says Labour’s tertiary education spokesperson David Cunliffe.

“Cuts of 107 places for theology students and 124 fewer hairdressers in the private education sector are evidence of this government’s doctrinaire policy and ad hocery.

“The constant mismatch in demand and supply in the Tertiary sector is hardly surprising. The strategic function of the Tertiary Education Commission has been gutted. The roles of MBIE and the Ministry of Education are confused.

“The Education Amendment Bill which does away with student representation on tertiary councils will make this make-shift approach to education get worse.

“Tertiary education needs to be an end-to-end system that provides a clear pathway for students careers and constant feedback between the labour market and tertiary providers. Message to Mr Joyce: Education by ad hoc decision making is not working.”
