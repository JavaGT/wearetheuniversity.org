EDUCATION

In its third term in government Labour will provide better access to quality tertiary education and training by:

• Abolishing all interest charges on student loans for all students and New Zealand based graduates from 1 April 2006

• Progressively increasing parental income thresholds so that at least half of all fulltime students will be eligible for a student allowance

• Doubling the number of bonded merit-based scholarships from 500 to 1,000 by the end of 2006, with a view to further increasing that to 1,500 by 2008

• Maintaining a simplified, capped tuition fee structure to provide certainty as to fee levels to students throughout the duration of their studies.

• Providing funding for an additional 5,000 Modern Apprenticeship places, taking the total number of Modern Apprentices to 14,000 in 2008

• Increasing participation in structured industry training to 250,000 by 2009 Labour will also deliver a strong school curriculum which not only leads to young people leaving school literate, numerate, and with a broad general knowledge, but also prepares them for full participation in society.

This includes developing an understanding of:

• The rights and responsibilities of citizenship

• The history of New Zealand

• Information young people need to keep themselves healthy and safe

• Decision-making and communication skills

• Rights and responsibilities as an employee

• Encouraging more democratic processes in schools by creating frameworks to aid the development of school councils and their involvement in decision making within the school.

Also by facilitating links between school councils in regions and with Local councils and other government departments

EMPLOYMENT

The time at which young people enter the workforce is both a time of great potential and a time when young people are vulnerable and may be taken advantage of.

Labour will:

• Expand Youth Transition Services (more policy on Youth Transitions and employment issues to be released tomorrow, 29 August)

• Retain the youth minimum wage, with regular reviews to ensure it maintains its value relative to the adult minimum wage.

YOUTH JUSTICE

The best preventative measures to youth offending are those that involve early intervention.

The way that a young person is dealt with when they first enter the criminal justice system represent a ‘last chance’ for intervention.

Intervention programmes must involve young people in context- at home, at school, and in the community with their peers.

Labour will:

YOUTH DEVELOPMENT

The Youth Development Strategy identifies goals to ensure that young people are supported and encouraged to take up challenges, build their skills and confidence, and reach their full potential.

Labour is committed to giving youth these opportunities.

Labour will:

• Ensure that the Youth Development Strategy guides policy for young people across the whole of government.

• Retain a separate Minister of Youth Affairs responsible for the implementation of the Strategy, and retain the Ministry of Youth Development as a semi-autonomous division of the Ministry of Social Development reporting directly to the Minister of Youth Affairs.

CITIZENSHIP

REPRESENTATION

Labour will:
