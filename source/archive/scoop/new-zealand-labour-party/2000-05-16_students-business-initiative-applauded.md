Otahuhu College Students' Business Initiative Applauded

Manurewa MP Hon. George Hawkins has applauded students of Otahuhu College for their excellent presentations during the Lion Business Experience Expo on Friday.

The Lion Business Experience Expo gave Otahuhu College students the opportunity to consider a viable business enterprise, invent an innovative product, present a financial business plan and a SWOT analysis and marketing plan.

George Hawkins was a judge of eight teams presenting their business ideas. The students certainly picked up the challenges of creativity and innovation that is so important in the business world, he said.

"I was thoroughly impressed with the ideas that these students presented to me. The products that the students invented displayed a sound understanding of technology applied to things consumers need," George Hawkins said.

He said the marketing plans considered who best to target the new products at and how this would best be achieved.

"The presentations were well thought through and well conceived. I want to congratulate Otahuhu College for this excellent Expo.

"I am convinced that many of these students, should they choose a career in business, will achieve much. Some certainly showed a determined freshness that would be the envy of many already established business people," George Hawkins said.
