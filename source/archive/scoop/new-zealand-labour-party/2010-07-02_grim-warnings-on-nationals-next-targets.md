Grim warnings on National’s next targets

**Grim warnings on National’s next targets

Finance Minister Bill English is giving coded warnings that its upcoming targets include interest-free student loans, Working for Families and free school education, says Labour Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.

“National has already inflicted savage cuts on entitlements to early childhood education, but Bill English is not going to stop there,” David Cunliffe said.

“Speaking in Auckland this week, Mr English said that one powerful influence driving personal debt over savings was government welfare.

“And he added: ‘The government gives free childcare, free compulsory education, no interest on tertiary ... and pay per week per child. Everything is free so why should people save?’"

David Cunliffe said this was clearly another indication that the Government has interest-free student loans firmly in its sights, while the Working for Families package is also at risk.

“But more than that, his comments could be interpreted to mean that Kiwis don’t save because of free education.

“Does Bill English really believe that if National charges Kiwis more for so-called free education, that they will reassess the way they spend and the way they save.

“That is absolute and arrogant nonsense,” David Cunliffe said.

“Hard-working Kiwis are already struggling to make ends meet. If they have to pay for more aspects of free education for their kids, they'll have even less money to save.”
