Typical Government response: No response

Clayton COSGROVE

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson  
MP for Waimakariri

  
31 March 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT

**Typical Government response: No response**

Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove says the Government virtuously claims it wants input from Canterbury people, community groups and local MPs on quake issues, but hasn’t responded to even one approach from Labour MPs.

“If it is showing the same disregard for the rest of Canterbury people --- and I suspect it is --- it makes a real mockery of its so-called consultation,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“I’m not saying local MPs are more important than anyone else, but we’ve been on the ground every day since 22 February --- and for much of the time since last September --- listening to the real concerns of real people in real communities, and it is their concerns that we are putting to the Government and the Christchurch City Council as well as our own ideas.

“Some response is deserved at least some of the time. There has been none, especially from the Government.”

Clayton Cosgrove said examples of non-communication include:

• Letter to Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Civil Defence Minister John Carter two weeks ago concerning the process for demolition of buildings in the Red Zone. Response: None.

• Two letters from Labour Leader Phil Goff’s office to Prime Minister John Key concerning the structure of the new earthquake recovery authority and about consultation. Response to both letters: Nothing at all.

• Three weeks ago I requested a briefing from Gerry Brownlee about the timeframe for mapping land in Christchurch. Response: Zilch.

• Two weeks ago I wrote to Mayor Bob Parker and the Christchurch City Council about a rent freeze for council tenants. Response: No response.

“These are just a few striking examples. We have also been raising issues with officials around home heating and emergency housing, and have not received a response so far.

“Yesterday Gerry Brownlee spent thousands of taxpayer dollars on advertisements saying they were holding widespread discussions with Canterbury people. If there are any discussions, it is a one-way street, because there’s no evidence the Government is hearing anything anyone is saying --- or even listening in the first place.”
