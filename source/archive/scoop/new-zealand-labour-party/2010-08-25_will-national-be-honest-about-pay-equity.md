**Will National be honest about pay equity in UN report  
**  
The Government must be upfront about its move to close down the Pay and Employment Equity unit when it reports to the United Nations on the status of women, Labour’s women’s affairs spokesperson Sue Moroney said today.

“The four yearly report to the UN must be an honest account of how New Zealand women are doing. And in that light National must admit it quashed an attempt to ensure pay and employment equity for Kiwi women,” Sue Moroney said.

“The UN report into the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women must show a true representation of the situation for women.

“Pansy Wong must be up front about the fact her Government has made no progress on paid parental leave, closing the gender pay gap or reducing violence against women.

“It should also show increasing costs for early childhood care and education, reduced opportunities for education with the gutting of ACE funding and changes to access to tertiary education opportunities.

“The Minister should also point out she has slashed Government funding for work on closing the gender pay gap from $1.5 million annually, to just $500,000.

  
“If the UN report is considered a report card on how New Zealand women are doing, Pansy Wong will be struggling to get a pass mark.”
