Otago and Southland celebrate neurosurgery victory

  
Dunedin Labour MP’s Pete Hodgson and Clare Curran today congratulated southern communities whose refusal to give up neurosurgeons in the region has resulted in a decision to retain three specialists in Dunedin.

The South Island Neurosurgical Service expert panel has recommended a minimum of three neurosurgeons should be based in Dunedin, and that the South Island-wide service should comprise eight neurosurgeons once fully established.

“The rallying for the retention of Neurosurgery at Dunedin Hospital has gone from strength to strength. Otago and Southland today celebrate a victory, banding together over the past few months to show that the community is a strong united force. This announcement bodes well for the newly merged DHB,” Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson said.

“Health Minister Tony Ryall has put the Otago and Southland communities through months of stress and anguish which could have been avoided. Today’s announcement is a direct result of their protests, petitions and the pressure they placed on the Government.”

“Tony Ryall should have intervened in the issue at the beginning. He should step up to the role or get out of it,” Clare Curran said.
