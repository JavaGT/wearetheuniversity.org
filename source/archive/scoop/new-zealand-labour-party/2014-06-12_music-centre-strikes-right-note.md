Music centre strikes right note

  
The construction of the Music Centre as part of the long-awaited Performing Arts Precinct will be a boon to the Canterbury arts community, Labour’s Arts, Culture and Heritage spokesperson Jacinda Ardern says.

“It is great to see some progress being made on rejuvenating Canterbury’s cultural heart, with the creative sector already having played such a critical role in the recovery, but with very little infrastructure to support it.

“Rebuilding Christchurch isn’t just about rebuilding the bricks and mortar; it’s also about rebuilding a vibrant arts and cultural scene with the creative sector continuing to play an important role in the recovery.

“However, while these new facilities are a vital part of the build, we can’t forget the ‘old city’. That needs its own recovery programme, and the first step in that is to get rid of section 38 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act that allows demolition of damaged heritage buildings without consultation.

“We owe it to Canterbury residents to keep on with the multi-tasking.

“Projects such as the Music Centre of Christchurch are vital to the rebuild, and Labour welcomes it. At the same time we must also keep a strong focus on the critical issues like housing, and ensuring people, whose daily lives were turned upside down by the earthquakes, are receiving the attention they deserve from the Government.”
