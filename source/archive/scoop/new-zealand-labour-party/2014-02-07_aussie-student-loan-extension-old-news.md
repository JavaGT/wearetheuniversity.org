Aussie student loan extension old news
======================================

Labour Leader

  
7 February 2014 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Aussie student loan extension old news**

John Key has got nothing out of his bilateral meeting with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott but a re-announcement of a previous Government’s decision on student loans, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.

“John Key has tried to claim a win out of his meeting with Tony Abbott today in the form of agreement to extend student loans to children of New Zealanders who are long-term Australian residents.

“He is taking the New Zealand public and media for a ride. This decision was reached by the previous Labor Government in Australia and was announced in June. Murray McCully even welcomed it in a [press release](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1306/S00176/australia-extends-student-loans-to-nz-residents.htm) at the time.

“There has been no movement on the crucial areas of social welfare for New Zealanders in Australia, who are still treated as second class citizens.

“John Key has re-heated an old announcement in a desperate attempt to save face,” says David Cunliffe.
