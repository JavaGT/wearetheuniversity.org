Rising unemployment in many regions and among Māori and Pasfika suggest the much-hyped economic recovery may have already passed many New Zealanders by, Labour’s Employment, Skills and Training spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“While it is good news that unemployment overall has fallen, that only benefits those lucky enough to find work.

“Today’s figures pinpoint significant underlying issues in our economy which must be addressed.

“Figures showing 4100 more Māori and 800 more Pasifika are out of work highlights that many are missing out on the so-called ‘rock star’ economy.

“The number of 20 to 24 year olds not in employment, education or training has soared by 3000 in the past three months alone.

“This is the future workforce of New Zealand. It is a huge waste of their talents for these young people not learning or earning. They are facing bleak futures.  
“The Government must do more to give these young people the skills they need to reach their full potential.

“As well as unemployment rising in most regions and among Māori and Pasifika, long-term unemployment has ballooned by 4700.

“CEOs of partially privatised energy companies are enjoying pay rises of hundreds of thousands of dollars while 43 per cent of workers didn’t get a rise in their wage rates in the past year. Many New Zealanders are rightly asking where their share of the economic recovery is,” Grant Robertson says.
