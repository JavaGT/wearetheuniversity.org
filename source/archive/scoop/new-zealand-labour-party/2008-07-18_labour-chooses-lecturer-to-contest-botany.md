Press Release: 17th July 2008

Labour chooses University Lecturer to contest Botany Electorate.

The Labour Party selected university lecturer, Koro Tawa, as its candidate to contest the Botany electorate in a well attended selection meeting on Thursday night.

The tightly contested nomination for the Botany electorate since the resignation of Brenden Sheehan as the Labour candidate because of family commitments gave the lie to the media spin that this election was a given for National said Botany Labour Electorate Chair, Alan Papprill, today.

“The Botany Labour Party had four nominations from a group of highly qualified and dynamic candidates whose backgrounds and heritage reflect the diverse ethnic and social makeup of the electorate.” Alan Papprill said. “The candidates demonstrated the vitality and all embracing nature of the New Zealand Labour Party compared to the limited social appeal of the opposition.”

President of the Labour Party, Mike Williams, told the large meeting of local Labour Party members that Mr. Tawa as dynamic and extremely capable candidate who would represent the interests of the electorate well.

Koro Tawa, in accepting the nomination, told the meeting that he would begin campaigning immediately as he was keen to take the initiative in the Botany electorate.

After the meeting Koro Tawa was warmly congratulated by Labour List candidate, Mr. Raymond Huo and by fellow nominee, Neelam Choudary.
