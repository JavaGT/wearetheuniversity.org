**Slide in university rankings reflects Government thinking on education**

Global rankings that show New Zealand universities are slipping behind their international counterparts is a black mark against the National Government, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Megan Woods.

“This Government has been so focused on cutting costs in the education sector that it has been unable to recognise the harm this is causing to our universities. The latest QS World University rankings merely reinforce that.

“The accompanying research show there is an affordability crisis for students everywhere and there is a risk many students will be priced out of a world-class education.

“National’s repeated cuts to student support are already having an impact here and increasing numbers of people are being denied access to study.

“It’s been hinted that Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce is about to make further major reform to our universities by centralising control of university governance.

“This makes no sense. It will take our universities further away from their role as critic and conscious of society and closer to corporate, profit-making entities.

“New Zealand once dominated research and teaching fields. While Mr Joyce refuses to recognise education as an investment rather than a cost to be cut, that reputation is on the line.”
