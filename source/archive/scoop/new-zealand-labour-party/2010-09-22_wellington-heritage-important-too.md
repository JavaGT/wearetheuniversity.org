**Wellington heritage important too**

As Cantabrians cry out for help to save heritage buildings, the Wellington District Council is preparing to bulldoze ones in this region, Labour Arts, Culture and Heritage spokesperson Steve Chadwick says.

“I find it simply unacceptable that the demolition of three buildings in Willis Street all over 100 years old is taking place without any public notification,” Steve Chadwick said.

“Why is it that even in the midst of the devastation caused by an earthquake work is being done to save buildings in Canterbury, but in Wellington bulldozers are ready to knock down historic buildings without any consultation?

“I believe the time is right for a nationally consistent approach to heritage. The public should automatically have the right to be included in decisions to demolish historic buildings.

“It is ironic that Wellington wants to be considered the artistic capital of New Zealand, but there is no thought given to protecting architecture in the city,” Steve Chadwick said
