**Labour welcomes Mandarin flight information at Auckland Airport**

Labour’s first Chinese MP Raymond Huo has today congratulated Auckland International Airport on becoming the first airport in New Zealand to provide travellers with Flight Information Display boards (FIDs) in Mandarin for all Chinese flights.

“This is a great initiative which shows the world that New Zealand is a welcoming destination that is well prepared for our important visitor markets” Labour’s Associate spokesperson for Ethnic Affairs Raymond Huo says.

“Initiatives such as this are positive ways to boost tourism from China and make for a more seamless travel experience for many of our visitors”.

Exports, tourism and international students from China are recognised as vital to our economy and increasing visibility of Chinese language will better equip us to maximise our relations with China in the years ahead.

Trade between the China and New Zealand has trebled since the 2008 signing of the Free Trade Agreement and in the first quarter of this year, China overtook Australia as our top export destination for the first time.

“The integration of multi-lingual information for international passengers aligns with the foci of the Asia New Zealand Foundation and acknowledges the vital market that visitors from China as well as the wider Asia region have for New Zealand and Auckland particularly” says Raymond Huo.
