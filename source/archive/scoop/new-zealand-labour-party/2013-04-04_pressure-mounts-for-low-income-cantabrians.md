Pressure mounts for low-income Cantabrians
==========================================

Phil  
TWYFORD  
Housing Spokesperson

4 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT

**Pressure mounts for low-income Cantabrians**

Today’s [report](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/UserFiles/File/Publications/Sector/pdf/christchurch-housing-report.pdf) into housing pressures in Christchurch, unsurprisingly reveals low-income Cantabrians are bearing the brunt of the city’s housing crisis says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.

“Since the earthquakes people across Canterbury have been under a lot of pressure.

“Today’s report shows rising housing insecurity in the city, with thousands of Cantabrians living in inadequate or overcrowded homes. Steeply rising rents coupled with a shortage of rental properties, especially in the ‘affordable’ bracket, mean low-income families are being particularly hard hit.

“The report says there has been a 60% decrease in “affordable” rentals --- that is; properties rented for under $300 per week---since the earthquakes.

“That’s a substantial drop and one that will be keenly felt by struggling Cantabrians,” Phil Twyford said.

“Many families are down to a single income as a result of the earthquakes and these pressures add unnecessary strain to an already stressful situation.

“The report states that the decrease in available rentals was driven by the loss of two and three bedroom homes– a point that underlines the pressure on families.

“Competition for housing is also on the rise with former red zone residents pushing up demand.

“On every measure Christchurch has been under great housing stress. It is clear the Government's response to the situation has been woefully inadequate.

“Today’s report should be a wakeup call for the Government. Instead of dancing on the head of a pin denying there is a housing crisis, the Government needs to pull its finger out and take decisive action to deal with Christchurch’s housing problems,” Phil Twyford said.
