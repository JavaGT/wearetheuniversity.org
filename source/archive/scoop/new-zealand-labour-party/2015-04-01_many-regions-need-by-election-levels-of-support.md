Many regions need by-election levels of support

Many regions need by-election levels of support  

Northland is not the only region struggling under the National Government, but unfortunately places like Gisborne, Whanganui and Tasman do not have by-elections on the horizon, Labour’s Economic Development spokesperson David Clark says.

“A desperate National Party has thrown money at the Northland region and promises more to come. It’s good that John Key is finally looking north of Helensville after decades of neglect but many other regions must be wishing they had a by-election coming up too.

“For example, while unemployment has increased in Northland in the past six years, it has also increased in every other region.

“The median household income has increased marginally in Northland, but decreased in Auckland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Wanganui, Tasman, Nelson, Marlborough and the West Coast.

“And as we all know, NZTA transport funding has been cut in Northland over the past six years but it has also been cut in Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, Taranaki, Manawatu, Wanganui, Tasman, Nelson, Marlborough and the West Coast.

“Sadly Northland is not the only region that has been neglected in this country. In fact other regions are doing worse in key statistics.

“If National’s regional MPs really want to make a difference to their communities, it seems the best thing they can do is resign,” David Clark said.
