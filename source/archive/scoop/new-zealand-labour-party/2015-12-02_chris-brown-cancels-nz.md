Chris Brown cancels NZ

  
Labour welcomes the news that Chris Brown has cancelled his New Zealand tour, says Labour’s Hauraki –Waikato member Nanaia Mahuta.

“Commonsense has prevailed. His domestic violence history is not something we celebrate in New Zealand especially when there are so many more young relevant international musicians to enjoy.

“This is the right decision and cynical attempts to promote Brown as a spokesperson against domestic violence despite his recent history of violence towards women were offensive and disingenuous.

“Hopefully, this outcome will dissuade promoters from using these lobbying tactics again,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
