Tongan King Leaves A Lasting Legacy

Mangere’s Labour MP Su’a William Sio and Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson has today expressed his sincere sadness to Tongans in New Zealand at the sudden passing of King George Tupou V in Hong Kong.

“I extend my sincere sympathies and condolences to the Heir Presumptive to the Tongan throne, the members of the royal family, and the people of Tonga who will be deeply affected by the loss of their King,” Su’a William Sio said.

“I was able to witness first-hand the abundant respect Tongans in both Tonga and New Zealand held for him when I attended the King’s coronation in August 2008 with the then Prime Minister Helen Clark & Governor General Sir Anand & Lady Susan Satyanand.

Thousands of Tongans from New Zealand attended King George Tupou V’s coronation in 2008 including Head of State’s from all over the world, and church leaders from across the South Pacific region.

“In the occasions that I have met the King I always came away knowing that the good fortune and wellbeing of the Tongan people was a matter the King agonised over.

“The King has left a lasting legacy for Tongans all over the world to be proud of when he voluntarily relinquished most of the near-absolute powers that his family has held for centuries in order to embrace the democratic aspirations of his people and allowing for the first democratic elections in November 2010.

“It is my prayer that the dark clouds that hover over the people of Tonga at this time will quickly dissipate and the skies will once again embrace a shining new dawn for Tonga,” Su’a William Sio said.
