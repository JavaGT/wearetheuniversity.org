Cloud hangs over Adult Learners’ Week

  
Prime Minister John Key should bite the bullet, admit the Government was wrong and remove the cloud hanging over Adult Learners’ Week by reversing the ACE funding cuts, says Labour Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.

“Adult Learners’ Week starts today with the aptly titled theme ‘Learn for Today and Tomorrow E ako mō tēnei rā me āpōpō.’ It was designed to emphasise the fact that learning has an immediate impact on the lives of adults and their communities, but is also an investment in the future.

“The theme was chosen before the Budget decision to slash 80 per cent of funding to schools-based adult and community education and it couldn’t be a more appropriate reminder of how short-sighted that decision was,” Maryan Street said.

“Events will be held around the country this week to celebrate adult learning success stories, but the celebrations will be marred by the knowledge that many future potential success stories have had the rug pulled out from under them.

“An OECD report due to be released tomorrow on the economic and social benefits of investing in education is expected to underscore further the foolishness of the decision.

“Labour leader Phil Goff and MP Carol Beaumont will attend a meeting at Mt Roskill Intermediate tonight on the ACE cuts and yet another march is planned in Auckland this weekend,” Maryan Street said.

“It appears neither John Key not Education Minister Anne Tolley will attend tonight’s meeting – another no-show from National MPs.

“Thousands of New Zealanders have now attended meetings around the country on the ACE cuts and National MPs have been noticeably absent.

“It’s clear they know they made a stupid decision and they don’t want to defend it. It’s time for John Key to admit that and to stand up and reverse the Budget cuts. There would be no better time to do it than this week,” Maryan Street said.
