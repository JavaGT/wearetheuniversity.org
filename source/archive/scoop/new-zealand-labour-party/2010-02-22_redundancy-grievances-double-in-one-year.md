**Redundancy grievances double in one year**

Labour Minister Kate Wilkinson needs to front up and look into why the number of personal grievances due to redundancy complaints has doubled in the last year, Labour’s Associate labour spokesperson Darien Fenton said today.

“Kate Wilkinson has been dodging this issue for some time now, but she must include it in the review she has announced,” Darien Fenton said.

“Between January and November last year, more than 900 personal grievances due to redundancy were taken either to mediation or the Employment Relations Authority, twice as many as the previous year.

“In March 2009, the there were 75 cases and in November 2009 the number reached a high of 76. This is an indication that the lack of redundancy rights in law is causing both workers and employers difficulty.

“We agree with the Prime Minister when he said his Government shares concerns from many quarters about the fairness and consistency of personal grievance decisions, but only because there is unfairness and inconsistency in redundancy protection for New Zealand workers.

“For example, if a worker is a union member covered by a collective agreement, there is a 90% likelihood they will have redundancy protection and entitlements should they lose their jobs due to redundancy.

“However, the majority of other workers have no rights when it comes to being laid off, and this is why we are seeing many more resorting to personal grievance processes to look for redress.

“Instead of thinking about how she can reduce workers’ rights, the Minister needs address the unfair situation of thousands of workers being been laid off through no fault of their own, and who have been left with nothing to tide them over during the hard times.”
