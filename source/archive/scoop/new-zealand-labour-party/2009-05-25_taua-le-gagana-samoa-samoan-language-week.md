25 May 2009 Media Statement  
"Taua le Gagana Samoa" - Samoan Language Week

Labour's spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs, Luamanuvao Winnie Laban, spoke today at St Patricks College in Wellington as part of the nationwide events programme celebrating Samoan Language Week.

Luamanuvao Winne Laban said that 60% of the Pacific Island population in New Zealand are born here, and they are young.

"It is important that our children grow up fluent in English and Samoan as well as other languages. This is true not only for Samoan, but Palagi and other children as it is crucial that they gain the educational and cultural benefits of multilingualism.

“Being fluent in the Samoan language is key to having a connection to Samoan history, values and identity, and is one of the best paths available to enriching the worldview and cultural understanding of our young people.

"Before the last election, at the request of the Samoan and other Pacific communities, Labour developed a whole of government Pacific Languages Strategy to be implemented by the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs.

“This kind of coordination and resourcing at a government level is needed, and I look forward to ongoing support for this initiative from the current Government.

Luamanuvao Winnie Laban wanted to acknowledge the Samoan community and church leaders, and more importantly the young people, who have been instrumental in organising and participating in events for this week.

“I also want to acknowledge the work of some City Councils, and the office of the Race Relations Commissioner,” Luamanuvao Winnie Laban said
