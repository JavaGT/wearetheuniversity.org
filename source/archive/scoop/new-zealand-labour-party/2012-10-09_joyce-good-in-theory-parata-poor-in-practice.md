**Joyce good in theory, Parata poor in practice**

The Government needs to get serious about helping more young people into further education, training and employment if the country is to harness the full potential of all our young people says Labour’s Education Spokesperson, Nanaia Mahuta.

"Far too many young people are being consigned to the scrap heap while this Government sits on its hands. There are currently about 84,000 Kiwis aged 15- 24 who are not in education, employment or training, and have nowhere to go.

“While the information produced in Steven Joyce’s Occupational Outlook may well be useful to students and their families, it will only truly be of value if the school system is up to the task of equipping our kids for the 21st century.

“We must do more to engage our young people onto better education or employment pathways. Vocational pathways for young people require a real investment in education, skills training and simply doing things differently in school.

"It’s a real disappointment that Steven Joyce and Hekia Parata are singing from a song sheet that does not support all young people. National Standards will create winners and losers in the school system, and that risks seeing more children disengage from the type of learning that will be tailored to their individual needs, and improve their learning and career prospects.

"If this happens, children will not be in a position to choose the subjects that are required for a future skills labour market no matter who much information is available to them about skills shortages.

"National’s education and skills policies are not coherent and fail to address the real challenge of improving educational success for every child in every community.

"While Joyce is good on theory, Parata is poor in practice and now is the time for action not rhetoric,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
