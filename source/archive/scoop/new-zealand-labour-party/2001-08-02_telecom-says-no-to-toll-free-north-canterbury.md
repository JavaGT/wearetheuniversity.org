Telecom Says “No” To Toll Free North Canterbury
===============================================

Waimakariri Member of Parliament Clayton Cosgrove was told “No” by Telecom’s Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Stratful during yesterday’s meeting to discuss the issue of toll free calling to Christchurch from Rangiora and between Rangiora and Kaiapoi.

This is the latest in a series of meetings between Mr Cosgrove and various officials from Telecom over the last 18 months to attempt to give the people of North Canterbury a fair deal with regard to the toll boundaries.

“I am very disappointed that Telecom has reiterated their unwillingness to give residents in Rangiora and Kaiapoi a fair go,” Mr Cosgrove said.

“I will not give up on this issue, because to me it is grossly unjust to my constituents. Telstra Saturn’s Chief Executive, Jack Matthews, has given me an assurance that he will consider expanding Telstra Saturn’s network into North Canterbury, and that if this did happen, his company would promote toll free calling into Christchurch from Rangiora and between Rangiora and Kaiapoi.”.

“I realise this is not something that can be solved overnight, however at least Telstra Saturn is carefully considering it,” Mr Cosgrove said.

“It’s a shame that Telecom refuses even to work out possible ways of adjusting the toll boundary. I will continue to work with Telstra Saturn and other Telecommunications companies in the hope that at some point this gross injustice will be resolved,” Mr Cosgrove said.
