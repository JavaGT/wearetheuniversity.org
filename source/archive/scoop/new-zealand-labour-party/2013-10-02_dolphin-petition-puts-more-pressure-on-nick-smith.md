2 October 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Dolphin petition puts more pressure on Nick Smith**  
International pressure is growing to get Nick Smith to do more to save the Maui’s dolphin from extinction, with thousands of people signing an online petition aimed directly at the Conservation Minister, Labour’s Conservation Spokesperson Ruth Dyson said today.

“The online petition has over 10,000 signatures, with around 2000 signatures added just yesterday.

“Nick Smith is feeling the heat on a number of issues, now he faces pressure from thousands of people overseas.

“There is much discussion in the international community about a further response should this petition not succeed. High in the talking points is the proposal for a complete boycott of the purchase of New Zealand fish. We cannot afford for that to happen.

“The world’s leading scientists from three well respected international organisations have joined together to call for a complete ban on fishing with gill nets and trawling, giving proper protection for the critically endangered dolphin. They are from the International Whaling Commission, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Society for Marine Mammalogy.

“Nick Smith needs to take strong action now. He could support the future existence of the Maui’s dolphins with a complete ban on gill nets and trawling, as well as support the fishing industry with a financial transition package to move to sustainable fishing practices,” says Ruth Dyson.
