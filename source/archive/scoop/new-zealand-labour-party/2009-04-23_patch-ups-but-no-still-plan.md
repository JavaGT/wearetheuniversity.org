Patch-ups but no still plan
===========================

Hon Phil Goff  
Leader of the Labour Party

23 April 2009 Media Statement

Patch-ups but no still plan

  
The Government’s latest patch-up of its nine-day working fortnight will do nothing to reassure the thousands of Kiwis worried about losing their jobs, Labour Leader Phil Goff says.

“Sixty percent of the workforce and more than 90 percent of businesses are still ineligible for the scheme,” Phil Goff said.

“The National Government’s lack of a plan for the economy means they are continuing to offer patch-ups and poorly thought-out offerings instead of providing real stimulus to the economy.

“New Zealanders need to see a Government in charge of the economy and providing leadership instead of one that sacks public servants without a second thought, says it’s too hard to help small businesses, but asks private businesses to keep workers on and ride out the recession.

“If the Government was truly committed to keeping New Zealanders in work it would extend the nine-day working fortnight to its own departments instead of sacking them.

“John Key’s explanation that small businesses are not included in the nine-day fortnight initiative because it would be too difficult to manage is a cop-out.

“Small businesses employ hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders and for the Government to wipe its hands of them because they think it’s too hard is ridiculous.

“The Government used the same excuse to justify not including a training component.

“New Zealand workers need to know their Government is committed to keeping Kiwis in work and to building a stronger economy.

“Complaining that it’s too hard to help small businesses or help people into training shows that this is not a Government ready to pull out all the stops to help ordinary Kiwis,” Phil Goff said.
