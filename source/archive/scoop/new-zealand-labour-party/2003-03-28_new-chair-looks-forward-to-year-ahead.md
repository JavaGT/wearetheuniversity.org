New Chair Looks Forward to Year Ahead

Princes Street Branch (Auckland University) of the Labour Party

  
Tristan Rossiter-Sheehy welcomed the opportunity to work with a dynamic group of young people intent on making a difference in New Zealand. His comments came as he was elected to chair the Auckland University Branch (Princes St.) of the New Zealand Labour Party at its AGM.

He commented that, "While Maori and Industry are the heart of Labour I firmly believe that our branch and ones likes it are the conscience of the party".

Asked about what challenges lay ahead, he saw "both international and local events drawing the branch's focus".

"The War in Iraq is certainly something we a very concerned about. Labour's position is firmly against the current conflict and we fully support that stance. On the local front the referendum on compulsory membership of the Student Union is certainly something we are keen to take part in," he said.

Other executive positions of the branch were also elected this evening.

"We have a wide range of people on our exec who are committed and I know we will achieve a lot this year," Tristan said.

The other people elected were:

Vice-Chair Craig Omundsen

Secretary/Treasurer Anna Barge

Membership Coordinator Bennett Kuan

Women's Rep Alana Chang

Social Activities Officer Emma Consedine
