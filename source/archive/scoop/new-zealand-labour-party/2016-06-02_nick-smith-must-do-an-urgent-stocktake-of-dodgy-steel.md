MEDIA STATEMENT

Nick Smith must do an urgent stocktake of dodgy steel

The Building and Housing Minister must do an urgent stocktake of major construction projects that may have used dodgy imported steel to ensure public safety, Labour’s Building and Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford says.

“The revelation that the Transport Agency has a no questions policy when it comes to the quality of imported steel being used in major transport infrastructure projects beggars belief.

“Comments by NZTA’s Waikato highway manager Kaye Clarke today that the Agency isn’t asking where the steel is from because it’s ‘not really what (they’re) interested in’ are simply astounding.

“If we don’t know where our building products are coming from, we can’t assess the size of the problem or ensure these structures aren’t dangerous.

“This follows concerns about substandard steel mesh being used in buildings for the  
Christchurch rebuild and a raft of second-rate building supplies being used in the construction of houses in Auckland.

“This highlights the inadequacy of our regulatory systems. The Minister needs to take responsibility for this.

“Nick Smith must work out how big this problem is and reassure the public that their homes, buildings and bridges are safe,” Phil Twyford says.
