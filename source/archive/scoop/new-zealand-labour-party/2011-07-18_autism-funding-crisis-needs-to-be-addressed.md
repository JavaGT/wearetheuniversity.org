**Autism funding crisis needs to be addressed**

A crisis in funding for people with autism and their families again raises serious questions about the priorities of the National-led government, according to Labour’s Spokesperson for Health, Grant Robertson, and the party’s Disability Issues spokesperson, Carmel Sepuloni.

The pair say news that Autism New Zealand has been forced to close its services in the Waikato, and potentially the Bay of Plenty, and cut back in other areas, should be a wake-up call to the government.

“These are essential frontline services for families who face a daily struggle. Referrals are increasing, not decreasing. It is simply wrong for the government to pull funding and leave these people to cope with no support," Grant Robertson said.

"Organisations such as Autism New Zealand do a great job in supporting families and autistic children to cope and achieve their potential. While they know that the overall economic situation is tight, it is simply impossible for them to continue to absorb the funding cuts of the last couple of years," said Carmel Sepuloni.

"Government support for education programmes and respite care is an investment in the future well-being of people with autism and their families and carers. Surely it should have a higher priority than giving tax cuts to the top earners, or money to Warner Brothers for publicity?

“The cases of Janine Albury-Thomson, and more recently that of Arie Smith-Voorkamp in Christchurch, highlight the need for greater awareness of how we help the 40,000 New Zealanders living with autism. As a country we can never let ignorance of autism cause similar situations to occur again,” Grant Robertson said.

"Reviewing the definition of disability that dictates the eligibility for government support – which currently excludes people with autism -would go part way to resolving the situation,” Grant Robertson said.
