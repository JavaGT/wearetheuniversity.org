Prime Minister Visiting Waimakariri Electorate
==============================================

**Monday, 16 July 2001, 4:54 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

Clayton Cosgrove Member of Parliament for Waimakariri is today (17 July) hosting the Prime Minister Rt Hon Helen Clark to the Waimakariri Electorate.

"The Prime Minister and I will be visiting Bishopdale Primary School where the children are going to showcase their activities which will include some of their art work", Mr Cosgrove said.

The day also includes a visit to the Lignus Timber Exchange. This is a recently established company which has developed the first operational negotiation-based electronic exchange for forest products outside North America and is targeting the $600 billion USD world market.

Lignus is fine example of a smart Canterbury enterprise which links a traditional industry -timber production- with the latest e-commerce technology to trade globally. As the recently appointed Member of Parliament assisting the Minister for Information Technology on the E-commerce Task Force, Mr Cosgrove is keen to showcase innovative Canterbury businesses.

"I am looking forward to hosting the Prime Minister and showing her some of the best that is in the Waimakariri Electorate - a superb and growing school providing high quality education and a world class business using 'home grown' technology to compete in the international marketplace, "Mr Cosgrove said.
