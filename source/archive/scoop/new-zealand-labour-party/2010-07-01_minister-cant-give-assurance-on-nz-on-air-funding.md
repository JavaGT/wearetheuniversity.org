Minister can’t give assurance on NZ on Air funding
==================================================

**Minister can’t give assurance on NZ on Air funding  
**  
Repeated signals that NZ on Air will face major funding cuts must worry independent producers, musicians and free-to-air television, says Labour’s broadcasting spokesperson Brendon Burns.

“Broadcasting Minister Jonathan Coleman, who today appeared before the Government Administration select committee, appears resigned to his Cabinet colleagues taking the axe to NZ on Air funding from here on.

“Although NZ on Air came through this year’s Budget largely intact, the Minister was completely unable to give any assurance that the current funding of $127m a year will continue,” Brendon Burns said.

“Further evidence that the Minister is losing the fight came at the select committee today with discussion on the Ministry of Culture and Heritage’s answers to estimate questions. It said of NZ on Air: ‘The main financial risk is the future re-priorisation of Crown revenue within the Vote which will need to be carefully managed if it occurs’.”

Brendon Burns said NZ on Air’s just released Statement of Intent 2010-13 is also peppered with references to cuts to funding for New Zealand music, television and radio programmes ([www.nzonair.govtr.nz/publications](http://www.nzonair.govtr.nz/publications)).

“While NZ on Air’s Statement of Intent proclaims ‘strong support’ from its Minister, it knows he carries no weight in Cabinet. It goes on to butter up John Key, saying spending on screen production is an investment in the sort of innovative tertiary industry that the Prime Minister was promoting in his 2010 Statement to Parliament,” Brendon Burns said.

“NZ on Air knows its $127m budget --- 97.5 percent spent on programmes and music content --- is being lined up for some savage cuts.

“New Zealand production, music and broadcasting sectors are central to our own sense of identity and culture. They are already doing it tough because of the recession and the Government’s refusal to review broadcasting competition issues --- again confirmed today by Dr Coleman.”

Brendon Burns says the Prime Minister is quick to line up with creative New Zealanders for a good photo opportunity but they now deserve a reassurance that they will continue getting the modest support provided by NZ on Air.
