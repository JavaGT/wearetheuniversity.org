Govt inaction = unemployment in Otago & Southland

Media Statement

Government inaction means higher unemployment in Otago and Southland

  
For the second time in one week the National/Maori Party Government has turned its back on the South Island, Dunedin based Labour MP David Parker said today.

“The Government’s much heralded infrastructure spending plan has not one single significant infrastructure project south of Christchurch.”

Last week the National and Maori Parties snubbed the South Island by failing to have even one Government MP attend the South Island Treaty of Waitangi ceremony at Bluff.

“They have now added injury to insult. Dunedin, Ashburton, Tïmaru, Oamaru, Queenstown, Invercargill, and everything in-between get zip.

“They seem to have forgotten that we pay our taxes down here and deserve our fair share. What could they have done? That’s easy. Advancing the Caversham motorway project and the SH1 realignment near the Leith Valley turn off would have been a start.

“They should also have responded to the Mayor’s request for a substantial contribution to the new stadium. That is the biggest infrastructure project planned for the lower south Island and would have leveraged off spending by the council and others.

“And let’s not forget they have yet to reinstate the $1 billion energy efficiency fund that would have helped insulate many of Dunedin’s old houses, keeping people warm while lowering their power bills.

“There can be absolutely no doubt that by ignoring Otago and Southland, our region’s unemployment will increase by more than it would have had we received our fair share,” David Parker said.
