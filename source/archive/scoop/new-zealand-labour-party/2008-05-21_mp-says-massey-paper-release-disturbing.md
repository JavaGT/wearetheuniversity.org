Labour MP

20 May 2008 Media Statement

‘MP Says Massey Paper Release Disturbing’

Labour MP Su’a William Sio says the way a study paper by Massey University economist Creg Clydesdale was released to the media is quite disturbing.

“It feels there is a deliberate effort to undermine the significant contribution of Pacific communities to New Zealand society, and a strong suggestion that it is time to bash Pacific people.”

“I haven’t seen the actual report other than media reports on it, but it would seem to me that no one is recognising the significant contribution made by Pacific people in the areas of sports, music, the arts and creative industries. And the best and more is yet to come.”

“Furthermore, no one appears to recognise that Pacific people are working in hospitals, hospitality and in the homecare industries doing work as cleaners, orderlies and caring for the elderly, often at very low wages, doing jobs that New Zealanders don’t want to do.’

“There is also a significant Pacific workforce who work the fruit and viticulture industries, again jobs that most kiwis just wont do.”

“All of these Pacific workers are tax paying responsible citizens performing their civic duties.”

“Yes there are pockets in the Pacific demographic which are facing the same challenges as other New Zealanders are facing with low incomes, home ownership, educational opportunities, and skills development, but the trends for Pacific people is that it is improving.”

“I’m amazed at how people are quick to point the finger at Pacific migrants and forget it was Pacific migrants that provided the labour force for the New Zealand manufacturing industry in the 1960s & 1970s.”
