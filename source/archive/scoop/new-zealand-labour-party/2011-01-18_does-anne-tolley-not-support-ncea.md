**Does Anne Tolley not support NCEA?**

Anne Tolley's silence on the NCEA versus Cambridge Exam debate speaks volumes about her lack of belief in the education system she leads, says Labour Associate Education Spokesperson Kelvin Davis.

“Anne Tolley's unwillingness to defend the NCEA system against the might of Auckland Grammar School shows she has no faith in the system at all,” Kelvin Davis said.

“The question has to be asked why then should students, parents, teachers, principals or Board of Trustees members have faith in the NZ education system?

“Even more disturbing is that the Minister has deliberately linked the much maligned National Standards to NCEA saying in an information letter to parents and available on the Ministry of Education website, ‘The standards have been designed so that a student who meets them is on track to succeed at NCEA Level 2’.

“Why has the Minister gone to the trouble of having National Standards that are inextricably linked to success in NCEA when she doesn't even expect students to have to sit NCEA?

“Does this mean we will now see a separate set of National Standards linked to success in Cambridge exams, and if not, why not? It is further evidence that Anne Tolley's National Standards are a political gimmick.

“The Minister's inability to defend the education system she leads simply undermines both her personal credibility and that of the system itself,” Kelvin Davis said.
