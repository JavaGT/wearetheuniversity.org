John Key’s stance on donations reeks of hypocrisy

John Key can’t claim that people donating to the campaigns of Labour leadership contenders somehow have a secret agenda but duck for cover when it comes to revealing those donating thousands of dollars to the National Party, Labour MP Chris Hipkins says.

“It’s utter hypocrisy for John Key to try to establish a new level of transparency for donations to Labour and then resort to technicalities when questioned about donations he has assisted the National Party in soliciting.

“He is being tricky. The same standards must apply to National.

“For decades the National Party has raked in millions of dollars in anonymous donations using trusts to hide the true identity of donors. It’s a bit rich for them to start throwing around accusations about secret agendas now.

“The public will see John Key’s attack on Labour for what it is – a cheap shot.

“Everyone can see through John Key’s blatant smear campaign. If he isn’t willing to live up to his own standards, he should stop hurling mud at others,” Chris Hipkins says.
