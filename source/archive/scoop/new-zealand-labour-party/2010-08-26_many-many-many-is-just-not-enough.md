Many many many’ is just not enough

**Many many many’ is just not enough**

According to the Minister for Social Development and Employment and Youth Affairs the Governments youth initiatives’ are helping “so many…. many many many” youth into jobs. Yet these initiatives who help “many, many, many” youth don’t seem to be reaching the over 40,000 young New Zealanders who are currently not in work, education, or on an unemployment benefit" Labour’s Youth Affairs Spokesperson Jacinda Ardern said today.

“The Minister doesn’t seem to have a grasp on how appalling our youth unemployment is.

“Young New Zealanders are hitting dead ends everywhere they turn. Jobs are scarce – and if they are lucky enough to pick up employment, they have to get through the first 90 days. Tertiary Education enrolments are limited; adult and community education courses are near to extinct.

“Paula Bennett pointed to the 2,000 places in the Governments Youth Guarantee scheme – but what about the 38,000 left who have so far avoided moving onto a benefit but have very few options left.

“Young New Zealanders are our future workforce – but if they can’t get jobs, learn skills or further their education now – how are they going to grow to be a productive workforce in the future?

“Ms Bennett may think she is helping ‘so many…… many many many’ youth, but her help is failing to reach the majority of youth that need it. Ms Bennett needs to realise she is only helping the very very few,” Jacinda Ardern said.
