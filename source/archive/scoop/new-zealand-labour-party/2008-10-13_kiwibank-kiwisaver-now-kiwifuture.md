KiwiBank, KiwiSaver now KiwiFuture

KiwiBank, KiwiSaver now KiwiFuture

“The Labour Party Campaign Launch offered New Zealanders a panoramic view of our progressive plan for New Zealand’s future,” says Te Tai Tokerau Candidate Kelvin Davis.

“Helen Clarke’s progressive and bold policy announcements blaze a trail into our KiwiFuture, In comparison opposition Leader John Key ‘plan’ is a stumble along the path of failed policies of the past.”

It was the first Labour Government in the 1930’s that showed New Zealanders how to govern a way out of an economic crisis. Helen Clarke showed the progressive spirit of the Michael Savage is burning brightly.

National’s plan in times like we are experiencing now has always been to cut spending. They did this in the nineties by cutting superannuation, abolishing the apprenticeship system, introducing student loans and cutting tax for the wealthiest New Zealanders.

The anticipated ‘trickle-down’ effect didn’t happen and the failed plan deepened the recession.

“This Labour Government is going to embrace six priorities for building a strong, upmarket economy, driven by skills and innovation, underpinned by our savings and modern infrastructure, focused on growing our export trade, and committed to sustainability.”

“In order for us to compete globally we need skilled people, we need access to international markets, we need innovation to develop high quality low carbon footprint products to sell to discerning overseas markets.

Over the last nine years the Labour Government has implemented a systematic plan that involved sorting out the mess of the nineties then creating a solid foundation for the future.

“I’m not sure that the country recognises the interconnectedness of the Labour Government’s policies. They are part of a master plan designed to carry us in to the KiwiFuture.

National’s response is to bombard us with a dislocated series of random announcements packaged around a smiling manikin.”
