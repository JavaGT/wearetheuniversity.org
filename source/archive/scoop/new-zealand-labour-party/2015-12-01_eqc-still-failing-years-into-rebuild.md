EQC still failing years into rebuild**

An Auditor General’s report that says EQC has made little progress improving the way it deals with complainants after all these years is an indictment on the Government, says Labour’s acting Canterbury spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“It’s been five years since the earthquakes and over two years since the Auditor General identified major shortcomings in how EQC dealt with people making complaints. Today’s report shows that there has been very little improvement in that time.

“So what exactly have EQC and Gerry Brownlee been doing in the last two years?

“The Minister has repeatedly dismissed calls for an enquiry into the mess at EQC, saying the existing complaints system was working fine. Now we’ve had another report showing the complaint system is still letting people down.

“After dodgy repairs, shonkey scoping and years of public dissatisfaction, it’s time for Gerry Brownlee to launch a full enquiry into EQC. They’ve had years to sort themselves out and they’ve failed,” says Ruth Dyson.
