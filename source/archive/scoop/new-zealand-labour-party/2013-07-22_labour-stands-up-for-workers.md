**Labour stands up for workers**

Today’s new campaign from the Council of Trade Unions is just the beginning of the opposition to National’s changes to employment law, says Darien Fenton, Labour spokesperson for labour Issues.

“The Employment Relations Amendment Bill before Parliament contains the most significant changes in wage and standards processes seen in more than two decades. Its provisions are, in some ways, worse than laws that drastically cut wages and worker rights in the 1990s.

“The changes the Government proposes are not the way to do business in New Zealand. They will have a knock-on effect for all workers, cement in low wages and make it more difficult for Kiwis to support their families.

“There will be thousands of submissions from workers up and down the country who know that the Government isn’t doing right by them.

“We will be taking the message out to workers and their families that Labour is standing up for them and we will do everything we can to defeat this backwards-looking law.

“Labour is committed to secure, quality work where workers are paid a living wage, backed up by laws that protect the rights of hard working Kiwis to build a better life,” says Darien Fenton.
