Nats primary health: worse, later, less convenient

Media Statement

National has plans for primary health – worse, later, less convenient

  
Health Minister Tony Ryall’s announcement that he will focus on primary health in 2010/2011 after his disastrous ten months focusing on hospital-based services, can only mean more bad news in the health sector, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“Last week Tony Ryall was today forced to admit in Parliament that elective surgery waiting times had increased under his watch. [http://www.electiveservices.govt.nz/espi/June%202009%20ESPI5.pdf](http://www.electiveservices.govt.nz/espi/June 2009
ESPI5.pdf)

“I tabled figures which showed that in November 2008 3,132 patients who had been given a commitment to treatment were still waiting after six months, and this had risen to 3,766 by June 2009.

“Now he is turning his attention to primary health such as the health care people receive in their communities about disease prevention and lifestyle, and advice they receive when they are first unwell.

“We have already seen bad news in primary care under Tony Ryall and so his 'special' attention in the next year is probably unwanted,” Ruth Dyson said.

The Primary Health Care Strategy launched in 2001 by Annette King was a move to help people get treatment earlier, pay less to seek that care and adopt healthy lifestyles.

“In the last month alone, I have seen reports of GP books being completely closed in Timaru while the local Emergency Department puts in place plans to reduce the number of people who can be seen in the ED by 5,000.

“National campaigned on a Health Policy of “Better Sooner and More Convenient. People are now waiting longer for hospital-based treatment and this latest plan to turn his attention to Primary Health is alarming,” Ruth Dyson said.
