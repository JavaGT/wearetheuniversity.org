**Minister’s decision-making on trial once again**

Education Minister Hekia Parata’s controversial decision to close and merge Christchurch schools goes on trial again today, with Phillipstown School seeking a judicial review of its proposed merger with Woolston, says Labour’s Associate Education spokesperson Megan Woods.

“Today’s hearing sends a clear signal to the Minister that the local community feels let down by her decision and demonstrates a Government running roughshod over the people of Canterbury.

“Good on the board for being determined enough to stand up for the safety and wellbeing of children attending their school.

“Board members have argued all along that the rationale for the merger was flawed, and I am with them all the way in their last ditch effort to challenge the Minister’s proposal.

“This isn’t the first time Hekia Parata’s decision-making has been before the courts; a resolution to close Salisbury School was successfully challenged earlier this year, with the court finding she had abrogated her responsibilities.

“The manner in which Mrs Parata has carried out the school closures and mergers in Christchurch is just a further example of her failure to engage with the community, and once again she is being forced to defend her decisions,” said Megan Woods.
