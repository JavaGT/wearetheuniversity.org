Sign Up To Help Labour Guarantee A Voice For Students

**Sign Up To Help Labour Guarantee A Voice For Students**

  
As students around New Zealand arrive at university for orientation, the Labour Party is urging them to join a campaign to keep their voice on university councils.

  
“The National Party is removing the right of students, staff and other community groups to be represented on university councils,” Labour’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

  
“It follows the Government’s introduction of voluntary student association membership and is a further silencing of students who have been vocal critics of National’s policies.

  
“Labour is making a commitment to students that when we are elected to government we will ensure they are represented on university councils and have strong student associations.

  
“We believe having those who are involved in learning and teaching on the governing bodies of universities is a good thing and adds value to the decisions being made.

  
“Starting today at Otago University orientation week, we are asking students to sign up to a petition opposing National's attempts to silence students’ voices.

  
“We will be at every university over coming weeks to give students the chance to oppose the university council changes and make a submission against the legislation Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce plans to introduce.

  
“A strong response from students to National's proposals will send a powerful message that they will not accept their voices being silenced,” Grant Robertson says.
