MP for Dunedin South  

16 July 2015 MEDIA RELEASE

**Save Saddle Hill petition a community-driven campaign**

More than 3500 people have signed the petition to save Saddle Hill, showing the depth of community support in protecting the local landmark, says Dunedin South MP Clare Curran.

“The wider Saddle Hill community has rallied behind the protection of Saddle Hill in an effort to ensure the local landmark is preserved.

“It has been a truly community-driven campaign, with thousands signing the petition to the Dunedin City Council both online and in physical form. The issue continues to grow in importance for Dunedin residents who value this treasured landmark.

“The petition asks the Dunedin City Council to request a stop work order on the quarrying of Saddle Hill from the Environment Court. Subsequently the Council took the issue back to the Court to determine the conditions to be applied to future quarrying and for an enforcement order to prohibit operations beyond those conditions. The community anxiously awaits the court’s decision.

“We need urgent action now to save this precious landmark. Already, over a third of the hill has been quarried and it’s lost 48 metres of height. The lengthy court process, which has spanned over many years, has meant a considerable delay in a firm decision being made on the future of the landmark. We cannot afford any further delays.

“I have also asked the DCC to work alongside the Saddle Hill community to initiate discussions on the future protection and ownership of Saddle Hill as a unique landmark. Community engagement is crucial in all decisions made on the future of the landmark. It is their history and their taonga” Clare Curran says.
