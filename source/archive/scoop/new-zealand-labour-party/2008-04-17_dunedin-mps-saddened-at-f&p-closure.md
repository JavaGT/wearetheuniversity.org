Dunedin MPs saddened at F&P closure

17 April 2008

Dunedin MPs David Benson-Pope, Pete Hodgson and David Parker say they are saddened at the loss of 430 jobs in Otago, after Fisher and Paykel announced it would relocate its Range and DishDrawer factory overseas.

“Fisher and Paykel has been a long-standing and reputable employer and this closure is a real loss to Mosgiel,” David Benson-Pope said.

“Our sympathies are with the workers, who will be shocked at this decision.

“Although unemployment in Otago is at a very low 2.9 percent and it’s likely that these highly-skilled workers will find new jobs, being made redundant is stressful, and our hearts go out to the families affected.

“As a matter of course, Work and Income assistance is available to anyone who needs it to find appropriate employment.”

Speaking from overseas, Pete Hodgson noted that 90 high-skilled jobs in the company’s Engineering and Product Development division will remain based in Dunedin.

“Now is the time to partner with the university and polytechnic to make sure we can retain and develop our innovative engineering sector.”

David Parker agreed that building on the region’s R&D strengths was important. “In the coming weeks and months I hope we can all sit down with Fisher and Paykel, local government and education representatives to plot a way forward that makes the most of the resources we have in Otago.”
