Labour leadership candidates in Invercargill

The four candidates for Labour Leader – Andrew Little, Nanaia Mahuta, David Parker and Grant Robertson - will be in Invercargill on Friday evening for a Husting meeting with members, as part of fourteen Husting Meetings being held nationwide as a key part of the process to select a new Leader. The meeting will begin at 7.30pm at The Lindisfarne Community Centre, Corner Lindisfarne and Miller Streets, Invercargill.

The Electoral College for the Labour Leader comprises three sections – Party members (all of whom have a vote, worth 40% of the College), Caucus members (all of whom have a vote, worth 40% of the College) and affiliated unions (with varying voting systems, worth 20% of the College).

The Husting meetings are a chance for voters from all three sections of the Party to meet and question the candidates, and to hear them speak. The meeting will be chaired by Labour Party President Moira Coatsworth and the speeches and question and answer session will be chaired and moderated by Des Collins, Invercargill LEC Chair.

The result of the Leadership Election will be announced on November 18th.

Glenda Alexander, Regional Representative on the Labour Party’s New Zealand Council says that the election of the Labour Party leader is an important component of Party democracy.

“The New Zealand Labour Party has joined the overwhelming majority of major political parties worldwide who involve Party members in electing their Leader, including the Australian Labor Party and UK Labour and Conservative Parties”, Rachel Boyack said.

Media can be present during the open session, which will feature a seven-minute speech from each of the candidates, and also at the end of the meeting. The meeting will last no more than two hours. People who are members of the Labour Party and affiliated unions are invited to attend, and need to bring evidence of their membership. Members of the public can join the Labour Party at the meeting and attend.
