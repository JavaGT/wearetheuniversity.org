Urgent action needed to help Sri Lankan civilians

  
The Sri Lankan Government needs to move rapidly to address reconciliation with Sri Lanka’s Tamil community and assist those affected by the ongoing conflict, Labour Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Chris Carter says.

“Many thousands of civilians are in a desperate state in northern Sri Lanka and no more innocent lives should be put at risk in the civil war which has already seen over 70,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced from their homes,” Chris Carter said

“We hope the military victory of the Sri Lankan Government in its conflict with Tamil separatist fighters will lead to reconciliation and peace throughout the country.

“It is critical that the Government of President Mahindra Rajapaksa moves swiftly to reconcile with the Tamil community, many of whom hold grievances and a historical sense of marginalisation within Sri Lanka.

“A lasting peace will only be possible when all communities feel secure.

“Tamils must also show a commitment to pursuing non violent means to achieve their goals. This is the only way in which both groups will be able to move forward in an atmosphere of mutual trust and understanding.

“If the history of this bloody conflict has taught us anything, it is that armed conflict is no answer to the problems of co-existence in a multi-ethnic society.

“The longstanding conflict has precipitated a humanitarian disaster with hundreds of thousands of individuals forced to flee their homes and lives. Their needs must be accorded the highest priority by the Sri Lankan Government. Urgent efforts must be made to treat wounded civilians and house those who have lost their homes.

“We urge President Rajapaksa to do everything within his powers to assist the refugees and other victims of the conflict to return to their homes to begin rebuilding their communities,” Chris Carter said.
