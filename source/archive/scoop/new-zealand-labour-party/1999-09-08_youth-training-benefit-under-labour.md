Youth training benefit under Labour
===================================

[![Labour
2000 web site](http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg)](http://www.labour.org.nz)Labour youth spokesperson Lianne Dalziel has welcomed Labour's commitment to restoring a training benefit to 16 and 17 year olds.

The plan is part of Labour's social security policy released in Wellington today.

"This is going to make a huge difference to the lives of many young people. It gives them positive choices that National stripped away," Lianne Dalziel said.

"Labour's policy has an emphasis on breaking the cycle of young people leaving school without any options for their future. Restoration of a training benefit for young people is a major aspect of that.

"When a 16-year-old leaves their home town for the bright lights of a big city, they can end up on the streets. It is in all of our interests to give them access to better opportunities through education and training, but National stripped away all reasonable options available to those young people.

"Labour is also planning greater support for young people who receive the Independent Youth Benefit. The Active programme will ensure that all young people who are eligible for this allowance are encouraged and supported into work, training and education. They will receive individual case management to ensure that assistance is tailored to their precise needs."

Lianne Dalziel said another exciting plan for youth was the new Citizen's Service for New Zealand.

"It will build on the Conservation Corps programmes to develop skills among young people through project based community work. Participants will then be eligible to have a proportion of the fees component of full-time tertiary study waived. Again, this is focused on providing positive opportunities for young people," Lianne Dalziel said.
