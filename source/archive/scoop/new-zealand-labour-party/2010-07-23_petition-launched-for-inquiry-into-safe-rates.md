Petition launched for inquiry into safe rates

**Petition launched for inquiry into safe rates in trucking industry**

  
  
Labour’s Transport Safety spokesperson Darien Fenton has launched a petition calling for an inquiry into whether there is a link between truck driver remuneration and safety in the road transport industry.

This comes after the government refused a Select Committee Inquiry earlier this year, despite revelations that truck drivers are routinely breaking logbook rules, scrimping on maintenance and working ridiculously long hours just to make ends meet.  
  
“Economic factors are having a direct impact on the death and injury toll caused by truck related accidents in New Zealand, but the government is in denial about this,” says Ms Fenton.  
  
“The current situation, particularly for small business owner drivers, can result in drivers working excessive hours to meet schedules, overloading their trucks and cutting back on vehicle maintenance.

“Far too often, the only control over the situation a truck driver has is to make up time and their rate of pay through unsafe practices.

“With an average of one death and 20 injuries a week in truck related crashes, and a cost to communities and families of more than $400 million annually, I would have thought the government would show a bit more interest.

A study by a team of academics in the US led by Professor Michael Belzer found the probability of a truck crash fell by 36 percent for every 10 percent increase in wages.

“An inquiry could take a hard look at current driving hours regulations, the current contracting cost models, the pressures on small business owner drivers and the responsibility of those further up the supply chain.

“If the government thinks there are no problems, it won’t have any problems agreeing to the call for an inquiry when this petition is returned to Parliament” says Ms Fenton.
