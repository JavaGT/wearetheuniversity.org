### Broaden dialogue on trade negotiations

It’s time for broadening dialogue about and input into the trade negotiation process, says Opposition Trade Spokesperson, Maryan Street.

“We are embarking on a new era of trade negotiations, where civil society demands more input into and more accountability from, those who are responsible for our international trade deals,” said Maryan Street.

“In the last decade, the Labour government put in place the processes and systems which allowed Parliamentary scrutiny of trade deals and their passage through legislation. That was an improvement on the previous era but it happened at the end of the negotiation process. We also had an advisory group on trade involving business, unions and civil society groups who provided good input on trade deals.

“Now there is much wider interest and concern about the practical effects of international trade deals, from the impact on a country’s sovereignty to the effect on climate change. Labour and environment clauses are now part and parcel of trade agreements which New Zealand signs, and they are gaining in strength and efficacy,” she said.

“The Labour Party believes that there should be wider dialogue and a range of advice available to trade ministers as they proceed to instruct trade negotiators about the trade outcomes they require. We would establish a group of people representing business, unions, academics and non-governmental organisations to provide the Trade Minister with analysis and advice to guide progress in negotiations.

“Labour follows a genuinely bipartisan approach to trade in New Zealand, because the country’s interests are more important than any political party’s interests. The current Minister, Mr Groser, added some closer scrutiny to the process in the San Francisco and Auckland rounds of negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, right now continuing its development in Santiago.

“That was a good move and is supported by the Labour Party but we believe it can usefully be developed further,” said Maryan Street.

“I have been a negotiator prior to becoming an MP and I know about the sensitivities of negotiations. I know that if the text of an agreement is publicly released too soon in a negotiation, positions can harden and further progress becomes impossible. But I do believe that critical analysis of the text by interested parties will enhance agreements and not detract from them. They could result in improvements for New Zealand’s interests. That can be built in to a more open, transparent and accountable process which I favour,” said Maryan Street.

“The Trans-Pacific Partnership currently being negotiated is one of the most ambitious and complex trade deals ever attempted. We can benefit from closer scrutiny being applied and should not shy away from it. We need to know what all the effects of any deal are for New Zealand so our interests are adequately protected and there are no unintended or surprise consequences.

“Labour says it is time to open up the process to greater participation,” said Maryan Street.
