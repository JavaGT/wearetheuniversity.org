David Parker

MP for Otago

Media Statement

TUESDAY 6 SEPTEMBER 2005

Sam Neill supports David Parker

Sam Neill has thrown his support behind David Parker's campaign to be re-elected as Otago MP.

Mr Neill said today:

"I see Helen Clark's Government as a calm and sensible middle-of the-road government in a world increasingly given to extremes.

Their great achievement is they kept us out of the Iraq war: we know Brash would have sent troops. This alone should disqualify him from leading the country.

I do not want to see New Zealand, persuaded by rash tax bribes, swing to the hard right under a Don Brash government.

David Parker is one of the most able people in Parliament, and has been an excellent member for Otago. I want to see him back."

Sam Neill and David Parker will speak at a public meeting at Waitaki Girls High School hall in Oamaru at 7.30pm on Wednesday 14 September.
