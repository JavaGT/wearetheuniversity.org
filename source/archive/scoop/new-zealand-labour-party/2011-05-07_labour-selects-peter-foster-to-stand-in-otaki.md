Labour selects Peter Foster to stand in Otaki

  
Today the Labour Party selected Peter Foster to stand as its candidate for the Otaki electorate in this years’ general election.

"Peter Foster is an excellent candidate. He is a family man, who has lived and worked in the Otaki electorate for 11 years. By day he is a criminal barrister who works with troubled youth. He also has a strong record of community involvement as a Board of Trustees member for both Waikanae School and Paraparaumu College and as a local rugby coach” said Labour Party President, Moira Coatsworth

Peter's selection today was greeted by a standing ovation from local Labour members.

"I have every confidence that Peter will hit the ground running and bring the Otaki seat back to Labour” Moira Coatsworth said.
