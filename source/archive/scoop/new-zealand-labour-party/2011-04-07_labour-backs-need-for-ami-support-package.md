Labour backs need for AMI support package

**Labour backs need for AMI support package**

Labour supports the need to provide certainty for the 85,000 Cantabrians who may have been worrying about whether their claims for earthquake damage would be paid out by AMI, and it hopes the Government support package will provide that.

“The wellbeing of Cantabrians and their ability to rebuild their homes and lives must not be put at risk because of financial uncertainty surrounding the country’s second largest insurer,” says Labour Leader Phil Goff.

“But this support package must only be a backstop. The Government will need to ensure that there are safeguards in place to protect the long-term interests of taxpayers.

“Kiwi taxpayers are sick and tired of bailing out the private sector, including finance companies which were often reckless and greedy.

“Those companies capitalised on the good times raking in profits, but when they started making losses and going bust, it’s left to the poor taxpayer to rescue them. That sticks in my throat and the throats of most other New Zealanders.

“AMI is a different situation that has come about through extraordinary circumstances. Action had to be taken to protect the interests of the 485,000 AMI policyholders throughout New Zealand, especially those affected by the disaster in Canterbury,” Phil Goff said.
