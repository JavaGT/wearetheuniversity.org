Taxpayers Should Not Pay For Frivolous Legal Action

**Taxpayers Should Not Pay For Frivolous Legal Action**

Labour Leader David Shearer is calling on John Key to rule out taxpayer funding for any legal action taken by his ACC Minister Judith Collins against MPs and media organisations.

“Judith Collins has no right to waste thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money on legal bills. Labour MPs who are being threatened with defamation action will pay their own costs and so should she. The cost should not fall on taxpayers.

“John Key says his Government is fiscally prudent and intends on keeping firm control of the Government purse-strings, with a possible zero budget this year. If he’s looking to save money, the first thing he should do is turn down Judith Collins’ request for legal funding.

“Labour will continue to ask questions about the massive privacy breach at ACC We will also continue to hold the Government to account in terms of allegations of cronyism.

“There is currently a perception out there that if you know someone from National, you’ll get special treatment. That goes against New Zealanders’ belief in everyone getting equal treatment and a fair go.”
