**EQC shows contempt for earthquake victims**

A community group, who advocate for earthquake victims, has again been stonewalled by petty and stupid Government obstruction, Labour’s Earthquake Commission spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove says.

“I took on the case of the Wider Earthquake Communities Action Network of Canterbury (WECAN) a fortnight ago after the group was told by the Earthquake Commission that it would accept its OIA request but it wanted $24,000 to process it.

“I took that OIA request over and resubmitted it in my name so the community group wouldn’t be charged. Today I get [a letter from EQC](http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1307/Letter_from_EQC.pdf) stating that they are extending the timeframe to September 9 to ‘make a determination and prepare a response’ to my request.

“So EQC want more time to determine whether they will accept my OIA request, the same OIA it had already accepted when WECAN lodged it.

“Gerry Brownlee ought to kick some backsides in EQC and stop this petty obstruction. However, the Minister is culpable because he knew about this – all OIAs from MPs are run through the Minister’s office.

“This is ridiculous. It is showing contempt for earthquake victims and a community group trying to help them.

“I will be laying a complaint with the ombudsman.”
