National’s job cuts hit home
============================

**National’s job cuts hit home**

  
The reality of National’s slashing of jobs in the public sector hit home for staff at the Tertiary Education Commission today as they found out which of them would be losing their jobs, Grant Robertson says.

The Government has previously announced that around 70 jobs were to be cut at the Tertiary Education Commission, and today staff were informed of the outcome of the final review. In some teams up to 80% of staff are losing their jobs.

“My sympathies go out to those who have lost their jobs. These are people with families and responsibilities, many with mortgages to pay, who will be concerned about their future. I hope that they are getting all the support they need at this difficult time, particularly from government agencies,” Grant Robertson said.

“The Government has announced a redeployment plan for public service staff who lose their jobs. While this is a fine idea in principle, the reality is that National has overseen the announcement of more than 1000 job cuts, the creation of just 100.

“So much for a Government that said its number one priority was keeping people in work.

“In addition the Department of Labour is cutting more than 40 jobs in the Pay and Employment Equity Unit, and the Labour Market Knowledge Managers.

“More public servants are being thrown on the scrap heap by National. Despite a yawning gender pay gap, National has disbanded the unit.

“The Knowledge Managers are people who work on the ground in regional communities helping to develop work opportunities.

“Surely these are the ‘frontline’ staff who are providing an important service to the community that National claims to be supporting?”

“Nearly 250 job cuts have been added to the total of job losses in the public sector this week. National is failing its own test for addressing the most important issue for New Zealanders in a recession- keeping people in work,” Grant Robertson said.
