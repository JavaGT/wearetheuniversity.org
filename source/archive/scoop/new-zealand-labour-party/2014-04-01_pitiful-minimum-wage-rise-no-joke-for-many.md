Pitiful minimum wage rise no joke for many

Pitiful minimum wage rise no joke for many

The minimum wage rise taking effect today is too little and too late and will do nothing for working New Zealanders who rely on it, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.

“The cost of housing, whether renting or buying, is now so out of kilter with the ability of low income families to pay the bills that another few dollars a week will go nowhere near making up the shortfall.

“The brutal reality for these workers is they are not getting their fair share and this is contributing to growth in income inequality and family poverty.

“That’s confirmed by the fact almost two-thirds of New Zealanders feel they are no better off or have gone backwards, in the six years National has been in government.

“Not only that, but in real terms median wages have dropped in many regions over the same period.

“National has also failed to address the lack of minimum wage protection for thousands of vulnerable contractors and cut the pay of young minimum wage workers.

“It had a chance to stick up for our lowest paid workers and help make a real difference to their lives and those of their children, but once again turned its back on them.

“Labour would do better – raising the minimum wage to $15 within its first 100 days in Government, followed by another rise in 2015. We would also address the lack of minimum wage protection for vulnerable contractors,” David Cunliffe said.
