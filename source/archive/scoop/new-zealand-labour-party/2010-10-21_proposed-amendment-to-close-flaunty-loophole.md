Proposed amendment to close Flaunty loophole

**Labour proposes amendment to close Flaunty loophole**

The Labour Party will move an amendment to local government law to prevent local board members from sitting on more than one board in the Auckland super city.

Labour's Auckland Issues spokesperson Phil Twyford said the case of West Auckland pharmacist Warren Flaunty sitting on five boards showed there was a loophole that should be closed.

Mr Flaunty was elected to three local boards in Rodney, Henderson-Massey and Upper Harbour as well as being re-elected to the Waitemata District Health Board and the Waitakere Licensing Trust.

"Power is already too concentrated in the hands of too few people running the super city. Mr Flaunty is obviously a competent person, but it is impossible for him to be able to do all of the jobs properly when he has to rush between different meetings trying to cover an area the size of three parliamentary electorates.

"There is an anomaly in the law that Rodney Hide's super city legislation should have prevented in Auckland. Local members should have to choose only one local board. I don't see any problem with someone standing for more than one board but if they get elected to more than one then they should have to choose one.

"I will put up an amendment when Rodney Hide's Local Government Act 2002 Amendment Bill comes back to the House in a few weeks' time."
