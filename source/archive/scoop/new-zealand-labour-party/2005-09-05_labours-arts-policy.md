Arts, Culture And Heritage

LABOUR’S VISION

Labour’s vision sees the arts, culture and heritage sector making a huge contribution to our nation’s life, and being recognised and valued for its role in defining who and what we are. New Zealand’s creativity and heritage are priceless assets which define us to the world as a unique nation with our own distinctive images, perspectives, culture and heritage.

LABOUR’S ACHIEVEMENTS

Labour has demonstrated its strong commitment to arts, culture, and heritage. The sector is thriving as never before. It is having a very positive impact on New Zealand's economic, cultural, and social life. Its success builds national identity and pride; brings pleasure to diverse audiences; enables New Zealanders to develop their creative talent; and secures economic advantage for New Zealand in the twenty first century.

Film Labour has:

• Introduced the Large Budget Screen Production Grant Scheme, to encourage the filming and production in New Zealand of large-budget films, by offering a grant to offset qualifying expenditure in New Zealand.

• Provided an initial capital injection of $22m through the Film Production Fund to encourage the production of New Zealand feature films, and in 2005 increased the Film Commission’s baseline funding by $10m per annum to ensure the momentum gained can be continued.

• Established the Screen Council to ensure that a strategic approach is taken to the development of the screen production industry.

• Increased funding to Film New Zealand, to enable it to continue its work in facilitating domestic and overseas film and television productions and to continue to foster the screen production sector's rapid expansion.
