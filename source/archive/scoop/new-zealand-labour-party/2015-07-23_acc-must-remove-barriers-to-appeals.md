ACC must remove barriers to appeals

ACC Spokesperson

**ACC must remove barriers to appeals**

The Government must prioritise removing barriers to justice for ACC claimants following a damning report by Acclaim Otago, Labour’s ACC spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“ACC Minister Nikki Kaye must urgently scrap her flawed plan to remove claimant’s right to redress in the District Court.

“The Acclaim Otago report released today condemned the Government’s proposal as producing ‘savings to ACC at the expense of injured people’.

“The Minister would rather spend up to $950 million on a new computer system for ACC than address issues of fairness and justice.

“Our ACC system replaced the ‘right to sue’. It would be wrong for the Government to now reduce the right of legal scrutiny on claim decisions made by the corporation.

“Labour has called for a review of the ACC system to focus on fairness, consistency and improved access to support and rehabilitation,” Sue Moroney says.
