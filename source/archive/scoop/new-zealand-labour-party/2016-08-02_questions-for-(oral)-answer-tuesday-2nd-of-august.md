**Questions for (Oral) Answer - Tuesday 2nd Of August**

While Parliament might be in recess, there are still plenty of things that Ministers need to answer for. So the Labour team has put together six of the best questions that the Government should be answering today (plus a special bonus question), Labour’s Shadow Leader of the House Chris Hipkins said.

QUESTION TO MINISTERS

**ANDREW LITTLE** to the **Prime Minister**: Does he still claim that New Zealand is not a tax haven given that New Zealand now faces the prospect of an investigation by the European Union that could result in a raft of trade sanctions in one of our most important export markets?

  
**ANNETTE KING** to the **Minister of Health**: What responsibility does he take for Canterbury DHB, Starship Hospital and Capital Coast DHB relying on charity donations for vital medical gear, given the $1.7 billion cut from the health budget in the last six years?

  
**GRANT ROBERTSON** to the **Minister of Finance**: When was he, or other Ministers first informed that New Zealand faced the prospect of an investigation by the European Union as to whether we are a tax haven, and what action did he take in response to this?

  
**PHIL TWYFORD** to the **Minister for Land Information**: Why does the foreign house buying data that she has released not count foreign students and others on temporary visas as foreign buyers, and can she confirm that there are 5,700 people on temporary visas who purchased houses in the last three months?

**JACINDA ARDERN** to the **Minister of Social Development**: Why has she failed to properly resource the Children's Teams she set up to support at risk children given that her own documents show that seven out of the ten teams have not been able to find staff to manage the teams?

  
**STUART NASH** to the **Minister of Police**: Why will she not reverse her decision to freeze Police staffing levels in light of a 13% increase in burglaries and 12% increase in robberies nationwide, including a 53% increase in some areas in the last year?

**BONUS QUESTION: TODD MULLER** to **the Prime Minister**: Did he hear Louise Upston being interviewed on Morning Report today, and if so, how come she gets to be a Minister and I don't?
