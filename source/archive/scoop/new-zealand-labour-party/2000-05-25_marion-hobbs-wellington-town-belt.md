Marion Hobbs - Wellington Town BeltMEDIA RELEASE

HON MARIAN HOBBS

MP for WELLINGTON CENTRAL

  
24 May 2000

  
WELLINGTON TOWN BELT

  
Wellington Central MP, Marian Hobbs, has met the Friends of the Wellington Town Belt to discuss possible legislation to protect the former Chest Hospital land on Mt Victoria from sale by Capital Coast Health.

Ms Hobbs has also set up meetings with the Mayor, Mark Blumsky and the Minister of Health, Annette King.

She rejected as fatuous, claims by the opposition that she was ignoring the issue.

"Annabel Young was copied into correspondence by the Friends of the Wellington Town Belt and is now trying to make political capital out of it," Marian Hobbs said.

Ms Hobbs said she was not in the House when Ms Young tried unsuccessfully to discuss the subject.
