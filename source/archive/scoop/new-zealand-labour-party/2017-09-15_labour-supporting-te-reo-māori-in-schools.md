Labour supporting Te Reo Māori in schools

Labour will support a future where New Zealanders from every background will have the ability to use Te Reo Māori in everyday conversations, says Labour’s Deputy Leader and Māori Development spokesperson Kelvin Davis.

“Labour will commit to a target that by 2025 every child during ECE, primary school, and intermediate school has Te Reo Māori integrated into their learning.

“We will also ensure that by 2025 every student at high school, once at the point they become able to choose their own subjects, has the opportunity to learn Te Reo Māori.

“To start work towards achieving these targets, Labour will ensure that all early childhood, primary school, and intermediate school teachers are provided with an opportunity to undertake lessons in Te Reo Māori.

“This will allow them to strengthen their understanding of Te Reo Māori to a position where they can integrate the language confidently into their teaching.

“We will also double the number of dedicated scholarships to increase the number of Te Reo Māori teachers in our secondary schools, to ensure that by 2025 there is enough supply to have Te Reo Māori available as an option in all secondary schools.

“The survival and future of Te Reo Māori as a thriving language is a core value for Labour because we believe it’s a unique taonga for all New Zealanders. Te Reo Māori is fundamental to our national identity and provides an important gateway to better understanding the rich history and culture of Aotearoa.

“The Māori language forms part of the broader cultural identity and heritage of New Zealand and has enjoyed a national resurgence after Te Reo Māori was given official status in 1987 by the Fourth Labour Government.

“But we can do better. A Labour Government will ensure that Te Reo Māori is integrated into early learning, is available for all high school students, and the resources to deliver this are there for our schools,” says Kelvin Davis.
