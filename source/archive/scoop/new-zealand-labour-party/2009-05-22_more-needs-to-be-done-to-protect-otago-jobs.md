More needs to be done to protect Otago jobs

Figures released today on the level of economic activity in the Otago region shows that the Government must do more to protect jobs in the region, Labour MP Clare Curran said today.

“Many hardworking New Zealanders are becoming increasingly concerned about job security as unemployment numbers continue to grow,” Ms Curran said.

“Action and urgency is needed from the Government to ensure as many Otago jobs can be saved. National has not had a plan to address unemployment when forecasts predict 60,000 Kiwis will lose their jobs this year.

“The Otago region  recorded the largest fall in employment in New Zealand, dropping 5.8 percent since  December. Unemployment for the March quarter increased by 38%  to 4,400. That means 1,200  Otago workers  have lost their jobs in the first three months of this year.

“More needs to be done to ensure regional economies stay strong and local businesses are getting the help they need to keep their workers employed,” Ms Curran said

“Small regional businesses are a vital part of our economy. They will do much of the heavy lifting that will get New Zealand through the current downturn.

Results of the National Bank Regional Trend survey released today show just how much pain regional economies are bearing.

“Economic activity in Otago has dropped away by 3% in the first quarter of the year. The reality of those figures is that bottom lines are getting even tighter for businesses.

“Those businesses need real help from the Government not the gimmicks and window dressing we’ve seen from National in its effort to appear to be taking action on the jobs front.

“John Key’s 9 day fortnight has been inadequate. It’s saved around 120 jobs when each week over a thousand Kiwis are losing their jobs.

“It’s time for John Key and his Otago MPs to listen, understand and offer real solutions to protect Kiwi jobs.

“The Government has the opportunity with this month’s budget.  The budget must focused on keeping Kiwis in work.” Ms Curran said.
