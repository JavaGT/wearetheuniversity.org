Dunne: With friends like these…

Revenue Spokesperson

14 March 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Dunne: With friends like these…**

While Revenue Minister Peter Dunne was overseas today, his National frenemies have been setting him up to carry the can for the car park tax, Labour’s Revenue spokesperson David Cunliffe said.

“In the past 24 hours “very senior” National Party sources have told news media their aim is to shift the heat on the tax onto Dunne.

“National Party insider Matthew Hooton has been winding up a coalition of business and unions to attack the Revenue Minister. Government back benchers have been scathing of the car park tax at the Finance and Expenditure committee.

“National needs a scapegoat because John Key has broken his promise never to introduce this car park tax.

“So Peter Dunne’s reputation, and potentially the United Future-National relationship, is on the ropes over an unworkable new tax that should never have gotten through Cabinet.

“National’s attack on United Future is a major kick in the teeth to their support partner. It’s a blatant abrogation of the Government’s Confidence and Supply Agreement which demands confidentiality and collective responsibility.

“We can only hope that Peter Dunne remembers this attack when it’s time to cast his deciding vote in the stinking SkyCity casino convention centre deal.

“National is running for cover because no Government has created more new taxes since Rob Muldoon.

“Last week National unveiled a new tax on Christchurch rebuild workers. They increased GST when they promised they wouldn’t. They invented paperboy and papergirl tax. They’ve upped the prescription charges, pickpocketed students, and cut services all over the show.

“And all this because they’ve staked all their credibility on balancing the Budget. These punitive and petty new taxes are the price the public now has to pay,” David Cunliffe said.
