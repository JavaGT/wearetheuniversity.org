Unsolved burglaries and rising violent crime

Jenny Shipley has painted a far too rosy picture from the latest crime statistics, Labour police spokesperson George Hawkins said.

"While any reduction in reported crime is to be welcomed, a closer examination of the figures reveals some disturbing facts.

"Violent crime has increased slightly with 40,274 recorded offences, and makes up a higher percentage of overall crime.

"There's been a massive 20.8% increase in reported violent crime in Northland, an 11.8% increase in Tasman and a 6% increase in Canterbury.

"Mrs Shipley claims that "while others talk, National delivers." How then does she explain a 93% increase in violent offences between June 1990 and June 1999? Under National, New Zealand has become a far more violent society.

"National has also failed to deliver on its promise to tackle the public's number one crime concern - burglary. The burglary resolution rate has fallen even further, to just 11.1 percent.

"A slight reduction in reported burglaries is no comfort. Police National Headquarters has estimated that only 55 percent of burglaries are reported to the police - many only because of insurance requirements. The public know that in most cases the police don't have the resources to help them.

"This is reflected in a drop in public satisfaction with Police services, from 80% to 74%. The percentage of people with full trust and confidence in our police force has fallen to just 19%.

"While individual police officers continue to do a wonderful job, government stuff-ups like the INCIS debacle and the cost-cutting police review have been major handicaps.

"Labour will tackle crime, especially youth offending and burglary, and is committed to restoring the morale of our police and the public's faith in them," George Hawkins said.
