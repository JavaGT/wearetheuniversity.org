National standards, the future for early childhood education, including home-based care and playcentres will be the focus of discussion on Monday in Dunedin.

Labour’s education spokesperson Sue Moroney will visit Early Childhood Education (ECE) Centres and meet with ECE Providers and Principals to discuss ECE Cuts and National Standards.

“The Minister’s recent decision to merge Forbury School and Macandrew Intermediate is just one of the reasons I asked my colleague to visit Dunedin,” Dunedin South MP Clare Curran said.

With the recent release of Early Childhood Education Taskforce recommendations and the Government continually cutting funding to the ECE sector, communities are voicing their opposition and concern to the Government’s directions in ECE and schools. The taskforce submissions are due on Monday 8 August so it is timely that a meeting is being held.

“Sue will be speaking to a meeting on Monday at 10.30am in the Green Room, Mayfair Theatre, to discuss the Government’s ECE funding cuts and taskforce recommendations.

The Government’s controversial National Standards is the subject of a second meeting at 1.30pm on Monday to discuss the issue with principals from Otago and the impact this is having on school communities.” Clare Curran said.

“I invite anyone who is interested to hear Sue speak about these issues or wants to voice their concerns to attend these meetings on Monday.” Clare Curran said.
