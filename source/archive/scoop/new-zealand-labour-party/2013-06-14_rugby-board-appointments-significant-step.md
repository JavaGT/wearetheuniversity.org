**Rugby board appointments significant step**

  
Labour’s associate spokesperson for Sport and Recreation, Louisa Wall, is delighted by New Zealand Rugby’s appointment of Julie Christie and Kereyn Smith to two of its committees.

"It is heartening to see New Zealand Rugby taking on board the issue of working towards a gender balance at a governance level.

"There has been a lot of discussion about the issue of women's governance representation over the last year and I am proud that New Zealand Rugby has recognised the value of diversity amongst its governors and made this step."

"These appointments of two excellent women follow the appointment of Raelene Castle as CEO of the Canterbury Bulldogs.

“They are a significant first and a welcome step towards an inclusive and diverse governance structure," Ms Wall, a former Black Fern, said.
