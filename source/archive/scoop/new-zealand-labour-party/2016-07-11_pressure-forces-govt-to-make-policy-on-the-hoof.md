**Pressure forces Govt to make policy on the hoof**

Steven Joyce’s surprise announcement that Housing NZ will no longer be used as a cash cow has forced the Finance Minister to make one of National’s biggest ever U-turns, Labour’s Finance spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“After years of insisting the dividend was necessary to ensure the Corporation was financially disciplined, Bill English suddenly decides -- two days after Labour announced it would forego the dividend – it’s not needed.

“This is panicked and desperate policy on the hoof from a Government that has failed miserably to solve the housing crisis.

“Labour’s comprehensive plan to fix the housing crisis has put National under intense pressure and they have buckled.

“This is a victory for the many thousands of needy families on the waiting list for a state house. But there is a long way to go and a lot more to do. If National really wants to solve the housing crisis, it should adopt the rest of Labour’s plans or better still, hand the reins over to the party providing the ideas,” Grant Robertson says.
