Reports show tick-box approach to kids’ health failing

The Government’s tick-box approach to health is failing our kids says Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King.

Two reports released within days of each other raise concerns about the Government’s efforts, or lack of, in both asthma and rheumatic fever prevention.

University of Canterbury PhD student Rachel Webb’s study on the links between home heating and hospital asthma admissions shows a clear correlation between school holidays and asthma admissions.

“When kids are at home in cold, damp and mouldy conditions their health suffers.

“Instead of looking for fast, flash political wins it’s time the Government required all rental properties to be insulated with affordable, non-polluting heating. That is why Labour has committed to a healthy home guarantee.

“The Government’s failings don’t stop with asthma prevention. The latest evaluation of its rheumatic fever prevention programme shows a lack of follow-up on kids’ throat swabs is affecting their health.

“The report says that even if there was adequate follow-up after swabbing, the programme is in danger of failing because it doesn't address the underlying causes of the disease such as un-insulated housing, poverty and a lack of access to health care.

“The Government needs to take a holistic approach to children’s health.

“Labour is taking the linking factors between children’s health and housing seriously. The growing inequities in our society must be addressed through policies that are linked across a range of portfolios.” Annette King said.
