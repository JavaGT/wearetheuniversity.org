MEDIA STATEMENT

**Labour will tackle Canterbury’s housing crisis**

Labour will tackle Canterbury’s housing crisis head-on by building 10,000 affordable KiwiBuild homes in the region in the first four years of the programme, Labour Leader David Cunliffe says.

“Rents in quake-affected areas of Christchurch, Waimakariri and Selwyn are sky-rocketing.

“The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment estimates up to 7400 people are living in insecure housing. Many more are living in overcrowded or substandard conditions.

“The Ministry estimates there is a 7000-house shortfall. This must be addressed and Labour’s pragmatic plan will do just that.

“Labour will also back efforts to revitalise New Brighton by working with the community, local businesses and the City Council. We will fast track the rebuilding of this suburb into a vibrant and modern beachside community.

“Through KiwiBuild we will ensure there are affordable houses in New Brighton. A revamp of the retail precinct will free up space for 200 new homes, with further development creating potential for up to 500 new dwellings.

“The New Brighton Community Revitalisation Project will kick-start our KiwiBuild programme  beginning with existing government and council land assets. It is a marker for more to come.

“Labour will also investigate the use of appropriate Red Zone land and properties as a stop gap measure for temporary accomodation. It is senseless to demolish houses when there is a pressing need for rental accommodation.

“Where it is safe and feasible, we will look at renting homes on the edge of the Red Zone, near houses that have been retained.

“The time has come for the Government to stop denying there is a housing crisis in Canterbury. Labour is prepared to take action,” David Cunliffe says.
