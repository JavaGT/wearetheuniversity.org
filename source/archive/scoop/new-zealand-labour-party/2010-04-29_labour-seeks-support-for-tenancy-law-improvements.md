Labour seeks support for tenancy law improvements

**Labour seeks support for tenancy law improvements**

  
Phil Heatley has an opportunity to make much needed improvements in proposed tenancy laws, says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Moana Mackey.

“The Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill was developed and introduced by the Labour-led Government, and adopted by the current Government”, says Moana Mackey.

“The Bill is now a watered down version of Labour’s legislation, although it is still a marked improvement on the status quo, which is why Labour will be supporting the legislation.

“However, Labour will be putting forward amendments during the committee stages of the House to further improve the law.

“Labour’s amendments deal with some of the up front financial barriers tenants’ face – like the charging of letting fees, as well as protecting innocent tenants against liability for damage to premises that they did not cause or could not reasonably have prevented.

“Labour will also be proposing amendments to ensure that the Tenancy Tribunal process is fair and accessible to all parties, whilst retaining its focus on quick and low-cost resolution of disputes.

“For this reason Labour opposes lifting the automatic threshold for the right to representation from $3,000 to $6,000 which this Bill does, instead we would like to see this threshold removed altogether, or if that cannot be achieved then we would like to see it significantly lowered.

“Labour is also introducing amendments to deal with a serious issue which has recently come to light.

“Labour was concerned to hear reports of Wellington boarding house tenants being evicted earlier this year so their rooms could be let out for the Wellington Sevens. While most landlords would never consider evicting a family from their home to make a quick buck in this way, Labour believes that fair tenancy law should make it clear that such an action is prohibited. This is particularly important given reports that Auckland properties are expected to be able to charge visitors thousands of dollars a week over the period of the Rugby World Cup.

“I urge the Government to support my amendments. Increasing numbers of New Zealanders are living in rental accommodation and they deserve the protection of fair and equitable tenancy laws”, says Moana Mackey
