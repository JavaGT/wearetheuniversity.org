**Southshore: A Divided Verdict**

The Government’s land announcement for the communities of Southshore today is a divided verdict, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.

“News that 198 of 401 properties in Southshore are now zoned red will be devastating to some but a welcome relief to others,” Lianne Dalziel said.

203 homes have been zoned green in Department of Building and Housing (DBH) Technical Category 3.

“It has been at least a nine month wait for Southshore residents who were expecting their answer four to six weeks after the first announcement in June last year.

“That means they have had nine months in limbo, expecting to be included in each of the announcements as they have occurred.

“This has caused considerable anguish that could have been avoided by proper community engagement in the decision-making.

“No wonder 87 per cent of newspaper readers are feeling that more should be done to help Canterbury. On the ground, whole communities are reliant on the whims of the Government’s scheduling.

“The Parklands East announcement, which confirms the community will remain green zoned, will be devastating to those who have had to shovel tonnes of silt from their properties time and time again.

“For Parklands residents, there will be a lack of trust in the Government’s decision making process. This will be shared by those in Southshore, who, having watched from a distance, will now take their turn negotiating with the Government and their insurers.

“I hope the Government is thorough in its meetings with residents in coming days, and hope CERA representatives address any community concerns with respect, and timely responses,” Lianne Dalziel said.
