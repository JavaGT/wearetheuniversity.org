Another talk fest won't stop workers dying

The National Government’s ‘decision’ to talk about workplace safety, is a slap in the face for people wanting meaningful action to improve their health and safety at work, says Labour’s associate labour spokesperson Darien Fenton.

Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson says she is meeting 25 senior business executives as part of National’s plan to improve workplace safety.

“This is just another talkfest” says Fenton.

“ But we shouldn’t be surprised. National’s track record on workplace health and safety speaks volumes.

Fenton says National has cut thousands of dollars for training workplace health and safety representatives, and slashed the independent advisory group (NOHSAC) which was conducting independent and evidenced-based research on improving occupational health and safety.

“John Key is helping his big business mates who see health and safety as just another compliance cost. But there are real workers dying here. The Government should quit talking and start acting – with workers as well as with business executives.
