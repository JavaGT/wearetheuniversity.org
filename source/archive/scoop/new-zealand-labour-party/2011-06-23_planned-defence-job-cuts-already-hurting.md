Planned Defence job cuts already hurting

Morale is through the floor in the New Zealand Defence Force as army, navy and air force personnel prepare for job cuts later this month, says Labour's Defence Spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway.

Answering questions from Iain Lees-Galloway at the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade select committee, Government Minister Wayne Mapp admitted morale had dropped significantly due to the proposed job cuts.

"Uncertainty is rife. More than 500 military personnel are facing the axe, with some 324 positions being opened up to civilians," Iain Lees-Galloway said.

"Uniformed personnel currently in those roles will have to re-apply for their jobs. Those that miss out will join the thousands of New Zealanders already unemployed."

"The Minister blamed the Defence Act for the need to make service people re-apply for civilianised roles, but then went on to admit that the Government did not believe amending the act to provide more certainty to personnel was a priority.

"Change is always difficult in any organisation, but the way the dis-establishment of roles has been handled has created unnecessary anxiety amongst the troops.

"These are the people who put their lives on the line for our country. They are loyal to the force and to New Zealand. The least they can expect is to have that loyalty reciprocated," Iain Lees-Galloway said.
