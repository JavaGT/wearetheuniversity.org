Media Statement

Could private schools strip resources off state schools?

  
National needs to make its policy on using taxpayer funds for private schools clear, Labour Education spokesperson Chris Carter said.

“News that Wanganui Collegiate, which charges as much as $27,000 a year for a single boarding student, wants to integrate with the state school system will have parents of state schools asking serious questions about what that means.

“Given John Key’s election commitment to increase funding for private schools by $30 million, taxpayers should be concerned and should be asking questions of the Government.

Mr Carter said schools that accepted large amounts of taxpayer funding should be accessible to all New Zealanders, but many private schools were well out of reach for ordinary Kiwis.

“If Wanganui Collegiate wants an increase in taxpayer funding then the taxpayers of Wanganui should be able to send their children to that school.

“The National government should make it clear what it expects of private schools in return for millions of dollars of taxpayers money.

“It is essential that resources in education are allocated in the best interests of as many students and teachers as possible.

“Allocating precious funds to schools where ordinary New Zealanders can’t afford to send their children is not acceptable.

“New Zealanders need to be asking the Government how it plans to ensure resources are not allocated away from state schools in order to fund schools that are financially out of reach of the majority.
