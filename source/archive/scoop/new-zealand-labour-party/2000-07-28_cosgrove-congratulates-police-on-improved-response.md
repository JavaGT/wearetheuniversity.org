Cosgrove Congratulates Police On Improved Response

Cosgrove Congratulates Police On Improved Response Times

Clayton Cosgrove, Member of Parliament for Waimakariri has today congratulated Canterbury police on improved burglary response times for both rural and urban Canterbury.

Burglary response times in Canterbury have been cut after Police were issued with a Government expectation that burglaries should be responded to within 24 hours.

“In Christchurch the average response time is now four hours and those living in rural areas like Kaiapoi, Rangiora, Oxford and Woodend can expect police to respond within just one hour. This is excellent news for Cantabrians and shows that the Government’s “tough on burglary” policy is really working.

The response times are a "snap shot" taken between 1 June 2000 to 13 June 2000.

These response times are in stark contrast to when the National Party was in Government. Then, burglary crime was considered a low priority. It was common for Police to take three to fives days to respond to a burglary.

“This is great news for ordinary New Zealanders who rightfully expect swift action when their homes are invaded by criminals. Burglars now have a lot more to fear, and that’s the way it should be.”

Mr Cosgrove said that another positive result of the “tough on burglary” policy has been a marked drop in the number of burglaries reported to Police. The Insurance Council has also publicly stated that current policing of burglary is having an effect on reducing reported burglary rates.
