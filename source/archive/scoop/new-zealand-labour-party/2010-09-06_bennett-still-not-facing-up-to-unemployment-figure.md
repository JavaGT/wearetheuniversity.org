Bennett still not facing up to unemployment figure
==================================================

**Monday, 6 September 2010, 2:32 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

**Bennett still not facing up to unemployment figures**  
Minister of Social Development and Employment Paula Bennett has today released a statement, on New Zealanders ability to find work, a statement which can only be described as deliberately misleading, Labour Deputy Leader Annette King says.

“Paula Bennett’s attempt to put a positive spin on increasing benefit figures, claiming thousands of people were finding work is misleading,” Annette King said.

"On closer inspection, the reality is the number of people receiving the unemployment benefit actually rose by over 850 people last month.

“The unemployment rate is rising, but rather than face that the Minister has taken the approach of attempting to put a positive public spin on it or is simply in denial.

“For quite sometime Labour has been concerned that the Minister is withholding and delaying benefit statistics. Today is another example of Ms Bennett attempting to manipulate information.

“However, it is clear the Minister has attempted to release a totally misleading statement.  
“Ms Bennett should be focussed on helping the people of Canterbury rather than attempting to spin unemployment numbers,” Annette King said.
