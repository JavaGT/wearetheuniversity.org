Labour leadership candidates in Napier
======================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

**Labour leadership candidates in Napier**

The four candidates for Labour Leader – Andrew Little, Nanaia Mahuta, David Parker and Grant Robertson - will be in Napier on Monday evening for a Husting meeting with members; one of fourteen ‘Meet the Candidates’ Meetings being held nationwide as a key part of the process to select a new Leader. The meeting will begin at 7.30pm at Pukemokimoki Marae, in Maraenui.  
The Electoral College for the Labour Leader comprises three sections – Party members (all of whom have a vote, worth 40% of the College), Caucus members (all of whom have a vote, worth 40% of the College) and affiliated unions (with varying voting systems, worth 20% of the College).

The Husting meetings are a chance for voters from all three sections of the Party to meet and question the candidates, and to hear them speak. The meeting will be chaired by Labour Party President Moira Coatsworth and the speeches and question and answer session will be moderated by former Mayor of Napier Barbara Arnott.

The result of the Leadership Election will be announced on November 18th.

Liam Rutherford, Regional Representative on the Labour Party’s New Zealand Council says the election of the Labour Party leader is an important component of Party democracy.

“This is an important opportunity for our members to hear first-hand from candidates what the Party would be like under their leadership, and their vision for the people of New Zealand.

In following this more inclusive process of involving New Zealand Labour Party members in the Leadership election, we have joined the overwhelming majority of major political parties worldwide, including the Australian Labor Party and UK Labour and Conservative Parties”, Liam Rutherford said.

Media can be present during the open session, which will feature a seven-minute speech from each of the candidates, and also at the end of the meeting. The meeting will last no more than two hours. People who are members of the Labour Party and affiliated unions are invited to attend, and need to bring evidence of their membership. Members of the public can join the Labour Party at the meeting and attend.

Labour’s Napier MP Stuart Nash and Labour’s Ikaroa-Rāwhiti MP Meka Whaitiri will both also be attending the event.
