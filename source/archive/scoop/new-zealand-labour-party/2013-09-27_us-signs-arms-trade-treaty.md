US signs Arms Trade Treaty
==========================

Ross  
ROBERTSON  
Associate Spokesperson for Disarmament  
(Small Arms and Light Weapons)

27 September 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**US signs Arms Trade Treaty**

The signing of a landmark arms trade treaty by 111 UN member states, including the United States, has been welcomed by Labour’s Associate Spokesperson for Disarmament and Arms Control and Parliamentarians for Global Action (PGA) President, Ross Robertson.

“I am very pleased that New Zealand has played a leading role in support of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).

“The fact that more than 100 UN Member States have signed the ATT and seven have ratified it in less than 15 weeks since it was opened for signature is an extraordinary accomplishment.

“However, this is not a time for complacency. With thousands of men, women and children around the world continuing to die or be seriously injured every day on account of the inadequate regulation of the international arms trade, it is important that all UN Member States, including New Zealand, take steps to ratify the ATT as soon as possible.

“To this end I call on the New Zealand government to bring ratification legislation to Parliament so we can continue to be a world leader for international law, human rights, peace and democracy.

“New Zealand’s signing is a strong message of support, and now that Samoa has also signed PGA calls on other Pacific states to follow suit.

“Implementation of the ATT must, and will, determine its long term successful legacy,” Ross Robertson said.
