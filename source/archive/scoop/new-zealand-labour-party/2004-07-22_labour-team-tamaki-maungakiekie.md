Labour Team Tamaki-Maungakiekie
===============================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

  
Labour Team Tamaki-Maungakiekie

Labour has announced its four candidates for the Tamaki-Maungakiekie Ward of the Auckland City Council. They are Leila Boyle, Jack Henderson, John Hinchcliff and Richard Northey.

Jack Henderson pointed to Richard Northey’s recent securing of an additional $10,000 for every community board for local community events that would otherwise have been axed, so that Maungakiekie can retain the Onehunga Bay and Oranga Festivals and Tamaki can keep the Panmure Festival.

“This is an appropriate opening for the Labour campaign, which will focus on the real needs of the public. By voting for all four Labour candidates under Richard's leadership, they will see such victories for the community all the time”.

Richard Northey is looking forward to working with a team committed to community-based policies.

“The people of Tamaki-Maungakiekie have never enjoyed the political clout of Hobson or Eastern Bays, but can now elect an experienced, quality team to work on behalf of the whole community, not just big business and the very rich”

The Labour team expected policy to be available shortly and confirmed that Labour has plans for urgent roading improvements, but unlike opposing candidates, does not support the proposed Eastern Highway
