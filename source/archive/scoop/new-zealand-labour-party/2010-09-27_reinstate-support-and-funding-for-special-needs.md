Reinstate support and funding for special needs
===============================================

**Reinstate support and funding for our special needs kids**

  
Funding for occupational and physical therapists working in schools should be reinstated immediately so that disabled kiwi kids receive the help they need and deserve, Labour Spokesperson for Disability Issues Lynne Pillay said today.

"In Budget 2009 the National government cut funding for school based therapists working in 23 schools throughout New Zealand.

"Following public outcry the government then decided to phase out the funding, retaining it for existing students at their current schools but cutting it for all new students.

"The phasing out of the funding does not fix the problem; and puts pressure on teachers, support staff and schools and means that children with severe physical disabilities are not able to reach their full potential." said Labour Spokesperson for Special Education Grant Robertson.

"A petition calling for reinstatement of the funding signed by nearly 1500 people was reported back to Parliament on 15 September 2010.

Labour and Green select committee members called for additional therapy funding to remain in place until such a time as future funding arrangements are confirmed.

"The Review of Special Education is in nowhere land at the moment," said Grant Robertson.

"Heather Roy has been removed as the Minister responsible for the Review and Rodney Hide is far too preoccupied with the disarray in the Act Party to spend any time on this important issue. Meanwhile our kids are losing out.

"We are only talking about $2.5 million; the government should admit its mistake, apologise and reinstate the funding immediately, said Grant Robertson.
