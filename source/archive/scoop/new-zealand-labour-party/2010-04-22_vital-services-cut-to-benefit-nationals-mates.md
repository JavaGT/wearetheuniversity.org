Vital services cut to benefit National’s mates

National seems set on slashing more vital public services to fund tax cuts for its rich mates, says Labour Finance spokesperson David Cunliffe.

“Finance Minister Bill English said today that National would re-direct another $1.8 billion of lower quality government spending over the next four years, but he doesn’t make any attempt to define what he means by lower quality spending,” David Cunliffe said.

“New Zealanders should be very worried. On past experience what he means by lower quality spending is savage cuts to training incentive allowances to help women get off the DPB, and more than a $100 million of cuts to the Pathways to Partnership programme which has enabled NGOs to provide community-based services.

“National’s definition of lower quality services has had a devastating impact on adult community education classes, and the quality of life of thousands of New Zealanders.

“In Mr English’s own electorate, thousands of elderly people are having the home support they rely on cut so that rich earners like Mr English can pocket an extra $300 a week. The elderly in his electorate apparently represent low value in terms of services,” David Cunliffe said.

“So do the seriously ill and dying in Manawatu. Services to them are apparently of lower quality, according to National.

“So are front-line bio-security jobs that protect agriculture and our economy.

“So are police cars to get to the scene of crimes, and make our communities safer. So are mental health services in Nelson-Marlborough.

“All these services are apparently of lesser priority than Bill English’s rich mates,” David Cunliffe said.

“It is far more important that these rich mates are looked after than the tens of thousands of Kiwis who depend on frontline services being maintained.

“These Kiwis know what frontline means. Bill English describes such services as lower quality.”
