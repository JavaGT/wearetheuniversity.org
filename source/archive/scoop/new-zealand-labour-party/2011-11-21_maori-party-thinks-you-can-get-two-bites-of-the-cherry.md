Maori Party thinks you can get two bites of the cherry

The Maori Party are scrambling their message on asset sales, says Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta.

"On the one hand they are saying ‘no’, on the other hand they are saying 'yes' if iwi want it! They need to make their minds up what they stand for," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"Selling the country's SOEs when there is no guarantee that our major assets will remain in kiwi ownership is hugely unpopular amongst Maori and pakeha," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"At this election every Maori voter will get a chance to say what they want. If they want to keep Our state assets then party vote Labour!" said Nanaia Mahuta.

"Many Maori know that iwi don't have the capacity individually or as a collective to purchase a major shareholding of all the assets proposed for sale. In addition to that not one iwi has sought a mandate from their tribal members to commit their tribes resources for such a significant investment," said Nanaia Mahuta.

"The Maori party are saying its ok to sell the family house and rent it back to the kids - it doesn't make any sense and they need to stop doing the dirty work for National.

“Just be straight up - once assets are sold that's it, you don't get two bites at the cherry," said Nanaia Mahuta
