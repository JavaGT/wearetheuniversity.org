Minister overstepping mark in pay negotiations

State Services Minister Tony Ryall has been caught meddling in the negotiation of employment agreements at Polytechnics, well outside the legislated process, Labour State Services spokesperson Grant Robertson said today.

“Last week Tony Ryall and Tertiary Education Minister Anne Tolley summoned the Council Chairs and Chief Executives of three Polytechnics to Wellington to get a dressing down about the pay negotiations they had under way or had recently completed,” Grant Robertson said.

“This is completely outside the process for negotiating employment agreements at tertiary institutions laid down in the State Sector Act.

“The State Services Commission has a consultative role in the process, but institutions have autonomy to finalise agreements. The idea that the Minister would become involved is well outside the legislated process.

“The Tertiary Education Union has raised concerns that the State Services Commission has stepped outside its legislative brief as well by intervening in a number of negotiations well beyond their consultative role."

Grant Robertson says the Minister appears to be making the matter far worse by intervening at a political level.

“This is a serious issue. The government does not have a direct role in employment negotiations in tertiary institutions,” Grant Robertson said.

“The Chief Executive is the employer of the staff, and they will make the decision in consultation with the SSC. The Minister is riding roughshod over this process.

“I understand the Minister’s concern is that agreements with a 2 or 3% pay increase at Polytechnics go against his desire for a pay freeze in the state sector.

“When he announced his expectations for state sector pay in February the Minister wasn’t prepared to admit he was seeking a pay freeze. It’s clear now by his unprecedented intervention that this is exactly what he was after.

“The Minister needs to respect the law and process as it is laid down, and leave Polytechnic Chief Executives to do their job.” Grant Robertson said.
