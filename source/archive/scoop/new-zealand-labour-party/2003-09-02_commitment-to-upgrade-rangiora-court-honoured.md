Commitment to upgrade Rangiora Court honoured

Member of Parliament for Waimakariri, Clayton Cosgrove, is pleased to announce that upgrading of the Rangiora Courthouse is set to start.

Mr Cosgrove has received written advice from the Minister for Courts, Hon. Rick Barker, that a contract has just been let to Simon Developments Ltd to undertake the renovations.

The Rangiora District Courthouse escaped closure in early 2002, when the Department for Courts proposed centralising all services to Christchurch. Clayton Cosgrove, along with many of the community’s stakeholders, was bitterly opposed to the suggested closure, and after that message got through to the then Minister, Matt Robson, the Department’s proposal was rejected and the Court was saved.

At that time Mr Cosgrove also sought and received a commitment that there would be an upgrade of the facility. That request is now ready to be carried out, at a cost of around $200,000.

Upgrading work will include:

\- an addition to provide cells, a sallyport for the secure loading and unloading of prisoners and a secure interview facility for solicitors interviewing their clients in custody;  
\- facilities for the disabled; and  
\- general refurbishment of the premises.

It is expected it will take approximately ten weeks to complete the project.

Mr Cosgrove is advised that the Department is completing a small number of administrative details and that commencement for the upgrade works will begin very soon.

Mr Cosgrove says the commencement of this project is wonderful news for Rangiora and North Canterbury.

“This entrenches the Court within the community. After spending $200,000 on upgrading the Rangiora District Court, there will be zero tolerance if any bureaucrat in the future had a rush of blood to the head and again tried to propose that our court ever be downgraded. Spending this money on the court cements its place in our community for the future.”
