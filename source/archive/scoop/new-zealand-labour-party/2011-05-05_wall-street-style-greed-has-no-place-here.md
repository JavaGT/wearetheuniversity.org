Wall Street-style greed has no place here

**Wall Street-style greed has no place here**

Labour’s Energy spokesperson David Parker says he hopes the Electricity Authority will today reverse the unprecedented overcharging by Genesis Energy for electricity on 26 March this year.

“The Authority’s due to deliver its judgment today,” David Parker said.

“On 26 March Genesis inflated its normal charges from $70 to $80 per MWh to $19,000 per MWh, charging buyers of its electricity $57 million instead of $250,000 over a mere seven-hour period!

“This latest overcharge by Genesis, which is chaired by former National PM Jenny Shipley, should be reversed and be called what it was --- uncompetitive and greedy,” David Parker said.

“The extra $57 million was charged to New Zealand businesses like the Chelsea Sugar refinery and to retailers like Power Shop who try to deliver lower prices to residential consumers. This undermines jobs and increases the cost of living.

“Genesis took advantage of its market power to gouge consumers, at a time when businesses and consumers alike are feeling the pinch of a flat economy,” David Parker said.  
“The excessive prices are yet more evidence of how consumers are overcharged for electricity, and it happened because the lack of an effective competitive electricity market means they can do just that.

“The Commerce Commission report (22 May 2009), based on an in-depth study by Professor Frank Wolak of Stanford University, a world authority, found NZ$4.8 billion of overcharging by electricity companies, equivalent to 18 per cent overcharging,” David Parker said. “Since then prices have increased further.

“The Government has allowed that overcharging to continue, probably because it wants to maximise the price it would get for the sale of shares in Genesis if it is re-elected.

“This type of Wall Street greed should have no place in New Zealand,” David Parker said.
