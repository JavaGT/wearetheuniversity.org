TWYFORD

Housing Spokesperson

14 May 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Building bedrooms not enough**  

Today’s move by the Government to act on overcrowded state houses is a drop in the bucket when hundreds of thousands of families are living in crowded private sector rentals thanks to a lack of affordable housing, says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.

“There is a direct correlation between our unaffordable housing market and the overcrowding many of our families are forced to bear.

“Today’s announcement may offer families in state houses some relief, but gives those in the private rental market little hope.

“That is why Labour has announced KiwiBuild – a bold, bricks and mortar solution that will give Kiwis a fair go.

“Too many of our kids are dying from preventable diseases because of cramped conditions. That is why Labour is pushing a healthy home guarantee alongside KiwiBuild to ensure all rental properties in New Zealand are warm and dry.

“Only a Government-backed building programme can be sure to deliver affordable homes and reduce the pressure families’ face.

“Today’s announcement promises to deal with overcrowded state houses. National is going to need a more comprehensive strategy if it is to really deal with our housing woes,” Phil Twyford said.
