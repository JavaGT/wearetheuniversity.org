New Zealand going backwards on gender issues

Media Statement

New Zealand going backwards on gender issues  

New Zealand is heading towards international humiliation on the issue of gender equality, Labour Women’s Affairs spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“Under Labour, New Zealand made significant and consistent progress on women's issues. Where we fell short we continued to challenge ourselves to address equity issues by developing the action plan for women which is also under threat from this Government."

"I am proud of New Zealand's record to date on addressing gender inequality and am alarmed that it has taken National just six months to unwind this progress and New Zealand’s reputation.

“No matter how hard Kate Wilkinson tries to spin the discussion in Geneva next month on gender equality, it will be clear to everyone that her Government is going backwards on this issue.

Sue Moroney is the author of a petition circulating at present calling on the Government to develop and implement a strategy to eliminate the gender pay gap.

Her petition was prompted by National's scrapping of pay equity investigations for school support staff and social workers early this year.

It has gathered several thousand signatures and is available by following the attached link : [http://blog.labour.org.nz/index.php/page/3/](http://blog.labour.org.nz/index.php/page/3/)
