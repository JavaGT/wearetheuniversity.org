**Government delivers half a tobacco control policy**

Labour is calling on the National Government to reinstate the $12 million it stripped from smoking cessation programmes if it is serious about tobacco control, Associate Health spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway says.

“Labour supports the Government agreeing to remove point of sale advertising of tobacco. In fact we have been asking the Government to do just that for nearly two years.

“We are delighted that National has adopted this policy.

“However, Tariana Turia’s announcement fails to mention smoking cessation services. If you want people to give up smoking you have to provide the services to enable them to do it.

“National in agreement with Labour raised tobacco excise taxes, which delivered the Government $200 million in taxes. So there is absolutely no financial reasons for them not to fund smoking cessation programmes.

“They have the money for smoking cessation so why have they cut funding in this area.

“Five thousand kiwis die of smoking related diseases each year, and while we support initiatives like banning point of sale advertising and raising excise tax, we also want to see smoking cessation made a priority,” Iain Lees-Galloway said.
