Collins undermines Key’s promise

**Something stinks as Collins undermines Key’s promise of higher standards**

  
Police Minister Judith Collins continues to undermine Prime Minister John Key’s already-tarnished claim that his government would insist on higher standards and accountability, says Labour Law and Order spokesperson Clayton Cosgrove.

“Judith Collins should have Police Commissioner Howard Broad in her office today asking him for assurances about the appointment of Detective Inspector Dave Archibald to head the Police College’s investigation and intelligence school,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

Clayton Cosgrove said the appointment raised serious questions after a 2006 reprimand for then Senior Sergeant Archibald for inappropriately accessing the computer system known as National Intelligence Application during the trial of ex-police officers Brad Shipton and Bob Schollum and two others for a pack rape.

“Judith Collins should be eyeballing Howard Broad, and asking him to tell her hand on heart that he is absolutely sure this officer did not also inappropriately pass on information that former colleague and private investigator John Birmingham hoped might help Shipton’s defence,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“She can’t demand that the appointment is rescinded, but if Commissioner Broad can’t provide the assurance, she should be suggesting in the strongest terms that the appointment be reconsidered.

“Judith Collins disappears without trace and dodges any accountability when the hard issues come up. She did the same thing when Whakatane police assaulted a man in a cell; and there was absolutely no leadership whatsoever from her when it was revealed a police superintendent refused to give a breath test after allegedly driving drunk,” Clayton Cosgrove said

“Her refusal to speak out lets down all the good police who are tarnished by association when colleagues transgress against the fine name of NZ Police.

  
“John Key has just been telling the Sensible Sentencing Trust annual victims’ conference that he’s on the side of victims, but his Government has rejected compensation for the women who alleged sexual misconduct by police.

“And now, in a second blow to these victims, his Police Minister is saying nothing as a police officer whio inappropriately accessed information during one of those sex trials is given a senior job training police recruits. If this is what John Key’s higher standards and greater accountability are all about, something stinks.”
