**Labour farewells Dame Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan**

The Labour Party is deeply saddened by the death of Dame Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan, says Labour’s spokesperson for Māori Affiars Parekura Horomia.

“Dame Whetu was one of our own. She was an articulate, principled Māori leader and a strong supporter of Māori development. She will be sorely missed.

“Dame Whetu served Southern Maori for 29 years with strength, mana and commitment.

“She was a pioneer in her own right and a strong supporter of Māori Women’s development. Dame Whetu broke through barriers not just in Maoridom but overall.

“She was a woman of firsts, leading the way in education ----where she championed the teaching of te reo and New Zealand history--- welfare reform, and bridging the gap between Māori and European communities.

“Most importantly she was a role model for women, particularly through her involvement at Victoria University at a time when few women rose to public and political prominence.

“She will be remembered by Labour and Southern Māori as a woman who picked her battles, and won,” Parekura Horomia said.
