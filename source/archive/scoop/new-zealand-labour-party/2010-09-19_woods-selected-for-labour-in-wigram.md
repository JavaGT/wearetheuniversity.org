**Woods Selected For Labour In Wigram**

19 September 2010

Megan Woods was today confirmed as the Labour candidate for Wigram to contest the 2011 General Election.

“It is an honour to be selected on Women’s Suffrage Day: a day we acknowledge and honour the fight for women's political rights,” Megan Woods said.

With Jim Anderton announcing that he will retire from Parliament if he wins the Christchurch Mayoral election Wigram is a seat Labour has identified to win.

Winning the Wigram seat is going to be tough and Labour isn't taking a win for granted.

"We'll go out and listen, acknowledge and reflect their concerns and fight on their behalf about the things they're worried about," Megan Woods said.

"I grew up in Wigram, and I chose to make my life here. Growing up here in the 1980s, I watched people lose their jobs. I saw workplaces like the Addington Workshops shut their doors forever. Now I am 36 years old and am watching jobs disappear from our communities again. Factories are closing, businesses are struggling and once again families are facing uncertain futures. I want to be a Member of Parliament so I can ensure the Sixth Labour Government has the creation of well-paid jobs in our economy high on the agenda," Megan Woods said.

"With GST going up, everything from food and clothing to petrol and power will be more expensive putting more pressure on families in Wigram. I want to see people in our electorate paid a decent wage for a day’s work," Megan Woods said.
