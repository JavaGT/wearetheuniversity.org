**Poto Williams selected as Labour’s Christchurch East Candidate**  
   
Labour Party President Moira Coatsworth has announced that Poto Williams will be the candidate for the Christchurch East by election following the resignation of Lianne Dalziel.  We had a robust democratic selection process with hundreds of local people in a packed rugby club hall in the heart of the electorate, where a very strong field of candidates discussed local issues.  
   
Moira Coatsworth said "We said the Christchurch East electorate needs an MP who understands what people have been through, and our process has given us a very strong candidate to make things happen for local people. She comes from a community background  and will advocate strongly for the people of Christchurch dealing with insurance companies, EQC, housing shortages, new schools, and a range of other issues.  The campaign will now be in full swing as we continue talking to the Christchurch East Community to ensure we're representing their views."  
   
Poto is committed to rebuilding for the long road ahead, and working alongside the people of Christchurch East.  "I encourage people to take interest in the by election to make sure our needs and priorities  are heard and understood.  Christchurch East is a fantastic area and I look forward to the coming weeks and a campaign where I can meet and talk to more people about how we can best take take the views of the electorate to Wellington to get things done. I am working in the rebuild effort in New Brighton and have worked on local housing for families and connecting the grass roots with the democratic process."  
   
The Labour Party’s process for selecting its new candidate was transparent and democratic, following on from the open and engaging process used for selecting its new Leader.  All local Party members had a vote in the process.
