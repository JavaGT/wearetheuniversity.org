Tolley’s shifting sands approach to ACE cuts

  
Anne Tolley appears to be peddling different stories to different audiences over who is responsible for the ACE funding cuts and she needs to explain what’s going on, says Labour Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.

“Last month Anne Tolley told Maryke Fordyce, the president of the Community Learning Association through schools, that the decision to slash ACE funding was beyond her responsibility and was ‘now in the hands of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.’

“That has been widely reported and coupled with comments by John Key to principals, created an impression that the Government might yet be considering reversing its decision,” Maryan Street said.

“But in an interview with the Herald today Anne Tolley is reported to have ‘dismissed earlier claims that the matter was now in the Prime Minister’s hands. She said she was accountable for the cuts.’

“It seems like Anne Tolley has caught John Key’s habit of telling one thing to one audience and something quite different to another.

“That doesn’t mean the Prime Minister wants to take responsibility for the cuts either of course, which is probably why he’s told his minister to front up and stop passing the buck.

“Whatever Anne Tolley is up to – it doesn’t look good. She’s avoided community meetings on the issue like the plague, despite thousands turning up to them.

“She’s tried to duck responsibility for the cuts and appeared to leave open the possibility of Prime Ministerial intervention. Now she appears to have closed that door again,” Maryan Street said.

“It’s time to front up and tell the public once and for all whether John Key is re-examining the issue and whether the Government is considering reversing the funding cuts or not.

“Thousands of New Zealanders are expected to take to the streets this Saturday, as part of ongoing protests over the issue. The least the minister can do is to be clear about what’s actually going on,” Maryan Street said.
