Labour celebrates Winnie Laban

Labour Leader Phil Goff today joined with his colleagues to celebrate the career of Luamanuvao Winnie Laban and wish her well for her future at Victoria University,

"Winnie has dedicated her life to promoting Pasifika people and her position at Victoria University will enable her to continue this work," Phil Goff said.

"Winnie has poured her heart into working for the Mana electorate and I know she will put the same energy, commitment and passion into helping Pasifika students at Victoria University.

"Winnie's new role will see her concentrating on lifting the achievement and aspiration of Pasifika students, something that Labour fully supports."

Phil Goff today also announced that Su'a William Sio would take over as Labour's Pacific Island Affairs and Interfaith spokesperson.

"I know William will bring with him the same passion and commitment that Winnie brought to the roles.

"Winnie has been a fantastic role model, and when elected to Parliament in 1999 was the first female Pacific MP and while in Government achieved the position of Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, a position I know she loved.

"Her contribution to caucus will be missed. But I know her colleagues here in Parliament look forward to seeing her succeed in the same way she did here," Phil Goff said.
