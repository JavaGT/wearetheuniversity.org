**PM misleads Aucklanders on Unitary Plan**

The Prime Minister is deliberately misleading Aucklanders in an attempt to cover up for his government’s total failure to deliver more affordable housing says Labour’s Housing spokesperson Phil Twyford.

“The Prime Minister is running around claiming the council only wants to build apartments and wants to cut people out from consultation on the Unitary Plan.

“This is just plain wrong.

“Auckland Council is going through a massive amount of consultation on the Unitary Plan. Right now thousands of Aucklanders are having their say on the draft plan and once it is notified, they can do it all again with the government-appointed Board of Inquiry.

“Ironically it’s the Government’s plans to legislate for the wholesale uncontrolled release of land and take control of resource consent applications that would reduce the ability for local people to have a say over how their community develops.

“The threat to force unplanned sprawl will simply lead to more congestion on our already clogged motorways.

“Mr Key needs to listen to groups like the Employers and Manufactures Association who say the Auckland Council approach is the way to go. Businesses want certainty, not the ham-fisted power grab the Beehive his trying to pull on Auckland.

“Labour supports Auckland Council’s balanced approach to accommodating the region’s housing growth. That means quality intensive redevelopment within Auckland’s current footprint alongside 30-40 per cent of new housing in greenfields sites. Claiming the council only wants high-rise buildings is highly misleading.

“John Key is trying to point the finger and shift blame from his government’s appalling record on housing. Labour’s policy is to pick up a hammer and get to work delivering 100,000 new affordable homes in the next decade.

“The biggest roadblock to delivering more affordable housing is the government. Kiwis deserve better,” Phil Twyford said.
