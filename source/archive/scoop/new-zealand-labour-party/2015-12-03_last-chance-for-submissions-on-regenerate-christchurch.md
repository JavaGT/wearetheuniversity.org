Last chance for public submissions on Regenerate Christchurch

Today is the last chance for Cantabrians to express their concern about the Government’s plan for a new agency to run the Canterbury recovery, says Labour’s acting Canterbury spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“The Government is proposing vast and unchecked powers that will continue for another five years. It’s absolutely vital that local people have their say and make their voices heard.

“Under this Government, the Canterbury recovery has been too slow and too messy. The convention centre debacle, the disaster with EQC, and the glacial pace of the inner city rebuild show us that a recovery driven by the Minister is not working.

“We only get one chance to rebuild our city. It’s vital we get it right.

“Local people should be speaking out and demanding more of a say in the future of their city, and more checks on ministerial power.

“People wishing to make a submission can do so on the [Parliament website](http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/sc/make-submission/51SCLGE_SCF_00DBHOH_BILL66263_1/greater-christchurch-regeneration-bill),” says Ruth Dyson.
