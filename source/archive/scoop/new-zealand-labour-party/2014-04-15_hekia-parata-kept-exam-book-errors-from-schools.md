Hekia Parata kept exam book errors from schools

Schools will be appalled to learn Education Minister Hekia Parata knew since January that hundreds of exam booklets had been returned to the wrong students but said nothing about it, Labour’s Education Spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.

“Exams are stressful enough for students. Those asking for their booklets are desperately hoping they can improve on their results and obtain certainty. Receiving someone else’s booklets would have added to their stress.

“The Minister has known all year that 455 students were in this position. Yet she chose to keep it under wraps. Perhaps she thought the truth would not come out.

“Hekia Parata should have been upfront about this botch-up.

"When a breach like this occurs, those affected should be told about it. To sweep it under the carpet is unacceptable.

“The Minister should have made a public statement and insisted schools be notified.

“NZQA has compounded their errors by failing to tell the Education and Science Select Committee when it appeared in March.

“It is outrageous NZQA haven't given full disclosure about this.

“This is just the latest mistake from the accident-prone Minister. No wonder parents, teachers and students have lost faith in this Government’s ability to manage the education sector,” Chris Hipkins says.
