Hamilton Airport Facing Unnecessary Costs

**Hamilton International Airport Facing Unnecessary Costs**

  
Customs Minister Maurice Williamson needs to explain why Hamilton International Airport is being lumped with a $450,000 bill to pay for immigration services, Labour’s customs spokesperson Sua William Sio said today.

“The conduct of Customs in this issue leaves a lot to be desired. No other established airport is paying this fee so why is Mr Williamson taking on the people of Hamilton and the people who visit the city?

“Customs seems to be taking advantage of the brief period where Trans-Tasman flights to and from Hamilton ceased to introduce this new charge on the airport.

“I see the Airports CEO is reported as saying it’s a blatant attempt by Customs to increase revenue and I happen to agree with him.

“It doesn’t make sense that an airport in one of our main cities is the only one being charged this fee by Customs.

“Mr Williamson sat back while Bill English stripped nearly $3 million dollars from the Customs in May’s Budget and it seems he is now looking for ways to recover the money.

“It’s likely passengers will pick up the tab through a $4.50 levy and I suggest the people of Hamilton let Maurice Williamson know of their opinions about that.

“The Minister should take the opportunity to explain why he is singling the people of Waikato out and why they should have to pay for immigration officers at their airport when others do not.”
