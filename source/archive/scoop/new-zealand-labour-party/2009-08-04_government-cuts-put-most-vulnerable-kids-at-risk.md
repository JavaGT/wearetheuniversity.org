Government cuts put most vulnerable kids at risk

Government cuts put most vulnerable kids at risk

The National Government’s decision to cut funding for special needs kids in our schools is wrong and must be reversed, Labour Leader Phil Goff said today.

“23 schools catering for children with disabilities such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy have had $2.5 million in funding for therapy cut from their budgets,” Phil Goff said.

“Many of the parents affected I have spoken to say this will have a devastating effect on the child’s learning.”

Phil Goff says he has four schools in his own Mt Roskill electorate that will suffer from the funding cuts.

“The Carlson School for Cerebral Palsy, and Mt Roskill Primary, Intermediate and Grammar Schools have all been told that they will lose a big part of their funding for therapy,” Phil Goff said.

“I have visited all the schools and they tell me that this will put their students at risk.

“Principals and parents have said children will be compromised by this decision. When students do not receive therapy they become unwell and cannot attend school.

“Any New Zealand parent who sees these kids would want the Government to do what it can to help them, not undermine their efforts by cutting support vital to them.

“It’s not only unfair. It directly contradicts Mr Key and Mr English’s pledge that the budget would help protect the most vulnerable in our society.

“At the same time this funding has been cut, the government is pouring $35 million dollars of additional funding into New Zealand’s elite private schools.

“On behalf of the schools, the parents and most particularly the children, I urge the Government to reconsider this decision.

“For $2.5 million in savings the Government will make, it undermines the ability of the children to be at school and to learn, and imposes big costs on the children and their families,” Phil Goff said.
