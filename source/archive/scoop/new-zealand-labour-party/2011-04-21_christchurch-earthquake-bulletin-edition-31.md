**Christchurch Earthquake bulletin edition 31**

The Labour Party’s Christchurch electorate MPs, **Clayton Cosgrove (Waimakariri), Ruth Dyson (Port Hills), Lianne Dalziel (Christchurch East) and Brendon Burns (Christchurch Central)** have started a regular bulletin to keep people in their electorates and media informed about what is happening at grass roots level.

**CLAYTON COSGROVE:** Much of the concern of earthquake-affected residents is still centred on the performance --- or lack of performance --- of private insurance companies. I attended a residents’ meeting in Kaiapoi last night at which this was the main angst expressed. Most of the complaints focused on the perceived lack of customer service, with calls to insurance companies often not being returned. More seriously, however, some people reported that they had been told by companies that if they didn’t sign off on a claim, they would hold up other people in the neighbourhood cluster. This is an appalling situation. People who are already suffering stress should not be steam-rollered in this way. My over-riding fear is that when claimants and companies can’t do a deal, progress on recovery will be stalled. Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee should use the power of his office to call in the chief executives of the insurance companies and the Insurance Council (which has been relatively silent) and demand that they get on with it. People are losing confidence in the insurance companies, and are becoming increasingly reluctant to complete their claims because they are afraid, fairly or unfairly, of being done over. I have asked Gerry Brownlee to set up some sort of facilitation service where people can get independent advice on their claims. Independent advice would allow claimants to have more confidence that their claim is being treated fairly. They would no longer think it was them against the big corporate. Unfortunately, Gerry Brownlee has consistently rejected my approach. His solution is to hand over issues to the Insurance Ombudsman, but the ombudsman doesn’t have the time or resources to do the job efficiently. Gerry Brownlee can’t turn his back on this issue. It is too big and important to simply fob distressed residents off.

**BRENDON BURNS:** It is worth sharing more detail on progress on the home heating issue, because it is still a major concern as Christchurch Labour MPs know from what our constituents are telling us. It is welcome news, as reported yesterday, that 4500 priority homes will have new heaters before the middle of next month. But it is significant that this figure is the same one as the number on the so-called ‘priority’ list that emerged after the September quake had brought down 20,000-plus chimneys. February 22 brought down a whole lot more and the priority list hasn’t increased. Why’s that? Fletchers announced yesterday that it has ‘closed’ 10,000 chimney claims to date, with 4500 priority cases to be installed by mid-May, another 700 who might be sorted by the end of May, 3500 who’ve opted out and 1500 not contactable. That totals around 10,000. When I questioned Fletchers further, however, the company acknowledged actually there are 22,000 people who’ve made contact asking about a new heater - and only 10,000 have been processed. Of course, this does not mean 12,000 more people necessarily need a heater --- some will have applied twice, some will have given up and sorted themselves, and some will have moved out ---- but it’s as plain as frost on a sub-zero morning that some thousands of Cantabrians are going to be heading into winter without proper heating. That makes it even more important that the Government sorts out the related issue of some form of assistance with power bills for those on low to modest incomes trying to stay warm, often in cracked, damaged homes. But the prospects are less and less bright there as well. Gerry Brownlee says he hasn’t had time to look at the issue John Key contradicts this by saying the cabinet has looked at it, but isn’t convinced such assistance would be well targeted. So who’s telling the truth? Or is Mr Brownlee simply not up with the play on what’s happening in his own portfolio?  
**RUTH DYSON:** This morning I have been in Lyttelton watching the last of the demolition of the Volcano Café and Lava Bar. I am here to ensure that the heritage agreements are being followed, with pieces of the buildings saved for heritage purposes. It is nice to think that perhaps parts of these iconic buildings will in some way inform the future face of Lyttelton. I think it comes as a great comfort for people to know that reuse and recycling is on the demolition agenda. Re the reports that a Nelson rest home housing many displaced elderly Cantabrians is closing its doors, the displacement of these people a second time is concerning, and unsettling for everyone involved. I am pleased that my initiative to link family to their relatives in rest homes around the country is picking up speed. We have now established lists of where many people are placed which has helped ensure these often isolated elderly people get the visitors and support they need. Anzac Day on Monday will be particularly emotional this year. I will attend several services but with the cenotaphs at both Healthcote and Sumner badly damaged it will serve as a graphic reminder of the recent devastation. The council has tried to repair areas as best they can, but for example the tradition of meeting before and after the Sumner service at the Sumner RSA won’t be able to go ahead, with the building badly damaged and the local community centre also closed. I think the fact that services are going ahead shows an enormous amount of community spirit and respect. There are some causes that really require a show of resilience and gratitude and Anzac Day is one of those.

**LIANNE DALZIEL:** I have been following up on the Kate Sheppard issue behind the scenes. I have met with someone from the Office of the Retirement Commissioner; and I have spoken to the statutory supervisor as well as the owner. I believe that there are some questions that require clear answers, but not all of the answers are known yet. One of the issues that no one seems to have appreciated is the question as to whether the land can be remediated and rebuilt on. I don’t know if the land has dropped as well as the buildings (over 700mm in some parts as I understand). This will have implications for what is paid out; and what will be paid by EQC vs insurance. It seems to me that this needs to be known before rebuild decisions are made (same site/new site or not at all) and that means it isn’t clear whether the insurance will be replacement or indemnity. Given that EQC only covers residential property and not commercial property, I don’t know that it is as straightforward as people think. I have recommended that the statutory supervisor develop a very clear set of Frequently Asked Questions and that should include some timeframes. This is a very distressing time for everyone, exacerbated by the uncertainty that hangs over these areas of land. Kate Sheppard was an important facility in the heart of my electorate and the damage that has occurred has been heart-breaking for everyone. I have also been following up about the need for health issues to be addressed in the eastern suburbs as we head into winter. I totally support the comments made by DHB member Andrew Dickerson in the Press and on RNZ’s nine to noon today. I have asked other DHB members to take up the case for the DHB meeting the cost of doctor’s visits for the eastern suburbs so they are free to all age groups. This will ensure that cost is not a barrier to visiting the doctor, which will be important to keep the pressure off stretched secondary services and help keep people well over the coming months.
