Kelvin  
DAVIS  
Associate Education Spokesperson

  
18 November 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT  

### Class closure simply spiteful

Education Minister Anne Tolley's decision to close down a highly successful programme for Maori students at Moerewa School in Northland is an act of spite because the Principal Keri Milne-Ihimaera is a vocal critic of National Standards, says Labour's Associate Education Spokesperson Kelvin Davis.

“Her decision has nothing to do with Maori achievement, nothing to do with a Maori community's aspiration for its children, but everything to do with a spiteful Minister. It's become personal.

“There is no other excuse for such a decision and it should be reversed immediately,” says Kelvin Davis.

“When the Minister is prepared to put her pride before children’s' learning, we know the education system is in trouble.”
