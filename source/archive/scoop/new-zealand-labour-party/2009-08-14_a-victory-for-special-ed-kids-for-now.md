A victory for Special Ed kids, for now

The Government’s back down on cutting therapy funding for special needs kids is a victory for the students, their families and the staff that care for them. But it is wrong that they intend to deprive children with the same conditions of this help in the future, Labour Leader Phil Goff said today.

“These kids with disabilities such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy currently at school will now have certainty around what other Kiwi children take for granted, learning in the classroom, “ Phil Goff said.

“The parents and staff need to be commended for standing up to Education Minister Anne Tolley for her and her Government’s heartless decision to cut $2.5 million worth of funding.

“The decision was wrong when she made it, and after months of pressure Anne Tolley has finally realised that and reversed it.

Phil Goff says the back down will mean special needs kids at 23 schools around New Zealand will be able to continue their current level of therapy which assists their learning in the classroom.

“It’s a victory for the students and their parents who face huge challenges and need all the help they can get to give their kids the best quality of life possible and keep them in the classroom,” Phil Goff said.

“We campaigned on behalf of the children, their parents, teachers and therapists because it was wrong that the most vulnerable and disadvantaged kids should have been the target of the Government’s funding cuts.

“The Government is only committing to keep funding for students currently receiving assistance and will be phased out over time. We will keep pushing hard on this issue to ensure all special needs kids receive the level of therapy they need for as long as they need it.

“While I welcome the back down, the Minister should think long and hard about the anguish she has put the students and parents through.

“We have won the first and most important battle to keep funding for children who already need it, but the campaign will go on.

“Anne Tolley has faced the reality that she got it wrong on special needs funding. Our next priority is to get her to reverse the savage cuts to Adult Community Education,” Phil Goff said.

ENDS
