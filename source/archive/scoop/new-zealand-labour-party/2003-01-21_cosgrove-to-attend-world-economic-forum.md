"I am looking forward to once again attending the Forum’s Annual Meeting. It is a great honour and gives me the opportunity to interact with and learn from some of the world’s great political leaders and entrepreneurs and bring back some new and innovative ideas to this country. I also look forward to renewing old friendships and networks with people from around the world who are key supporters of New Zealand and it’s many trading and commercial causes", Mr Cosgrove said.

**Background Information**

Each year members of the World Economic Forum nominate 100 new Global Leaders of Tomorrow (GLTs). Mr Cosgrove was nominated in the class of 2002 and is the first New Zealand politician to be selected. Mr Cosgrove attended last years Annual Meeting in New York and is attending this years Meeting again at the invitation of the Forum.

In line with the Forum’s commitment to building partnerships between business and society to improve the state of the world, the GLT initiative was started in 1993 to provide an informal, efficient framework for an ongoing exchange of opinions on strategic issues of concern to this younger generation of decision-makers.

Active task forces and initiatives that have grown out of the GLT activities range from environmental sustainability, the changing face of healthcare and the future of Europe to the prospects of leadership and service, and the social impact of new technology.

The World Economic Forum ( [http://www.weforum.org](http://www.weforum.org)), based in Geneva, Switzerland, is an independent organisation committed to improving the state of the world. Funded by the contributions of 1,000 of the world's foremost corporations, the Forum acts in the spirit of entrepreneurship in the global public interest to further economic growth and social progress. The Forum serves its members and society by creating partnerships between and among business, political, intellectual and other leaders of society to define, discuss and advance key issues on the global agenda.

Incorporated in 1971 as a foundation, the World Economic Forum is impartial and not-for-profit, and is tied to no political, partisan or national interests. In 1995 the Forum was awarded NGO consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations.

(Note: The trip is being jointly funded by Mr Cosgrove and the World Economic Forum)
