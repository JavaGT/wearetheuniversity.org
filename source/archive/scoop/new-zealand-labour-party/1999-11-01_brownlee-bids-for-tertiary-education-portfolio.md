"National junior whip Gerry Brownlee's display of strength at his party's campaign launch shows he has set his heart on the Tertiary Education portfolio," says Labour senior whip Mark Burton.

"Mr Brownlee's manhandling of hecklers was obviously intended to impress his leader and let Max Bradford know he has competition.

"Mr Brownlee's performance as a bouncer clearly outshone Mr Bradford's attempt to throttle a student. It can only be a matter of time before he asks Mr Bradford to step outside.

"The Otago University Students' Association says it will holding a Student Strangling Competition tomorrow to replace a cancelled forum with Mr Bradford.

"I urge them to cancel it, as there is a risk that Mr Brownlee will show up and inflict serious casualties."
