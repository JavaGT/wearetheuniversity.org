**Local communities critical to Civil Defence**

Labour will focus on empowering New Zealand communities to be resilient in Civil Defence disasters, says Labour’s Civil Defence spokesperson Clare Curran.

Announcing Labour’s Civil Defence policy, she says that Labour will work with schools, voluntary agencies and community groups to make sure they are ready to act effectively as the Student Army did in Christchurch. In the aftermath of the Canterbury earthquakes, volunteer networks emerged to tackle the huge recovery task.

“However there are issues that need to be resolved about the sustainability of these volunteer networks.

“A Labour Government will develop the sustainability of that volunteer base and also the capacity of communities to undertake the response and recovery in a crisis.

“New Zealand needs to be prepared for the next emergency before it happens. Labour will make sure that recovery planning is embedded in our planning and training.

“Nothing is more important than keeping our families and communities safe. Labour will use the heightened awareness after Christchurch to ensure all New Zealand is prepared,” Clare Curran says.
