9 December 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Govt should release CTV report this week**

The Government must urgently release part three of the Canterbury Earthquakes Royal Commission Report which includes a section on the collapse of the CTV building, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson and MP for Christchurch East, Lianne Dalziel.

“The Government has made it clear that it intends to release part three of the report before Christmas - but without an official response.

“It should do this without delay.

“The people who lost family members and friends in the CTV collapse are already coming to a difficult time of year. If there is information available that might give them answers, peace or some closure, it should be released urgently.

“The release of the Royal Commission’s second report last week saw an outpouring of anguish from quake victims’ families, particularly in relation to the Government’s discussion document, released at the same time, which appears to delay dealing with unsafe buildings.

“These families are hanging on the verdict of the Royal Commission. Given the Government has said it will not be officially responding to part three of the report at this time there can be no reason to delay its release,” Lianne Dalziel said.
