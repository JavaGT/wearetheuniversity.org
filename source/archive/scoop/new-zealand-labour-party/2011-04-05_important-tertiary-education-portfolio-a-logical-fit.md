Important tertiary education portfolio a 'logical fit'

Important tertiary education portfolio a 'logical fit'

  
Labour's newly-appointed Tertiary Education spokesperson David Shearer says his new responsibilities are a logical fit with his existing portfolio of research, science and technology.

"Tertiary education is a hugely important area to support so that every Kiwi, regardless of who they are and where they come from, can achieve their full potential and contribute to New Zealand's society and economy," David Shearer said.

"Increasing our skills base and commercialising more technology and innovation from our tertiary sector are crucial to creating Kiwis jobs and lifting Kiwi incomes.

"There's no more important time to do that than now when our economy is mired in recession, and our skills base is neglected and in crisis," David Shearer said.

"New Zealand's incomes are falling behind the rest of the world, and so is our investment in science. The Government has no strategy to deal with either problem."

David Shearer said he was very happy to have been given his new responsibility.

"I relish the opportunity to look at skills training in particular.

"Over the past 18 months I have been talking with and working with universities and other educational institutions and crown research entities, and it's great to be able to advance that work."
