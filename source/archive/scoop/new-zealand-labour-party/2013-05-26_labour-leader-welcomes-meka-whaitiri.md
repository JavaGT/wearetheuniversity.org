Labour Leader

26 May 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Labour Leader welcomes Meka Whaitiri as Ikaroa-Rāwhiti candidate**  
David Shearer has today congratulated Meka Whaitiri on her selection as Labour’s candidate for the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti by-election.

“Meka Whaitiri is an outstanding candidate. She is committed to serving the people of the electorate and continuing the work of Parekura Horomia, who left a huge legacy.

“Today’s selection of a new candidate follows Parekura Horomia’s passing. He served the people of Ikaroa-Rāwhiti as their MP for 14 years. He is missed by us all.

“We don’t take the support of the community for granted. We know we will have to work hard for every vote. And we’re up to the challenge.

“The people of Ikaroa-Rāwhiti are hurting under this Government. They’re working hard and doing everything right but they’re just not getting ahead. Labour will stand up for them, and Meka Whaitiri will campaign hard to earn their trust.

“Unemployment is higher than the national average, more people are surviving on benefits, power prices have gone up and thousands of locals have bought a one-way ticket to Australia.

“Our policies will make a real difference because people are our priority. We won’t sit back like this Government and watch people suffer.

“We’ll create thousands of jobs, bring down power bills, build 100,000 affordable houses, require landlords to make sure all rental properties are warm and dry, put food in schools and give all hard-working Kiwis the opportunities they deserve,” said David Shearer.
