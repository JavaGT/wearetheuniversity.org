National must take real action on innovation

**National must start taking real action on innovation**  
Labour welcomes the Crown Research Institute Taskforce’s report but what it proposes are merely the first steps to getting our CRIs producing the innovations that will deliver social and economic benefits to Kiwis, Labour Research Science and Technology spokesperson David Shearer said today.

“The Government needs to take on board the recommendations of the Crown Research Institute taskforce if it is to make innovation a key element of New Zealand’s economic transformation,” David Shearer said.

“While changing the accountability, funding and governance structures for CRIs will provide greater focus and certainty, National must act to ensure there is increased collaboration with universities and businesses to ensure their innovations become commercial viable.

“The taskforce report does not make enough of increasing links with business but this must be a key part of the strategy if our ideas are to become successes.

“National must also encourage higher levels of private sector investment in R&D. But National’s attitude to date suggests it is not interested in that.”

David Shearer said National has not kept all its election promises on R&D.

“Scrapping the R&D tax credit is the only promise it has followed through on. What happened to the $315 million of direct funding of science and research?” David Shearer said.

“National claimed that funding would be split 50:50 for research at both universities and CRIs. None of that has happened.

“CRIs can lead the way to make innovation a real engine for economic growth.

“The taskforce says New Zealand has a ‘rare opportunity for change’. The challenge now for John Key and Research Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp is to take action.

  
“The taskforce’s recommendations are just the beginning. In May’s budget New Zealand must see National making a serious commitment to innovation.”
