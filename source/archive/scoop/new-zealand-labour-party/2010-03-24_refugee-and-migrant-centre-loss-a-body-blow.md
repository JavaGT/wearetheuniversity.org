**Refugee and Migrant Centre loss a body blow to city**  
  
The looming closure of the Refugee and Migrant Centre is another body blow to Christchurch’s vulnerable, say Christchurch based Labour MPs.

MPs Brendon Burns, Ruth Dyson, Clayton Cosgrove and Lianne Dalziel say the thousands of new residents depend on the centre as a base for services assisting them with immigration, work, training, language and welfare issues.

"This is just too important to see closed. It almost seems as if every week we are seeing threats to another vital cog of the machinery that keeps our city’s wheels turning," say the MPs.

Brendon Burns says his Christchurch Central electorate is home to many essential services and too many of them are being cut, closed or threatened.

"Youth Health 198 is closing next month; now the Refugee and Migrant Centre. I’m learning of cuts to literacy programmes helping troubled youth in our city and other important services such as Floyds Creative Arts have been given temporary reprieves.

"The Government and city council have to realise what these closures and allied threats are doing to our city’s fabric and image,” Brendon Burns said.

Christchurch East MP Lianne Dalziel, who supported the setting up of the Refugee and Migrant Centre in 1997 says there are only so many knocks a community like Christchurch can take.

"The loss of the Refugee and Migrant Centre will have a huge impact on some of the most at-need people in our community. This closure would send a very negative message well beyond the boundaries of Christchurch City."

Lianne Dalziel says the Christchurch Refugee and Migrant Centre was the first established in the country, before there was any specific government funding. The lack of ‘bricks and mortar’ support has been a big part of its on-going financial challenge.

The Labour MPs say there is a need for urgent Government and council intervention to ensure the services of the current Refugee and Migrant Centre can be fully retained even with the winding up of current arrangements. They are seeking urgent meetings with Immigration Minister Jonathan Coleman and Mayor Bob Parker to see what can be done.
