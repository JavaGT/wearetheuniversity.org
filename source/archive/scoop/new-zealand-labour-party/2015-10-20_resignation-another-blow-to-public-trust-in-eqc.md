Canterbury Spokesperson  
20 October 2015 MEDIA STATEMENT

**  
Resignation another blow to public trust in EQC**

The resignation of a senior manager after allegations of nepotism is another blow to people’s trust in EQC and further evidence of the need for an independent inquiry, says Labour’s Canterbury spokesperson Megan Woods.

“Serious allegations at EQC have seen a senior manager responsible for earthquake claims resign.

“This will create even more uncertainty for Cantabrians worried about the standards at EQC.

“Gerry Brownlee continues to insist everything is fine at EQC and there is no need for an inquiry. The resignation of such a senior figure following serious allegations should be a long overdue wakeup call to the Minister.

“Cantabrians deserve to have confidence that EQC is operating above board, and certainty that their claims will be resolved quickly.

“I hope the Minister will take swift action to restore public confidence that claims at EQC are handled well, and this should include an independent inquiry,” says Megan Woods.
