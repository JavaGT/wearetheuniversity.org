**Labour Leader to help serve school breakfast**

Labour Leader Phil Goff will help serve breakfast at Porirua’s Holy Family School tomorrow to highlight concerns about the thousands of children going to school hungry because their families can’t cope with the rising cost of living.

Recent reports have suggested that nearly 40,000 children are being fed each week by school breakfast programmes and the number of families needing help is continuing to rise.

Media are welcome to attend.

**Thursday 4 August**

7.30-8.30am – Holy Family School  
169 Mungavin Ave  
Porirua East
