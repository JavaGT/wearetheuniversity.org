**More than 1,300 schools to face budget cuts**

The latest Ministry of Education figures reveal thousands of schools will face cuts to funding under National’s new operations grant funding model, says Labour's Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins.

“In the budget, National froze operational funding for schools, with new money being channelled through payments for at-risk students. Since then, Hekia Parata has been desperately spinning, promising that no school will be worse off under the new funding system. Today, the reality has been exposed.

“According to new data from the Ministry of Education, 1,376 schools will lose funding under the new system, with 140 schools having their funding cut by more than $5,000.

“The school facing the largest cut is Rangitoto College in Auckland, losing $28,640 for the 2017 year. Special schools will also be hit hard, such as the Blind and Low Vision Education Network NZ, who can expect a cut exceeding $7,000.

"When adjusted for the expected increase in costs over the coming year - such as power bills and learning equipment - the numbers look even worse, with almost two thousands schools set to be worse off, some by as much as $40,000.

“The new funding model continues the erosion of school funding, and will undoubtedly mean increased pressure on parents to pay for more of the cost of their kids’ education. The new funding system is just an elaborate way to dress up a funding cut.

“The truth about education is simple: under National, funding for our schools is being cut and more of the burden is falling on parents,” says Chris Hipkins.
