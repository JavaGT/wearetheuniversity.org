**Media release  
Dame Dorothy Fraser Lecture will celebrate achievements of women in politics**

Tomorrow the sixth annual Dame Dorothy Fraser Lecture will continue the strong tradition of honouring the late Dame Dorothy Fraser by highlighting the achievements of New Zealand women, and remembering their contributions.

Hon. Annette King will deliver a lecture titled _Parliament and Politics: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly._ Annette is a stalwart of New Zealand politics who has more than 30 years of experience in Parliament. She has been Minister of Health, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, and an MP in three different electorates. She will have some fascinating insights and stories to share with the audience, and will continue a strong tradition of speakers which includes renowned historian Professor Barbara Brookes, campaigner Louise Nicholas ONZM, former National Party MP Marilyn Waring, former CTU President Helen Kelly and former Prime Minister Helen Clark.

Dame Dorothy Fraser was the youngest person to join the New Zealand Labour Party and was a well-known community figure who gave so much back to the Dunedin South community. She spent 29 years on the Otago Hospital Board, was a Dunedin City Councillor, an Otago University councillor, Otago High School board of governors member, and chairwoman of Montecillo Trust Board. The Dame Dorothy Fraser Lecture, now in its sixth year, honours her accomplishments and celebrates the achievements of other women.

Annette will be introduced by Hon. Marian Hobbs, former Labour MP.
