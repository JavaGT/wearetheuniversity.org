Christchurch MP speaks on reconstruction
========================================

**Wednesday, 27 April 2011, 5:19 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

**Lianne DALZIEL  
MP for Christchurch East  
27 April 2011**

### Christchurch MP speaks on reconstruction

Lianne Dalziel Labour MP for Christchurch East will speak tonight alongside policy and economic analyst Peter Harris on the reconstruction and rebuild of Christchurch.

Both speakers are hosted by the Wellington based Fabians Society at St John’s Church Hall, Cnr Dixon & Willis Streets starting at 5.30pm.

Lianne is well qualified to speak on reconstruction in her capacity as the MP for Christchurch’s eastern suburbs and a resident of Bexley, one of the suburbs facing an uncertain future in the wake of the second earthquake.

She is a proud Cantabrian – born and bred – and has signed the Pledge to stay and be part of the rebuilding of the city. She made the decision earlier this year not to stand for the Labour Party’s list, because for the first time since MMP was introduced she decided that if she was not re-elected as MP for Christchurch East, she would accept that it was time for her to find a new direction in life.

Peter Harris is a former academic and trade union policy analyst. He was the economic advisor to Finance Minister Michael Cullen during the first three years of the 1999 Labour led coalition.

He will look at options for financing the reconstruction of Christchurch from the perspective of how funding decisions impact on other aspects of government activity, and on the wider economy.

ENDS
