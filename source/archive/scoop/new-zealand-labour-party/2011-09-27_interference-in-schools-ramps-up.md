Interference in schools ramps up

MEDIA STATEMENT

**Interference in schools ramps up**

Despite protestations to the contrary the Government is continuing its stand-over tactics around National Standards, with dozens of schools being forced to include Ministry statements in their charters, Labour’s Education spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“Acting Education Minister Paula Bennett admitted today that 93 schools had received letters directing them to include statements - written by the Ministry of Education about National Standards targets - in their charters.

“Another 400 schools have been forced to make their charters compliant with references to National Standards, although some have managed to get the Ministry off their backs by referring to ‘NZ Curriculum Standards’,” Sue Moroney said.  
“Meanwhile the Ministry is also gearing up to send limited statutory managers into those schools whose charters state they comply only because they were formulated under duress, and has approached a number of individuals to undertake training as LSMs.

“However much the Government punishes schools, the fact remains that at least a quarter of New Zealand’s primary schools – and their communities - are not committed to implementing National Standards and are being forced to do so against their will.

“Schools need to have passionate and committed boards of trustees, principals and teachers to deliver high quality education – not schools that are going through the motions because of a do-as-you-are-told, interfering Government,” Sue Moroney said.

“Labour will not require schools to implement National Standards, but will instead require schools to assess students’ achievement, progress, and next learning steps against the NZ Curriculum, and report this information to parents.”
