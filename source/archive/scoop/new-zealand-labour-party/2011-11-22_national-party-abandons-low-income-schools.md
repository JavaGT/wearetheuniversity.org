National Party abandons low income schools

National's plans to divert funding to schools that are already 'high performing' shows its agenda has nothing to do with lifting under-achievement, says Labour's education spokesperson, Sue Moroney.

"Not content with giving tax cuts that favour high income earners, they now want to use taxpayer money to embellish already well resourced schools. "We need to be making sure every child in New Zealand has the same access to high quality education no matter where they live or what their parent's income is. But National is simply planning to reward a few schools while abandoning those that need extra help.

"It is easier to achieve good academic results in communities where family resources are plentiful than it is in communities where resources are scarce.

"National's proposal will further increase the growing gap between the rich and the poor in New Zealand.

"If funding is linked to the flawed national standards data, then schools will actually be incentivised to embellish their data, rather than report accurate information to parents on their child's achievement.

"The interests of children should be at the heart of any education policy. National clearly believes its political views are more important than educating children," Sue Moroney said.
