Pacific leaders to head critical language fono

### Pacific leaders to head critical language fono

Labour’s Pacific Island Affairs spokesperson, Su’a William Sio is calling all Pasifika and community leaders, educators, churches, organisations, parents, and fanau to come together and discuss the impact the government’s decision to cancel Pasifika Literacy Materials will have on heritage language learners.

“Many Pacific leaders view the Government’s decision as an attack on our children, that it takes away their ability to speak their heritage languages.

“A community meeting has been organised by University researchers Judy McCaffery –McFall and John McCaffery this evening in my electorate of Māngere, and organisers are calling on the government to explain the basis of their decision to cut Tupu and Folauga resources.

“Anne Tolley and this National government do not value bi-lingualism, and there is no evidence whatsoever to support Minister Tolley’s decision. Her refusal to turn up to the Pacific Viewpoint TV discussion in Hunua confirms that Pacific people and their languages are not on this Government’s priority list.

“A petition organised by concerned parents, university researchers, teachers is circulating and gathering signatures calling on this National government to reverse its decision to strip heritage language learners from their resources.

For those interested in participating in tonight’s fono the details are:

  
**Time:** 6pm - 8.30pm, 16 February 2011  
**Venue:** Nga Tapuwae Community Centre  
253 Buckland Rd Mangere
