Ka Mate, Ka Mate

Labour is pleased to support action which will give proper recognition to the now famous Haka 'Ka Mate Ka Mate', said Labour’s Maori Development spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.

“Ngati Toa, in seeking to resolve their historical treaty claim, have also sought to put on the record that it's their famous ancestor Te Rauparaha who wrote the haka.

“The new agreement means that recognition must be given to Te Rauparaha and Ngati Toa and this applies to any form of communication, broadcasting, publication or film.

“I hope that Kiwis see this mechanism as a way to share more of our rich history associated with 'ka mate' whether it's in a Kohanga, at a university, on the sports field or at a beerfest. The Haka is an expression of being proud of our country and our Kiwi heritage.

“I want to thank and commend Ngati Toa for enabling all Kiwis to express the Haka 'Ka Mate' with greater confidence.”
