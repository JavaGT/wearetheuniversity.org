Charter school students funded up to 5x more

**Charter school students funded up to 5x more**

The Government is so desperate to ensure its controversial charter schools are a success, students are being funded at a rate up to five times the average of state school students, Labour’s Education spokesperson Chris Hipkins says.

“State and integrated schools received an average funding per student of about $7000 but charter schools receive funding of up to $40,000 per student. _(See details below)_

“A hand-full of children are being funded at a much greater rate than the bulk of Kiwi kids.

“Education Minister Hekia Parata today failed to justify to Parliament why the Government is creating this inequality.

“Charter schools are deeply unpopular and there is no evidence to show they improve learning.

“Yet the Government is throwing money at them in an attempt to boost their chances of success.

“There is no doubt every state and integrated school in the country could dramatically improve their students’ results if their funding was increased to match that given to charter schools.

“Where is the value for money Minister?

“A Labour government would scrap charter schools, axe National Standards and end this Government’s war on teachers,” Chris Hipkins says.

**Charter Schools receive up to 5 times the funding for state schools**  
• Charter schools are receiving up to $40,000 per student in 2014 compared to average funding of around $7,000 per year for students in state and state integrated schools.  
• Charter schools are guaranteed the same level of funding regardless of the number of students they enrol, unlike state schools who face funding cuts on a quarterly basis if their roll drops.  
• Charter schools are guaranteed annual funding increases based on the CPI and Labour Cost Index, unlike state schools who aren’t guaranteed any annual funding increases.
