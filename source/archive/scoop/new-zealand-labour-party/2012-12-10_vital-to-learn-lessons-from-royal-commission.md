Vital to learn lessons from Royal Commission

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Spokesperson  
10 December 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Vital to learn lessons from Royal Commission**

The findings from the release of the final part of the Royal Commission into the Canterbury Earthquake must be considered quickly, says Labour’s Earthquake Recovery spokesperson Lianne Dalziel.

“I am glad to see the Government has released the final volume of the Royal Commission’s report today. This is an incredibly difficult time for families of those lost in the earthquake and our thoughts are with them.

“The best way to honour those people is to ensure the recommendations are considered and responded to quickly. The public will also be looking for reassurance in the light of the findings of the report.

“The collapse of the CTV building, that took 115 lives, is clearly due to major failures of oversight and regulation.

“The 83 recommendations today must be considered quickly to avoid any repeat of such a tragedy.”
