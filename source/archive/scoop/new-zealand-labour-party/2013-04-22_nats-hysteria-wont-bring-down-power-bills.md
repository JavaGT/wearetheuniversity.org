Nats Hysteria Won’t Bring Down Power Bills
==========================================

Grant  
ROBERTSON

Deputy Leader  
22 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT

**Nats Hysteria Won’t Bring Down Power Bills**

John Key’s response to Labour’s plan to cut Kiwis’ power bills by between $230-$330 a year is a hysterical overreaction from a Government that has no answer to the relentless rise in electricity prices, says Labour’s Deputy Leader Grant Robertson.

“Labour’s plan will bring down power bills. It’s as simple as that. People will be paying between $230 and $330 less a year under a Labour-led Government. All the name-calling, hyperbole and hysteria from John Key can’t hide the fact that under National prices will continue to rise at a rate that many families simply can’t afford.

“Power prices are rising faster here than in many other countries. The market is uncompetitive and it is failing consumers. That’s why Labour will act to stop power companies making super profits of the backs of Kiwis.

“John Key’s argument for doing nothing includes claiming it’s all about nationalising assets. That’s not true. Nothing is being repurchased under Labour’s plan.

“He argues that the impact of the ETS will end up costing consumers more. But that’s not true either. Two-thirds of power is generated from hydro which doesn’t produce emissions.

“John Key can call the policy anything he likes. New Zealanders know that it’s simply common sense. Bringing down power prices gives Kiwis more money in their pockets. It stimulates the economy to the tune of $450 million and creates thousands of jobs.

“Labour has a credible plan to grow the economy so that it benefits all New Zealanders. National has failed to do this in its five years in Government.

“We have concrete ideas to create thousands of jobs, reduce power bills and help 100,000 Kiwi families into their first homes. National has no solution to any of these problems.

“National is too busy carping, moaning, hurling abuse and pointing the finger. Kiwis deserve better than that. They deserve a Labour-led Government that will make a real difference to their lives,” said Grant Robertson.
