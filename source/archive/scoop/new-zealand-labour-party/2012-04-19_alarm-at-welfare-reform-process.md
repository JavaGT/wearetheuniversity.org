**Alarm at welfare reform process**

An almost unanimous call for the Government to slow down its welfare reforms threatened to become the major issue of a Social Services Select Committee meeting today, according to Labour’s spokesperson for Social Development Jacinda Ardern and Labour committee members Rajen Prasad and Sua William Sio.

“With 11 days to produce a submission on these reforms, it’s easy to see why submitters from church organisations like Caritas through to the Law Society, have expressed their major concerns over the Government’s truncated timeline.

“The Law Society rightly pointed out that the Minister can’t have it both ways – either her changes are significant and deserve decent analysis or consideration or they’re not and can be rushed through.

“Ironically, some submitters from Auckland were unable to attend the one day they were allocated for their submission to be heard because they were at a conference Paula Bennett was due to speak at,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“In case she has therefore missed the overwhelming message my colleagues and I have written to her to ask that she reopen submissions and give this debate the time it deserves.

“This isn’t ‘just some little project’, but, to quote the Government, is ‘part of a comprehensive package of welfare reform’. The changes will affect thousands of young people, sole parents and those on Widow’s and Women Alone benefits and, most importantly, children.

“If this area of policy isn’t worth more time, debate, and focus from Parliament, then I truly question the Minister’s priorities”
