**Amendment to protect Hagley Park wins support**

Labour has won Government support for an amendment to enshrine protections for Hagley Park into law, meaning emergency powers cannot be used to build on the park, says Labour’s Canterbury Spokesperson Megan Woods.

“Hagley Park is a local icon that is central to our identity as the Garden City.

“Legal protections for the park have been longstanding but the original drafting of the Government’s Regenerate Christchurch Bill opened up the possibility of emergency powers being used to allowing new buildings to be developed in Hagley Park.

“Today, Labour has secured National’s support for an amendment which would see protections for Hagley Park written into the new law. This ensures there will be no law on the books which allows a threat to Hagley Park.

“The earthquakes have robbed Cantabrians of so much of what we love about our city. It’s a big win for local people that Hagley Park – one of our most enduring icons – will continue to be protected for future generations,” says Megan Woods.
