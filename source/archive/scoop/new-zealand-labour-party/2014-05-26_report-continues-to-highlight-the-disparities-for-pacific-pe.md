**Report continues to highlight the disparities for Pacific people**

It is crucial the Government doesn’t just shrug off the Salvation Army’s [update](http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz/sites/default/files/uploads/20140526This
Is Home May 2014.pdf) on the state of Pasifika people in New Zealand as just another report, Labour’s Spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs Su’a William Sio says.

“_This is Home_ reaffirms the growing inequality between Pacific people and the rest of New Zealand, an issue the National Government has so far steadfastly refused to address.

“While there have been some improvements our people still face an uphill battle when it comes to employment, housing, educational achievement and income.

“A major concern is that home ownership still remains an elusive dream for thousands of Pacific people, with the proportion owning or part owning their home falling from 26 per cent in 2001 to just 18.5 per cent in 2013, while home ownership among European New Zealanders remains at around 55 per cent.

“When you look at NCEA achievement rates in Year 11, Level 1 and Year 12, Level 2 the Pacific rate sits at the bottom of all the other ethnic groups.

“National’s promise of a ‘brighter future’ has done little in the way of improving Pacific infant mortality rates which remain 20 per cent higher than the rate for the overall population.

“Its reluctance to address jobs, income and home ownership is doing little to support the many valiant attempts the Pasifika community is making to better outcomes.

“Labour, on the other hand, has a raft of policies that will support those efforts, including increasing the minimum wage, building thousands of affordable homes and offering the most vulnerable new mums more ante and post natal care,” Su’a William Sio said.
