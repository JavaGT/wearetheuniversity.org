50 Frontline Health Service Cut In 18 Months
============================================

**50 Frontline Health Service Cut In 18 Months**  

A conservative stock take of health services show that 50 frontline services have been cut by the National Government in 18 months, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“The cutbacks include the slashing of home help services for thousands of elderly across the country, mental health services, cutting diabetes programmes, reducing emergency department access in some areas and a reduction of nursing positions at one DHB,” Ruth Dyson says.

“I find it a disgrace that every month since he has been in office Health Minister Tony Ryall has overseen at least three cuts to frontline patient services.

“The stock-take of cuts does not include ongoing industrial action by radiographers, which has seen services reduced to patients across the country, nor does it include changes to undo work on healthy eating programmes such as quality food in school canteens.

“Clearly the National Government does not have improving the health of Kiwis as one of its top priorities.

“This week alone Auckland Regional Public Health have cut 12 jobs that will affect nearly all their programmes - including alcohol and tobacco, communicable diseases, emergency planning and response, Māori health nutrition, promoting health and Wellbeing and screening services.

“Taranaki DHB also announced it was preparing for more cutbacks and worryingly pointed towards diagnostic services, pharmaceuticals and medical staff for proposed cuts. Its now become clear the cuts are nationwide following directives from Minister of Health Tony Ryall that DHBs cut their budgets.

“The stock-take of cutbacks is information that has been make publicly available by DHBs. The Minister covers up the health cuts by calling them ‘changes’ and has also become forthcoming in is response to written parliamentary questions and OIAs.

“Mr Ryall apparently believes that any cutback in health care for patients is ‘operational’ and therefore not his concern.

“In opposition Mr Ryall told the public that every decision to change services was the responsibility of the Minister, but now as Minister of Health he has publicly washed his hands of the cutbacks he is allowing.

“The Labour Party will continue to monitor the cutbacks in health which appear to be picking up pace. We hope to release an updated stock-take of cutbacks every three months.

“In opposition Mr Ryall told the public that he would fund more frontline health services by simply cutting backroom functions. In reality the only thing he has cut is services to patients.

“The Labour Party intends to hold him and his colleagues responsible for the cutbacks, reductions and ‘changes’ he has allowed in the health service,” Ruth Dyson said.
