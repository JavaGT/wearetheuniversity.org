Destiny NZ Party Distort The Truth

Destiny NZ Party Distort The Truth

It is not a good look for a church-sponsored political party to engage in negative, divisive campaigning based on half truths and misinformation, says longtime Manukau resident and Manukau City Councillor Su'a William Sio

Responding to negative comments by Destiny NZ Church Party leader Richard Lewis in the weekend, Su'a says that the Destiny NZ Church party is publicly promoting incorrect information about Labour and the political system.

Destiny's party campaigned against Labour at the Otara Fleamarkets, and on Radio Samoa, misinforming Pacific people and the people of Manukau.

\"Whether that's intentional or the Destiny Party is simply ignorant of the facts, I don't know. I would have hoped that the Destiny Church's political party leader, given their so-called Christian platform, would at least present honest and correct information."

For example, says Su'a, legislation for the Civil Union and Prostitution Law Reform Bill were private members bills. They were not introduced by any one party.

"It was a personal conscience vote exercised by individual Members of Parliament - not the government - that pushed these bills into legislation.

"Several Labour MPs voted against it. And the same voting pattern, for and against, happened across all party lines - National with Don Brash voting for the prostitution law reform. And so did the Maori Party leader Tariana Turia."

For criticizing Helen Clark saying that she is not a Christian, Su'a says:

"Let me remind people of Graham Capill, the former Christian party leader and ex-police prosecutor, who is now in prison for multiple sex offences against children. He campaigned vigorously on a platform of Christian virtues.

"Yet, behind closed doors, this Christian leader was clearly a hypocrite of the lowest order, the most unchristian and repugnant of human beings, let alone any politician.

Su'a asks Pacific people to judge the government on its track record in improving quality of life across the board for all people including Pacific people.

You know what you get with Helen Clark and Labour:  
\* Strong, stable government  
\* Experienced team  
\* Building on what we've done - keeping the momentum going  
New Zealand is going ahead:  
\* Economic growth  
\* Investment in people and skills \* Research and development \* Drive for high value economy/new technology \* More Jobs  
\* Premium put on  
\* Universal health care \* More teachers \* Apprenticeships \* Students/interest free loans \* Security for families and older people  
\* Pride in national identity  
\* Achievements in our creative areas \* Nuclear free - strong independent nation

Su'a says, "Don't put all this at risk. If you want a Labour - led government you have to vote for it.

A Labour-led Government, says Su'a, will continue to give New Zealand a strong economy and carry out its responsibility to look after those who most need assistance and help.

"Isn't that what Christian values are really about?" says Su'a. "Not excluding people from the abundance and helping people in times of need. Helen Clark and this Labour-led government have consistently worked hard for all our communities."
