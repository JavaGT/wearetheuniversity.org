Go the All Whites

Excitement is building as the All Whites prepare to do the country proud in the winner take all World Cup qualifier tomorrow in Wellington, Labour Leader Phil Goff and Sport and Recreation spokesperson Chris Hipkins said today.

“On behalf of all my Labour colleagues I want to wish the All Whites all the best for their game against Bahrain tomorrow,” Phil Goff said.

“It will be a hard game but one the All Whites can win.

“I will be one of the more than 35,000 people lucky enough to be at the Cake Tin cheering the team pm. Thousands more will be watching the game on Television.

“I remember the All Whites in 1982 and how excited the country was about our national football team making it to the world’s biggest sporting stage. Now it’s the turn of a new generation of footballers to have their opportunity to make it to the World Cup.

“I know New Zealanders will be right behind our players tomorrow,” Phil Goff said.

“New Zealanders are passionate about their sport and will be incredibly proud of how well the team has done so far,” Chris Hipkins said.

“Every weekend during winter thousands of New Zealand children all over the country pull on their soccer boots and it is fantastic that they will tomorrow get to see the All Whites playing for a spot in the World Cup,” Chris Hipkins said.

“The excitement in Wellington is already palpable and I am sure the All Whites will be buoyed as they hear the roar of the crowd as 35,000 people in the stadium and many more at home scream ‘Come-on the All Whites’,” Phil Goff said.
