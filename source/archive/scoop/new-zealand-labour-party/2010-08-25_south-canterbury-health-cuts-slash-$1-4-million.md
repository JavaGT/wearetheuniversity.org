South Canterbury health cuts slash $1.4 million
===============================================

**South Canterbury health cuts slash $1.4 million**  
Today's release of the South Canterbury District Health Board's district annual plan for 2010/2011 paints a grim picture with a cut of $1.4 million in health spend over the coming year, Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson says.

“The Minister of Health, Tony Ryall has been sitting on the release of the 20 District Health Board annual plans which are usually made public in mid July each year. South Canterbury's late-August release means locals are now able to see the exact dollar amount of cuts they can expect on top of the cuts they have endured in the last year.

“Notable loses are a $1.2 million reduction in spend for child oral health, a $0.1 million reduction in spend for palliative care, and a drop of $0.4 million locally for primary care.

"Last year South Canterbury District Health Board responded to a $1 million cut by slashing home help to older people, reducing Emergency Department patient numbers by about 5000, and reducing radiology services. Another $1.4 million this year will compound these existing cuts.

"The remaining District Health Board plans, and their cuts, need to be released immediately so communities can assess for themselves whether the National Government is delivering health better or sooner or more conveniently in their area,” Ruth Dyson said.
