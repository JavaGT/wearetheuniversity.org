Solid Energy’s cuts a blow to Huntly

**Solid Energy’s cuts a blow to Huntly**  
Solid Energy’s decision to cut 75 jobs from the Huntly coal mine is a huge blow to families in the local community, says Labour’s MP for Hauraki Waikato, Nanaia Mahuta.

"Losing 75 jobs from the coal mine will be a huge blow to the Huntly community. The prospect of fathers, sons and uncles losing a job at the mine will pose some serious challenges for whanau who understand how constrained the current employment market is.

"I wouldn't be surprised if several families are considering joining the thousands of others across the country in moving across the ditch to Perth or the Gold Coast to get a job.

“The Government must show how it intends to create employment options or training pathways for workers affected by job cuts at the mine.

"Reducing revenue across Solid Energy operations to the tune of $200 million will reorient the company in a way that will prepare it for sale at and hurt those who have been committed workers.

"It's time for the Government to spell out how selling New Zealand's energy companies will retain Kiwi jobs for local people.

"It's not just individuals that will be affected but whole families and entire communities - this is not the brighter future that National promised."
