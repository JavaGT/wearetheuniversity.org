80,000 Auckland patients not seen on time

11 June 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT

80,000 Auckland patients not seen on time  

  

Tony Ryall is covering up the fact that tens of thousands of patients are not being seen in emergency departments within the best practice timeframes, Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.

“Until October 2010 quarterly reports were available publicly on how long patients waited depending on the seriousness of their condition. A scale rating for clinical urgency was used to ensure patients were seen in a best practice timeframe.

“Without an announcement or replacement system, Tony Ryall dumped public access to the benchmark reports and changed the reporting system.

“Through the OIA the first reports from DHBs have been obtained. In two Auckland DHBs alone 6,466 patients who should have been seen in 10 minutes with conditions as serious as head injuries, massive bleeding or suspected heart attacks waited longer than the best practice benchmarks in the past year.

“A further 74,000 patients in three Auckland DHBs who should have been seen in 30 minutes with conditions including fractures, breathlessness or bleeding were again not seen within the right time.

“In opposition Tony Ryall made a big song and dance about patients not being seen on time. In Government his approach is to cover up the facts and regards six hours as his acceptable waiting time,” says Annette King.
