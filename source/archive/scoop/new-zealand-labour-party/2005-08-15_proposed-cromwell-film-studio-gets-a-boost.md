Proposed Cromwell Film Studio gets a boost

Immigration complications getting in the way of a film studio proposed for Cromwell have been resolved.

Following representations from Otago MP David Parker, the Associate Minister of Immigration Damien O’Connor has cleared the way for the investors in the proposed Cromwell Film Studio to be granted residency.

American couple and former Queenstown residents Margie and Ray Liu were behind a bid last year to set up a film studio at Arthur’s Point, near Queenstown. Mr Liu is an award winning film maker who wants to establish a production facility in New Zealand. Their initial proposal floundered because they could not get resource consent.

A revised proposal in Cromwell’s industrial zone, which did not require resource consent, was in danger of floundering due to their inability to resolve their immigration status. The proposed investors need to be certain that Mr and Mrs Liu can operate the production facility before they can commit to build it.

Representations by Mr Parker to the Associate Minister of Immigration about the Liu’s application resulted in a decision to make an exception in this case. The New Zealand Immigration service has been directed to grant residence to the Lius in advance of the new business being established, as an exception to policy, subject to their completion of paperwork, payment of fees and meeting character and medical requirements.

“I am delighted with the decision which shows a forward thinking approach”, said Mr Parker. “If the proposed film studio proceeds it will bring economic gains to the region and help cement New Zealand’s premier film-making world status; and Central Otago’s place as a centre of creative adventure and entertainment for New Zealand.”
