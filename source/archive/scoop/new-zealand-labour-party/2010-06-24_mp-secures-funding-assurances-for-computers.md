**MP secures funding assurances for Computer Clubhouses and Computer in Homes  
**  
The MP for Mangere Su'a William Sio has secured assurances from the Minister of the Community and Voluntary sector Tariana Turia today that she will be keeping an eye on the Digital Literacy and Connections budget.

“The Minister provided an assurance to me that she will ensure the Computer Clubhouses and Computer in Homes initiative by the Manukau community will be financially supported long term,” Su’a William Sio said.

The Computer Clubhouse provides a creative and safe out-of-school learning environment where young people from underserved communities work with adult mentors to explore their own ideas, develop skills, and build confidence in themselves through the use of technology.

“This is an important community programme and I am committed to ensuring that the Government continues to fund it.

“The Computer Clubhouse is a community initiative, which has grown through the hard-work and dedication of Mike Usmar and his team. It is well planned, well researched, carried out by qualified individuals, supported by Manukau City Council, businesses, tertiary organisations and the local communities. The funds going into this initiative is a long-term investment towards the future of our young people and this country.”

Su’a William Sio said he was concerned that budget documents had not provided ongoing funding for the programme, which is why he had chosen to question the Minister.
