Prebble the loser!
==================

[![Labour
2000 web site](http://www.labour.org.nz/images/logomed.jpg)](http://www.labour.org.nz)Labour Wellington Central candidate Marian Hobbs has welcomed the start of the television leaders debates saying that they showed voters how lacklustre and incoherent Richard Prebble is.

"An overwhelming feeling following last night's debate is how badly Richard Prebble performed," Marian Hobbs said.

"He lied about how much Act's tax policies would affect the provision of health and education. He insulted students by implying that they would rip the student loan system off if they were given half a chance. Students go to university to get an education so they can get a decent job - they don't go to make money.

"Despite being a seasoned politician, Mr Prebble clearly let Winston Peters rattle him and was unable to articulate anything very clearly. It will be a real dampener for Act as they prepare to launch their Wellington Central campaign.

"By contrast, I am offering articulate, strong advocacy for Wellington Central and will be clear and focused on issues like schooling and health provision.

"The contest for Wellington Central is clearly between me and Richard Prebble and if the leaders' debates continue in the same vein they will be of more help to me than Mr Prebble," Marian Hobbs said.
