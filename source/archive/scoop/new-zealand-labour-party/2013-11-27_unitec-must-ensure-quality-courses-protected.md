Unitec must ensure quality courses protected

Unitec’s decision to make 50 design and visual arts department staff redundant raises serious concerns about the future quality of the highly regarded programme, Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“The loss of jobs will be tough on the staff. It appears there will only be 17 full-time positions in the restructured department which means many people will be without a job.

“The design and visual arts department at Unitec is well regarded and it is hard to understand what would justify the loss of those who have built that reputation.

“Unitec insists the restructuring is not about money, but about getting closer to industry and having more involvement from industry in the teaching process.

“It is important the programme has close links with industry, but that should not compromise the quality of teaching and the students’ experience.

“Students in the programme need an assurance from Unitec they will continue to receive quality teaching that develops skills which are applicable across the industry.

“With such dramatic staff cuts, and few full time staff remaining, there are serious questions to be answered about quality assurance for this programme.

“Design is an important part of a prosperous future New Zealand economy. We cannot afford to see the quality of programmes in this sector compromised,” Grant Robertson says.
