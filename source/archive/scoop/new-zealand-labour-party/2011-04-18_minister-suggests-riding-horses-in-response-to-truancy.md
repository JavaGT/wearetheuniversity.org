Education Minister suggests riding horses in response to truancy concerns

The Education Minister is developing a reputation for bullying behaviour after revelations she sent an email scolding the Gisborne Mayor for advocating for extra school buses in his community to curb truancy, says Labour's Education spokesperson Sue Moroney.

"Anne Tolley lashed out after being embarrassed by a 2000-strong hikoi of parents and students who marched in a bid to try and get a school bus in Kaiti, said Sue Moroney.

Gisborne-based Labour MP Moana Mackey says she's shocked by the content of Anne Tolley's email which also suggests various ways students get to school, including 'in this part of the electorate, I believe they still ride horses!'."

"Anne Tolley also falsely accuses the Mayor of not raising the issue directly with her. Meng Foon has tried to raise concerns but has been ignored by the Minister, who only reacted when the community took to the streets."

Sue Moroney says Mayor Meng Foon supported the hikoi because he is concerned that the lack of transport available to students will increase truancy.

"Instead of trying to find a way to help, Anne Tolley emailed the Mayor telling him off and accusing him of being 'michievous'. This behaviour follows her bullying letter to schools telling them to buck their ideas up when it comes to dealing with violence in schools.

"The people of Gisborne along with parents and students throughout the country would no doubt prefer the Minister displayed her support for them rather than her bad temper," said Sue Moroney.
