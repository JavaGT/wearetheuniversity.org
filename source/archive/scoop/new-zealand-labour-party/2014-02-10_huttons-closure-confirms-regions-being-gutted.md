**Huttons closure confirms regions being gutted**

The closure of the Huttons factory in Frankton confirms New Zealand’s regions are being gutted by the Government’s hands-off approach, says Labour Leader and Regional Development spokesperson David Cunliffe.

“While the Prime Minister is busy gallivanting around the country telling people he’s ‘fixed the economy’, 125 hardworking Kiwis are losing their jobs.

“The closure of the Frankton factory will be a crushing blow to the Waikato economy.

“It follows job losses at NZ Post and Genesis Energy, and redundancies announced at Ruakura; which are all Government entities.

“These workers will join 14,000 others in Waikato who are already on the dole queue. Unemployment in the region is among the highest in the country and has grown by 2100 in the past year.

“This is another kick in the teeth for young workers looking for opportunities in our regions.

“The loss of wages from Huttons’ workers is expected to suck $100,000 a week out of the local economy.

“There will also be a flow-on effect for local contractors and businesses.

“The Government needs to get off its chuff and back local manufacturing.

“A Labour government will invest in our regions, support research and development and take the necessary steps to create a value-added economy,” David Cunliffe says.
