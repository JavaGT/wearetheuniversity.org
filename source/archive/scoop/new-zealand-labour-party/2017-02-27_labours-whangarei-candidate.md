Media Release **Labour’s Whangarei Candidate**

Monday 27 February 2017

Tony Savage has been selected as the Labour Party candidate for Whangarei for the 2017 General Election.

“I am pleased to be Labour’s candidate for the 2017 election and I look forward to representing the Whangarei electorate in Parliament,” says Tony Savage.

Being a strong advocate for fairness and dignity for all, and fighting for those without a voice or privilege is at the core of Tony’s decision to stand as Labour’s candidate for Whangarei.

“I am excited to become an advocate for Whangarei, and Northland, after years of failure and neglect from the current National government,” he says.

“I would like to see Whangarei and Northland becoming the vibrant caring communities they are capable of being – with much less unemployment and housing problems, and improved health among all our people, and I will be working towards this goal.”

Tony has an employment background as a CEO, technology adviser, strategy consultant, financial adviser as well as being a successful local lawyer in Whangarei practicing mainly within the commercial and property fields. Educated as a lawyer at Auckland and holding an MBA from the University of Auckland, Tony brings a business focus to the role of politics, and “a belief that so much more is possible” to enhance life in Whangarei.

Since he moved to Whangarei in 2004, Tony Savage has used those same skills to the voluntary and community organisations he has been involved in – the Whangarei Music Society, Rotary, being a trustee on both secondary and intermediate schools in Whangarei (Boys High and Whangarei Intermediate), the Northland Community Foundation and other local groups.

With such a broad range of interests, Tony Savage’s commitment to and involvement in Whangarei is a role model for community leadership – a role he wants to expand to help take Whangarei towards an exciting future.
