With the decision by the New Zealand Principals Federation to pass a vote of no-confidence in he National Government’s, National Standards policy and Minister Anne Tolley, John Key can no longer ignore this situation Labour Education spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“For more than 750 of the nation’s educational leaders to say they no longer have confidence in the Minister or the main education policy of the Government is unprecedented.

“National has attempted to drive a wedge between parents and educators at the expense of students and today principals said no more,” Sue Moroney said.

“If the education of children is really a priority for the National Government then John Key must act quickly to remove a Minister who has failed so miserably to deliver for parents, teachers and students.

“While in the past National has attempted to pass off concerns by teachers as ‘union’ activity the reality is teachers want to do the best they can for parents and students.

“Teachers in most cases are parents themselves if they really believed that National Standards benefitted students they would be behind them.

“But sadly Anne Tolley and John Key have side-lined teachers and their expertise and as a result have damaged the vital parent - teacher relationship.

“Labour today calls on John Key today to stand-up for New Zealand children and students, and remove a Minister who is clearly incapable of doing the job and review national standards,” Sue Moroney said.
