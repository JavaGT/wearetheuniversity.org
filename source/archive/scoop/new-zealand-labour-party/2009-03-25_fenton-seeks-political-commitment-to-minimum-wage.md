Fenton seeks political commitment to minimum wage

  
Labour MP Darien Fenton today tabled a Supplementary Order Paper seeking a commitment by all political parties to the minimum wage.

Darien Fenton said it was time all parties in Parliament laid their cards on the table and made it clear whether or not they were committed to a minimum wage for New Zealand workers.

“The issue has been used as a political football, similar to the way political parties have dealt with superannuation in the past.

“Changes were made to the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act as a result, which included a schedule listing the political parties in Parliament which supported the provision of super,” Darien Fenton said.

“The SOP tabled today proposes an amendment which would see the same schedule added to the Minimum Wage Act and adds to a Member’s Bill (the Minimum Wage and Remuneration Bill) which is due for further debate in Parliament this evening.

The Bill would provide for thousands of vulnerable low paid contractors to become entitled to at least minimum wage.

"National has opposed this and also appears set to oppose another SOP I have tabled, aimed at increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 2011.

“In light of these factors and the recent miserable increase to the minimum wage, I believe it is time all political parties clarified their position on whether New Zealand workers should be entitled to a fair day’s pay.

“This issue is particularly important in a time of recession and I challenge the Government and other political parties to stand by New Zealand workers and support this amendment.

“The SOP would also require ministers who amend the Minimum Wage Act to inform Parliament of the consultation process engaged in regarding the changes, which will increase ministerial accountability,” Darien Fenton said.
