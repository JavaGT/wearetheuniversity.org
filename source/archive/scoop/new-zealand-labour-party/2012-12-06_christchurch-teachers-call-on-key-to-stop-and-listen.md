Christchurch teachers call on Key to stop and listen  

Christchurch teachers fed up with the National Government’s education reform agenda have turned out in force today with a clear message for the Prime Minister, says Labour MP for Wigram Megan Woods.

Teachers and support staff from more than 100 Christchurch schools met this afternoon in a unified stand against National’s education reform agenda.

“They presented me with a petition to take to John Key, calling on him to halt his Government’s flawed plan for the future of education in Christchurch.

“The petition is signed by more than 7000 teachers across the country, and at least 40% of all teachers in Christchurch. The message is simple: stop and listen to the regions students, parents and educators about what is best for students and their learning.

“I look forward to presenting the petition to the House. With such an overwhelming majority opposing the Government’s reform agenda it is clear John Key cannot continue to ignore the voices of the region’s teachers, principals and parents.

  
“Christchurch residents have been through enough in the last two years, they should not have the future of their schools dictated to them by the Beehive.

“If changes are to be made, the Government needs to take the community with them. Hekia Parata has botched the consultation process from day one, but it is not too late for her to listen to the community.

“There will be plenty of opportunity, with teachers agreeing to a Christchurch-wide strike on February 19 2013.

“The future of education in Christchurch is too important to get wrong. It’s time for the Government to take seriously the concerns of parents and teachers - who only want what is best for children and their learning,” says Megan Woods.
