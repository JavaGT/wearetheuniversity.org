Prosser’s stereotyping unacceptable
===================================

Phil  
Goff  
Foreign Affairs Spokesperson  
12 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Prosser’s stereotyping unacceptable**

Labour’s Foreign Affairs spokesperson Phil Goff has condemned the racial and religious stereotyping by New Zealand First MP, Richard Prosser.

“Mr Prosser’s comments are extreme and unjustified. They require an absolute withdrawal and apology by him without delay.

“To suggest that young men who are Muslim should be banned from air travel is bizarre and reflects appallingly on the prejudice of the MP concerned.

“Mr Prosser is suggesting that young men of the Muslim faith as a group are likely to be terrorists.

“That is an insult to the thousands of young Muslims in this country who are responsible and good citizens and who contribute hugely to New Zealand.

“Mr Prosser’s statement is unacceptable from an MP and he and New Zealand First should consider whether he has any future in politics,” Phil Goff said.
