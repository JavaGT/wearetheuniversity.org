**Students’ stories show StudyLink stinks**

Students are having so much trouble with Government loan adviser StudyLink that National’s own youth wing have had to launch a campaign highlighting its poor service, Labour says.

“Young National’s ‘easy does it’ approach and [polite press release](http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1304/S00366/young-nats-launch-campaign-to-fix-studylink.htm) won’t ruffle Steven Joyce’s feathers, but students’ stories definitely will,” Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Megan Woods said.

"StudyLink is notorious for long delays, administrative errors and poor service. I have heard cases where students have been denied access to course materials because StudyLink has left them short-changed.

“Most students rely on StudyLink to pay some portion of their course costs, rent, food and power. Most will plan other work around loan income, so glitches in payments that were budgeted for are causing genuine hardship.”

“Students are being left in the lurch by a system that is not paying them. They are getting lumbered with debts because StudyLink's system cannot cope,” Jacinda Ardern said.

“This isn’t about frivolous students waiting for the Government to pick up the tab, it is about a service that is failing young New Zealanders already juggling study and part-time work with the stress of budgeting.

“Just as it did with the Novopay debacle, the National Government seems to think it is okay for people to get by with no income. Teachers can't do it, and neither can students.

“The Government needs to listen to its own youth wing and NZUSA representatives and ensure StudyLink can manage its data and meet its obligations,” Jacinda Ardern said.
