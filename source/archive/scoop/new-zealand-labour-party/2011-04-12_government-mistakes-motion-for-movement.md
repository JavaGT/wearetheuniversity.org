MEDIA STATEMENT

**Government Mistakes Motion for Movement**

The ink is barely dry on the last review of the Government’s science sector, but Research Science and Technology Minister Wayne Mapp is already reviewing Crown Research Institutes in a move to influence another merger.

“The last CRI review rejected further mergers. Conducting yet another review on a whim, at taxpayers’ expense, shows the Government has no plan for science and innovation,” says Labour’s spokesperson for Research, Science and Technology David Shearer.

“This is ad hoc thinking. The Minister believes that the more consultants and money he spends on reviews, the more likely he is to lay claim to a ‘good idea’ which will address where science and innovation in New Zealand should be going.

“This Government mistakes motion for movement. Shuffling yet another review through is not the same as real action and progress.

“It simply shows once again that this Government has no plan. It is running the country on reviews and polls.

“What will his next big idea be? Form must follow function. Mapp’s plans have the potential to cause massive disruption to a critical area of New Zealand.

“The 4400 scientists who carry out some of our best research will be concerned that the Minister is tinkering with something without any real understanding of the costs or benefits--- if any--- that might come from it, ” David Shearer said.
