The National Government has failed to deliver on a serious public health issue by refusing to legislate for the removal of tobacco displays says Labour Associate Health Spokesperson (Drugs and Alcohol) Iain Lees-Galloway.

The Government yesterday tabled its response to a Health Select Committee recommendation that it introduce legislation to require tobacco and cigarettes displays in retail outlets to be out of sight, in which it stated that the matter would be shelved for the foreseeable future.

“National appear to have put expedience ahead of doing the right thing,” said Iain Lees-Galloway.

“The fact is cigarettes kill, not when they are misused or abused, but when they are used as intended. That’s not the sort of thing that should be on display next to bread and milk.

“If the Government is serious about reducing smoking rates and the serious impact tobacco has on our communities and on our health system then it would be prepared to take any measures available to de-normalise cigarette smoking.”

“Since the Government is not prepared to support parents trying to keep their kids from smoking, it is my intention to do so by introducing a Member’s Bill to the ballot,” said Iain Lees-Galloway.

“I believe there are many members across all parties in Parliament who do support a ban on cigarette displays. Should this bill be drawn from the ballot, I hope it gives them the opportunity for their voices to be heard and for thousands of parents, children and health professionals to get the representation they deserve.”
