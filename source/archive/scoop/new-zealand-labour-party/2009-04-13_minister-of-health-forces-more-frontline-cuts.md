Minister of Health forces more frontline cuts

Southland and Otago District Health Boards are the latest to join the line cutting frontline health services in response to Government directives, says Labour Health spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“This is further evidence that Minister of Health Tony Ryall’s promises to increase frontline health services before the election were a sham.

“The Otago and Southland DHBs plan to cut spending by five per cent each, which will have a significant impact on the services they can deliver. This is the opposite of what Mr Ryall promised and he needs to explain himself,” Ruth Dyson said.
