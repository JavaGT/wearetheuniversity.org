Education Minister bullying sector
==================================

**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

Nanaia  
MAHUTA  
Education Spokesperson

13 July 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Education Minister bullying sector**

The Labour Party says it is disappointing the Education Minister prefers to bully teachers and principals, rather than listening to their advice about how best to teach kiwi kids.

Labour’s Education Spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta says \"It appears Hekia Parata has cautioned teachers and principals against using school newsletters to inform parents about the impact of Government policies, such as larger class sizes."

  
"During that debate, principals took the rarely-used measure of detailing the adverse effect the Government’s plan would have had in their schools and on student’s learning."

  
"Education professionals were frustrated at the Minister’s rejection of their advice about the real impact of larger classes at a time of such constrained funding."

  
"But Hekia Parata chose to follow Treasury-led advice on a policy that would have had a negative impact on children's learning."

  
"Now she is adopting bullying behaviour and trying to drive a wedge between parents and teachers.”

  
"If the Minister continues down this path the only losers will be the children who deserve more and need a coherent set of policies that help them realise their full potential."

  
"The Minister should work with the sector constructively, support parents who want more for their children and be a role model for children who do not want more bullies in the school system."
