Regions hollowed out under National

The latest regional GDP data from Statistics New Zealand shows the regions are being hollowed out under National, Labour Leader and Regional Development spokesperson David Cunliffe says.

“Figures out today for the year to March 2013, show economic activity per capita went backwards in Waikato, Gisborne, Hawke's Bay, Taranaki, Manawatu-Wanganui, Marlborough, the West Coast and Southland.

“Even modest growth in Northland didn’t translate into desperately needed jobs with the annual unemployment rate rising from 8.3 per cent to 9.9 per cent over the same period.

“Median real income in Northland has declined by $37 per week since 2008\[1\]. Real median incomes in almost every region are down under this Government.

“National’s hands-off approach to the regions has left people out of work and out of hope.

“Labour’s Economic Upgrade will breathe life back into the provinces. We will work with local communities and businesses to create sustainable jobs.

“Our forestry taskforce will create jobs for long-term unemployed. Our Pro-Wood policy and investment incentives will create better jobs and higher wages.

“A Labour government will back regional businesses and help them move their products from volume to value. We will invest in research and development to make sure New Zealand reaps the benefits of Kiwi ingenuity,” David Cunliffe says.
