Key’s mixed messages on drugs and alcohol

Prime Minister John Key’s mixed messages about alcohol and drug addiction are undermining efforts to responsibly respond to substance abuse in New Zealand, says Labour’s Associate Health Spokesperson Iain Lees-Galloway.

In today’s NZ Herald, Mr Key is reported to have asked chief science advisor Professor Peter Gluckman to investigate the possibility of eliminating pseudoephedrine form cold and flu tablets as part of the government’s so-called “War on P.”

“Only a month ago, John Key took the position that it would be wrong to punish those who use a substance responsibly because some people misuse or abuse it.

“In respect to alcohol he said: ‘I think you’ve got to be very careful you don’t get in a situation where you simply whack up the price of booze and everybody gets affected because some, particularly young people, are going out on benders’.

“But today he suggests penalising thousands of New Zealanders who legitimately use pseudoephedrine to relieve the symptoms of cold and flu because a fraction of those who purchase it do so in order to manufacture P.

“While I acknowledge the devastating impacts P has on our families and communities, the fact is alcohol is still the single substance that causes more damage than all other substances put together,” said Iain Lees-Galloway.

“The Prime Minister wants to appear tough on P. But if he really wants to help families struggling with substance abuse he needs to be equally keen to address alcohol abuse.”

Iain Lees-Galloway said the Prime Minister needs to get his messages straight if he is serious about substance abuse.

“Substance addiction and abuse are complex issues that need more than knee-jerk responses.”
