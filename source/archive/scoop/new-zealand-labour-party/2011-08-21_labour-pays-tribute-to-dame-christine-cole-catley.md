**Labour pays tribute to Dame Christine Cole Catley**

The death of Dame Christine Cole Catley represents the loss of one our leading women publishers, says Labour Arts Culture and Heritage spokesperson Steve Chadwick.

“She was an independent woman, publisher and author. She was a trailblazer who lead the way for women in New Zealand to enter the fields of journalism and publishing.

“Running New Zealand’s first full-time journalism training programme in the 1960’s she is understood to have insisted that half the students were female. A move that greatly influenced the landscape of media in this country.

“She will be mourned, by all those who knew her work and who benefitted from her guidance and mentoring,” Steve Chadwick said.
