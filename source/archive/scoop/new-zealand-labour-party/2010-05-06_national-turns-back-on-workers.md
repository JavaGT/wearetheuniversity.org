National turns back on workers
==============================

**National turns back on workers**

Labour MP Darien Fenton said today she was disappointed at the Government’s decision today not to support her Bill to give basic redundancy protection to thousands of workers.

The Redundancy Protection Bill was voted down in Parliament. National, Act and Peter Dunne’s United voted against.

“National has talked a good game on wanting to help people get through the recession but once again, when the rubber meets the road, it turns its back on the lower paid.

  
“It didn't even have the sense of fairness or care enough about these workers to vote this bill to select committee where people could tell their stories,” Darien Fenton said.
