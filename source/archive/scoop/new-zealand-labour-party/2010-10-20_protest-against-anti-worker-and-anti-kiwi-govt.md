Protest against anti-worker and anti-Kiwi govt

20 October 2010 **Media Statement**  
**Rallies a protest against anti-worker and anti-Kiwi government**

  
Today’s nationwide day of action reflects the anger of tens of thousands of Kiwis at the Government’s co-ordinated process to drive down pay and conditions for wage and salary earners, says the Labour Party’s labour spokesperson Trevor Mallard.

“It’s the exact opposite of what National promised before the election,” Trevor Mallard said.

“National promised to close the wage gap with Australia. Instead, we have fallen much further behind, and National is set on a relentless path to drive down conditions as well.”

Trevor Mallard congratulated the Council of Trade Unions (CTU) for organising the Fairness at Work rallies across the country.

“The CTU has done the organising, but it is the Government’s oppressive and harsh policies that are providing the inspiration for Kiwi workers across the country to unite in protest.

“Policies like the 90-day clause, obstacles placed in the way of wage and salary earners gaining access to union officials, the taking away of meal and tea breaks, and the loss of a fourth week’s holiday are all part of a wider picture of a government committed to looking after its wealthy mates, but unconcerned about low and middle-income Kiwis,” Trevor Mallard said.

“These policies are not only anti-worker, but anti-New Zealand as well, because the economic recovery of New Zealand depends upon hard-working Kiwis who are increasingly struggling to make ends meet.”
