**Efforts in wild rivers campaign applauded**

Anton Oliver's endorsement of a campaign acknowledging the importance of protecting our wild and scenic rivers is another positive step towards achieving this goal, says Labour’s Conservation spokesperson Ruth Dyson.

“Labour welcomes his involvement and the collaboration between the various organisations who have signed up to the [Outstanding Rivers campaign](http://www.outstandingrivers.org.nz/) .

“Labour is a staunch advocate for the protection of our rivers and waterways and stands alongside this community effort to raise awareness of Water Conservation Orders (WCOs),” Ruth Dyson said.

“Earlier this year, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, Dr Jan Wright, raised significant concerns in relation to the limited protection for our rivers. She has given us a very valuable base of information on which to consider these issues.

“Dr Wright particularly noted the environment versus environment tension in relation to hydro-schemes. However, with the National Government's relentless drive for irrigation, particularly in Canterbury, there is very little legislative protection against such projects jeopardising the health of our rivers.

“WCO’s are expensive and do not provide permanent protection. They are a valuable tool but we can do a lot better - and we need to do a lot better.

“The reports are now piling up on the desks of the ministers for the Environment and Conservation.

“They should take advantage of the expertise that has been provided to them through these reports and the passion of all New Zealanders about our rivers. It's time for action now,” Ruth Dyson said.
