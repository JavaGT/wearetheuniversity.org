**Water Take Should Not Be Taken For Granted**

"Increased demand for water from the Waikato river should not be taken for granted,” said Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta.

“It is evident that Watercare are seeking to increase its take by a further 200,000 cubic meters a day on top of the 150,000 they already secure for Auckland City.

“Waikato-Tainui must contribute to the overall consideration of this consent with a view to promoting our regional interest in the most efficient utilisation of our precious water resource.

“Our region has been working hard to invest in catchment planning, and improving collaboration across a range of stakeholders including iwi to ensure that one of our greatest assets remains a viable and sustainable resource.

“A significant amount of investment from the Waikato-Tainui River Settlement is committed to a clean-up fund for the river and creating employment opportunities that will contribute to the overall improvement of water quality and ecological environs.

“It is evident that as Auckland continues to expand and grow, it will cause greater demand pressure on water and infrastructure resources and our central and local government political leaders alongside key stakeholders need to be mindful of the impact that such growth can cause to the Waikato region, “said Ms Mahuta.

“Maybe it’s time for Waikato-Tainui to seek a voice at the Watercare table to ensure that we can represent the wellbeing of our river in decision-making affecting future water allocation.”
