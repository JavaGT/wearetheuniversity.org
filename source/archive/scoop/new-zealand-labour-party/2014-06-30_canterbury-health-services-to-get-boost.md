**Canterbury health services to get boost**

Labour is to invest in Canterbury’s health system to help people dealing with the ongoing health impacts of the earthquakes and their aftermath.

“Nearly four years on and people in Canterbury are still struggling with the after effects of the quakes,” Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King says.

“We are hearing reports of increasing numbers of young people being on suicide watch and mental health providers struggling to cope with the extra demand.

“That is why Labour is promising to invest $1million in local non-government mental health services and double the number of nurses working in the Canterbury District Health Board schools-based mental health team.

“Labour is also committing to investing $12.5 million for new health hubs in Rangiora and Akaroa, something the DHB has been left to pay for out of baseline funding despite extra and on-going costs following the earthquakes.

“We will also ensure that after hours GP services are available.

“The people of Canterbury want to get on with their lives. Having access to the health services they need is an essential part of that,” Annette King said.
