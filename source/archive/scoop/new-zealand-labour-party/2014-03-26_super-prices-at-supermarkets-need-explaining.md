Super prices at supermarkets need explaining

**Super prices at supermarkets need explaining**

New Zealand’s supermarket duopoly needs to do some serious explaining as to why their fruit and vegetables are so pricey, Labour’s Consumer Rights spokesperson Carol Beaumont says.

“An Otago University [report](http://www.otago.ac.nz/news/news/otago067315.html) shows Kiwi households are likely to be spending upwards of $2500 a year more on their fruit and veges if they buy them from a supermarket rather than their local market.

“Given ever increasing power prices and rising interest rates, there are not too many families that wouldn’t find an extra $49 a week in their pocket helpful.

“Unfortunately not everyone has access to a market, and the supermarkets know that.

“It’s past time for some transparency around pricing.

“Under this Government it seems the rewards are concentrated at the top. Lower down the food chain everyone else appears to be getting a raw deal.

“Supermarkets don’t have to wait for the Commerce Commission’s report to change their behaviour.

“They could start now - by bringing their fruit and vegetable prices into line with local sellers.”
