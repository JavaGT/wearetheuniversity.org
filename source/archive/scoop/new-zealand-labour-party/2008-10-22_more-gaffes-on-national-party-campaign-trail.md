More gaffes on National Party campaign trail

Labour Minister Trevor Mallard has called on National’s Leader John Key to explain the views of his Immigration spokesman after a gaffe about migrant workers.

"Lockwood Smith has been quoted in the Marlborough Express as suggesting the country needed more Asian workers because they have small hands for pruning grapevines, and he also complained that Pacific Islanders needed training in the use of toilets and showers," Trevor Mallard said.

"John Key now needs to explain if it represents the National Party’s view about Asian and Pacific Island workers.

"This week Mr Key has already had to deal with the gaffe of his transport spokesman Maurice Williamson, who suggested motorists could be charged tolls of up to thirty dollars a week – fifteen times as much as National’s tax cut for a worker on the average wage with children. Mr Williamson was banned from a major road funding announcement in the Waikato yesterday for telling the truth about their road tolls policy.

"Will John Key discipline Lockwood Smith as well today, or run for cover?

"These foot in mouth episodes by National’s senior leadership team show it cannot be trusted to understand the real needs of the economy.

"Far from National presenting a fresh face, the old team of Maurice Williamson, Lockwood Smith, Murray McCully and Bill English remind us of the disastrous days of the last National government," Trevor Mallard said.
