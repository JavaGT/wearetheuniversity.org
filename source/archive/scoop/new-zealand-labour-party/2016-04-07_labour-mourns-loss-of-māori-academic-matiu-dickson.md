**Labour mourns loss of Māori academic Matiu Dickson**

Tangi kau ana ngā tai e!  
E te manu whititua. E te pou tokomanawa o ngā whare maire o ngā tūpuna. Tāhuhu kau ana ngā puke I te tonga ka mōkaia ngā tai o Tauranga moana e!

  
It is with deep sympathy that we acknowledge the passing of Matiu Dickson from Ngai Tukairangi, Ngai Te Rangi, says Labour’s Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta.

“Matiu was a man of many talents and made an important contribution to Māori education and iwi politics.

“He was a law lecturer at the University of Waikato and shared his immense love for the legal practice through teaching and mentoring students and graduates of law.

“Matiu was focussed on applying his skills and talent to advance Māori aspirations and advocating for te reo Māori.

“He was involved in politics on a local and national level serving as a former Tauranga City Councillor. He also served on the Board of Trustees for Hillcrest High School, was the chair of Te Runanga o Kirikiriroa and he stood as a candidate for the Labour Party.

“He was a former board member of Pharmac, a founding member of the National Urban Māori Authority, a Director of Nga Rau Tatangi, and a judge for Te Matatini senior kapahaka competitions.

“He had a particular skill in bringing people together and forging a shared sense of understanding when it came to the Treaty of Waitangi and Māori aspirations.

“Matiu will be sorely missed. He had a level of optimism and foresight that made people feel secure when seeking his advice. He was a reflective thinker and gave considered opinions on a range of issues.

“Labour’s Māori caucus and the wider party send their sincere condolences to his wife Helen, their six children and four mokopuna.

“Matiu will return to his whanau to Hungahungatoroa Marae in Tauranga. May he rest in peace,” says Nanaia Mahuta.
