Canterbury continues to gain jobs unemployment drops

Official statistics today showing Canterbury with strong job growth and lowering unemployment signals the region’s underlying economic strength, says Waimakariri MP, Clayton Cosgrove.

The Household Labour Force Survey – the government’s official measure of the labour market – shows 2.1 percent growth in employment in Canterbury in the year to June.

In the same period, seasonally adjusted unemployment has moved marginally from 4.7 percent of the labour force to 4.4 percent. The national unemployment figure has fallen from 5.0 percent in March to 4.7 percent in June.

Mr Cosgrove says this is the lowest national unemployment rate since late 1987. “Canterbury is sharing the benefits of a strong economy in which the regions are now playing their part. With more jobs being created here and unemployment continuing to decline, everyone in Canterbury has reason to feel very positive,” said Mr Cosgrove.
