Tolley’s incompetence results in bullying and intimidation

Schools have been intimidated and bullied into adopting National Standards when they do not agree they will deliver results for students, Labour education spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“Schools that believe there is no educational merit in the standards have been threatened and bullied by a Minister who has failed to convince teachers of the merits of the system,” Sue Moroney said.

“Forcing schools by intimidating them to implement National Standards against their will is detrimental to children’s education.

“The only option left for those who disagree with National Standards is to vote to change the Government at the election in November.

“New Zealanders will have a clear choice this election to choose between blind ideology in National Standards or policies that put children first,” Sue Moroney said.
