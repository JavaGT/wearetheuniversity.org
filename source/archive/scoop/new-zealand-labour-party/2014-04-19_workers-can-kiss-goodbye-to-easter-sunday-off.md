Workers can kiss goodbye to Easter Sunday off

Workers can kiss goodbye to Easter Sunday off

  
The Government’s decision to “reprioritise” scarce labour inspector resources by abandoning the enforcement of Easter Sunday Shop Trading laws means workers can kiss goodbye to a guaranteed day off, says Labour’s Associate Labour Issues spokesperson Darien Fenton.

“The Labour Minister Simon Bridges confirmed last year that inspectors would only respond to complaints rather than carrying out proactive inspections of violations of New Zealand’s shop trading laws.

“His justification was that more resources are needed to prevent migrant worker abuse. But given only three inspectors have been allowed more time to address this growing issue, that rings hollow.

“Migrant workers also have rights under New Zealand law to have Easter Sunday off, yet these seem unimportant to the Minister.

“Given their vulnerability, many will end up working because their employer will say they must.

“This is the Government’s way of deregulating Easter Shop Trading by stealth.

“The thousands of retail workers, faith-based organisations and others who have for years opposed the liberalisation of Easter Sunday Shop Trading will be rightly demanding some answers.

“Given the Government’s attitude to guaranteed public holidays, it’s only fair to ask whether Easter Friday, Anzac Day and Christmas Day will be next,” Darien Fenton says.
