Tolley makes baseless accusation
================================

Sue MORONEY  
Education Spokesperson  
5 October 2011  
MEDIA STATEMENT

**Tolley makes baseless accusation**

Education Minister, Anne Tolley should read and listen more carefully before she makes accusations, Labour Spokesperson for Education Sue Moroney says.

“Anne Tolley has accused an experienced principal, Radio NZ and Labour of ‘getting it wrong’ about the background of Student Achievement Practitioners, when the criticisms were actually levelled at a broader group of advisors being employed to be expert advisors to schools,” Sue Moroney said.

“My advice to the Minister would be to read and listen more carefully before she jumps to conclusions and accuses others of making false claims.

“She has put two and two together and come up with 10, but if she reads my press statement carefully, she will see that I have made no reference to Student Achievement Practitioners.”
