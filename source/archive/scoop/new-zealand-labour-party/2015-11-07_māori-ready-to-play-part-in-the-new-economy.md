**Māori ready to play part in the new economy**

7 November 2015

The Māori economy will be a big driver of work changes and must be in a strong position to reap the benefits of new opportunities, Labour’ Chair of the Future of Work Commission Grant Robertson says.

Mr Robertson and Māori Development spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta today released three papers written by independent experts on the Māori Economy, Waikato-Tainui’s skill development partnerships and a South Auckland case study, as part of the Future of Work programme.

“The Māori economy is now worth $39 billion. It has a young workforce and a long-term inter-generational approach. Access to Treaty settlements capital puts Māori in an excellent position to benefit from the changes to the workforce over coming years,” says Mr Robertson.

“To make sure the full potential of these opportunities are seized there should be a new combined approach from the Government, Iwi Māori and the private sector to build high-value exports, and better skills, jobs and wages,” he says.

“Education, innovation and investment must all be harnessed properly. The regions must work in step with the heart of the Māori workforce – in South Auckland,” says Nanaia Mahuta.

“The challenges that lie ahead include transitioning the Māori economy towards a high-value sustainable future, the potential for new education and research collaborations between government and iwi, and harnessing the latent potential of young people in Auckland,” she says.
