Quake recovery pleasing but local must get work

**Cosgrove pleased with early earthquake recovery efforts, but locals must be given work  
**

Labour Earthquake Recovery spokesperson and Waimakariri MP Clayton Cosgrove has welcomed the selection of a construction company to manage the Earthquake Commission’s recovery process, but is calling on the Government to do more to ensure local workers don’t get overlooked.

The Government announced today that Fletcher Construction will manage the Earthquake Commission’s Canterbury earthquake project management office after a successful tender process.

”It is good to see progress being made to speed up the earthquake recovery process, but there is still serious concern about whether local sub-contractors and tradespeople will be given the first opportunity to carry out the rebuilding of our province,” Clayton Cosgrove said.

“Over the last two years many tradespeople within our region have lost their jobs and construction work has been particularly flat.

“Many younger people engaged in trade training have also lost apprenticeship positions --- some only months away from completion. The re-construction of our province presents a prime opportunity to provide work for both locally qualified tradespeople and those engaged in apprenticeships.”

Clayton Cosgrove will be seeking a meeting with Fletcher Construction to discuss the local employment situation and has written to Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee to raise concerns about local workers being overlooked.

“I am seeking a written guarantee from the Minister that local workers and sub-contractors will be offered reconstruction opportunities before such work is offered to people outside of the province.

“The lives of thousands of residents remain in limbo with hundreds of people out of work and out of their homes. While we cannot change the course of nature we can do everything possible to ensure that those seeking work in the rebuilding process won’t be punished twice.”
