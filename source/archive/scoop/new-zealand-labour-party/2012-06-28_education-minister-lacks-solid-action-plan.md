Education Minister lacks solid action plan

**Education Minister lacks solid action plan**

Lifting the achievement of Maori and Pacific learners is about more than arbitrary targets, and begins before our kids even get to school, says Labour’s Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta.

Her comments follow the Government’s release of its ‘to-do list’ for the public sector, including the re-announcement of lifting secondary achievement to 85 per cent of NCEA level two and the target to raise participation in early childhood education (ECE) to 98 per cent by 2016.

“Ensuring Maori and Pacific learners achieve at the highest possible standards is essential. But to reach that goal we need an action plan from the Minister, not catchy targets,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

“We know that learning begins before our kids step a foot in the classroom. That is why Labour has staunchly supported quality and accessible ECE.

"What the Minister’s ECE target overlooks is the reality that the participation rates of our youngest children are often hampered because of cost or the ability to access a local service.

“In fact July 1 this year will be the first year in a long time that ECE centres don’t receive an inflation linked funding increase. This will inevitably lead to higher fees, and mean yet another barrier to ECE participation for Māori and Pasifika families.

“Our youngest learners deserve more than just a 98% target for ECE participation. They require a plan and support to achieve that target,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

"The Minister’s second goal -- to lift the achievement of secondary students to 85 per cent of NCEA Level 2 -- is a worthy goal. But she is yet to explain what actions will be taken to lift the achievement of the significant numbers of Maori and Pacific learners.

"There’s no new plan from the Minister to lift Māori and Pasifika achievement or even improve retention of students. What we do know is that $114 million is to be ripped out of next year’s education budget to pay for her class size bungle. That’s not a good start.

"These are serious and important challenges and I hope that the Minister is willing to draw on the exemplars that currently exist in our schools, such as Kura Kaupapa and Te Wharekura, to advance the opportunities for our challenged and disadvantaged learners.

"In visiting many schools and communities around the country, I’ve seen innovative solutions which combine what's happening inside and beyond the school gate to lift Māori and Pasifika achievement.

"The Minister needs to take those lessons on board and spell out a coherent action plan sooner rather than later,” Nanaia Mahuta said.
