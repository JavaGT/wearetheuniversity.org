MARCH ISSUE

Carisbrook School building work ALL GO

I recently visited Carisbrook School to take a look at the progress being made following the merger of the three schools, Carisbrook, College St & Calton Hill in 2012.  
The new Carisbrook Main site will be ready to take in all of the Terraces site children by the start of 2014. At present the site has the full year 7 & 8 group on site and the existing year 1 - 6.  
The big question now is the future of Carisbrook Heights? Having a school up on the Corstorphine/Calton heights hill is very important and I will be watching with interest what the Ministry of Education choose to do. I have asked the Minister for her views and I will be supporting the principal and Board of Carisbrook as much as I can through this process.  
Postal Service changes a real concern  
N.Z. Post’s plan to reduce postal services within New Zealand could be a huge blow for rural New Zealand. The visit from the Rural Delivery Contractor is an essential link to the outside world for many rural residents. In my constituency this is a big concern as so much of the area is rural. Middlemarch & Taieri farmers are so very dependant on the Rural Mail services. Supporting the continuation of these services is important.

Solid Energy  
One of my tasks in Parliament is to be part of a Select Committee where politicians from across the House work on the finer details of legislation as well as holding government departments and state owned enterprises to account for their financial reports. As a member of the Commerce Select committee I have recently been involved in the financial review of Solid Energy, the state owned energy company who have just reported a debt of $389 million as a result of the drop in coal prices and pressure to return a higher dividend to the Government.

The woes of Solid Energy are a perfect example of why state assets such as the power companies should not be sold into private ownership. Electricity production is a core part of our nation’s infrastructure however they are just as vulnerable to mismanagement and bad investments as other enterprises. This governments economic mismanagement may have driven solid energy into the ground but imagine what can happen when the only incentive is to return higher dividends to shareholders as opposed to the state?

Labour has been a core part of the Keep Our Assets coalition and last week the many volunteers hard work culminated in the presentation of between 390,000-400,000 signatures to the Office of the Clerk calling for a referendum on the governments asset sales program. Voters from across the spectrum have expressed their concerns about the mixed-ownership model proposal to me throughout the Keep Our Assets campaign and deserve to have their voices heard by the government.  
Synthetic Cannabis in our community  
This issue has been highlighted in the last 6 weeks with visits to schools and speaking to community leaders. Clare Curran's opinion piece was published on Friday 15th March. Take a look at ...

Youth Parliament Entries  
We had 2 very capable young woman as finalists in the Dunedin South Youth Parliament competition. Congratulations to Kate Gardner from Bayfield High School and Nuvindi Basnayake from Queens High School for their high class entries and speeches. The winner was Kate Gardner who will now represent me at Parliament in Wellington on 16th & 17th July.  
Social Services Dunedin Meeting  
Jacinda Ardern who holds the Labour Party Social Services and Children portfolios, visited Dunedin on March 14 to speak at a Social Services meeting run by my office. David Clark and I hosted Jacinda and then later that day we hosted David Shearer, who attended the ID Fashion Emerging Designers Awards.  
David Shearer at ID Fashion  
David Shearer's first ID Fashion Show & the firsttime a political party leader has attended an ID fashion event.....It was a great night and I encourage you to keep supporting this event and what it brings to Dunedin.

**CURTAIN BANK**  
**What is a Curtain Bank?**  
The Dunedin Curtain Bank is a not for profit organization set up to collect curtains, repair, reline and  
wash them then distribute them to those in need (low income households, families, elderly,  
disabled, immigrants and others in need).  
Curtains provide a low cost and effective insulation for  
windows (which lose the most heat in a house, even double glazed windows). Curtains make a  
home cheaper and easier to heat, while also providing privacy, improved ambiance and most  
importantly of all health benefits**.**

**Why We Need You?**  
The role of partner agencies is a key part of the curtain recycling service. We rely on our partner  
agencies in the community to identify people in need of curtains. In some cases, an agency or  
business is willing to be a drop off point for donors unable to drop their curtains at the Curtain Bank  
itself.  
Agencies will be supplied with all information referral forms and vouchers to help the client and us identify what is needed.

**How to Be Involved**  
If you are interested in being a referral agency for the Dunedin Curtain Bank or just wish to be kept  
abreast of what we are up to please contact us, preferably by email, and let us know.  
Contact : [curtainbank@gmail.com](mailto:curtainbank@gmail.com)

**Our office will be closed for Easter and staff training from 29 March to 5th April. Reopening again 8th April.**
