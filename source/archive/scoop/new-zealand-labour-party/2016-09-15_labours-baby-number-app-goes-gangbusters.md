**Labour’s baby number app goes gangbusters**

An [interactive tool](http://www.labour.org.nz/babynumber) that celebrates Labour’s achievements in health over the decades has become an online hit, says Labour’s Health spokesperson Annette King.

“Since the tool was launched last night, 18 thousand people have used it to find their baby number – an average of one person every three seconds.

“The interactive app will tell you which number baby you are in our public health system and lead you on a journey through New Zealand’s health system.

“This week is the 78th anniversary of the Social Security Act 1938, which created New Zealand’s public health system.

“Those reforms of the First Labour Government were crucial in creating a health system that now deals with everything from affordable GP visits to hospital care.

“Our public health system is under threat from the National Government’s $1.7 billion of cuts to health.

“The Labour Party of today is as committed to a world class public health system as we were when we created it in 1938,” says Annette King.
