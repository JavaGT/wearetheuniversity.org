Statement to Parliament – Christchurch Earthquake
=================================================

**Statement to Parliament – Christchurch Earthquake  
**

Mr Speaker.

I pay tribute to the people of Christchurch and Canterbury for their resilience and courage, and readiness to look after each other and think of others whose plight is worse than their own.

I saw that first hand as we went around some of the worst areas of devastation.

I remember in particular talking to people at Pine Beach, where house after house had sunk or slipped off their foundations and have been marked for demolition.

When I expressed concern for the plight of one young family loading a trailer with their possessions, they said to me it was alright. In a country like ours they would get assistance where people suffering in places like Pakistan had lost their livelihood and would face famine and disease.

Neighbours were helping neighbours and lending a helping hand to others who were on their own and offering them comfort and support.

People were out on the streets, clearing up the silt and debris and working to get their lives back together.

I heard this morning of students in Christchurch organising themselves into volunteer work forces and going out to give help where it was needed.

And I want to pay tribute to the work of Civil Defence and emergency services, and the contractors who have made amazing efforts to help restore vital services

The Linesmen and team at Orion who are now close to restoring power throughout the city

The water supply engineers who have worked around the clock to repair the mains and restore water supplies

Groups like the Sallies and Red Cross teams who are out there giving assistance and support to those who need it

It makes you proud to be a New Zealander to see the efforts that communities are making to care for others and the decency of most people.

I acknowledge the work done by the Mayor and Civil Defence. I thank them for their commitment.

My Parliamentary Colleagues Brendon Burns, Ruth Dyson, Lianne Dalziel and Clayton Cosgrove are not in the House today. They are out in their constituencies ensuring that their offices can help people get information and connect with the help that is available.

Brendon and his wife Philippa can’t return to their home. It’s been too badly damaged. But that hasn’t stopped them getting out and helping others.

Lianne Dalziel got her first hot shower today when water was restored to her and Robbie’s home. When I spoke to them early Saturday morning they were out on the street assessing the damage and trying to help.

Clayton Cosgrove can’t get into his Rangiora office because of the damage, but he’s got his mobile office – a bus out on the road - so it’s business as usual.

Ruth Dyson has been working around her electorate, with some areas badly affected.

It is important today that we don’t just offer sympathy for the people of Canterbury but that we ensure that they get all the support they need to recover from the trying circumstances that they are in.

What I saw on the ground was worse than the impression gained from the media.

There are streets where no one will be able to return to their homes, which will be condemned.

Thousands more are coping with significant structural damage.

People are left uncertain about what it will mean for their future.

For some it’s their livelihoods as well as their homes. A woman I talked to in Edgeware Street in St Albans – her home was damaged, but across the road her business had been totally destroyed.

How does she cope when her income has been destroyed but the bills keep coming in?

How do her employees get on when there is no way to pay the wages?

We need to respond positively to Peter Townsend of the Christchurch Chamber of Commerce when he stresses the need for Government to provide help.

You can’t totally support investors who make the wrong decisions with $1.7 billion but not help people whose plight is through no fault of their own.

There isn’t room for Party politics in this. We promised to the Government that there would be no question time today because this is the first sitting day since the earthquake. The combativeness of question time is not consistent with the united approach this Parliament should take in assisting those, victim to the earthquake.

All New Zealanders would support the strongest assistance we can give being made available to the people of Christchurch and the region.

All of us know that there but for the Grace of God any community or region might have gone.

I urge the Government to err on the side of generosity in helping people get their lives back together.

People need certainty. They need information. They need to know as soon as possible what their entitlements are and what they can expect.

They have been stoical but people are tired, they are stressed, their children and elderly folk have often been traumatised.

The Labour Opposition will support any necessary initiatives to help people cope and help them to recover.

We should take a moment to note our gratitude for a situation which could have been much worse.

The quake happened at 4.35AM. Had it been 4.35PM, there would have been fatalities and scores more casualties.

And in a first world country with proper standards, building codes and regulations most modern buildings withstood the test. When it comes to streamlining compliance it is a lesson that we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater.

To Cantabrians I offer Labour’s support, care and commitment to work with you to overcome the adversity you have suffered.

ENDS
