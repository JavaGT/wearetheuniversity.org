Vandals target empty housing stock

8 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT

Vandals target empty housing stock

  
Labour’s Associate Maori Affairs spokesperson, Rino Tirikatene, is concerned with reports of empty state homes and growing incidents of vandalism in the Wellington region. In 2012 Labour revealed almost 3000 state homes were empty.

“The best way to end vandalism against the state housing stock is have whanau living in them. It makes sense to tenant homes, not invite vandals with an empty target” Mr Tirikatene said.

“As the Associate Minister of Housing, our people expect Tariana Turia to do more to help more get Maori whanau into state housing”.

Vandalism against empty state homes is not confined to the Wellington region. Recently 20 vacant state homes were vandalised in the Napier suburb of Maraenui.

“Empty state homes have a disproportionate effect on Maori whanau. There are thousands of whanau on the Housing New Zealand waiting list, a high proportion will be Maori whanau” said Mr Tirikatene.

“I have had constituents approach me and ask why the government has thousands of whanau on the waiting lists, but thousands of empty homes too. There is a supply of homes that is not being used to meet the demand. The government has to step up and utilise the empty homes”.
