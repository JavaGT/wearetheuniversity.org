Groser not focussed on value of conservation

22 April 2009 Media Statement

Groser not focussed on value of conservation

  
New Zealand’s conservation estate is a valuable asset that needs protecting, Labour Conservation Spokesperson Steve Chadwick says

“Tim Groser is a part-time Minister of Conservation who is missing the importance of New Zealand’s most precious resources; our natural environment,” Steve Chadwick.

“The Minister can simply not ‘do’ Conservation on a Thursday as he has reportedly instructed his staff.

“Leadership in the vital Conservation role takes more than one day a week if New Zealand is to continue to be a world leader in this area.

Ms Chadwick was disappointed that the Government had chosen to allow part of Oteake Conservation Park in North Otago to be used lignite mine sometime in the future.

“In Government Labour worked to protect this valuable land from ever being mined. It is disappointing that the National Party has not seen the value of protecting this land.

“There will be no benefit to New Zealand’s economy in the short-term from this move, but the damage done to our international reputation as a country that cares about the environment could be significant. Greenpeace have already condemned the move.

“The National Government needs to think of the Conservation Estate as a precious resource in itself that needs protecting rather than changing the boundaries to suit themselves,” Steve Chadwick said.
