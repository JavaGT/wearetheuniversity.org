Nats duck for cover on community education cuts

National MPs should have had the guts to front up to a public meeting in Auckland last night on cuts to adult and community education, says Labour Tertiary Education spokesperson Maryan Street.

Maryan Street said Education Minister Anne Tolley had told adult and community education meeting organisers no National MPs would be attending the meeting hosted by Western Springs College, but I didn’t believe they would all lack the courage to show up.

“This is gutless behaviour from National MPs. The cuts to night classes have caused huge concern in the community. This was evidenced by the fact about 350 people attended this meeting alone. It is not good enough for National MPs to duck for cover.

“National MPs like Nikki Kaye, Sam Lotu-Iiga and Paula Bennett voted for these education cuts. It’s one thing for a Government to make decisions, but in our democracy it is fundamental that MPs front up to the people and explain themselves.

“The cuts contained in the July Budget slashed 80% of funding to schools-based adult and community education,” Maryan Street says.

“Tens of thousands of Aucklanders are affected by the cuts. National has some 15 MPs based in Auckland. Surely one of them could have been delegated to attend the meeting. Three Labour MPs made the effort.”
