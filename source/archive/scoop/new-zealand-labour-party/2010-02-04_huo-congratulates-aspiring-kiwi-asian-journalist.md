**Huo Congratulates Aspiring Kiwi-Asian Journalist**

**Labour Associate Ethnic Affairs spokesperson Raymond Huo has congratulated Corazon Miller for being the inaugural recipient of the Asia New Zealand Foundation Kiwi-Asian Journalism Scholarship.**

**“As the first recipient of this scholarship, Corazon Miller will lead the way for other aspiring Kiwi-Asian journalists who may wish to contribute in this modern era of bridge building across cultures and countries,” said Raymond Huo.**

**“With a growing Asian population in New Zealand and a strengthening business market, it is vitally important for us to promote understanding and familiarity with Asia and its people,” Raymond Huo said.**

**“Ethnic minorities need to have their voice and opinions heard in the mainstream media in order to provide an easier transition into New Zealand society. This initiative will promote inter-community understanding and help prepare newly-arrived Kiwi-Asians to become contributing members of society.”**

**Corazon Miller, of Filipino and New Zealand European descent, has enrolled in a Post Graduate Diploma in Communications Studies with a Journalism Major at AUT University in Auckland. The Scholarship will pay up to $5000 on completion of Ms Miller’s journalism study.**

**“I want to encourage all Kiwi-Asians with a passion for Journalism to follow Miss Miller into a career in journalism,” Raymond Huo said.**

**“With a large and growing Asian population in New Zealand, it is important that we have a base of Asian journalists who can effectively communicate Asian issues in the media.**

“I must also commend the Asia-NZ Foundation for this fantastic initiative which will have ongoing benefits for the Asian community in New Zealand.”

The Kiwi-Asian Journalism Scholarship is designed to attract more young Kiwi-Asians into journalism study and to encourage increased representation of Asian communities in mainstream journalism. Applications for the 2011 scholarship will open in August.
