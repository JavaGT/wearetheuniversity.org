5 September 2008 Media Statement

It’s Time to Meet the Locals

Local Labour List MP Darien Fenton is encouraging people in Helensville and surrounding areas to get out and experience New Zealand’s amazing wildlife as part of Conservation Week 2008.

“We are lucky enough to be surrounded by spectacular wildlife in New Zealand, most of which is not found anywhere else in the world. Conservation Week is a chance to really celebrate all that’s special in this country, whether it’s animals, plants, places or people,” said Darien Fenton.

The theme for this year is ‘Meet the Locals – Tutakitia te Iwi Kainga’, and the aim is to connect people with the ‘locals’ in their regions, whether it is local species, local places, or the local people who are working to protect New Zealand’s unique wildlife.

“I encourage the local community to get out and make the most of our natural treasures. This week you could try a local walking track through our native bush, visit one of our fantastic heritage sites, or just simply appreciate seeing a tui or a fantail in your backyard.

“There’s plenty happening and lots of opportunities to take part in some of the events planned to celebrate Conservation Week across New Zealand.

There are a range of events planned for Conservation Week which will begin with the official opening of Taputeranga Marine Reserve on Wellington’s South Coast on the 7th September and with a family fun day at Auckland Zoo, and concluded with an event at Wellington Zoo on the 14th September.

“The conservation of our natural and historic heritage is part of our national identity. This is a chance to celebrate conservation, and its social, physical, environmental and economic benefits. It’s also a chance to recognise the thousands of volunteers and hundreds of community groups protecting and restoring New Zealand’s native plant and animal life, for the benefit of the wider community.”
