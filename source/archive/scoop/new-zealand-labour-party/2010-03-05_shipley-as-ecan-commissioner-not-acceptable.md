Shipley as ECAN Commissioner not acceptable

**Shipley as ECAN Commissioner not acceptable**  

It appears the Government is setting up a cronies network to get its way on the management of Canterbury’s water, Labour’s water spokesman Brendon Burns said today.

“Environment Minister Nick Smith may say reports that former National Prime Minister Jenny Shipley is being considered as a Commissioner for Environment Canterbury are ‘premature speculation’, but this smacks of him lining up National mates to implement a pre-determined Government agenda.

“The future management of Canterbury water is too precious to be handed over to a succession of former National Government Ministers.

“ECAN was reviewed by Mrs Shipley’s former Deputy Prime Minister, Wyatt Creech, who began a dairy company convicted of repeated breaches of the RMA.

“Now, Jenny Shipley appears to be front-runner to take control of managing Canterbury’s water resource. This looks like a National Party jack-up.

“Already the Prime Minister is saying he wants a quick resolution in Canterbury so more water can be allocated.

“That ignores that we’ve already lost our right to swim safely in Canterbury streams due to agricultural intensification, mostly around growth in dairying.

“The last thing we want is someone with close National Party links who can rapidly implement the Government’s agenda and only pay lip-service to the hugely important, complex needs of improving water quality.”

Brendon Burns said Jenny Shipley was the ideological soul-mate of former National MPs Ruth Richardson and Don Brash, both of whom sit on the boards of dairy companies in Canterbury.

“ECAN was by no means perfect on water management but it was beginning to try and slow the gold-rush for water and improve water quality.

“The Government should be looking at giving ECAN expertise and resource, while upholding the principle of no taxation without representation.

“Nick Smith should think twice before he appoints Jenny Shipley or someone similar at Canterbury ratepayers’ expense to run a Government rapid growth agenda is unacceptable every level.”
