Kiwis tell John Key: We don’t want your whaling
===============================================

**Kiwis tell John Key: We don’t want your commercial whaling**

Public pressure is building on Prime Minister John Key over his plans to allow commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean.

Yesterday the Labour Party launched an online petition for people who oppose the resumption of commercial whaling. In less than 24 hours more than one thousand people have signed the petition already.

Labour’s Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Chris Carter said “Whales are critically endangered animals, and they depend on the resolve of conservation minded countries and individuals to avoid extinction at a time of global climate change and increasing marine pollution.

“John Key’s great plan to save the whales is apparently allowing the Japanese and other nations to hunt them for profit. Mr Key has abandoned our long-time anti-whaling ally, Australia, and placed New Zealand in the group of countries that are prepared to continue to hunt endangered species. He has truly threatened our international clean green image.

“The large response to Labour’s petition shows that New Zealanders are horrified by the Prime Minister’s decision,” Mr Carter said.

“Labour is calling again for Mr Key to stand up for New Zealand. Compare our Prime Minister’s kowtowing to a handful of whaling nations with Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s clear choice to Japan’s whalers; if Japan does not voluntarily end its whaling programme by November of this year then Australia will take a case against them to the International Court of Justice.

“The public has a right to be heard on this important issue and John Key’s appalling move can only be stopped by public pressure,” Mr Carter said.

“I continue to urge people to sign the petition and send a strong message that Kiwis do not support commercial whaling.”
