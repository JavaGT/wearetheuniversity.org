Political Endorsement for Efu Koka in Otara By-Election

Labour MP, Su’a William Sio is announcing to church and community leaders that he is personally endorsing Mr Efu Koka to become Otara Councillor in the upcoming by-election (July 8-30).

“I promised the Otara community when they farewelled me last month that I would be recommending someone to them as the best person to replace me as Otara Councillor on Manukau City Council.”

“I am pleased to say that I have no hesitation whatsoever in commending Mr Efu Koka to the Otara community as the person they should support and vote for.”

“I have worked with Efu for a long time. He is highly intelligent, a strong advocate for the local community, and a hard worker. He is business savvy, he has strong political sense, and is home grown talent from Otara.”

“I want to make sure that the right person is representing Otara on council, and I believe that Efu is that person. Efu can work with people from all walks of life and will be a good role model for the next generation of future community leaders.”

Efu Koka is of Samoan and Niuean heritage and was raised and educated at local schools Mayfield Primary, Bairds Intermediate and Hillary College.

He has been a loyal member of the Labour party for many years and brings both business experience and workers advocate skills as a former organiser with the Engineering Printing & Manufacturing Union (EPMU).

His business experience includes a healthy portfolio in property investment, and as franchise licensee in NSW Australia and Europe for a Car Stacking System which has been marketed as a world leader in car parking infrastructure.

He is also a current alumni member of the Commonwealth Leaders Dialogue who was chosen from hundreds of applicants to participate in the Future Pacific Leaders Forum in 2006.

Voting papers will be sent out to all electors in the Otara ward from Tuesday 8 July 2008. Voting closes on Wednesday 30 July at 12 noon.
