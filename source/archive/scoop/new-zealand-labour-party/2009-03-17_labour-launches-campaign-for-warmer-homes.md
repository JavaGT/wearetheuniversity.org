Labour launches campaign for warmer homes

Labour launches campaign for warmer homes, green jobs

Labour Leader Phil Goff today launched a Labour campaign calling for the creation of a comprehensive insulation programme to help families make their homes warmer, drier and healthier.

At the launch in Greymouth today, Labour unveiled a new website www.healthyhomeshealthykiwis.org.nz, which will provide information on the campaign. The Website can be accessed via a link on the www.labour.org.nz site.

“A nationwide programme, which builds on the $1 billion home retrofit assistance package Labour put in place last year, but cancelled by National, would make New Zealand homes much healthier and would save on power bills,” Phil Goff said.

“At a time when hundreds of Kiwis are losing their jobs every week, the scheme makes more sense than ever. The building industry is at its lowest point in 34 years, with thousands of jobs at risk. Retrofitting insulation and other energy saving devices in New Zealand’s coldest homes would create a significant number of jobs.

“There is huge demand in the community. A recent study by the Business Council for Sustainable Development found that more than one million New Zealand homes are not properly insulated, leaving them cold, damp, mouldy and draughty and contributing to New Zealand high rates of asthma and respiratory infections.

“If all our homes were warm and dry, we could reduce by 50 people a day those going to hospital with respiratory infections, and cut sick days off work by 180,000 a year.

“I have already called on National to admit it was wrong and reverse its short-sighted decision to cancel the programme,” Phil Goff said.

“Other countries have shown they have the imagination and clear headedness to include similar schemes into their economic recovery plans.

“Australia is providing free ceiling insulation for home owners and subsidies for rental owners, and last week the Obama administration announced it would invest $8 billion to retrofit US homes – putting ‘87,000 Americans to work and \[saving\] families hundreds of dollars per year on their energy bills’.

“Labour proposes the formation of partnerships between central and local government, power companies, building and manufacturing companies and community groups to roll the scheme out around the country.

“Labour is calling for the public to support the campaign. We encourage Kiwis to send their stories about living in cold homes to the healthyhomes Website, sign a petition, write to their local newspapers, and talk to their friends, family, workmates and local community groups,” Phil Goff said.
