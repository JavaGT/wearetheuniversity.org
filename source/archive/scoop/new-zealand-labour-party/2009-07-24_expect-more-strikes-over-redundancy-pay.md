Expect more strikes over redundancy pay

Associate Labour spokesperson Darien Fenton says today’s strike by Telco workers throughout the country seeking redundancy protection highlights the problem of having no statutory redundancy entitlements.

“The Government has shown no interest in implementing an Advisory Group report, produced last year that called for minimum notice and redundancy compensation, but today’s actions show that workers are more than interested,” says Ms Fenton.

“I’m aware that redundancy protection has become a priority issue for many workers in collective bargaining, and I predict there will be more industrial unrest over this issue.

Darien Fenton said there are tens of thousands of New Zealand workers who have no redundancy protection in their employment agreements.

“The Minister, Kate Wilkinson says it is not her priority to impose redundancy costs on business.

“However, she seems willing to let workers bear the cost of losing their jobs and that’s simply unfair.

Darien Fenton has drafted a members’ Bill which would provide for minimum notice of redundancy and compensation.
