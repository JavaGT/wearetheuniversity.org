John Key is in denial over his Government’s record of persistently high unemployment, increasing child poverty and a double credit downgrade, Labour Campaign spokesperson Grant Robertson says.

“This is not about John Key as a person. This is about the record of his government. The fact is he has not led New Zealanders to the brighter future he promised them,” Grant Robertson said.

“While the Government is obviously not responsible for the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes, it is responsible for providing strong leadership and good policy to deal with the long-term problems we face. Sitting on the side-lines is not good enough.

“John Key should explain his Government’s record. That’s why Labour released 10 vital statistics showing that New Zealand is going backwards. He shouldn’t dismiss the scrutiny with a glib one-liner. New Zealanders deserve more than that.

“Labour wants to debate policy at this election, and that means looking at the record of this government on delivering on policy, and on the commitments that both parties are making.

“This election is a choice between National’s assets sales agenda and Labour’s plan to keep assets and deal with the long term issues facing New Zealand,” Grant Robertson said.
