Funding cuts cost regions vital services

  
The problems faced by Dunstan Hospital in Central Otago are symptomatic of the Government’s nation-wide neglect of the regions, Labour’s Health spokesperson and Deputy Leader Annette King says.

“Warnings that Dunstan may be forced to turn patients away because of a planned $500,000 funding cut, despite growing demand for its services, will come as no surprise to other local providers.

“National has long had its head in the sand when it comes to the recognising the importance of small, rural hospitals.

“It refused a request for funding for the redevelopment of Dunstan way back in 1998, instead suggesting the community should raise the money.

“It was thanks to a Labour Government that the locals got an upgraded facility, as did other regions including Kaitaia, Thames, Murchison, the Wairarapa , Hawera and Blenheim to name a few.

“Increased demand for its services means Dunstan is now facing new challenges. Any cuts to its budget – and Southern DHB is already operating on a $21 million deficit – will not only cost services but will also cost jobs.

“It’s time for the Government to get real about what’s happening in the provinces and reassure these communities hospital services will be maintained.”
