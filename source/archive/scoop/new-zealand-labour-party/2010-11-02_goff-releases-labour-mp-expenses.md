Goff releases Labour MP expenses

Labour Leader Phil Goff today released the full costs of Labour MPs' expenses for July, August and September.

"I believe that MP expenses should be transparent and made public. I do not agree that some costs should be withheld. We all need to be accountable for the expenses we incur as we do our jobs as MPs.

"That's why I'm releasing our full costs today. These show that international travel, spousal travel and personal domestic travel accounts for 8 per cent of Labour's total travel and accommodation expenses.

"As the Speaker has already noted, this amount has been deducted from MPs’ salaries. But I'm concerned that withholding these figures creates an impression the cost is much higher than it actually is, so I've decided to release Labour's totals.

"I'm calling on all other party leaders to show the same commitment to transparency and to release the details of their MPs' expenses and for the Speaker to return to the former - and more transparent - form of release,” Phil Goff said.
