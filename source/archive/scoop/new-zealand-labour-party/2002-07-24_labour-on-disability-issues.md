Labour On Disability Issues

LABOUR’S VISION AND ACHIEVEMENTS

Labour’s approach to disability issues is based on a commitment to human rights, partnership and inclusion. Significant progress has been made on implementing our 1999 Manifesto policies in relation to Disability Issues. The portfolio of Minister for Disability Issues was created and the Disability Strategy was released, with a comprehensive action plan. Our 2002 policy is based on the continued implementation of that Strategy.

Human Rights

Labour believes that people with disabilities have equal rights to those of other New Zealanders and that these rights must be protected by the Human Rights Act, and throughout other relevant legislation.

Treaty Partnership

Labour recognises that the Treaty of Waitangi is New Zealand’s founding document and is committed to fulfilling its obligation as a Treaty partner in government.

Attitudinal Change

The key issue of concern raised in the Disability Strategy was that of negative attitudes. Labour will continue to promote a truly inclusive society, including specific actions to bring about attitudinal change.

The State Sector

Labour has established the Office for Disability Issues as part of its strong commitment to the whole-of-government approach of the Disability Strategy.
