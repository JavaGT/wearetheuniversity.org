**Carter, Huo back Government relief fund in Indonesia and Southeast Asia**

  
The initial $1 million Government emergency natural disaster relief package for Indonesia, the Philippines, Viet Nam and Cambodia has been welcomed by Labour Foreign Affairs spokesperson Chris Carter and Associate Ethnic Affairs spokesperson Raymond Huo.

Chris Carter said the full scale of the disaster following the earthquake that struck western Sumatra on 30 September was becoming more apparent each day.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people across Southeast Asia have been displaced by the devastation of Typhoon Ketsana.

“The death toll from both tragedies continues to rise, and it is absolutely vital that countries like New Zealand provide humanitarian support and emergency relief and medical supplies,” Chris Carter said.

Raymond Huo said the hearts of Southeast Asian New Zealanders went out to the families of those who had lost loved ones.

“Many New Zealanders are anxiously waiting to hear news of family and friends, and they will particularly welcome the support of the New Zealand Government for the relief and rescue work.”
