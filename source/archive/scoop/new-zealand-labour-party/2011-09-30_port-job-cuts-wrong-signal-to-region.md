Port job cuts wrong signal to region

Clare  
CURRAN  
MP for Dunedin South

30 September 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Port job cuts wrong signal to region**

The job cuts announced today by Port Otago are another body blow to our region, Labour’s Dunedin South MP Clare Curran says.

“I understand that the jobs are being axed because management expects a decline in container numbers due to Port Otago no longer being the trans-shipment hub for shipping from Maersk.

“However at the same time the Port has delivered a record $12.5 million dividend this financial year and there’s been an increase in commodities such as logs and milk powder through the port.

“Surely this decision could have been averted. Instead 12 skilled workers will be lost to the dole queues which will undoubtedly have a flow-on effect on the wider Dunedin economy.” Clare Curran said.

“This city needs to work together and come up with solutions to grow industries and jobs, and move forward rather than continue to slide backwards.

“Dunedin and Otago urgently need an economic strategy that the whole city can buy into and get behind. The city’s leaders need to work together and commit to it.

“We have seen 44 highly skilled jobs go from Hillside in the last few months, more people are joining the dole queues or heading out of Dunedin and offshore. I want this city to move ahead and thrive, not to shrink.

“In the absence of a regional growth strategy from the National Government we need to take charge of our own region and work together. I am committed to doing that and ask Port Otago to buy into it too.” Clare Curran said.
