Adult who supplied 9y/o with alcohol must be held to account

MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Adult who supplied 9-year-old with alcohol must be held to account**

Hamilton-based Labour MP Sue Moroney and Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta are meeting with local Police to ensure the adult who supplied alcohol to a nine-year-old boy is held accountable for his or her actions.

“There is something very wrong about any adult thinking that it's fun, entertaining or appropriate to get a child drunk. This attitude is a wake-up call about the culture of drinking and youth drinking, that is going unchallenged right across New Zealand," said Sue Moroney.

"The Labour Party challenges this damaging culture - we must change attitudes and support families to do their best for our next generation.

"It will also be a test of the Government's alcohol law change of December 2013 which made an offence of supplying alcohol to a minor, without parental consent.

“Labour supported the Government's alcohol law reforms, but criticised them for not going far enough.

“Amongst the amendments proposed by Labour was the outright banning of RTDs such as the one supplied to the Hamilton boy. Unfortunately, it was voted down by the Government, as were Labour's other amendments to improve the law.

“The Government failed to implement all of the recommendations of the Law Commission on alcohol law reform which Labour said were needed to challenge the damaging drinking culture in New Zealand.

“We will now see if the watered-down version will make any difference,” said Sue Moroney.

“I am mindful that Fairfield is a community that wants more for its young people. While young people are still on holiday, parents must be vigilant. Greater access to youth programmes will go a long way to getting kids off the streets and finding productive ways to utilise their holiday time,” said Nanaia Mahuta.

"Labour is also backing the call from Police for the video clip which identifies the boy to be taken down immediately from You Tube. The continued viewing of this video revictimises the child.”
