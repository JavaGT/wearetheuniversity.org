Labour lodges Cantabrians’ $24k OIA request

**Labour lodges Cantabrians’ $24k OIA request**

Clayton Cosgrove has today lodged an Official Information Act request with the Earthquake Commission on behalf of the Canterbury community group that EQC proposed to charge $24,000 to process the request.

“The Wider Earthquake Communities Action Network of Canterbury (WECAN) was informed by EQC that it would be charged $24,000 for just one OIA.

“That’s unacceptable. As an MP the Ombudsman has ruled I am entitled to OIAs free of charge.

“I have today lodged the OIA with the Earthquake Commission. I expect to hear from them well within the 20 working days they are required to respond by.

“I extend this offer to other community advocacy groups that are being charged for their right to request official information,” says Clayton Cosgrove.
