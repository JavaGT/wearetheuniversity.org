John Key In La-La Land On Power Prices
======================================

**Tuesday, 23 April 2013, 10:45 am**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

Grant  
ROBERTSON  
Deputy Leader  
23 April 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT  
  
**John Key In La-La Land On Power Prices**

John Key’s claim this morning that Kiwis aren’t paying too much for their power shows just how out of touch he is, says Labour’s Deputy Leader Grant Robertson.

“John Key should tell that to the Kiwis who dread opening their power bill every month, who think twice about turning the heater on and worry that it’s too expensive to have the electric blanket going this early in the year.

“Prices are rising faster here than in many other countries. The average household power bill has gone up by $770 since 1997. But John Key told TVNZ’s _Breakfast_ show this morning that power prices aren’t too high in New Zealand. He’s living in la-la land if he believes that.

“The difference between Labour and National on this issue couldn’t be clearer.

“Labour will bring down the annual average power bill by between $230 and $330 a year. National will let prices continue to rise.

“Labour will ensure that power companies make a fair rate of return and that Kiwis get a fair deal on their power bills. National will let power companies continue to make super profits on the backs of consumers.

“John Key says a competitive market is best. Well he should get in behind Labour’s policy because it will in fact create more competition amongst retailers.

“Our plan will also put more money into people’s pockets. It will boost the economy by around $450 million and create thousands of jobs. It’s a sensible solution that benefits all New Zealanders.

“What’s National’s plan?” said Grant Robertson.
