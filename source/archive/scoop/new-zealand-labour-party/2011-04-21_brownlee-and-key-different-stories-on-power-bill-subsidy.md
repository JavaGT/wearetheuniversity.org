Brownlee and Key - different stories on power bill subsidy

BURNS

MP for Christchurch Central  

  
21 April 2011 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Brownlee and Key tell different stories on power bill subsidy**

Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee and Prime Minister John Key are at odds on the issue of paying a power bill subsidy to quake-affected Christchurch residents struggling to heat their homes, says Christchurch Central MP Brendon Burns

“On Monday morning Gerry Brownlee told Radio New Zealand that he hadn’t had time to look at the issue of a power bill subsidy,” Brendon Burns said.

“Then the same afternoon, at his post-cabinet media conference, John Key said the cabinet had had a look at the issue, and done some work on it, but it would be quite expensive and difficult.

“It is hardly comforting for Christchurch residents, with cracks in their walls, limited heating options, even more limited means to pay for those options, and in many cases probably facing the prospect of losing their jobs, to realise that the Earthquake Recovery Minister is not being kept in the loop by his cabinet colleagues.

“This is going to be one of the most crucial issues facing quake-residents this winter as the cold bites.

“Gerry Brownlee and John Key owe it to Christchurch people to get their act together.”
