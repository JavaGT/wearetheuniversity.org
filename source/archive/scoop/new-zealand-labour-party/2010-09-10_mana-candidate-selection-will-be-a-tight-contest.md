**Mana Candidate selection will be a tight contest**

Labour’s by-election campaign in Mana has begun in earnest with a contested candidate selection to be held on Saturday 18th September 2010.

Labour Party President Andrew Little says “Labour is taking nothing for granted in the Mana by-election. I am confident that any one of the four nominees would be a capable candidate to continue the outstanding local work of retiring Labour MP Hon Luamanuvao Winnie Laban.”

“The candidates are talented people” Little says, “Each candidate has a depth of experience and skills and each would make a great MP. This selection will be a tight contest and choosing the winning candidate won’t be an easy decision for the selection panel,” he said.

The four nominees are: business manager Michael Evans, press secretary Kris Faafoi, criminal defence barrister Peter Foster and communications consultant Josie Pagani.

A candidate question and answer session for Labour Party members will be held from 12.30pm, Saturday 11 September, Helen Smith Community Room, Pataka Museum, Norrie & Parumoana Streets, Porirua.

The selection meeting is taking place at Pahina Congregational Church Hall, 13 Kivell Street, Ranui Heights, Porirua East at 2pm, Saturday, 18 September. The selection meeting is open to all Labour Party members.

Brief bios and contact details of the nominees attached.
