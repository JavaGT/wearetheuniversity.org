Concerns for seniors as Budget Day looms

**Concerns for seniors as Budget Day looms  
**  
With nearly 60 percent of elderly reliant solely on Superannuation, concerns are growing about what the Budget will hold for them, Labour Senior Citizens spokesperson Ross Robertson says.

“I am aware that the number of people reliant solely on Superannuation is steadily increasing and this means increasing numbers of people will be watching the Budget process intently,” Ross Robertson said.

“So far seniors have already had cutbacks to home support services, the SuperGold card scheme is under review, surgeons have said ACC is declining more people for surgery based on their age, safe driver training programmes for elderly have been axed and ACC has scrapped falls prevention programmes that aim to keep elderly safe at home.

“What we are seeing is a National Government which considers programmes for seniors as an opportunity to cut costs.

“Cutting prevention programmes in order to save health dollars in the short term is a false economy that will result in greater costs in the long term”.

“A study released by Age Concern in March this year said that one in 13 persons over the age of 65 did not have enough money to meet their everyday needs.

“That is extremely concerning and with GP fees increasing last year and many seniors in areas like Southland and Otago and Kapiti Coast now being asked to pay for home help increasing numbers will find their budgets stretched even further.

“There are over 500,000 Superannuitants in New Zealand and so far the National Government has completely ignored their needs,” Ross Robertson said.
