Basin flyover delay good news for Wellingtonians

The delay in the Board of Inquiry process for the Basin Reserve flyover is good news for Wellingtonians as it increases the prospect of a better transport solution in this historic part of the city, Wellington Labour MPs Grant Robertson and Annette King say.

“A delay in this inquiry has been inevitable for some time. There are a large number of submitters and experts to hear, and cross examination to take place. The Minister was warned about this and received requests to extend the process, but she ignored them. She really has no right to be ‘disappointed’ about the delay,” Grant Robertson says.

“What this now means is that there is no chance of work on the flyover commencing before the election, whatever the decision of the Board of Inquiry. Labour has said for some time that we believe there are better options for dealing with traffic flow around the Basin, as part of an overall sustainable transport solution. We are committed to giving those alternatives a fair hearing and ensuring that Wellingtonians get the best long term solution for their city,” Annette King says.

“The evidence presented to the Board of Inquiry so far has seriously undermined the case for the flyover. Most of the time saving for traffic claimed in the flyover proposal actually comes from the Memorial Park tunnel and other changes, not the flyover itself. The inquiry has also highlighted that the main congestion point in the area is the Mt Victoria tunnel, not the Basin Reserve,” Grant Robertson says.

“We believe a solution that address the main congestion point, makes other roading improvements and promotes more efficient and reliable public transport is possible and under Labour will become a reality,” Annette King says.
