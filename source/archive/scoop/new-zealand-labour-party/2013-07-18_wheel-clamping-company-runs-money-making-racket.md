Wheel clamping company runs money-making racket

A wheel clamping company is fleecing unsuspecting mums and dads, picking their kids up from school, of thousands of dollars, Labour MP for Mt Roskill Phil Goff says.

A supermarket car park, opposite Mt Roskill Primary School, is a popular point used by parents of three schools wanting a safe place to pick their children up from.

“I understand the concern of retailers who want the car park available for their customers.

“But the NZ Wheel Clamping Company is using enforcement as a money-making racket, with motorists copping hefty charges for parking there for less than two minutes.

“The company takes photos of cars using the car park, some of which belong to supermarket shoppers, then follows up with a bill for $100.

“If that’s not paid within two weeks ‘administration fees’ are charged, adding hundreds of dollars to the original bill, and debt collectors may be called in.

“In one case a local business owner - who used the park for a total of one minute while he opened a garage adjacent to it - had a $100 fee imposed. Another who parked outside an empty warehouse for two minutes was clamped and had to pay $200.

“Worse, a number of parents with English as a second language have received bills of up to $500 for being in the car park for minutes without realising they were doing anything wrong.

“The company is fleecing people who can ill-afford it. Yes, there is a problem for the retailers, but this is not the answer.”

Mr Goff has called a meeting of local school principals, board representatives and Auckland Transport to try to find a solution.

“In the meantime people should know that advice from the Automobile Association and Consumer Affairs is that the Wheel Clamping Company has no statutory authority to fine people,” he said.

“Rather than pay the bill people should invite the Company to take the matter to a Disputes Tribunal.”
