**Minister grasping at straws on National Standards**

The Minister is grasping at straws trumpeting an ER0 report claiming that just 37% of schools were well prepared for National Standards at the end of the first year of implementation, Labour education spokesperson Sue Moroney says.

“The ERO report highlights what a huge distraction the National Standards have been for schools since their introduction last year,” Sue Moroney said.

“The report highlights high levels of confusion among teachers and parents about what the National Standards are and this is not surprising given the haste with which they were introduced and the inconsistent way they are being applied. This means there is nothing national, nor standard about this shambles.

“Labour would rather have schools putting that time and into providing quality education for New Zealand children, than complying with the Minister's instructions on standards they have no faith in.

“No wonder 750 school principals took a vote of no confidence in this Minister and her Government's National Standards.

“Schools are implementing the National standards under the threat of action being taken by the Ministry of education if they don't and still only 37% appear to be well prepared to do this after a year of them being in place.  
“The Minister’s approach to education has not only driven a wedge between herself and teachers but also between parents and teachers.

“Anne Tolley has no idea what she is doing when it comes to building an education sector where teachers, parents and the Government work together in the best interests of students,” Sue Moroney said.
