Government Must Support Canterbury Uni
======================================

WOODS  
Tertiary Education Spokesperson  
28 February 2013 MEDIA STATEMENT

**Government Must Support Canterbury Uni**  

The Government must give Canterbury University certainty about its future as soon as possible as it stares down the barrel of a $67 million deficit, mostly related to earthquake recovery costs, says Labour’s Tertiary Education spokesperson Megan Woods.

“Tertiary Education Minister Steven Joyce must answer the simple question of whether the National Government is committed to having a University in Christchurch or not.

“If the answer is yes, then he needs to commit to expediting Cabinet’s funding negotiations with the University and giving them the surety they need to plan for their future.

“The University, like all Cantabrians, need and deserve that certainty so they can get on the job of rebuilding. The Government’s lack of urgency on the funding plan for the University means it cannot move forward.

“Labour is committed to a strong University at the heart of the rebuilt city,” said Megan Woods.
