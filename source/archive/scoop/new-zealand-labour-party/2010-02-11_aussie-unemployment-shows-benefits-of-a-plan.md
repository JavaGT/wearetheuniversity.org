Aussie Unemployment Shows Benefits Of A Plan

**Aussie Unemployment Trend Shows Benefits Of Having A Plan  
**  
Australians are reaping the benefits of their Government having a clear plan to weather the recession with their unemployment level falling for the fourth consecutive month, Labour Leader Phil Goff said today.

“In contrast John Key’s lack of a plan to keep the Kiwi economy moving has seen unemployment reach a 16 year high, jumping 0.8% in the last quarter to 7.3%,” Phil Goff said.

“168,000 Kiwis are now unemployed and National has done little to help protect or create jobs. New Zealand’s unemployment rate is now over a third higher than across the Tasman.

“Kevin Rudd in Australia committed the Australian Labour Government to tackling unemployment as a priority and developed a plan and a stimulus package to do so.

“In New Zealand all we have had is the rhetoric of the Jobs Summit, and the impact of the last Labour budget which did provide stimulation to counteract the international downturn.”

Phil Goff says Australians are now benefiting from their Government’s approach by going back to work in their thousands.

“Unfortunately for Kiwis, National party inaction has meant uncertainty still looms around the job market,” Phil Goff said.

“That is the reality that thousands of Kiwis are living because of John Key’s lack of commitment to any plan to keep Kiwis in work.

“Australia has enjoyed a Government that has been proactive, has stimulated the economy and has committed itself to investing more in skills training and education.

“Instead of making jobs his priority, John Key has made breaking his election promises his priority.

“How many jobs will be created by hiking GST up to 15%? Why didn’t we hear how John Key’s GST plan will create jobs earlier this week?

“Kiwis struggling to make ends meet will be looking across the Tasman and seeing unemployment falling while at home their Prime Minister wants to lift GST to 15%.

“You can’t blame them for wanting to scratch their heads.”
