Council changes more bad news for students

The signal from Steven Joyce that he will move to reduce the size of University Councils is further bad news for students, in the wake of cuts to allowances and a hike in the repayment rate for student loans, says Labour’s Tertiary Education Spokesperson Grant Robertson.

"When National took the axe to Polytechnic Councils last term, it was students and community members who got the chop. It will likely be the same for universities.

"Students, staff and the wider community are important stakeholders in universities. They bring a perspective that is unique and helps the institutions perform their legislated role to be the critic and conscience of society.

"As usual Mr Joyce is looking at this through his accountant's eye, seeing the cost of everything and the value of nothing. Universities are not simply sausage factories pumping out products. They are an important part of our democratic society, supporting accountability and transparency.

"They have a vital role in the economy, and in promoting innovation. This means they need to manage their finances well, and generally speaking they do a good job of this.

"If Mr Joyce really wants to see universities play an increased role in our future economic development he could focus on supporting them to be more collaborative and focused on developing their particular strengths.

"To that end, his announcement that there will be a further review of the Performance Based Research Fund is welcome. It’s good that he has heeded the call of Labour, the Tertiary Education Union and others that the scheme needs a thorough re-look to ensure its goals are being met.

"Mr Joyce has a solution in search of a problem when it comes to reducing the size of University Councils. He should let them get on with their job and stop meddling in matters that will not make a significant difference to the quality of education and research being produced,” said Grant Robertson.
