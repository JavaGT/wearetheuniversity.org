ANZAC poppy loss a blow to Canterbury

**ANZAC poppy loss a blow to Canterbury**

The loss of the Kilmarnock Enterprise Contract for making ANZAC poppies is a big blow to the Canterbury region, Labour MP for Port Hills Ruth Dyson said today.

“The poppies are worn as a mark of respect for the men and women who served in our armed forces on our behalf, with many paying the ultimate sacrifice with their lives,” Ruth Dyson said.

“For this extremely special recognition to be shipped overseas for production is a very sad move.”

The contract in Christchurch is worth about $132,000 and the loss of that income is a very harsh way for the employer and workforce to move into Christmas,” Ruth Dyson said.

“It is also very obvious that the staff were very proud to be able to make the poppies, knowing that so many people would be wearing them on ANZAC day.

“Canterbury has been hit hard this year by the earthquake and the impact on businesses is significant. It is the worst possible time for us to be losing further income,” Ruth Dyson said.
