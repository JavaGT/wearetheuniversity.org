**Labour mourns the loss of Tapihana Shelford**

_E rere i runga i nga parirau o Tawhirimatea haere i runga i te ara o nga rangatira o nga kingi me te rawa kore haere atu ra haere oti atu e ..._

“The New Zealand Labour Party extends its deep sympathy to the family of Tapihana Shelford, a friend and committed stalwart,” Hauraki-Waikato MP Nanaia Mahuta said.

“Tapihana was hugely respected throughout New Zealand.

“The great-grandson of Paraire Karaka Paikea and grandson of Tapihana Paraire Paikea, both of whom represented Northern Maori, he initiated the Morehu Youth Movement and was a keen advocate for rangatahi and their contribution to the Ratana Movement.

“He was mentored and inspired by the late Te Reo Hura and Dame Te Atairangikaahu.

“Tapihana forged alliances between Te Iwi Morehu and Labour by creating numerous opportunities to discuss the relevance of Te Tiriti O Waitangi, a legacy set out by Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana and continued by Tapihana’s grandfather.

“He was well-versed on matters pertaining to the Ratana movement and he was a confident orator who understood the important relationships that connected Morehu to iwi throughout the country.

“Considered a diplomat and a gentleman by all who knew him, Tapihana provided constant support and advice to former Labour Prime Minister Helen Clark. More recently, he was instrumental in spearheading a renewed relationship between Ratana and the Labour Party.

“Tapihana was passionate about progress for his people in Te Uri o Hau along the Kaipara harbour.”

“As we mourn his loss we remember his contribution, he was a gentle giant of a man who served his people with solid determination to see the betterment of the Maori people,” Nanaia Mahuta said.

_Noreira e te rangatira, haere ki o matua tupuna. Haere ki te torona o Ihoa. Takoto pai mai e te hoa, e te rangatira._

A contingent of Labour MPs will attend Tapihana Shelford’s tangi at Otamatea on Sunday.
