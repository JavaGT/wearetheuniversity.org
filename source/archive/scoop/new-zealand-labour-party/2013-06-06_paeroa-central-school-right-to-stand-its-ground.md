**Paeroa Central School right to stand its ground**

The care and safety of students and teaching staff have to be at the forefront of the situation that has emerged at Paeroa Central School says Labour MP For Hauraki-Waikato, Nanaia Mahuta.

“The Ministry of Education is demanding that a 10 year old boy attend the Primary School irrespective of former behavioural issues and a track record of violent behaviour.

"This is a clear example that intensive supports need to be put in place to enable this young boy to resolve severe issues that prevent him from reaching his full potential.

"These severe needs cannot be catered for at Paeroa Central School or indeed any public school and the Ministry should put some effort into to finding specialist support.

"I have visited Paeroa Central School and it is evident that the children staff and community are close knit. The Principal continues to demonstrate her commitment to the students by making sure that their learning environment is positive.

"At risk violent behaviour does not support the aspirations of the school community and the Minister needs to step in and require an alternative learning option for the young man that doesn't risk the safety of others.

"I fully support the plea of the Principal and Minister Parata cannot pretend that this is someone else's problem - the responsibility lies with her- she must act decisively.
