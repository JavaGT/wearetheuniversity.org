Only thing dying in Wellington is John Key’s government  

  

John Key has shown himself to be totally out of touch with Wellington, and completely clueless as to how to help our capital city develop, say Grant Robertson and Annette King, on behalf of Labour’s Wellington region MPs.

"John Key says Wellington is dying and he has no idea how to resuscitate it. What ignorant nonsense,” Grant Robertson said.

“Like a lot of cities Wellington needs to keep upping its game, but there is plenty of life in our capital city.

“The only thing dying in Wellington is John Key's government, racked with incompetence, brain fades and scandal.”

"If John Key and his government haven’t got a vision for Wellington then it’s time for them move aside, and let a Labour-led government take charge,” said Annette King.

“There is huge potential in our city and region, from business through to arts and events. It's such a shame that John Key as Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism has chosen to bag Wellington."

Mr Robertson said there were some great digital businesses - such as Sidhe, SilverStripe and Ponoko - that were leading the world in their areas.

“Along with that there are new science and innovation possibilities emerging from the city’s various tertiary institutions. We need a government that is prepared to back these kinds of businesses instead of putting up the white flag.”

"Wellington remains our arts and culture capital with a thriving music, theatre and art scene. We also do events like WOW, the Arts Festival and the Sevens better than most,” Annette King said.

“Just a couple of weeks ago thousands of Australians flocked to the city to take in the first AFL game played outside Australia. Mr Key might have been put off by the crowd booing him at the end of the game, but it was a sign of what Wellington can do,” Annette King said.

"Still, we can’t be complacent. There are challenges ahead to keep providing opportunities and protecting and enhancing our unique culture and environment. Meeting those requires a partnership between central and local government and the people of Wellington.

“It seems John Key does not have the vision to be a part of that. Well, Labour does and we will keep backing Wellington all the way,” Grant Robertson and Annette King said.
