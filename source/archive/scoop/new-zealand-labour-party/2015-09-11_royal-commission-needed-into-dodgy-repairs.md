Royal Commission needed into dodgy repairs

**Royal Commission needed into dodgy repairs**

Labour is supporting calls by the people of Canterbury for a Royal Commission of Enquiry into dodgy EQC repairs, says Labour’s acting EQC spokesperson Megan Woods.

“Large numbers of repairs done by EQC have been found to be deficient, and those are just the ones that have been checked. This raises the possibility that there might be hundreds or even thousands of homes with dodgy repairs the homeowner doesn’t know about.

“After everything people have had to go through to get their repairs done, they need to know the job was done properly and won’t have to be fixed up all over again. Cantabrians deserve to know their repairs are up to scratch.

“It isn’t just one area that’s affected. Stories of dodgy repairs, shonky scoping and rorting the system point to much wider problems at EQC.

“We only get one chance at rebuilding our city and people rebuilding their lives. We’ve got to get it right.

“The Government should immediately launch a Royal Commission of Inquiry to get to the bottom of how this botch-up happened, how widespread the problem is, and what we can do to fix it and make sure nothing like this ever happens again,” says Megan Woods.
