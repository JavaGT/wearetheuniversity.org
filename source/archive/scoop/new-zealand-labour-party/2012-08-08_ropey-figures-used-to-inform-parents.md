**Ropey figures used to ‘inform’ parents**

Plans by the Government to publish league table based on John Key’s self-described ‘ropey’ figures will leave parents misinformed not better informed , Labour Leader David Shearer says.

“Yes, there needs to be accountability in the education system, but it needs to be based on accurate data which truly measures student progress.

“This latest proposal comes hard on the heels of John Key’s disastrous plan to increase class sizes. It is just another attempt by Mr Key to divide teachers and parents for his own political gain.

“As a parent and former teacher I know we all want the best for our kids. We are not going to get that if the Prime Minister continues to put a wedge between them,” said David Shearer.

“Forcing schools to release information on student performance is another slap in the face for the education sector,” Labour’s Education spokesperson Nanaia Mahuta said.

“First there was the push to increase class sizes. Then there were charter schools and their unqualified teachers.

“Today we have Hekia Parata telling schools they must ‘show and tell’ using National Standards data, despite massive variability in reporting.

“This has been rushed through with little consultation. Less than a year ago teachers were being told the government had no intention of pursuing league tables,” said Nanaia Mahuta.
