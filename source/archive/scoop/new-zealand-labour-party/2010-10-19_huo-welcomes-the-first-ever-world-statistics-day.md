_**Huo welcomes the first ever World Statistics Day**_

The importance of statistics in everyday life are highlighted by the first-ever World Statistics Day which is being celebrated today says Labour Statistics Spokesperson Raymond Huo.

“Over 100 countries will mark World Statistics Day (WSD) with special events, conferences, round tables and exhibits,” Raymond Huo said.

In New Zealand, a number of events have been planned including the launch of the Official New Zealand Yearbook.

“The yearbook is a complete statistical picture of life in New Zealand since 1893.It will be a great resource for all New Zealanders and provide readers with a glimpse of how life in New Zealand used to be,” Raymond Huo said.

“This is also a great reminder to all New Zealanders that the next census is just around the corner in March 2011.

“It’s important that New Zealanders realise the importance of the census which strongly influences where tax-payers money is spent in health, education, transport and many other areas which affect our day-to-day life,” Raymond Huo said.

Other events planned around the World Statistics Day are

• 2011 Census video for the deaf  
• Auckland University presentation to the Royal Statistical Society  
• Government Statistician Geoff Bascand presentation to the New Zealand Institute of Internal Affairs  
• Women in Statistics Conference
