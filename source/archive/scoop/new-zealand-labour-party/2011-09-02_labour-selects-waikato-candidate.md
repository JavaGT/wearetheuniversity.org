**Labour selects Waikato candidate**

Last night the Labour Party confirmed Kate Sutton as its candidate to stand in the Waikato electorate in November’s general election.

“I have been meeting with people across the community; they are telling me that they have had a tough time over the last few years” Sutton said, “The people of Waikato deserve a real choice at this election and I am thrilled to be chosen to be a strong voice for Labour in the Waikato.”

“Labour has a plan for our economy that will deliver hard working Kiwis. We have announced several policies that I am getting great feedback on, no GST on fresh fruit and veges, first $5000 earned – tax free and our capital gains tax which will shift investment into the productive sector. All these policies will be great for the Waikato community and we have plenty more to announce in the lead up to the election.”

“Kate is a smart and effective representative for communities and will bring her experience in business and community advocacy to the campaign” said Moira Coatsworth.
