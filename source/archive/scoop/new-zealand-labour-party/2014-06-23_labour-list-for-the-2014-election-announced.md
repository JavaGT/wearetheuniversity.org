===========================================

**Monday, 23 June 2014, 2:02 pm**  
**Press Release: [New Zealand Labour Party](https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Labour_Party)**

  
**LABOUR LIST FOR THE 2014 ELECTION ANNOUNCED**

The Labour Party has agreed its List for the 2014 General Election. **Please see attached**.

Moira Coatsworth, Labour Party President, said today:

“An outstanding group of talented New Zealanders was selected for Labour’s list over the weekend. Our Moderating Committee met on both Saturday and Sunday in Auckland and agreed a list of 64 List candidates. The Party’s renewal and the number of skilled candidates meant that the biggest challenge was having to rank 64 people of such high calibre. We are excited by the skilled, experienced people we expect to join our Caucus team”.

David Cunliffe, Labour leader, said today:

“I am delighted at the fantastic array of talented candidates who have made it onto our List. The skills, energy and positivity which they bring shows the excellent health which our Party is in. Those candidates will be out each day promoting our messages on jobs, homes and families, and I look forward to joining them on the campaign trail”.

• There will be a stand-up at 10.15am on Tuesday in Parliament featuring some of the leading new list candidates.  
• Labour’s full team of electorate and list candidates will be profiled at its Congress on 6 July 2014.  
• The List of 64 people comprises 30 men and 34 women. A further 21 people (16 men and 5 women) are standing only for electorates.
