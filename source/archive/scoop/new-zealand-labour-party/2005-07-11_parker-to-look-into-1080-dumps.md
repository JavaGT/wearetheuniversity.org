1080 poison near waterways under spotlight: Hobbs and Parker

The practice of dropping 1080 poison near waterways will come under the spotlight on Tuesday when Otago MP and Environment Minister Marian Hobbs meet with concerned Waimakarua locals.

A group of Waimakarua residents are concerned that 1080 poison drops by air by the Animal Health Board around the Waimakarua area are too close to waterways, posing a danger to drinking water.

Mr Parker said the government last year changed legislation to allow the Environment Risk Management Authority (ERMA) to apply a wider range of conditions on the use of approved chemicals (including 1080 poison).

Mr Parker said it was expected that later this year the Department of Conservation and the Animal Health Board would apply to ERMA to review the use of 1080.

Marian Hobbs' visit to Oamaru on Tuesday also includes a visit to a best practice Monitor Farm and a meeting with the environmental protection group Merton Tidal Arm.

ENDS
