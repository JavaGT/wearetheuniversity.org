Fenton Bill for redundancy protections drawn  
   

  
Labour MP Darien Fenton’s says she is very pleased that her bill, the Employment Relations (Minimum Redundancy Entitlements) Amendment Bill has been drawn from the ballot today.  The bill is due for first reading on the 19th August. 

“Currently, there are no redundancy protections in law and my bill will provide for minimum redundancy notice and compensation,” says Ms Fenton.

“The only way workers get redundancy entitlements is if they are provided for in their individual and collective agreements.  However, thousands of workers have no such protection and in fact, many employment agreements specifically exclude the payment of redundancy compensation.

“It’s simply not fair for workers to be dumped from their jobs without notice and redundancy pay.”

Darien Fenton says that the first reading of her bill is a chance for New Zealand’s politicians to seriously consider this important issue – an issue that has become much more prominent with the large numbers of job losses this year.

“I hope that all parties will be prepared to listen to the arguments and send it to Select Committee where this pretty basic protection can be considered,” Ms Fenton says.
