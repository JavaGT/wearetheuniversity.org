White Paper Must Live Up To Expectations

**White Paper Must Live Up To Expectations**

If Paula Bennett’s White Paper on Vulnerable Children is to have a real and long-lasting impact it must acknowledge and address the issues around child poverty in New Zealand, Labour’s Social Development spokesperson and Spokesperson for Children Jacinda Ardern says.

The document is being released tomorrow at child abuse prevention network, Jigsaw’s, annual conference.

“Thousands of people have put a huge amount of time and energy into being a part of this process and expectations are high. I genuinely hope that the Minister demonstrates their views have been heard.

“We know the impact child poverty is having on health and education, so it surely must form the cornerstone of any paper seeking to address vulnerability.

“We also know things are at crisis point. At least 270,000 Kiwi children are living in poverty and, based on figures released by Ms Bennett to a select committee, need across families has increased massively in just the last few years.

“That’s reflected in the shameful rise in the number emergency food grants being accessed – up from 285,460 in the year to June 2008 to 553,854 at June 2011.

“People asking for help don’t do it for fun. They do it out of desperation.

“To make matters worse Ms Bennett has refused to acknowledge failings in the current process means families with immediate need are reportedly having to wait up to two weeks before receiving a grant.

“Tomorrow provides an opportunity to address some dire immediate and longer term issues to help our kids.

“I hope it's an opportunity not lost on Ms Bennett,” said Jacinda Ardern.
