Key should join tourism industry and support holiday bill

Revenue Spokesperson  
24 July 2012 MEDIA STATEMENT  
**Key should join tourism industry and support holiday bill**

John Key will let the tourism industry down if he doesn’t support the ‘Monday-isation’ bill for Waitangi and Anzac day, says the bill’s sponsor Labour’s Revenue spokesperson David Clark.

“As Minister for Tourism John Key is letting his industry down. The Tourism Industry Association have come out today and supported my bill to Monday-ise Anzac and Waitangi days. This will boost domestic tourism and give Kiwis a decent break.

“I welcome the support of Martin Snedden and the Tourism Industry Association. It’s time the Minister for Tourism John Key stood beside the thousands of tourism operators who will benefit if every year Kiwis get the same number of public holidays.

“John Key is supposed to be the tourism industry’s biggest supporter but he’s failing the very people he’s representing as a minister.”

David Clark says his private member’s bill has the support of all parties in Parliament apart from National and Act and should pass without them.

“This bill is a win for tourism operators and all other hard-working Kiwis. John Key is offside with Parliament, public opinion and the industry he is supposed to support. It’s time he gave Kiwis a break and supported the bill.”
