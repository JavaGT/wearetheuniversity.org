Ryall on his own

Respect for Health Minister Tony Ryall has sunk on the back of his decision to sack Richard Thomson as chair of the Otago District Health Board, according to Dunedin North MP Pete Hodgson.

“He is a lonely man. Even his parliamentary colleagues seem unenthusiastic about his judgement. On the other hand there have been countless expressions of disappointment or dismay directed at the minister, locally and nationally.

“The correspondence I have received has been completely one-sided. In politics that is unusual. I have yet to receive a letter or email in support of Mr Ryall, much of that correspondence has been rather vociferous.

“By contrast Richard Thomson seems to have emerged with his reputation considerably enhanced. One is left with the sad conclusion that Mr Thomson cares more about our health system that does the current minister,” Pete Hodgson said.
