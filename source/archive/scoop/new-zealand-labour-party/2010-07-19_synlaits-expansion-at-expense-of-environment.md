Synlait’s Expansion At Expense Of Environment
=============================================

**Fear That Synlait’s Expansion Will Be At Expense Of Environment  
**

Labour Water spokesperson Brendon Burns says there is now a real worry that Canterbury corporate dairy farmer Synlait will significantly expand production before effective new environmental controls are put in place to protect endangered water quality in the region.

Synlait announced today that Bright Dairy, a large Chinese dairy company, will take a majority stake in the company, and, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, will become joint owners of Synlait Milk. Bright Dairy will invest $82 million for expansion.

“Obviously investment that creates new jobs and wealth for the province is welcome, but the other crucial side of the coin is providing effective protection for Canterbury’s waterways.

“As figures released today again confirm, Canterbury’s water quality is such that it is no longer safe to swim in most of our streams and some of our rivers.

“The danger is that Synlait’s plans to have its milk powder output doubled by 2011/12 lines up with the Government’s announced agenda to see new water allocations flowing in Canterbury next year, long before any tough new environmental controls can be put in place.”

  
Brendon Burns said the community’s fears had become heightened by the Government’s decision to axe Environment Canterbury’s elected councillors who were among those concerned at the deteriorating water quality, most particularly in the area where Synlait’s milk plant is centred.

“Dunsandel township, just up the road from the existing plant, has had e-coli in its water supply for the past year. Now Synlait wants to double production and later double it again. Little wonder it has invested in the Central Plains Water project, which, despite occasional attempts to mask its purpose, is designed to create more water for dairying.

“The issue is not about foreign investment. It is about investors getting the benefit of water provided for next to nothing and facing little by way of penalties when the effluent or nitrates from their dairy farms enter our waterways.
