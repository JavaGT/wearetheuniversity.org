Media Statement

Te Hurihanga closure stupid and short-sighted

Labour Leader Phil Goff has slammed the Government's closure and dismantlement of youth offending programme, Te Hurihanga, as "stupid and short-sighted".

He said that it will inevitably make Hamilton and the Waikato a less safe community.

"This programme works. It takes on the small group of offenders who commit the most crimes in our community, and shows that through an intensive programme it can reduce and for many eliminate reoffending," Phil Goff said

“Police and judges describe it as a ‘godsend’, the evidence is there of the difference it made for the young people, their families and a safer community.

"The Government paid for an evaluation and then ignored and distorted what it said."

The evaluation made the following key points:

• Te Hurihanga was highly regarded by all who worked with it.  
• They were targeting the toughest kids.  
• The Youth Horizons Trust was competently delivering the programme and working effectively with Maori.  
• Te Hurihanga developed a valuable treatment model and a team with the skills and experience to deliver it.  
• The "consistent" picture was of improvement in the young people whose offending histories made them the most difficult to deal with.  
• Te Hurihanga filled a gap in the system which was devoid of residential programmes.

"The $171,000 cost per offender is nothing compared to the alternative of millions of dollars which will be spent dealing with each offender through policing, the justice system and time in prison,” Phil Goff said.

“The cost of keeping an offender in prison for two years alone exceeds a programme which was stopping crime and keeping the person out of prison.

“Most importantly, intervention means the human and financial costs suffered by victims are avoided.

“Te Hurihanga is a last chance programme to stop young offenders becoming life long criminals. Where will the Youth Court send these young people once the programme is disbanded?

"New Zealand needs more Te Hurihanga programmes, not their axing," Phil Goff said.
