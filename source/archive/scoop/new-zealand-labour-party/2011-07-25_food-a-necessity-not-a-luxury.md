Food a necessity, not a luxury

**Food a necessity, not a luxury**

That increasing numbers of children are going to school hungry in a country that produces more than enough food to feed everyone highlights the failure of the National government to come to grips with economic and social realities, Labour’s Deputy Leader Annette King says.

Her comments follow the release of a report by the Child Poverty Action group which shows thousands of Kiwi children are turning up at school without breakfast or lunch.

“Everyone knows that when kids are hungry their learning suffers. Charities that provide food for schools know it, teachers know it, and parents know it.

“Labour knows it, too. Which is why we’ve got a package that will see 98 per cent of Kiwis will pay less income tax, with families better able to put food on the table and in lunchboxes,” Annette King said.

“Blaming the parents is National’s usual recourse in situations like this. But you only have to look at the latest inflation figures to know that the country’s poorest – and they are the ones whose children are going hungry – are right now being hit with a triple whammy, and it’s not of their making.

“Food, electricity and transport costs have all increased. Wages haven’t kept pace. Growing kids need feeding, but when you don’t have the cash, there’s not a whole lot you can do about it.

“Labour’s tax-free zone, where the first $100 a week people earn will be tax free, and our policy to cut 15 per cent off the price of fresh fruit and vegetables by removing GST will provide much needed extra cash to those families struggling to provide for their kids. Labour’s commitment to boosting the minimum wage will also put an extra $66 in people’s pockets each week.

“This country isn’t without compassion. We’ve seen that in Christchurch with the outpouring of goodwill towards that city’s residents in the aftermath of the earthquakes. Labour wants to build on that, and encourage communities to look out for each other.

“Supporting families so children get a better start in life – and don’t have to go to school hungry – is one way of doing that. And that is something Labour is committed to,” said Annette King.
