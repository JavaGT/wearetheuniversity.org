**Government casts doubt on Christchurch plan**

Canterbury Earthquake Minister Gerry Brownlee must tell Christchurch people whether there actually is a serious draft central city plan for the city or not, says Labour Deputy Leader and duty spokesperson Grant Robertson.

“When the draft central city plan was published at the end of last year, it became very clear that government departments were to lead the way in redeveloping the heart of the city,” Grant Robertson said.

“However, now two of the most important departments—Social Development and Inland Revenue—have signed nine-year leases on offices out near the airport.

“For the sake of Christchurch’s future, what message is this decision to sign nine-year leases sending?

“The Government seems to be thumbing its nose at the draft plan. A short-term lease might have been understandable. But nine years? It doesn’t add up if the Government is serious about working with local people in mapping out how Christchurch will look in the future.

“The issue is not the final shape of the CBD,” Grant Robertson said. “One thing is certain, however, and that is that the CBD is not going to be at the airport.

“Gerry Brownlee must give Christchurch people confidence that the Government will back the future of the central city area.”
