Bennett misleads on Job Ops

Minister of Social Development has deliberately misled New Zealanders on the success of the National Party’s Job Op scheme, Labour Deputy Leader Annette King said today.

“Paula Bennett today claimed that the success of the Job Ops scheme had resulted in youth unemployment stabilising at 19,500 young people. But what she doesn’t want the public to know is that this year more than 8000 young people joined the dole queue and just 1721 of those people found their way on to the Job Ops scheme.

“Paula Bennett has repeatedly claimed that 4000 employment opportunities for young people have been created under the Jobs Ops scheme. But in reality just over half that number of young people, have been put into jobs under the schemes put in place by her Government.

“Today Paula Bennett announced a further 2000 Job Ops places because of the programme’s success. Clearly the Minister is ignoring the reality that more and more young people are losing their jobs and that the Job Ops scheme is simply not delivering what she promised.

“According to the Household Labour Force Survey more than 62,000 people under the age of 24 are currently out of work. Yet Paula Bennett continues to try and mislead New Zealanders on her Job Ops scheme in a desperate attempt to claim she is taking the issue seriously.

“The complete lack of regard she has shown New Zealanders and particularly young people by trying to mislead them about the number of job opportunities her Government has created is simply appalling.

“Tens of thousands of young people have had their lives blighted by unemployment and they deserve better than a Minister of Employment who blusters and blathers but fails to deliver when it comes to getting young people off the benefit and back to work,” Annette King said.
