Real Consultation Needed on Maternity Proposal

**Real Consultation Needed on Maternity Proposal**

It is time for the Government and DHBs to listen to health professionals who are concerned about proposed changes to maternity services in Whanganui and Palmerston North says Palmerston North MP Iain Lees-Galloway.

Speaking in support of today’s rally in Palmerston North, organised by the College of Midwives, Iain Lees-Galloway said the proposal to remove acute maternity services from Whanganui, requiring 400 women a year to birth in Palmerston North, is just one option the DHBs have to respond to the shortage of obstetricians in Whanganui.

“There is a problem, everyone acknowledges that. The status quo can’t go on. However, the proposal has been offered as the only alternative and thus far consultation appears to have been nothing more than keeping up appearances,” said Iain Lees-Galloway.

“Midwives, nurses, doctors, parents and everyone in our community should have a genuine opportunity to participate in finding a solution. Their knowledge and experience is valuable and should be used.

“The impact on families who will have to travel needs to be better recognised. The current proposal, with no financial support for travel or accommodation, will put considerable strain on many families at a time when they could really do without that extra pressure.

“The National party promised that women requiring extra care after giving birth would be able to stay in hospital longer. This proposal will put extra demands on space in the Palmerston North maternity ward, making fulfilling that promise impossible.

“Despite that, the Government has been silent. Health Minister Tony Ryall prefers to distance himself from any unpopular decisions, saying they are an operational matter for DHBs. I bet if a new theatre was being opened he’d be there with bells on.”

Iain Lees-Galloway urged the Government and DHBs to extend the consultation period, ensure the public had an opportunity to participate and genuinely listen to alternative options that are proposed.
