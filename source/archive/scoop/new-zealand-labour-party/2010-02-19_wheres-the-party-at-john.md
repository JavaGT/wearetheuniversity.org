Where’s the Party at John?

**Where’s the Party at John?  
**  
The failure of the Government to secure agreement to transform Auckland’s waterfront into “party central” for the 2011 Rugby World Cup proves National’s handing of preparations is a shambles, Labour Leader Phil Goff said today.

“When he announced ‘party central’ last year John Key said Queens Wharf would be the cornerstone of this Rugby World Cup phase of the waterfront development, and told his ministers to put ‘serious work into making it happen’. National has failed,” Phil Goff said.

“This now means Auckland will be playing catch up to get a venue ready to host the tens of thousands of rugby supporters who will flock to New Zealand.

“The party central plan was ill thought out and was being rushed for one major event without consideration for the long term development of a stunning piece of waterfront.”

Phil Goff said John Key as Tourism Minister and Prime Minister should take his fair share of the blame for the project’s failure.

“John Key was all for hosting the party, but he didn’t do the work to get it ready.

“Aucklanders have seen sense and rejected the Prime Minister’s half-baked plan.

“Auckland’s Mayors are to be congratulated for their decision which will mean a better process for the waterfront’s development.

“The city’s ratepayers were facing a multi-million dollar bill to pay for what was turning into a white-elephant.

  
“Once again it’s sloppy work from the Prime Minister with another ‘back of the envelope’ announcement that has failed to deliver. This isn’t the way to run a country.

“New Zealand has just 18 months to get ready for an influx of rugby fans. My message to John is, sort it out.” Phil Goff said.
