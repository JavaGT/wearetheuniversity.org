MEDIA STATEMENT

Power prices soar on the eve of winter

On the eve of winter as New Zealanders are turning on their heaters, power prices have soared sky high, Labour’s Energy spokesperson David Shearer says.

“Energy Minster Simon Bridges claimed in Parliament that prices were estimated to rise 2.4 per cent over the six months from February to August.

“Last month, many regions exceeded that in just one month.

“In parts of Waikato, Wellington, Tauranga and Christchurch some power company prices have jumped over 6 per cent in just a month. Other companies have hiked their prices up a staggering 10 per cent in a month.

“Prices are out of control and totally unreasonable for people facing high power bills with winter coming. It is simply not fair for Kiwis to face those sorts of bills.

“In Auckland prices have gone up around 1.5 per cent in one month. These projections will blow Simon Bridges estimates in just two months.

“The increases have been picked up on the PowerSwitch website. It tracks power prices and its latest update records the power bill hikes that many Kiwis experienced when they received last month’s bills.

“Just four weeks ago, John Key dismissed those increases in family power bills, saying it was Transpower charges – something Transpower quickly refuted. These latest increases dwarf anything Transpower could pass through.

“The electricity market is clearly broken. With electricity demand falling but prices soaring, prices should be going down, not up. The Key Government is defending a system which results in higher bills for families to maintain higher profits for newly privatised power companies.

“Genesis, the company that was sold off in the past week has been the worst culprit beating others on the magnitude of its price rises, across most regions.

“Labour’s NZ Power policy will reduce prices by hundreds of dollars a year and stem the ever increasing cycle of power price rises,” David Shearer says.

**Results from the PowerSwitch website**

Simon Bridges said power prices would increase 2.4% from 1 February to 1 August this year.

The latest PowerSwitch data shows **significant price hikes taking place in most areas of New Zealand in just the last month** **that are in excess of 2.4%.**

Prices are likely to rise far more than Bridges has claimed. Already rises up to 10% in one month have been recorded.
