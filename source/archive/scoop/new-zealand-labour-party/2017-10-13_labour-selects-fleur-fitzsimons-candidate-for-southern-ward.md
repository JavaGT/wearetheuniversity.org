Labour Selects Fleur Fitzsimons Candidate for Southern Ward
===========================================================

**Fleur Fitzsimons selected as Labour candidate for Southern Ward**

The Labour Party has selected lawyer, mother of three and Island Bay resident Fleur Fitzsimons as its candidate to replace Paul Eagle as the Councillor for the Southern Ward on the Wellington City Council.

Paul Eagle was elected to Parliament as the Member of Parliament for Rongotai, requiring a by-election in the southern suburbs.

Fitzsimons has been a lawyer for the Public Service Association for 10 years and was a former President of the Victoria University Students’ Association and the New Zealand University Students’ Association.

An advocate for parents, Fitzsimons established a successful campaign to save the indoor play space at Capital E, developed the coalition for 26 weeks paid parent leave, and is a member of the Island Bay School Board of Trustees.

“I’m honoured to be selected as the candidate for the Southern Ward. I love Wellington and I love the southern suburbs. They are a great place to live and I am committed to making them even better,” said Fleur Fitzsimons.

“I am passionate about guaranteeing Wellington is a great place to raise children. That means we must make homes warm and dry so kids don’t get sick. I want Council to build modern playgrounds and ensure access to swimming lessons for every child before they start school.

I want to make sure the transport problems facing our city are fixed. We must upgrade transport infrastructure and invest in public transport for the future.

“I think the Council must do a better job of listening to communities and learn from past mistakes. I will pro-actively seek the views of the community when Council consultation processes are not delivering a wide range of views. The Island Bay cycleway must teach the Council lessons about the importance of effective consultation and balancing diverse views.

“I believe Justin Lester and the new Council are moving in the right direction. I support his focus on better transport, affordable housing and stronger and safer communities.

Former Southern Ward Councillor Paul Eagle endorsed Fleur Fitzsimons for his vacant position.

“I have known Fleur for a while now and I know she will do a great job on the Council. She is smart, principled, and down to earth. She is well grounded locally as a Board of Trustees member and Island Bay resident. I know her experience as a lawyer, campaigner and mum of three young kids will make her a great representative for people in the Southern Ward.”

Nominations for the Southern Ward by-election close on Thursday 26 October. A by-election will be conducted by postal vote from Thursday 30 November and close on Friday 22 December.
