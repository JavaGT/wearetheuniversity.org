Sustainable Future Institute Changes Name
=========================================

**News for Immediate Release:**

**February 28, 2012**

**Sustainable Future Institute Changes Name to McGuinness Institute:**  
**_New Name Better Reflects the Institute’s Research Scope_**

The Sustainable Future Institute announced today that the Institute’s directorial team approved a name change to the McGuinness Institute.

The name change is effective from February 28, 2012.

Wendy McGuinness, Chief Executive, believes this change reflects international best practice, making transparent both where the principal funds are coming from, and the purpose; namely private funds invested for the public good.

The Institute has become increasingly aware of misconceptions concerning the nature of our work arising from the use of the word _sustainable_.

Rather than being seen as an organisation primarily focused on progressing environmental issues, the name change better reflects the breadth of the Institute’s work; exploring New Zealand’s long- term future through integrated evidence-based research on social, economic and environmental issues.

The McGuinness Institute is a non-partisan think tank working for the public good, contributing strategic foresight through evidence-based research and policy analysis.

We endeavor to undertake research that is independent, innovative and relevant in a professional manner.

Further, the McGuinness Institute places a great value on inclusiveness and accessibility and works hard to respect cultural and demographic diversity.

The McGuinness Institute operates with a diverse team of graduates, academics and experienced professionals with expertise in a multitude of disciplines, who are all focused on working towards better long-term outcomes for New Zealand.

The McGuinness Institute is very fortunate to have the help, advice and support of many experts who guide the team through the process and externally review all publications.

Further, the McGuinness Institute has a number of international affiliations and relationships which ensure an informed global view is incorporated into our research and policy recommendations.

**Major Projects of the McGuinness Institute: Project 2058**

Earlier work by the McGuinness Institute found that New Zealand is well behind on its international obligations to develop and implement a National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS).

The strategic aim of _Project 2058_ is therefore to promote integrated long-term thinking, leadership and capacity-building through the development of an NSDS that effectively seeks and creates opportunities while simultaneously exploring and managing risks over the next 50 years.

It is hoped that _Project 2058_ will help develop dialogue among government ministers, parliamentarians, policy analysts and members of the public about alternative strategies for New Zealand’s future.

**Project: Constitutional Review**

The aim of this project is to build capacity so that New Zealanders – in particular youth between the ages of 18–25 – can engage with the Constitutional Advisory Panel in an informed and considered manner.

This project has two main work streams.

Firstly, the McGuinness Institute is closely following the progress of the Constitutional Advisory Panel and will report and research key issues as they arise.

Secondly, the _Empower_ project aims to facilitate discussion amongst young people around the constitutional review and New Zealand's long-term future.

The McGuinness Institute is working to create a space and place to enable young people to connect, discuss and explore New Zealand's future constitutional arrangements.

**Project One Integrated Report**

The McGuinness Institute believes the use of one integrated annual report, by both organisations and countries, is a critical mechanism for improving global governance of resources, human health and well-being.

The creation of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) is a positive step towards the formation of this framework, and the Institute has introduced the current stream of work in support of this initiative.

The McGuinness Institute considers it is now time to plan how to move from a financial reporting framework to an integrated reporting framework.
