MCGUINNESS INSTITUTE MEDIA RELEASE 7 DECEMBER 2012

**Time for youth to think about our fiscal future**

_The McGuinness Institute announces its workshop_ LongTermNZ_: Taking a long term position on the future, 09–14 December 2012_

‘No one will be more affected by current fiscal decision-making than youth, so it is important that they have an opportunity to participate in the discussion’, says Wendy McGuinness, Chief Executive at the McGuinness Institute.

The McGuinness Institute is experimenting with a new initiative designed to open the door for engagement by young people interested in understanding the long term fiscal and policy challenges facing New Zealand. Participants will have the opportunity to discuss New Zealand’s fiscal issues and to grill experts, including Chris Laidlaw, Andrew Gawith and Sam Morgan.

The _LongTermNZ_ workshop will bring together 20 young people to develop a _Youth Statement on the Long-Term Fiscal Position_. The participants will have spent the previous two days attending the _Affording our Future_ conference being held by the Treasury and Victoria University in Wellington.

With support from the Treasury and Victoria University of Wellington, _LongTermNZ_ will provide an environment for the 20 participants to reflect on what they have learnt, and to discuss and articulate their reflections in a booklet targeted at other young people.

Wendy McGuinness says ‘The _LongTermNZ_ workshop provides the opportunity for New Zealand youth to begin a conversation about the future of New Zealand’s long-term fiscal position and communicate this information to their peers.’

‘The Treasury’s Statement on New Zealand’s Long-Term Fiscal Position is an important tool for strategic foresight in government and it is important the country’s young leaders are encouraged to take a long term view of the challenges and opportunities they will face.’

To finish off the workshop a public finale presentation and lunch will be held on Thursday 13 December where participants from the workshop will present their ‘_Youth Statement on New Zealand’s Long-Term Fiscal Position’_.
