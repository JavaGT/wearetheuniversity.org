**UC remains among the top three percent of universities in the world**

September 10, 2013

The University of Canterbury (UC) has maintained its ranking among the top three per cent of universities in the world.

In the latest QS World University Rankings released today and has retained its world ranking to be in the top three universities in in New Zealand.

UC is ranked 21st in the world in civil and structural engineering as a discipline, UC’s College of Engineering is ranked 152nd in the world while the College of Business is 217th in discipline rankings released earlier this year.

UC is ranked in the top 100 universities in education, psychology, law, geography, history, philosophy, linguistics, accounting and finance. This means four of the six disciplines in arts and humanities ranked by QS are in the top 100. UC is ranked among the top 150 universities in computer science and information systems, earth and marine sciences, sociology, economics and finance, stats and operations research.

The QS ratings are out of the top 800 universities, though there are around 17,000 universities worldwide.

In the assessment of employers UC ranked 153rd in the world. The employer reputation indicator is based on a global survey, taking in 27,900 responses. The survey gives students a better sense of how universities are viewed in the job market.

The international faculty ratio where UC ranked 27th assesses how international a university is, by measuring the proportion of international students and faculty members in relation to overall numbers.

UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the university’s focus on employability and entrepreneurship builds on a strength already observed by employers in New Zealand and overseas.

"Not only are we a research-intensive university but we can rightly claim to be one of the most international universities in the world according to this measure.

"For the University to retain its position in the top three per cent is a credit to the quality and commitment of staff considering the unprecedented impact of the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes.

"We have responded rapidly with so much activity progressing and developing student engagement, curriculum review and facilities on campus. Today we have 14,000 students, including a record number of new and continuing PhD students, 1900 full time equivalent staff and have offered over 1,200 courses this year.

"Applications to our halls of residence for 2013 are up significantly on the last two years indicating out of town students are interested in studying at UC next year.

"We have built 15,000 square metres of student learning and faculty space in Kirkwood and Dovedale Villages and we are now investing a million dollars a week remediating other buildings as we go. The Undercroft has become the new central hub for students to gather," Dr Carr says.

The University which contributes more than $1 billion annually to the local economy is the only New Zealand university to receive a five star QS ranking.
