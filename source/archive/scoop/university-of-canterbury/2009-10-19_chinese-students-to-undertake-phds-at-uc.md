Chinese students to undertake PhDs at UC
========================================

**Agreement opens way for Chinese students to undertake PhDs at UC**

The University of Canterbury is to become one of just 70 universities worldwide accredited to accept specially selected postgraduate students from China’s top universities.

UC and the China Scholarship Council (CSC) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) paving the way for Chinese students to study for doctorates at UC. The MOU is also designed to develop research collaborations between UC and Chinese universities.

Founded in 1996, the CSC is a Chinese government agency that funds more than 14,000 Chinese students to study abroad. Under the agreement, selected Chinese students will enrol at the University to undertake doctoral study. On successfully completing the programme and defending their theses, PhD degrees will be conferred by UC.

UC will also work with CSC to undertake research in the areas of information and communications technology; life science and public health; materials science and new materials; energy and environment; engineering, applied social sciences; and teacher education.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr said he was delighted the University of Canterbury was joining the international programme.

“Only 39 Chinese universities are accredited to present students and only 70 universities in the world are accredited to enrol students.”  
Dr Carr told the six-member CSC delegation that the New Zealand-China relationship was a “long and enduring one” and that the signing of the MOU marked a special milestone.

“Building networks between your citizens and our citizens in culture, education and scientific endeavour is extremely important for us. It is very much appreciated that China is reaching out to engage with our University.”

CSC Secretary-General Dr Liu Jinghui said the council was grateful to the University for its long-term support of Chinese students and looked forward to further co-operation.

She said she hoped the Chinese students would be able to spend more time in New Zealand, not only to further their studies and knowledge of the language but also to gain a deeper understanding of New Zealand culture.
