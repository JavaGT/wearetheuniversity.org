**University of Canterbury boosts scholarships for Maori/Pasifika students**

The University of Canterbury has increased its scholarship funding for 2012 and beyond by more than a third. This includes increased scholarships that support Maori and Pasifika students at UC and Emerging Leaders. The number of the UC Emerging Leaders Scholarships has been increased by more than 40 with a category within the UC Emerging Leader Scholarships reserving scholarships for Maori and Pasifika students.

The UC Emerging Leaders Scholarships provide recipients with $5,000 in fee waivers for their first year as an undergraduate student at UC and the opportunity to participate in the Emerging Leaders programme valued at $4,000. Emerging Leaders scholars will also be offered their first preference of hall in the first round of offers made by university halls of residence.

In addition, three new Ngai Tahu PhD scholarships have also been established specifically to support research undertaken within the Ngai Tahu Research Centre hosted at the University of Canterbury.

Individual colleges also offer scholarships reserved for Maori and Pasifika students. The College of Engineering High Achievers Awards, for example, are open to all first-year students entering the intermediate year of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree. Up to 10 scholarships for $5000 and up to 50 scholarships for $1000 in fee waiver support are offered for students in selected programmes.

“We believe in supporting sustained achievement at UC,” said University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor, Dr Rod Carr. “Scholarships are open to all students who achieve the eligibility criteria with some scholarships including sub-categories reserved for certain groups of students such as Maori and Pasifika students or students who excel at sports. We hope that our additional scholarship offerings for Maori and Pasifika students will encourage them to achieve excellent results at UC.”
