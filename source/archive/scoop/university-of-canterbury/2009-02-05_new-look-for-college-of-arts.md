New look for University of Canterbury's College of Arts

The University of Canterbury's College of Arts has taken on a new look for the New Year.

The programmes within its schools have been reorganised into six rather than 11 schools.

The new schools are: the School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics; the School of Humanities; the Centre for Fine Arts, Music and Theatre; and the School of Social and Political Sciences.

The School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics now comprises the Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, European Languages and Cultures, and Linguistics programmes.

The School of Humanities consists of American Studies, Art History and Theory, Classics, Cultural Studies, English, History, Philosophy, and Film Studies, while the School of Social and Political Sciences contains Anthropology, Gender Studies, Mass Communication and Journalism, Political Science, Religious Studies, and Sociology.

The Centre for Fine Arts, Music and Theatre, which has a newly appointed Director, Amanda Morris, encompasses the disciplines of fine arts, music and theatre and film studies.

The School of Social Work and Human Services and Aotahi: The School of Māori and Indigenous Studies remain unchanged. The College also embraces the Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies.

Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Arts) Professor Ken Strongman saysthe reorganisation was the culmination of the Arts Future Project which included a full review of the BA degree and analysis of the academic, managerial and financial aspects of the College.

He saysthe aim of the new structure was to streamline management through a smaller advisory committee consisting of the Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Deans and Heads of School.

“Another important aspect of this is that no programme or discipline has been lost in this reorganisation. They have been rearranged and moved but no programme has been dropped.”
