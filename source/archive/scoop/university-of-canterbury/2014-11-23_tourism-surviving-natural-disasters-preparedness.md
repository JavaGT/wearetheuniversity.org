**Tourism surviving natural disasters: Preparedness and planning**

A University of Canterbury doctoral student is investigating the preparedness and planning of post-disaster tourism service providers.

Abanti Antara, whose thesis is being supervised by Associate Professor Kevin Voges, says it is important that those involved in tourism are well informed on how to improve tourism resilience for service providers to manage disasters in New Zealand and elsewhere.

Antara is pursuing a doctoral study in tourism marketing. Antara gave a talk to the New Zealand Tertiary Engagement summit last year and will share her latest research at the second New Zealand Tertiary Engagement summit at the University of Canterburytomorrow (Monday, November 24).

\`\`Throughout the world countries experience natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, drought, wildfires, snowstorms, haboobs (dust storms) and wind storms,’’ she says.

\`\`These natural disasters often cause serious disruption to tourism activities. It is generally accepted that science cannot predict and provide timely warnings before these disasters occur so industries such as tourism tend not to be well prepared for the impact of disasters on their services.

\`\`Tourism today has global branding featuring diverse scenery, population, customs, cultures and tourism activities as key concepts. Such a mix of tourist attractions has now shaped New Zealand as a unique and outstanding tourist destination.

\`\`Previous research and literature show that a logical conception of strategic approaches is needed both for tourism management planning and also for promotion of tourism destinations, especially after disasters. Alternative tourism is the term used for innovative and creative strategies which can restore tourism post-disaster.

\`\`Christchurch had significant cultural identity and historical features to attract tourists to the city and as a gateway to the South Island. But international tourist numbers initially dropped after the earthquakes.

\`\`Tourism in the city has suffered the loss of many experiences and activities that were on offer to tourists, with the demolition of more than 40 percent of its historical buildings and loss and disruption to many tourist experiences. Four years later the city is rebuilding tourism. In order to understand and mitigate the impact and challenges, tourism service operators are now paying attention to survival strategies and long term recovery.’’

Antara says the findings in a previous study raised implications for the need to develop disaster management planning for post-disaster tourism. It indicated that tourism providers must take stock of the actual realities of post-disaster situations and develop planning for survival and rebuilding.

Tourism experts suggested that adoption of the current existing situation is the higher priority for service providers and managers. They should modify and adapt their skills for the actual situation along with collaborative practices and create new innovative products.

Examples of substitute attractions have been the pop-up ReStart Mall, Quake City by the Canterbury Museum, the tram with a video presentation on pre-quake Christchurch and community engagement in the Court Theatre restoration.

\`\`It is important that those involved in tourism be well informed on how to improve tourism resilience. This will require proper investment, collaborative approaches, and innovative thinking for service providers to manage disasters in New Zealand and overseas.’’
