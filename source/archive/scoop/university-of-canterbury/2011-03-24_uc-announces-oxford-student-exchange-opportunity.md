**UC announces Oxford student exchange opportunity**

The University of Canterbury is pleased to announce an exchange opportunity for 42 of its senior students to study for a term at the University of Oxford.

UC is inviting applications for the University of Oxford Exchange, which will have places for 32 honours students and 10 postgraduates to study at Oxford University for the eight-week Trinity Term commencing after Easter.

The University of Oxford Exchange is open to arts, humanities, social sciences and law students who are studying at honours/400-level or who are in their second or third year as a PhD student.

  
University of Canterbury Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Town said he was delighted to be able to announce the exchange programme.

  
“The University of Canterbury was founded in 1873 by virtue of its links with Christ Church and the University of Oxford. Immediately after news of the 22 February earthquake reached the UK the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Hamilton, contacted us to see if Oxford could be of help, with the result that these fully funded places for UC students were offered by the University and its colleges.”

  
Professor Town acknowledged the generosity of the offer made by Professor Hamilton and his Oxford colleagues and thanked them for their strong support.

  
“This offer of 42 places for the spring term represents a tremendous opportunity for our brightest senior students to study at a world leading university for part of 2011.”

Professor Andrew Hamilton said “I am immensely proud of the response from the collegiate University to the earthquake in New Zealand, which had such a devastating impact on the lives of our friends and colleagues in Christchurch. We are greatly looking forward to welcoming University of Canterbury students here in Oxford next term”.

  
Students chosen for the exchange will be given college membership, which will enable them to use college and University facilities and be a full member of the collegiate community.

The University of Canterbury will give successful students a special scholarship of NZ$2000 to cover international travel, taxes and insurance and the University of Oxford and its colleges have waived fees for all participants and will provide residential accommodation.

  
  
ends.
