**UC mathematical expert receives a second large research grant**  
   
**August 10, 2013**  
   
Outstanding University of Canterbury (UC) researcher, Dr Maarten McKubre-Jordens, has been awarded another prestigious research grant.  
   
Earlier this year, Dr McKubre-Jordens was a recipient of a $345,000 Marsden Fund grant for his work in non-classical foundations of mathematics. The three-year grant will allow Dr McKubre-Jordens to explore his own research in non-classical mathematics and help promoted UC  as a world leader in non-classical mathematics research.  
   
On top of Dr McKubre-Jordens's Marsden success in one aspect of non-classical mathematics, he is an associate investigator in a major European Union Marie Curie awarded project consortium, headed by UC’s Professor Douglas Bridges, for research in constructive mathematics.  
   
The European Union research project will link algorithmic proofs in pure mathematics to the development of computer software. The UC researchers have been awarded approximately NZ$250,000 for research visits to Europe in the five years from 2014 through 2018.  
\`\`How does all this work in mathematical proofs and logic tie into what we know today? Without logic there wouldn’t be computers. Mathematical logic is the basis for modern computing,’’ Dr McKubre-Jordens says.  
   
\`\`The mathematical logic has given us the theory that has allowed everyday designs to be extended in ways we couldn’t have imagined. Without them scientists would not have come up with the concept of supersonic speed or anything beyond conventional travel speeds.  
   
\`\`Pure mathematics and mathematical logic has contributed in many ways to modern design and technology by saving time and money. If you make a good mathematical model then new ideas and developments can be tested initially by simulating on a computer, without having to actually build and field test every design option.  
   
\`\`While it might seem that pure mathematics is a long way away from everyday life, most products and designs in your home and your work have had a genius in pure mathematics. Thanks to our research, we all benefit from maths,’’ Dr McKubre-Jordens says.
