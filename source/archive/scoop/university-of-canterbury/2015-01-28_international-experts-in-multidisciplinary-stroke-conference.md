**International experts and clinicians taking part in multidisciplinary stroke conference**

January 28, 2015

Experts, engineers, physiologists, clinicians, medical academics and students from around the world will discuss the impact of new technology on helping recovering patients at an international stroke rehabilitation conference in Christchurch in May.

Keynote speakers from the United States, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand will talk about neuroscience and neural recovery, clinical research and commercialisation.

The May 10 to 12 conference is being hosted by the University of Canterbury Rose Centre for Stroke Recovery and Research at St. George’s Medical Centre.

Centre director Associate Professor Maggie-Lee Huckabee is one of five keynote speakers and she will raise issues impacting on stroke victims.

“Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide and a common cause of disability in adults in developed countries. Stroke is largely preventable, yet about 9000 New Zealanders every year have a stroke. Every day about 24 New Zealanders have a stroke and only half of these are able to return to full time work after six months,” Associate Professor Huckabee says.

“There are an estimated 60,000 stroke survivors in New Zealand. Many are disabled and need significant daily support. However, stroke recovery can continue throughout life.

“Health systems have developed comprehensive clinical rehabilitation services for people in acute and post-acute phases. Services are particularly well developed for elderly stroke patients. There are also well developed services for young patients who have suffered disability due to accidental injury.

“It’s exciting that our University of Canterbury Rose Centre for Stroke Recovery and Research will celebrate our inaugural year with an international stroke rehabilitation conference.

“This conference is the only of its kind in New Zealand to target stroke rehabilitation specialists with a focus on applied biotechnology.”

Associate Professor Maggie-Lee Huckabee’s work, combined with the efforts of clinicians in the district health board, has improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs by more than $1 million and has supported a collaborative culture of research support for frontline clinicians.

Associate Professor Huckabee has co-authored two textbooks on swallowing impairment following neurological impairment, 10 book chapters on topics related to rehabilitation and 51 peer-reviewed scientific articles in various dimensions of dysphagia.
