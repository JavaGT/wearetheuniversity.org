UC Scientists take part in Family Fun Days
==========================================

**UC Scientists take part in Family Fun Days**

Scientists from the University of Canterbury’s Department of Geological Sciences participated in a Family Fun Day at Simeon Park in Addington yesterday (**subs 2 March**).

Professor Jim Cole, Dr Tom Wilson and PhD candidate Johnny Wardman gave families talks about the recent earthquake, why Christchurch experiences earthquakes, why liquefaction occurs and how buildings behave during earthquake shaking.

They used simple, interactive models to show how faults rupture, liquefaction occurs and how to strengthen buildings.

The fun day included face painting, a treasure hunt, bouncy castles and a chance for children to do drawings about their earthquake experiences. The drawings will be collected and made into a mural.

The day was organised by Heather Taylor, a PhD student from Massey University and research associate at UC who is doing a thesis on how children are affected by natural disasters.

Ms Taylor said that such events are important for children and families to help relieve stress, provide a space to share experiences and begin to recover mentally and emotionally.

Ms Taylor was assisted by Adventure Specialities, Spreydon Baptist Church and other volunteers from the local communities.

There will be two other Family Fun Days at Heathcote Domain today (**subs 3 March**) and Pioneer Park tomorrow (**subs March 4**) from 1pm-4pm.
