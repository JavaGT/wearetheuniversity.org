Students head for Chemistry Olympiad in Turkey

Three Auckland students and one from Christchurch were yesterday named as the New Zealand team for the International Chemistry Olympiad to be held 9-18 July in Ankara, Turkey.

They are Andy Chen, from Macleans College, Thomas Fellowes, from Christ's College, Jade Leung, from St Cuthbert's College and Kailun Wang, from Auckland Grammar School.

Two non-travelling Reserves were also named: Aaron Li, from Mt Roskill Grammar School and Matthew Conder, from Onehunga High School.

This is the 20th year New Zealand has competed in the Chemistry Olympiad. Last year in Tokyo, Japan the New Zealand team won 4 Bronze medals.

In Ankara the students will face two 5 hour exams - one practical and one theoretical.
