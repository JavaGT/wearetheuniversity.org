**Slick idea wins UC business competition**

**March 21, 2013**

University of Canterbury (UC) student Troy Scott has won a competition that encourages UC students to share their business ideas.

The Napkin challenge, which is part of the entre programme to educate students in business development, requires students to submit their business ideas on a small paper napkin.

Scott’s idea was a snakeskin-type product, like a slick, to put over mountain bike tyres to save cyclists buying different tyres, providing versatility and cost effectiveness.

The \`\`Funniest Idea Award’’ went to student Lachie Watson for his a moving basketball hoop target in urinals. He said it was a great way to meet new people in a competitive environment.

\`\`Most Innovative’’ went to a fast food tray activated rubbish bin door opener to avoid the unhygienic alternative of using hands. This idea was submitted by Sean Gardner.

\`\`Most Beneficial to Students’’ category was won by Brad Darling for a phone app that uses a communication technique to open doors at UC through UC identity cards.

\`\`Most Plausible’’ went to Nicole Evans for sewing the top bed sheet to the bottom bed sheet to save time during bed making.

The Napkin Challenge is the first of many competitions in the annual entre programme.

Later this year students will compete for $75,000 worth of prizes in the annual $75K Challenge.
