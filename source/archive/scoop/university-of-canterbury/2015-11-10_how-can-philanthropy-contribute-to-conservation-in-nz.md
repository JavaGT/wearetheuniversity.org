How can philanthropy contribute to conservation in NZ?

**How can philanthropy contribute to conservation in NZ?**

**For immediate release**

The Government does not have the means to halt New Zealand’s biodiversity decline and we need to find other ways to preserve our natural heritage, University of Canterbury ecology Professor David Norton says.

Leading conservationists will discuss how non-government initiatives could solve this problem at a public talk and panel discussion at UC, on Tuesday, 17 November.

The event, The role of philanthropy, partnerships and non-government initiatives in New Zealand conservation, is part of the New Zealand Ecological Society’s annual conference and is the brainchild of conference co-conveners Prof Norton and Dr Laura Young, from UC’s School of Forestry.

Prof Norton says that the public event is a valuable opportunity to bring together a group of conservationists to examine approaches that could make a difference in New Zealand and further afield.

“It’s important for us to help increase community awareness of how non-government initiatives play a role in looking after our biodiversity. Our native species offer endless benefits to us as New Zealanders and we need to take care of them. Government does not have the funding to address biodiversity decline and we need to find other ways to tackle this problem, but how can non-government programmes best contribute to our conservation goals?” he says.

The event will kick off at 7.30pm in the C1 Lecture Theatre with Devon McLean from the NEXT Foundation, one of New Zealand’s philanthropic investors in environment and education programmes.

Devon McLean, Department of Conservation (DOC) Director-General Lou Sanson, DOC Threatened Species Ambassador Nicola Toki and Forest and Bird Manager of Campaigns and Advocacy Kevin Hackwell will then participate in a panel discussion, moderated by Alison Ballance from Radio New Zealand.

Members of the community who are interested in attending the talk and panel discussion can register for free on Eventbrite.

The public event follows the conference’s plenary symposium where 350 delegates will hear from a range of speakers profiling different non-government approaches to conservation. The full programme is available on the conference website.
