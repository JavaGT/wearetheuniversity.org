Law without lawyers: does legal education have a future?
========================================================

Lawyers are not popular, as Shakespeare’s most famous and much-repeated quote makes clear. However, the changing nature of law means that the exhortations of Dick the Butcher to “kill all the lawyers” may no longer be necessary.

The increasing cost of legal advice and the excessive formality of the legal system has left the way open for alternative ways to undertake the ‘law jobs’, without the need of lawyers, according to Professor John Hopkins of the University of Canterbury School of Law.

“From Blockchain to ‘Alternative’ Dispute Resolution, the way appears open for a legal system without the need for the high priests of the legal profession to navigate it,” Professor Hopkins says.

“If current trends continue, the much maligned profession may die out, all on its own.”

Given that the profession is facing such an existentialist threat, what does the future hold for legal academia? Based upon the author’s published work, tonight’s UC Connect public lecture – _Law without lawyers: does legal education have a future?_ – argues that the legal academy’s future is assured but will be very different from its recent past.

Successful law schools will be those that shrug off their isolationist exceptionalism and embrace a multi-disciplinary future, Professor Hopkins says.

“In effect, the changing relationship between law and society will drive legal education back to its academic roots. The future of legal academia is the study of law, not the training of lawyers.”
