Leading NZ art figure appointed head of UC fine arts

November 6, 2014

A leading figure in the New Zealand contemporary art community, Aaron Kreisler, has been appointed University of Canterbury’s new Head of the Ilam School of Fine Arts.

Kreisler who takes up his new role in February, has been the curator at Dunedin Public Art Gallery, New Zealand’s oldest municipal art museum.

In his Dunedin role, he produced many key exhibitions including works by Ralph Hotere, who was a guest lecturer and artist-in-residence at Canterbury in 1984.

Kreisler, who has worked at Waikato Polytechnic and Massey University, has established a significant reputation in the New Zealand arts sector over the last couple of decades as a project manager, academic, art writer, critic and curator.

He has edited critically acclaimed books, contributed to public forums and important discussions about contemporary art and been the recipient of a number of major awards, including a Qantas Media Award for best review and best reviewer of the year.

Having worked in numerous roles in a range of institutions, from running small start-up art spaces to working in more established organisations, he has formed a strong understanding of the local and international arts community.

In more recent years this has seen him fostering stronger connections with leading figures in the international art scene, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Europe.
