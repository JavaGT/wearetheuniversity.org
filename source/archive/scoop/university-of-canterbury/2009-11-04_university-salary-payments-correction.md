University salary payments correction

University salary payments correction

An article in today's Press newspaper regarding salary payments made in 2008 to former Vice-Chancellor Dr Roy Sharp and Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Town was based on incorrect information contained within the State Services Commission annual report.

The SSC annual report does not note that the salary payments were made on a pro-rata basis to Dr Sharp, who left the University in July 2008, and to Professor Town who assumed the role of Acting VC for the remainder of that year.

The combined salary payments to Dr Sharp and Professor Town in 2008 were $370,836 - about half of the combined figure reported in today's newspaper article.
