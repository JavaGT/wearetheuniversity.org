More Fulbright scholarships for UC than any other university

**University of Canterbury receives more Fulbright scholarships than any other university**

June 24, 2014

The University of Canterbury received 10 of the 26 percent of the Fulbright scholarships, more than any other university, announced at Parliament House tonight.

Ten of the 26 Fulbright awards, for postgraduate students to study and research at top universities in the United States, have been awarded to Canterbury. Previous Fulbright scholars include Pulitzer Prize winners, heads of state and Nobel Prize winners.

Canterbury’s Distinguished Professor Geoff Chase says the results reflect the new University of Canterbury student profile and commitment by the university to be far more international.

“In all cases it shows we are producing graduates able to compete and get into the very best schools. The schools and places and unis our students are going to are all top flight. This demonstrates that nearly four years after the earthquakes, Canterbury is punching above its weights.

“Historically, Fulbrights have been more about arts and sciences but for various reasons this time we have a strong engineering contingent, which reflects the Government’s funding support for our recovery and expansion in all areas reflecting the nature of post-quake work and research.

“Engineering and technology are increasingly of international importance and we are showing substantial leadership in these areas. The span of schools and disciplines of students who won awards shows the all-round complete university aspect of the University of Canterbury. We are not just specialists in a few things but we cover such a wide field of academic endeavour.

The university’s Fulbright representative Dr Clemency Montelle says the Fulbright awards are not given on the basis of academic merit alone.

“Students must also have ambassadorial qualities, show all-round high achievement, they must be leaders, community minded and be of the calibre that can make a splash overseas in academics and beyond,” Dr Montelle says.

Canterbury engineering honours student Max Ferguson received a $33,000 Fulbright scholarship in natural disaster research. This award is for a promising New Zealand graduate student to undertake postgraduate study or research at a US institution in the field of natural disaster research.

Ferguson, from Christchurch, will complete a Master of Science degree in civil engineering, specialising in structural and geotechnical engineering, at Stanford University in Stanford, California.

The other University of Canterbury Fulbright scholars announced tonight are:
