Second Free Earthquake Lecture
==============================

Second Free Earthquake Lecture

In response to public demand, the University of Canterbury is giving residents another opportunity to attend a free lecture by geologist Dr Mark Quigley.

A lecture on campus last week was attended by 600 people, with several hundred more being turned away. Next week's lecture will be held in the James Hay Theatre at the Town Hall, which can accommodate about 1,000 people.

It will consider how the 4 September earthquake occurred and why the fault line responsible for it was not known before now. Dr Quigley, who has had a high media profile in the weeks since the earthquake, will also discuss aftershocks and when they might stop; what has been learnt from the earthquake; and the likelihood of another major earthquake in the Canterbury region.

The free lecture will be held on Tuesday 2 November between 6.00pm and 7.30pm in the James Hay Theatre, and will replace the scheduled UC in the City lecture at the Christchurch Art Gallery.

Residents who have a question they would like to be considered for discussion on the night should email myquestion@canterbury.ac.nz.
