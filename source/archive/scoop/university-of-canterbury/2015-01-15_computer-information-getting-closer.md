In the next five years people will be able to search for information using their glasses, a wrist watch, or even a computer built into the clothes they wear.

A University of Canterbury research project is investigating how smaller computers will affect people’s behaviour.

The university’s psychology experts are collaborating with their human interface technology colleagues to investigate how skills used in daily lives can be made easier or improved by using the in-development Google Glasses.

The research is being carried out by Professor Deak Helton and PhD student Matt Ward, along with the university’s HITLabNZ Professor Mark Billinghurst.

Ward says the Google Glass consists of a computer unit which can be attached to a variety of prescription glasses or sunglasses frames.

“Users can see information displayed by the device’s liquid crystal on silicon micro-display which overlays a virtual image over top of the real world. Sounds are transmitted using a bone conduction audio transducer; simulating headphones without the need for extra wires.

“The Google Glass takes inputs using voice commands, the camera, a variety of internal sensors and a touchpad on the side of the device. It also connects to both Android and iOS phones to expand its range of inputs.

“The team here at University of Canterbury has just completed a study where users performed a tracking task, requiring constant attention, while simultaneously receiving messages on the Google Glass. This tested how well users are able to play attention to the Google Glass and the real world at the same time.

“While monitoring the Google Glass, users had a harder time judging the speed of moving objects. They also had slower reaction times to sudden changes in movement by about a quarter of a second. While this seems like a very small amount of time, it represents a very real danger around fast moving objects.

“A car traveling at the standard street speed limit will travel more than three metres in this time, a significant hazard whether the user is driving the car, or just trying to the cross the road in front of it.

“Our continuing research will try and reverse this, increasing the speed and ease with which users interact with the Google Glasses. Our goal is to minimise the distracting effects of these devices until they integrate smoothly into users’ behaviour, along with finding skills than can be made easier and quicker by using the Glass. Together this will help future programs and devices improve rather than impair day to day tasks.”

Professor Helton says the University of Canterbury is well-placed to be a leader of wearable interface research in Australasia.

“We do innovative work, especially in how wearables are used in physically demanding situations, like moving over natural terrain, where we are an international leader. We have some exciting news coming about our latest research which will help people in their daily lives. Many PhD psychology students at Canterbury are looking into issues that impact on people’s lives,” Professor Helton says.
