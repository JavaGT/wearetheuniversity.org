Huge public demand from the community for UC’s legal advice

**Huge public demand from the community for UC’s legal advice**  
   
**May 12, 2013**  
   
Unprecedented demand for free legal services is seeing the Christchurch Community Law Centre and the School of Law at the University of Canterbury (UC) inundated with inquires.  
   
A year on year increase in the number of inquiries at the Community Law Centre has seen the centre grow to be the largest of its type in New Zealand, says its head, Paul O’Neill.  
   
\`\`Canterbury law students are making a major contribution to the wellbeing of our community through servicing more than 20,000 inquiries from the public each year’’ O’Neill says.  
   
The Dean of UC’s School of Law, Associate Professor Chris Gallavin, says in the aftermath of the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes that not-for-profit service centres such as the Community Law Centre are increasingly important to the recovery of the Christchurch community.  
   
\`\`Like the enthusiasm shown by students in the Student Volunteer Army, our law students are very keen to help those in need wherever possible. It is extremely heartening to see young people so passionate about standing up for their community.  
   
\`\`While the great need for free legal help in Christchurch is a damming indictment on the provision of core services, it also brings great opportunity. Where else in the country are enthusiastic young people presented with the opportunity to really make a difference in their community? Nowhere but Christchurch,’’ Professor Gallavin says.  
   
He is finding increased interest in the study of law at UC from high school students outside of the Canterbury region, a fact he attributes in large part to the opportunities Canterbury offers.  
   
\`\`Christchurch is a tale of two cities at the moment, those who are still struggling and those who believe our region to be the most exciting and innovative place in the country,’’ Professor Gallavin says.  
   
Up to 100 UC law students at any one time work at the Christchurch Community Law Centre servicing inquires through the phone service, drop in clinics and appointment service. The centre also takes on specific public interest cases in which law students work with lawyers to advance causes too big, too complex and too expensive for commercial lawyers to be engaged.
