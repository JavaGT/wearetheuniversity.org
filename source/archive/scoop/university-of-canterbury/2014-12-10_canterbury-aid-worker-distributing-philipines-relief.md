University of Canterbury senior fellow and entrepreneur-in-residence and international humanitarian aid worker Linda Cruse says they havestarted distributing relief parcels to hundreds of villagers in the Philippines who have been left homeless and without food following a devastating storm that has killed 27 people.

Typhoon Hagupit has forced more than a million Filipino people into temporary shelters. Cruse has helped with humanitarian work following disasters in many countries and was today handing over emergency supplies and basic provisions for more than 600 vulnerable families in the northern village of Carles.

\`\`We provided food and bare essentials to 600 families. There were small rations for each family which are total lifesavers - for the babies, children and for their hope. It was humbling seeing the old and young so grateful for so little,’’ Cruse says.

\`\`People are really shaken up. Their fishing nets were knocked over in the fierce winds and it will take a few days to get them ready to catch fish again. Now I am off to help clean up the damage in the community gardens which is a powerful cooperative which sustains 17 families.

The hands-on approach is needed as fast as possible to release the vegetables crushed by fallen bamboo. It is super-hot and humid but we are sweating through it. University of Canterbury student Hannah Rhodes has been an amazing help. We are teaching health and hygiene to villagers today.

\`\`Two Auckland University students have been deeply touched by what they have witnessed and have real humanitarian mission work experience. They intend to enrol in and complete the humanitarian and aid work courses as the University of Canterbury establishes them next year.’’

Most homes are still without electricity but the critical need is food and hygiene. The villagers have not been able to fish, work on the land, sell their goods and all their resources are gone.

Cruse will deliver an entrepreneurial course to University of Canterbury management students next year – called the 21-day challenge. More information will be available in the new year.
