Media release: New trans-Tasman research partnership launched at Parliament

Taking public health research, crime research, hazards management, cultural mapping and city planning to the next level through advanced technologies is the goal of a new and unique trans-Tasman partnership for the University of Canterbury.

This evening (Wednesday, 13 July) the University will officially become the first New Zealand university to partner with Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information (CRCSI) at a function hosted by the Minister of Science and Innovation, Hon Dr Wayne Mapp, at Parliament Buildings.

Australia’s cooperative research centres are part of an Australian federal government programme which brings together researchers from universities, government organisations, private industry and public sector agencies to achieve real outcomes of economic and social significance.

In New Zealand, it is estimated that the use of geospatial information adds more than $1 billion a year to the New Zealand economy, and there remains significant opportunity for additional financial and non-financial productivity benefits.

The spatial information industry is a component of the broader information technology sector and has scientific and technical links to all other disciplines such as environmental science, engineering, computer science, health delivery, logistics, planning, resource management and electronics.

The new strategic partnership between the University of Canterbury and the CRCSI will provide a New Zealand hub for analysis and research on geospatial information and its applications, including in the health sector, in hazard management, and in urban planning - including the Christchurch rebuild.

“Geospatial research is a key contributor to New Zealand’s economic growth and is set to contribute even more in the future,” said UC’s Dean of Science, Professor Wendy Lawson. “It has a very significant role to play in the rebuilding of Christchurch and has applications in a range of areas that impact on all New Zealanders.”

The New Zealand node of CRCSI was established last year, with LINZ (Land Information New Zealand) as New Zealand's "anchor" government participant.

“As a well-connected organisation, the University's active involvement will have a positive influence on those key government and private sector organisations who are developing their own cases for joining the CRCSI,” said LINZ Chief Executive, Colin MacDonald.

“The University of Canterbury is exhibiting a commitment to capacity building and research in the spatial sector,” said Simon Jellie, Managing Director of e-Spatial Limited and industry consortium 43pl Board Member. “The relationships that develop from a long-term commitment to CRCSI will, from an industry perspective, ensure that research remains relevant and that graduates are equipped with the skills required to meet market demands.

“By joining the CRCSI, the University will strengthen its leadership position in applied spatial science, both nationally and on the international stage, as well as provide new expertise and potential collaborations with existing CRCSI participants.”
