**UC Motorsport students take podium in global race**

University of Canterbury Motorsport students are celebrating their podium finish in the prestigious Formula SAE competition in Melbourne over the weekend.

In the Formula SAE competition, 30 international university teams design and build a car from scratch to race it, and are judged not only on speed but also on such factors as endurance, acceleration and efficiency.

UC Faculty Advisor to the team Bruce Robertson attributes UC’s success to its exceptionally high level of organisation. UC Motorsport had designed and built its car by early July, and then spent months testing and fine-tuning it.

“Due to their tireless work over the last year, they were rewarded with a car that was both fast and perfectly reliable, which is very, very rare in this competition,” Mr Robertson says.

“I believe this level of professionalism from our students is the reason they have enjoyed a rise to the top of the field, now with a world-class car, in an unprecedentedly short period of just three years.”

UC Motorsport placed first in skid pan, which assesses how quickly and well a car can go around a corner, and finished second in autocross.

The UC team also placed second in the business presentation part of the competition, where students had to ‘pitch’ their car to a panel of mock investors.
