British Cabinet Minister Lectures In Christchurch

British Cabinet Minister's Lectures In Christchurch

The British Cabinet minister who sparked an outcry three weeks ago when she approved a controversial GE project, will speak in Christchurch tomorrow night (Tuesday).

Margaret Beckett, who is the UK’s Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, will deliver a lecture for the University of Canterbury’s National Centre for Research on Europe.

Mrs Beckett has overall responsibility for environmental, agricultural, horticultural, fisheries and rural affairs in Britain.

She angered environmental campaigners and organic farmers earlier this month when she approved a commercial planting of a type of maize modified to resist herbicides.

Mrs Beckett is a member of the EU’s Agricultural and Fisheries and Environment councils, and has campaigned for radical reform of Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy.

The National Centre for Research on Europe, at Canterbury University, works with students and scholars to help the government and the New Zealand public understand issues facing the EU.

After Australia, the EU is New Zealand’s second largest trading partner.
