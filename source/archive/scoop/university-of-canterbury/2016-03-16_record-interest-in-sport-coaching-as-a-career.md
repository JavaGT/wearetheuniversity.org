**Record interest in Sport Coaching as a career**

With the University of Canterbury celebrating increased enrolments among school leavers and new-to-university students, the Bachelor of Sport Coaching degree has seen record growth, with enrolments increasing by 125 per cent, compared to the same time in 2015.

Sport Coaching degree programme coordinator Dr Jenny Clarke attributes part of this growth to the new endorsements and professional accreditation students can gain, as well as final-year internships in professional sporting workplaces.

The degree offers endorsements in Leadership, Performance Analysis, Strength and Conditioning and Māori Health and Wellbeing.

“Performance Analysis students can gain accreditation through the International Society of Performance Analysis in Sport and the opportunity to sit Sportstec analysis accreditation. Sportstec’s software is an industry standard, providing performance analysis support to thousands of international professional sporting organisations including English Premiership football teams, NBL franchises in the United States, and our own Crusaders rugby team.

“UC also hosts the internationally recognised Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS) exam,” Dr Clarke says.

In addition to the sport science endorsements, students prepare for careers as managers, leaders in business and teachers through the Leadership endorsement.

“Many students choose double endorsements, gaining leadership skills while training to also deliver quality Strength and Conditioning support to athletes and teams.”
