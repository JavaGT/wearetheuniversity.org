UC leads carbon crusade, reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 34%

Amid a $1.2 billion, 86-hectare campus rejuvenation, the University of Canterbury has managed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by a third.

An annual independent audit shows that since the benchmark year of 2010 the University of Canterbury (UC) has reduced its absolute emissions by 34%.

Darryn Russell, UC’s acting Executive Director of Learning Resources, describes the achievement – the first of its type in the Southern Hemisphere – as “good for the University, the country and the planet”.

UC is leading by example, he says, by showing that it can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and show good corporate social responsibility.

“UC provides a world-class learning environment so it’s natural that it also has a strong sustainability focus,” Mr Russell says.

He welcomes the University’s recertification under CEMARS – Certified Emissions Measurement and Reduction Scheme – to ISO 16042.

“The recertification for UC represents significant work by many people, who can celebrate their efforts in this endorsement. It also recognises the commitment of the University Council, management and staff to protect our environment though the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions. That commitment is made as part of a local, national and global community.”

Last year, UC won an Enviro-Mark Solutions award for at least a 20% reduction in absolute emissions or emissions intensity and held CEMARS or carboNZero certification for 6+ years.

Independent certification proves that a company or product is taking credible action for a better environment. CEMARS certification is available in 17 countries and recognised in over 60 countries.
