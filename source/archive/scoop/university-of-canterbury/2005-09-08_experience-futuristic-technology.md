Experience futuristic technology at EPECentre R&D Expo

If you want to see where the future is taking technology and shaping innovation in the energy field then you shouldn’t miss next week’s EPECentre Research and Development Expo 2005: The Return of the Machines.

The expo on Thursday 15 September is being run by the Electric Power Engineering Centre (EPECentre) at the University of Canterbury in association with its industry partners. It will showcase cutting edge technology coming out of the Centre of Excellence at the University of Canterbury and highlight exciting research opportunities in the energy sector.

The event will also mark the official opening of the newly upgraded Electric Machines Laboratory which EPECentre Manager Joseph Lawrence says is the best of its kind in Australasia and one of the best in the world.

Research and development displays include the world’s first partial-core superconducting transformer, a lightning arc cannon capable of firing 70m arcs of real lightning, and a display on renewable energy and energy efficiency research for Scott Base, Antarctica, as part of EPECentre’s Project Antarctica.

There will also be a series of live demonstrations including Lightning Arc Sculptures, a fusion between Fine Arts and Engineering, and — one especially for those concerned about the petrol price hikes — electric vehicles, the automobiles of the 21st century.

Also packed into the hour-long expo will be the announcement of the 12 recipients of this year’s prestigious EPECentre Scholarships, worth between $5000 to $25,000, each.

The Return of The Machines Expo will run from 4pm to 5pm on Thursday 15 September in the Machines Laboratory of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. It is open to the public.
