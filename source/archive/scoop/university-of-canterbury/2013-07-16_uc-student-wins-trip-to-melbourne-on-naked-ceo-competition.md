**UC student wins trip to Melbourne in Asia-Pacific Naked CEO competition**

**July 16, 2013**

A University of Canterbury (UC) fourth year business student, Nicole Van Dugteren, is one of six Asia-Pacific winners in the Australian-organised Naked CEO Boardroom competition.

The event is run by professional accounting organisation CPA Australia which is one of the largest accounting bodies in the world.

Van Dugteren’s prize is a four night visit to Melbourne later this month. She will receive two days of mentoring from the CPA chief executive Alex Malley and will sit in on CPA board meetings.

To qualify for Melbourne, students were asked to submit an accounting question to the CPA chief executive Alex Malley via The Naked CEO website (www.thenakedceo.com). The six best questions were judged by Malley. The five other winners are from Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore.

The July 24 to 26 trip gives the winners a look at the day to day role of an accounting chief executive. CPA Australia is a global professional accountancy body with 132,000 members in 116 countries.

The visit will help Van Dugteren bridge the gap between theory and the raw reality of life on the road to leadership success.

This is the third year in a row a UC student has won the major CPA Australia competition. In 2011 Tim Brand won the Make Your Mark competition and a trip to Sydney to meet Commander Neil Armstrong, the first person to land on the moon.

Last year, Pip Widdon won the New Zealand Big Break competition and a trip to Melbourne to compete in the grand final, presenting her business case for The Make-a-Wish Foundation to a panel of judges.
