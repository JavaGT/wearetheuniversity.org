**UC living-learning adventure for Auckland students**

The University of Canterbury (UC) has announced a “Go Canterbury” living-learning experience to encourage Auckland students to study at UC in Christchurch in 2016.

The Go Canterbury grant is open to current Year 13 Auckland students with a minimum of NCEA Level 2 Merit and a taste for personal leadership and outdoor adventure. The offer is open to both domestic and international students already in New Zealand.

Designed to promote the benefits of studying in Christchurch – the gateway to South Island outdoor adventures – the Go Canterbury grant also marks the recent opening of UC’s new Auckland office and is a response to Auckland’s high housing costs.

“In Auckland, it can take 90 minutes just for students to get from flats they can afford to their campus. In Canterbury, you can get to a skifield, beach, high country track or a myriad of other recreational activities in that time,” University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says.

The Go Canterbury grant will enable Auckland students to get a quality UC degree while experiencing the South Island outdoors through a first year adventure experience package. The three components of the grant are personal leadership development, a $5,000 accommodation grant and a range of adventure activities such as skiing, tramping, visits to UC field stations and community engagement.

“Every New Zealander should spend time in the South Island, and university is a great time to do it. The Go Canterbury Grant offers Auckland-based students access to research-led academic teaching and a vibrant student experience. UC’s partnerships with the Crusaders, the Tactix, and the Student Volunteer Army, along with more than 130 student clubs and a great location mean there is always a new adventure in store,” says Dr Carr.

UC helped relieve post-quake rental pressure in Christchurch by adding student accommodation capacity, and now has space to take more students from Auckland city. More than 2,000 students live in UC halls within 700 metres of their lecture theatres or labs, giving them more free time for study, recreation and socialising.

“Despite the earthquakes, UC has retained our world-class ranking in the top three percent of the world’s 17,000 universities,” says Dr Carr.

“UC is already ranked as the 21st most international university, based on the nationalities of our staff and students.”

Applications for the grant open on 6 July and are due by 30 September. Successful applicants will be notified by 7 October – visit the UC website www.canterbury.ac.nz from 6 July for more details.
