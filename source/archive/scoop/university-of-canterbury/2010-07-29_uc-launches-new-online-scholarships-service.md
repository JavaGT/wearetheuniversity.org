**UC launches new online scholarships service**

Searching for scholarship support to study at the University of Canterbury has just got a whole lot easier.

The University has launched a new online service for students which will help them search through the more than $13.5 million worth of scholarships and prize funding available annually and make it easier for them to find a suitable scholarship to assist with their study.

The new scholarships website – www.canterbury.ac.nz/scholarships/– went live this week. The site enables students to search through the full list of scholarships and download application forms for study in New Zealand and abroad.

  
UC Student Management System Manager Trudi Zawodny said the new and improved site gave UC’s potential scholars easier access to a lot more information and ensured that information was the most up-to-date available.

  
“The service is being driven by a searchable database fed from the Jade Student Management System and is updated automatically overnight. It replaces a brochure-like website that was difficult to maintain. Students will be able to search and view it in a manner that has the most relevance to them,” she said.

  
Ms Zawodny said during the site’s developments over the past 12 months measures had been taken to improve the quality of the information available and ensure it was kept current. Much work had also gone into making the site both easy to navigate for its target audience but also more visually appealing.

A new prominent feature of the site’s homepage is rolling profiles of scholarship students studying and succeeding at UC.

  
Ms Zawodny said the idea behind the site’s revamp was to get more people aware of the extensive range of scholarships available and applying for them so the University would in turn get a “greater pool of talent”.

  
“We expect to see an increase in both the volume and quality of scholarship applications, which in turn will move us further towards our strategic intent of attracting people with the greatest potential.”
