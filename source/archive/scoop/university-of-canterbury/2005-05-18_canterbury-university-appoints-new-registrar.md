The University of Canterbury has appointed its current Director of Communications and Development, Jeff Field, as its new Registrar.

The appointment will take effect from the end of July when the current Registrar, Alan Hayward, retires.

Vice-Chancellor, Professor Roy Sharp, says Mr Field will bring significant strengths to the role.

“Jeff has extensive experience, expertise and qualifications of direct relevance to the position.

“His institutional knowledge is deep and wide-ranging. He has worked in a variety of portfolios, principally with an external focus, and has been responsible for internal and external communications, alumni relations, fundraising, marketing, the International Office, the Printery and Canterbury University Press.

“Throughout his 17 years as a Canterbury staff member he has worked closely with Vice-Chancellors, Councils and Chancellors and various Senior Management Teams.”

Mr Field began his working life at Canterbury University in 1988 as Information Officer following successful teaching and journalism careers.

After graduating from the University with an MA with first class honours in psychology and a postgraduate Diploma in Journalism, and a Teachers' College Diploma, with distinction, from the Christchurch College of Education, he taught mathematics at Aranui High School.

A career change some years later saw him working as a reporter on the Christchurch Star daily newspaper and then a reporter/director for Television New Zealand, rising to the position of Chief Reporter for the Canterbury Region.

Mr Field is internationally accredited in public relations, being made APR (Accredited in Public Relations) in 2002. He also holds fundraising qualifications jointly awarded by the Fundraising Institute of New Zealand, the University of Indiana and the University of Queensland.
