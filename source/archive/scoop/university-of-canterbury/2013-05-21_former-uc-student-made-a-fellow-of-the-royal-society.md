**Former UC student made a Fellow of the Royal Society**

**May 21, 2013**

A former University of Canterbury (UC) student, Cambridge University astronomy professor Gerry Gilmore has become a Fellow of the Royal Society (UK).

Professor Gilmore, who was the first UC student to receive an astronomy doctorate in 1979, leads efforts at Cambridge to understand the structure and origin of the galaxy. A number of UC students have gone on to become Fellows of the Society, starting with Ernest Rutherford.

Professor Gilmore pioneered the use of spectral surveys to unravel the galaxy's history. In 1994 he and a student discovered the galaxy's most important satellite after the Magellanic clouds.
