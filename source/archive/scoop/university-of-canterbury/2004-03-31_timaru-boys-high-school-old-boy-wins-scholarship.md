Timaru Boys’ High School old boy wins scholarship

Timaru Boys’ High School old boy wins university scholarship.

The latest recipient of the Jim Wakefield Scholarship for Timaru Boys’ High School old boys studying at the University of Canterbury is someone who progressively flowered during his school years, according to the school’s principal.

Thomas Small is the fourth person to receive the scholarship, worth up to $9,000 over three years, which was established by another Timaru Boys’ old boy, Jim Wakefield.

The former accountant and retired businessman set up the fund after realising the benefits of such awards when he received a Don McKenzie Scholarship to Canterbury University in the 1950s.

Thomas Small spent five years at Timaru Boys’ and, last year, was one of its prefects.

Principal Kevin O’Sullivan says Thomas has a fine work attitude which, when he was at the school, extended well beyond the classroom.

“He is a thoughtful young man who always gave of his best; who really came into his own during his latter years at school in the sense that he took on quite a constructive leadership role.”

Thomas represented the school in swimming and sailing events and won a number of academic prizes. He also played in the Timaru Boys’ and Timaru Municipal brass bands with last year’s winner of the Wakefield Scholarship, Anthony Smith.

Since leaving Timaru Boys’ Thomas has begun studying engineering at Canterbury University.

He says he is delighted to be this year’s scholarship recipient.

“It’s something not everyone gets. Without it I would have to get a huge student loan. It will definitely benefit me.”
