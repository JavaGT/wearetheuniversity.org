UC/CCE merger goes to next stage

The University of Canterbury and the Christchurch College of Education have agreed to forward their merger business case to the Minister of Education for consideration.

The Councils of both Christchurch tertiary education organisations met yesterday and considered the third draft of the academic and business case and resolved to take their merger discussions to the next stage.

The draft, developed by a project team and joint working groups, incorporated feedback from senior management at UC and CCE, Academic Boards at both institutions, the Project Reference Group and UC’s Finance, Planning and Resources Committee.

The business case identifies a strong strategic and academic rationale for the merger, including:  
\- the current extensive teaching and administrative integration of the neighbouring institutions  
\- the integration of teacher training within universities internationally and in the North Island  
\- a policy environment which supports such mergers  
\- the alignment of teacher education with most other major professions  
\- the University’s interest in the outcomes of schooling  
\- the wider societal benefit from enhancing and adding academic depth to teacher education

The draft case considered by the two Councils will form the basis of the document to be sent to the Minister.

If the merger does proceed then formal consultation with staff and unions will be undertaken using established protocols in respect of proposals for change, with a view to completing the merger before the 2007 academic year.

The detailed background information about the proposed merger can be viewed at http://merger.cce.ac.nz.
