**UC Connect public lecture: Who speaks for the trees? The possible futures of conservation**

In an upcoming UC Connect public lecture, _Who speaks for the trees? The possible futures of conservation_, University of Canterbury law academic David Round considers the choices ahead for the public conservation estate, native species, the Department of Conservation and environmental law itself in an age of increasingly desperate resource exploitation, environmental degradation and international uncertainty.

A keen tramper, he is a former national president of Federated Mountain Clubs and former member of the Canterbury/ Aoraki Conservation Board. He is currently a trustee of the Maurice White Conservation Trust and the Canterbury Te Araroa Trust.
