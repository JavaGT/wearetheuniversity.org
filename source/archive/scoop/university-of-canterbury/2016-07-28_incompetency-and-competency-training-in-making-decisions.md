**Incompetency and Competency Training in Making Tough Decisions**

An upcoming public lecture from an American professor of marketing will look at the wisdom behind the quote: “It's not what we don't know that hurts. It's what we know that ain't so.” (Will Rodgers).

Incompetency training is often highly effective in committing trainees and entire nations to engage in bad to disastrous actions, according to marketing expert and visiting Erskine Fellow, Professor Arch G. Woodside, Boston College, United States, in his upcoming UC Connect public lecture at the University of Canterbury.

Slavery as God's will, the reasoning behind the ‘Stolen Generations’ of indigenous children, the pre-war ‘weapons of mass destruction’ propaganda by US President George W. Bush, and the use of ‘product portfolio planning’ tools such as the Boston Consulting Group's growth-share matrix are examples of such high-impact training activities and bad outcomes.

Incompetency training is pervasive and often non-apparent to trainees and trainers, Prof Woodside says. Learning how to be competent is insufficient for avoiding the powerful influences of incompetency training.

His presentation answers two questions:

• What tools do educators, executives, politicians, and people knowingly and unknowingly use that increase incompetence in thinking, deciding and doing?

• What steps are useful to take to reduce highly effective incompetency training?

Attend Prof Woodside's UC Connect public lecture to learn tools that help to increase vigilance and reduce the impact of incompetency training, with relevance to those interested in business strategy, marketing and human resources.
