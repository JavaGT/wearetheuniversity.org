Thorough analysis of speed limit increases needed

**Thorough analysis of speed limit increases needed**

**March 28, 2013**

Open road speed limits should not be increased to 110kph without thorough analysis, a University of Canterbury (UC) transport expert says.

UC transport engineering Professor Alan Nicholson was commenting today on the push to lift the speed limit to 110kph on the newest and safest roads.

Associate Transport Minister Michael Woodhouse would not rule out increasing the 100kph maximum speed limit. Police say they are open to discussion.

Professor Nicholson said actual speeds are quite close to 110kmh now.

\`\`This is likely to be the result of police applying a 10kph tolerance, except at holiday weekends. An increase in the speed limit is very likely to be accompanied by a further increase in actual speeds, as drivers take advantage of the tolerance applied by the police.”

Events such as the recent traffic jam event in Auckland, where inner-city traffic was brought to a virtual standstill, would likely to become more frequent if the speed limit was increased due to more serious accidents.

Professor Nicholson disagrees with the suggestion that increasing the speed limit by 10kmh could reduce congestion.

\`\`There is more than one measure of congestion, but traffic flow theory does not support a decrease in any of those measures of congestion due to an increase in the speed limit as such.”

He also said that an increase in vehicle speeds on roads where speeds are already 100 kph or more would result in an increase in fuel consumption and vehicle operating costs, which the road freight industry would presumably need to pass on to its customers.

\`\`New roads are being built with safety features that allow for a higher speed. A substantial part of the justification of new roads is an improvement in safety and an increase in speed limits and operating speeds could well undermine the achievement of those safety benefits.’’

Professor Nicholson said the issues are complex and need a lot more analysis.
