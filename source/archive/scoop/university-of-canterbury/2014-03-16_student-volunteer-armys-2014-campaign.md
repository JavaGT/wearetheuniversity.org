Top businessman to help launch Student Volunteer Army’s 2014 campaign

  
One of New Zealand's most successful businessmen, founder of 42 Below vodka and Moa beer, Geoff Ross, will help to launch the University of Canterbury (UC) Student Volunteer Army’s 2014 campaign on campus next week.

In a positive upbeat approach to the new academic year, the Student Volunteer Army (SVA) has appealed to all UC students to \`\`become a member of the Secret Service and learn the secret to success at the 2014 Student Volunteer Army launch night on March 20’’.

SVA president Bridget Williams says the launch, with a live band, is an opportunity for students to mingle with past and present SVA members and to unveil big plans for the year.

\`\`We can’t reveal all the secrets of our community plans for this year yet. They will be unveiled next Thursday night.

\`\`But we one thing we can say is that we plan to single out one of the neediest Christchurch communities and let them know that we are coming to their aid for just one day, on May 4, and carry out any projects needed around their houses and gardens.

\`\`We have over 1300 members and it's hard to say how many people we hope to help just one community. But we will take their rubbish to the dump, weed, mow lawns, chop wood, wash windows, paint murals, bake, vacuum and do any general fix-it jobs.

\`\`The launch illustrates the SVA is becoming more organised than ever. We are going to explain what is in store for the future of the SVA and list our events for the year.

\`\`We want to emphasise a new level of professionalism for the SVA so we can prove that while we are great at responding to natural events, we have another side that is sustainable, and proactively engage with the community so we can empower students.

\`\`The launch will also demonstrate how much the SVA has grown as we showed in helping the Heathcote community after the recent floods.’’

Williams says a raft of community service projects were planned for this year. The SVA was born on the streets of Christchurch after the February 22, 2011 earthquake to help with the liquefaction clean-up.
