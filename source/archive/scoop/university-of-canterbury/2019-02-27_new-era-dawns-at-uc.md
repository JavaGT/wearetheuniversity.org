It was a year of highlights for the University. Prime Minister Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern opened Stage 1 of the $220 million Rutherford Regional Science and Innovation Centre – the Ernest Rutherford building, named for renowned UC alumnus Lord Rutherford. The building includes specialist teaching and research laboratories for Physics, Astronomy, Chemistry, Geology, Geography and Biological Sciences. Construction of Stage 2 is well under way, the innovative multi-storey timber-framed building named for UC alumna and renowned astronomer Beatrice Tinsley.

The blessing of the new Rehua building, which opened for teaching in January 2019, marked another special moment in UC’s recovery. Rehua houses the College of Education, Health and Human Development | Te Rāngai Ako me te Hauora, the Centre for Entrepreneurship | Te Pokapū Rakahinonga and the Executive Development Programme of the College of Business and Law | Te Rāngai Umanga me te Ture.

In 2018 UC recovered student numbers with 14,070 EFTS\* overall (an increase of 7.5% on 2017), with increases across domestic, international and postgraduate students.

Financially, the University achieved a $9.6 million surplus, compared to the 2017 deficit of $5.3m, and a budgeted operating deficit for 2018 of $7.9m. The surplus was buoyed by a one-off insurance payment for earthquake damage. The University also received the final $50m of support from the Crown, having achieved the necessary milestones and targets required. This post-earthquake support of up to $260m of the University’s building programme concluded in 2018. The University remains grateful for the assistance from the Crown and, through that support, its acknowledgement of the role UC plays in the city of Christchurch and the economy, as one of the region’s largest employers.
