UC graduate takes up art residency in Berlin

A recent University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts (SoFA) graduate is heading to Germany for her first art residency, fulfilling her goal of traveling the world with her painting.

Nikki Kutyn, who graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from SoFA last year, was one of four international artists chosen for the three-month residency, at a privately owned gallery, Gallerie 102, situated in the centre of West and East Berlin.

“During this time we are offered mentoring, gallery openings, museum viewings and tours, and most importantly, the opportunity to paint. This particular residency aims to enable artists’ access to the art market in Berlin and it also opens up the opportunity to make promising contacts for future projects. At the end of the residency there will also be a group exhibition that commences during Gallery Weekend Berlin,” Kutyn says.

In order to be accepted into the residency, applicants’ works were presented in front of a jury which then considered the artists’ experience, artistic background, and work as a whole. From there, a collective decision was made about which four artists would receive the residency.

Kutyn admits she is both excited and nervous to begin this huge experience, flying overseas on Monday, especially as she doesn’t speak German.

“Words cannot justify how grateful I am to receive this opportunity to be exposed to a whole new variety of art, as well as the chance to break into the international art scene. Unfortunately for me I know little to no German. However, I am trying my best to speed-learn as much German language as possible. I cannot wait for this amazing opportunity that lies ahead of me.”
