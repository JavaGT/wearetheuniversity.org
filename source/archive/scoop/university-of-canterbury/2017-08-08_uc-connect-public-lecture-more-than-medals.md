UC Connect public lecture: More than medals
===========================================

**UC Connect public lecture: More than medals – turning athletes into future leaders**

Athletes are an exceptional population as they need to maintain a wide range of skills, attitudes and capabilities across different domains while competing in competitions. Many successful athletes are also notable for their ability to either develop additional skills, or acquire a new skill set replacing the original, and subsequently apply them at the top level of performance. While the characteristics required for learning new skills are not unique to athletes, their focus on a very precise skill set, coupled with their ability to transfer performance of high standards in one domain into new activities by being goal-focused, motivated and confident in their abilities, makes them a useful model for the wider population.

This presentation will focus on how athletes can develop and adapt into fundamentally different and increasingly complex roles and environments and, as a result, have the potential to be future leaders and influencers in businesses and the community.

Visiting the University of Canterbury as a 2017 Canterbury Fellow, David Lavallee is a Professor and Head of the School of Sport at the University of Stirling, Scotland. A central focus of his research is on the transitions experienced by athletes across their career in order to better understand how skills are learned, developed, applied, maintained and adapted. His research aims to contribute to more responsible support systems by focusing on the duty of care for participants in sport.
