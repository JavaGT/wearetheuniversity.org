**UC economists to give public talk on money**

September 4, 2013

University of Canterbury (UC) economists Stephen Hickson and Eric Crampton will give a public talk in the Christchurch central city tomorrow night about money.

Hickson will ask people at the Physics Room in the CBD to think about money and why society has money.

"How did we end up with the money system we have? For something to be useful as money, what must it be able to do?

"In order to do these things, what must money be like? In today’s modern economy, money is really just bits of paper but it can cause a couple of big problems.

"One is when everyone decides to go and get their money out of the bank at the same time and there just isn’t enough to go around.

"The other is when a government misbehaves and decides to print too much money, usually to try and pay its own bills."

Dr Crampton will help people who may be bamboozled by economics and want to understand how it all works.

"I’ll explain the gap between economics the public understands and what economists know about economic policy issues."
