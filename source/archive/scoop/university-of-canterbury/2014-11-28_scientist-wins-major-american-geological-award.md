**University of Canterbury scientist wins major American geological award**

**November 28, 2014**

University of Canterbury’s Associate Professor Mark Quigley is the first scientist outside North America to win the Geological Society of America’s annual Public Service award, for his work following the Canterbury earthquakes.

Over the last four years Associate Professor Quigley has become one of New Zealand’s best known and respected earth scientists for his research excellence and through his clear, accurate and engaging scientific communications following 2010 and 2011 quakes.

He has become a leading science communicator providing understanding, context and vision with a deep subject knowledge. His awareness of key geoscience issues has helped decision-making in the recovery and rebuild of Christchurch city, head of the university’s geological sciences department, Professor Jarg Pettinga, says.

\`\`Mark’s own website www.drquigs.com has amassed over three million hits. He has received the Prime Minister’s Prize for Science Communication, the New Zealand Association of Scientists Science Communication Prize and the top Hochstetter Lecturer award by the Geoscience Society of New Zealand.

\`\`Mark has done an enormous amount of research in terms of Christchurch. He was communicating with people at a time when it was important that they understood what was happening in terms of the seismic activity.

\`\`He is a scientist who understands the need for effective science communication and is willing to step up to improve the public’s scientific understanding. He is a great asset to natural hazards research in New Zealand and to the University of Canterbury.

\`\`His effective engaging style, combined with a rare ability to communicate complex scientific issues to the general audience in a credible and calming way are extraordinary skills to draw on following the quakes.

\`\`He has been involved in an advisory capacity with the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) and other local, regional and central government agencies, so ensuring that the future rebuild of Christchurch city maintains an essential focus on the geological factors,’’ Professor Pettinga says.
