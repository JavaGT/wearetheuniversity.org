UC academic writes for UN on sustainable development

University of Canterbury Associate Professor Bronwyn Hayward is one of 50 world experts, business leaders, and community advocates invited to contribute to a new United Nations report, released this week, into how to address some of the most troubling world problems.

Dr Hayward was asked to comment on how people can change behaviours in everyday life to achieve the new Sustainable Development Goals that came into effect on 1 January 2016 in the United Nations Association – United Kingdom (UNA-UK) publication Sustainable Development Goals: the people’s agenda. She discusses how to shift the focus from ‘promise’ to ‘practice’ to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and build peaceful societies on a healthy planet.

“The problems that face the world are huge. The scale of the Syrian refuge crisis and climate change for example can leave us paralysed as citizens. What can one person do in the face of suffering on a global scale? The reality is both hopeful and helpful. We need individuals who care passionately about the world around them, but individual actions are not enough on their own. Acting with others, in local communities, from cities to national governments, to commit to changing priorities is the key to achieve lasting long-term effects,” Dr Hayward says.

Dr Hayward's article, Changing behaviour to achieve progress, sits alongside those of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations Development Programme Administrator Helen Clark as well as other international figures discussing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

“The SDGs herald the start of 15 momentous years that have the potential to change our world and its people immeasurably for the better. With commitment and hard work, the opportunity is ours to grasp,” Ban Ki-moon writes.

Dr Hayward is the Head of Department of Political Science and International Relations at the University of Canterbury. She is also a Co-Investigator of the ESRC-funded Centre for Sustainable Prosperity CUSP, University of Surrey, UK and Voices of the Future, University of Oslo, Norway.
