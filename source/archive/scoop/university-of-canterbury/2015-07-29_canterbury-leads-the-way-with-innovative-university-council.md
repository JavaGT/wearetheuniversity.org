University of Canterbury leads the way with innovative University Council

29 July 2015

The University of Canterbury Council will lead the way in reducing the size of its governing body – from 20 members to 12, following the gazetting of a new constitution. The change will take effect on 1 August.

UC Chancellor Dr John Wood said the Council had been through a review process in 2013 which meant the Council was well placed to move forward after changes to the Education Act aimed at downsizing the governing bodies of tertiary institutions were foreshadowed by the Minister.

“We had come to our own conclusion following the earthquakes that a smaller, more professionally capable council in terms of financial and governance management would be required to steer the University through that difficult time. With the passing of the Education Amendment Act this year the Council was well placed to submit its revised constitution to the Minister for gazetting and will be the first New Zealand university to make the change, which will come into effect on 1 August.”

At its final meeting under the existing constitution, the Chancellor acknowledged the outgoing members who had contributed to a significant number of critical decisions in recent years, decisions reached through consensus, and in so doing had established a strong foundation on which the incoming Council can build.

The 12 positions on the UC Council will be four ministerial appointments, elected representatives of academic and general staff and students, a Ngāi Tahu appointment, the Vice-Chancellor and three Council appointments, two of whom must be graduates of the University. The Chancellor will continue to be elected from within those members.
