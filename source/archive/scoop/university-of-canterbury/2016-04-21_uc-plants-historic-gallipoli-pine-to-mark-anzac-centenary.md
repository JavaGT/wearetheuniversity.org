UC plants historic Gallipoli pine to mark Anzac centenary

The University of Canterbury is marking the Anzac Day centenary with the planting of a seedling from the original Gallipoli Lone Pine on Anzac Day.

University of Canterbury Chancellor Dr John Wood CNZM QSO will plant the Gallipoli Pine seedling to mark the 100th anniversary of the first Anzac Day after the University’s Anzac Service hosted by the UCSA on Monday 25 April.

Anzac Day was marked for the first time in 1916, a year after the Gallipoli landings. The Gallipoli Pine is of symbolic importance as a representation of our nation's great sacrifice, tenacity and fortitude.

Dr Wood says, “The sacrifice of our predecessors was a terrible one, its consequences enduring and still with us. But without that sacrifice we would not be here, at this place, at this time, doing what we are doing today. We will remember them.”

Scion, a Crown Research Institute, has gifted the Gallipoli Pine to the University of Canterbury for the memorial planting to help honour former students and staff who left New Zealand to fight in World War I and other conflicts. The tree has a direct genetic line to the Gallipoli Lone Pine.

Scion propagated 50 Turkish Red Pine (Pinus brutia) seedlings for distribution in New Zealand for Anzac Day commemorations. There are five of these trees in the South Island - at Christchurch’s Rannerdale Veterans Home and Bridge of Remembrance, Southland’s Invercargill RSA and Wyndham School, and now one at the University of Canterbury.

The UCSA Anzac Service will commence at 10am, in UC’s Ilam Campus central courtyard in front of the Puaka - James Hight Library. The service will be followed by the planting of the Gallipoli Pine near Okeover House. All are welcome to attend the Anzac Service and the tree planting.
