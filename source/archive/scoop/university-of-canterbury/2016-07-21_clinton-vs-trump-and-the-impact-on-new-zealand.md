The Dis-United States? Clinton vs. Trump and the impact on New Zealand

An upcoming UC Connect free public lecture will focus on the raucous 2016 Presidential election in the United States, which is causing headlines around the world.

University of Canterbury academic Dr Amy Fletcher will discuss the Hilary Clinton-Bernie Sanders divide, the Donald Trump candidacy and a divided Republican party, the angry voter, and the implications of the decision on 8 November for United States Foreign Policy and US-NZ relations.

Dr Fletcher is an Associate Professor in the Political Science Department at the University of Canterbury.

Prior to moving to New Zealand to take up a teaching post in 2000, she worked as a legislative assistant in the US House of Representatives.

Born in Huntsville, Alabama, while her father was stationed there to work on the Moon test rockets in the 1960s, she has had a lifelong interest in US politics, space and technology policy, and US foreign policy. At UC she teaches courses on contemporary American Government and public policy.

UC Connect public lecture: _The Dis-United States? Clinton vs. Trump and the impact on New Zealand_, Associate Professor Amy Fletcher, University of Canterbury, Monday 25 July, 7pm.
