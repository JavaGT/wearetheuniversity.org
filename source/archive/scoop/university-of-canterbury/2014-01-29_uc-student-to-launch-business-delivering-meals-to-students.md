**UC student to launch business delivering meals to students**

January 29, 2014

A University of Canterbury (UC) student will next month launch a business delivering meals to students.

Stefan Warnaar will provide ingredients and recipes once a week to make five meals, serving four adults at a time, through his website www.myfivemeals.co.nz.

His business concept has been supported and nurtured by UC Innovators, run by Dr Rachel Wright.

Warnaar says the Christchurch student food delivery service opens February 5 and deliveries will be made every Sunday. The food for individual meals will cost around $6.50.

"We deliver with cooler bins to keep the meat refrigerated. Our food will be approved by health and safety regulations and delivery is free for all orders.

"We will make a profit working on low margins and selling five meals at once. Food is a low margin business and so volume is key.

"There is a similar service in parts of the North Island although ours is aimed at regular families and students who want to eat well and stay on budget.

"As a student I found cooking dinner a chore, but I love eating good food. Our service means students don’t have to spend time menu planning, shopping or budgeting every week.

"We will be helping out during university O-Week starting February 17 promoting My Five Meals.

"By allowing students to choose five meals from a selection of ten makes it simple to plan for the week. We will use higher quality cuts of meat.

"All orders between February 5 and March 9 will receive a free copy of the new UC Students’ Association cookbook _Your on Dishes_. A few of the meals in the cookbook will be available as options on My Five Meals.

"Our goal is to make it simple to enjoy delicious and healthy meals and deliver the best New Zealand meat and produce to students.

"My Five Meals aims to be a replacement for the supermarkets, not an exclusive premium option. We believe our costs are similar or better than the supermarkets. Our food comes from a range of established food wholesalers in Christchurch."

UC Innovators manager Dr Rachel Wright says it was exciting to see students grow, create, develop and realise their business dreams and ideas.

"It is great to see how Stefan has identified a need among his fellow students and has worked out a fantastic solution that has the potential to transform a large number of flats," Dr Wright says.
