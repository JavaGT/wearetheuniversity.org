**Deal signed with global manufacturer of energy efficient motors**

Dr Richard Strahan from Canterbury’s Electrical Power Engineering Centre (EPECentre) has, with assistance from the University of Canterbury’s Research & Innovation team, successfully completed a licensing agreement with New Zealand-based Wellington Drive Technologies (WDT).

The deal allows WDT to access Dr Strahan’s technology to support its research and development of advanced energy-saving, electronically commutated motors. These motors use electronics instead of mechanical brushes to produce rotation, and are more compact and efficient than the traditional motors they replace. They are frequently used in computer hard drives, CD/DVD players, cordless power tools, refrigeration systems and electric vehicles.

Dr Strahan’s technology supports greater reliability, energy efficiency and cost performance, lower noise levels and reduced product complexity.

WDT is a leading global provider of commercial refrigeration control solutions. It is headquartered in Auckland and is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange.

The WDT deal is the latest success for Dr Strahan, whose pioneering work on brushless motor technology has already seen him working with a large European manufacturer. He is also a consultant to electrical machine manufacturers, helping with the design and development of motors for a variety of applications. He was awarded the IET 2006 Premium Award for Proceedings – Electric Power Applications for best annual paper in this leading journal.

Dr Strahan studied for the Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University of Canterbury (UC) from 1989 to 1992 before completing his doctoral degree at the same University.

Based in the EPECentre at UC, Dr Strahan says support from UC’s Research & Innovation team was excellent, with very useful advice provided in a timely manner.

“UC and the Electric Power Engineering Centre have enabled an environment over time where I have been able to create, research and develop this brushless motor,” says Dr Strahan.

UC’s Research & Innovation Commercial Director, Bill Lee, says UC’s role is to support all stages of research and innovation development conducted at the University of Canterbury.

“We provide support and assistance to UC’s academic staff and researchers – from sourcing initial research funding through to commercialisation of the outcomes.

“Dr Strahan’s deal with WDT is a great example of how we can help UC researchers commercialise their intellectual property (IP), as well as bring benefits to NZ technology companies,” says Lee.

The approach is part of a developing culture of innovation and entrepreneurship at UC, which is shifting from a sole focus on getting research published to managing IP to maximise the financial return. The change is helping build the University’s reputation for doing useful things – useful for businesses, communities and environments.

UC’s innovation role also includes helping to build scale in the region as a founding shareholder in the Canterbury Innovation Incubator and Powerhouse Ventures Ltd and a member of the stakeholder advisory group of CDC Innovations.

Dr Strahan is now undertaking a separate project for another client to design and develop a brushless motor capable of operating in an extremely high temperature environment.
