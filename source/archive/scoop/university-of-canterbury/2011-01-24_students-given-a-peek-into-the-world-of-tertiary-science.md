Students given a peek into the world of tertiary science

**High school students given a peek into the world of tertiary science**

Three high school students from Canterbury and Nelson have had the door to a world of scientific opportunity opened to them during a summer internship at the University of Canterbury.

Sarah Quinney (Garin College, Nelson), Sheetal Chand (Hillmorton High School) and Georgina Kioa (Christchurch Girls High School) were among eight secondary school students nationwide awarded 2010/2011 MacDiarmid Discovery Awards.

The awards, funded by the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, target top science students of Maori and Pacific heritage in Year 12 and 13 and aim to nurture an interest in science, expose pupils to possible career options and encourage them to undertake tertiary studies in the sciences. The awards are worth $1000 each, plus flights and accommodation.

Sarah, Georgina and Sheetal spent two weeks (10-21 January) at the University of Canterbury working alongside academic staff and postgraduate students in the chemistry, physics and electrical and computer engineering departments. The other five recipients were based at Victoria University of Wellington and Auckland University.

The South Island awardees programme began in December when they spent two days at Victoria University of Wellington undertaking an initiation programme. They also took part in the university’s celebration of 100 years of physics and visited the Gifford Observatory for some star gazing.

While at Canterbury the three students spent a week working with UC chemistry PhD student Jan-Yves Ruzicka on an aspect of his research into the potential use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles to break down dyes and organic waste using UV light. Working in the University’s Preparative Wet Chemistry Laboratory, the three students synthesised titanium dioxide then tested its ability to act as a catalyst in the degradation of dyes in a range of conditions.

They then spent the second week working with researchers in the University’s physics and electrical and computer engineering departments. They looked at and measured titanium dioxide particles using the University’s atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscope. They also made solar cells, a device that converts the energy of sunlight directly into electricity, with UC research engineer Gary Turner; carried out some laser interference lithography with UC electrical engineering postdoctoral fellow Dr Trey Holzwarth; and checked out the scanning tunneling microscope in the University’s physics department with PhD student Ojas Mahapatra.

Georgina, who will start Year 13 this year, said being part of the programme had been “exciting and interesting” and had given her an opportunity to learn new skills.

“It’s been a really great experience and has given me a taste of what it’s going to be like studying at university.”

Sarah, who will begin study at Massey University this year, said she had enjoyed being involved in real research.

“What we’ve been working on is science that is happening now and science that is relevant. It’s been such a great experience and I’d recommend the programme to any students interested in science as a career.”

Sheetal, who will go into Year 13 this year, said while the programme had been an eye-opening experience for her, it had made it harder for her to choose a future career.

“It’s opened a whole range of new paths for me that are all so different and exciting.”

University of Canterbury Senior Lecturer and Principal Investigator with the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology, Dr Vladimir Golovko (Chemistry), said the Discovery Awards programme gave high school students a chance to develop important scientific skills.

“The three students on the programme at Canterbury have been getting very good results from their experiments so there may be a paper published on this work.”

Professor Richard Blaikie, Director of the MacDiarmid Institute, said the Discovery Awards were a way for the institute “to connect to the next generation of New Zealand's scientists and engineers”.

\"The students are all very bright and highly motivated to learn and it is a pleasure to see their eyes being opened to the excitement and opportunities that await them in their future careers. They will also go back to their schools and communities and share their experiences, giving insights into our work to a wider group of people."
