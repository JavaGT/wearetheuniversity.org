**UC research people's positive outlook three years on**

August 1, 2013

A University of Canterbury (UC) postgraduate student is researching people's mental health condition and resilience three years after the first Canterbury earthquake.

Martina Zivic is investigating people’s coping mechanisms in spite of adversity.

"The potential is there as big events bring destruction, fear and long term stress which can lead to post traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, acute stress and insomnia.

"Earlier UC research investigated the mental health effects of the September 2010 earthquake in Christchurch suburbs Hornby and Avonside. Work after the 2011 earthquakes expanded the study to include South New Brighton, Papanui, Avonside, Hornby, Cashmere and Mt Pleasant.

"The research, headed by Associate Professor Martin Dorahy, found some differences between the suburbs in the level of acute stress disorder. The high levels in suburbs like Hornby and Avonside produced the same trauma found after motor vehicle accidents.

"Not everyone exposed to trauma following natural disasters will develop negative mental health outcomes. A number of personal factors contribute to human resilience in the face of trauma.

"I am seeking to find out how people have been coping three years on in Christchurch. We now believe it to be useful to assess the prevalence of symptoms three years on. We don’t expect to find high levels of acute stress from 2010 and 2011 but there may be other mental health effects.

"We do predict that people are mostly settled and will not be experiencing issues but research should endorse our suspicions. We believe people are doing well, so it will be good to highlight that in my report.

"It will be exciting to find out how people stayed strong and rebuilt their lives following adversity. This demonstrates a significant sense of community and individual resiliency," Zivic says.
