UC one of top universities to travel abroad to

The University of Canterbury (UC) has been named as one of the top universities worth travelling abroad for by website FlipKey.com.

UC tourism researcher Dr Girish Prayag says it not surprising that UC features highly on the “must” visit campuses around the world.

“Besides academic interest, the UC campus provides a physical and social space that stimulates students’ curiosity, creativity and conviviality.

“The use of physical space and landscaping on campus are certainly points of differentiation compared to other campuses in New Zealand.

“At UC the wide open spaces encourage social interactions among students through events or just ‘hanging’ out with friends. The campus is also a tourist attraction for Christchurch. It engages all the five senses as one would expect of tourist experiences. Given the assets of this campus, the UC ‘site’ must be communicated to a wider target market audience to capitalise on the link that exists between education and tourism,” he says.

FlipKey notes that studying abroad is extremely popular and fulfilling, and being able to receive education from a top university can provide academic and personal growth for students.

“International students are not only drawn to the possibility of studying in New Zealand but also the opportunities to travel and experience the place.”

FlipKey also notes that outside of academic interests, the top universities worth travelling to also feature jaw-dropping architecture, flawless grounds and must-see attractions.

“The UC campus is a landmark for Christchurch that must be signposted for both the international student market and visitors.
