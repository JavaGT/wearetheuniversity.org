New College of Arts showcases its wares  
17 March 2003

Dignitaries from the city and the business, cultural and education sectors will join with university staff on Friday to celebrate the formal opening of the new College of Arts.

The Arts College, one of four Colleges in a new structure adopted by the University this year, is the first to welcome the wider community to its new home.

College Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Kenneth Strongman said the occasion provided a chance for the community to meet key staff and see the new offices.

“It’s also an opportunity for us to showcase some of the very diverse things we do in the Arts and Social Sciences. There’ll be a kapa haka performance from our Maori Department, a jazz ensemble from the School of Music, art works on show from staff and students in the School of Fine Arts and a display of all the courses and programmes offered in the College,” he said.

The opening starts at 2pm on Friday in the Arts quadrangle with a powhiri conducted by the University Chaplain, Reverend Turi Hollis, and short speeches by the Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp and College’s PVC, Professor Kenneth Strongman.
