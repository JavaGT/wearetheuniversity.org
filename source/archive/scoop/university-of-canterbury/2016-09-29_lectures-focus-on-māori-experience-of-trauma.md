**Lectures focus on Māori experience of trauma**

The Ngai Tahu Research Centre at the University of Canterbury is hosting a lecture series_, He Kokonga Whare - Māori and the Transmission of Historical Trauma,_ on the high rates of trauma that generations of Māori have experienced.

Māori people experience high rates of trauma, which can be passed from one generation to another, and is correlated with a range of health and social problems, from heart disease to imprisonment.

The Roadshow Lectures explore the findings of the He Kokonga Whare Research Programme – a five-year endeavour investigating the way that Māori people experience and seek healing from the impacts of colonialism.

Each lecture explores a different topic related to the themes of trauma and healing, including: Māori traditional approaches to trauma; alienation from land; imprisonment; and sexual violence.
