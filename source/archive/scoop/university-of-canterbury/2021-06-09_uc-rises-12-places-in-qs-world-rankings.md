The University of Canterbury (UC) has improved its global rank among the world’s universities, rising 12 places in the latest QS World University Rankings released today.

UC is one of the few universities of New Zealand’s eight QS-ranked institutions to rise in the 2022 global list - climbing from 270 in the 2021 rankings to 258.

Tumu Tuarua Rangahau | Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research, Professor Ian Wright, says it is pleasing to see the University moving in the right direction.

“This result is due to a concerted effort across the entire University in the last couple of years, and it is gratifying to see this effort has the University moving in a positive direction.”

“I would especially like to acknowledge the hard work of our world-class academics and researchers who deliver quality education and create research that is responding to a changing world,” Professor Wright says.
