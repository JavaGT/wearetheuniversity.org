Surging interest in University of Canterbury Open Day
=====================================================

**Tuesday, 19 June 2018, 2:09 pm**  
**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

  
The University of Canterbury continues to see a surge of interest in its upcoming Open Day with record numbers of people registering to find out more about the learning opportunities across the five Colleges.

With registrations to attend the UC Open Day on Thursday 12 July in their thousands to date, they are already exceeding the last Open Day registration figures by 24% compared to the same time last year. The 2017 Open Day figures were in turn an increase on 2016 registrations by 93% compared to the same time.

This year, more than 2200 prospective students and whanau are already registered as coming from around the country and overseas to explore the degree options and the campus lifestyle at UC, with registrations to attend still open.

UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr was pleased to see the continued resurgence of interest in coming to study at UC among young people and their whanau/families.

“This is one day that could change your life and a decision that can bring lifelong benefits. UC offers a community of learning where students can live on or near campus in a supportive learning environment that aids success. It’s a combination of our state-of-the-art green campus, high-tech online learning and a real-life meeting of the minds that gives a real boost to learning.”

Dr Carr noted that Christchurch school leavers were tending to stay in Christchurch to study but UC was also attracting record numbers of out-of-towners especially from Auckland and Wellington.

“We’ve seen an uplift in interest from Auckland due to the attractive short or non-existent commute and favourable student lifestyle, which includes an affordable rental market, plus city, surf and mountains all within easy reach. Wellington school-leavers are also finding Canterbury a better option for providing a more attractive and affordable independent student lifestyle.”

UC was one of the few New Zealand tertiary institutions to see a substantial increase in enrolments in 2018, with a 13% increase in new-to-UC students to date compared to 2017, and all five of UC’s Colleges welcoming more students this year.
