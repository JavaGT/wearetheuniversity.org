UC academics bring Food for Thought to Riverside Market
=======================================================

**Friday, 6 December 2019, 12:46 pm**  
**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

Every weekday next week, learning lunches will be on the menu at Riverside Market as five University of Canterbury (UC) academics share their thoughts in bite-sized public talks.

‘Food for Thought’ is a five-day series of 15-minute talks in the city, bringing the university’s thought leaders to the public, so people can feed their minds while filling their tummies.

Each day at midday Monday to Friday, an expert speaker from one of UC’s five Colleges will cover current thinking on an interesting topic in a short speech, by the Avon/Ōtākaro River, outside the Riverside Market on Oxford Terrace (inside Riverside Market if weather is wet).

The series of engaging and thought-provoking mini-lectures will cover diverse topics, ranging from using brainwaves as lie-detectors, to exploring food as medicine, to life in space, with a different speaker each lunchtime.

**UC Food for Thought programme:**

• **Monday 9 December - Speaker:** Associate Professor Peter Field, UC Arts, on ‘Higher education in the age of the smartphone’.

• **Tuesday 10 December - Speaker:** Professor Julia Rucklidge, UC Science, on **‘**Food as medicine: ‘How good food supports mental wellbeing’.
