University of Canterbury Closed Due to Aftershocks
==================================================

**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

**University of Canterbury Closed Due to Aftershocks**

Following a series of aftershocks that struck Canterbury this afternoon, the University of Canterbury as a precaution closed its campus and evacuated both Ilam and Dovedale sites. There were no injuries on campus or in the Halls.

The University campus will stay closed for the remainder of Monday 13 June and all day Tuesday 14 June. The Halls of Residence are operating as usual after inspection.

The University is undertaking building assessments to determine whether any additional building damage has been sustained and to ensure that health and safety requirements are met prior to allowing staff and students back on campus. A decision on the timing of campus re-opening will be made as soon as possible depending on the results of building assessments.

The University understands that students will have questions about the scheduling of tests this week and the exams to follow. UC is currently assessing the best way of proceeding and will advise students prior to re-opening campus.
