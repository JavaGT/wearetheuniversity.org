UC Re-opening Midday Thursday
=============================

**Wednesday, 6 June 2012, 4:33 pm**  
**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

UC Re-opening Midday Thursday

  
Following today's closure due to snow, and the prospect of sub-zero air temperatures overnight, it has been decided that the University of Canterbury will not re-open until midday tomorrow (Thursday).

Driving conditions tomorrow morning are likely to be hazardous. There is also the prospect of schools remaining closed and staff and students with children needing time to address childcare arrangements.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the University's Facilities Management staff have been clearing roads and car parks but, with some trees on campus damaged by snow, there are areas that have not been safe for them to work in.

He says staff and students are being asked not to come on to the campus prior to midday tomorrow. Any congestion will make it difficult for the facilities team to address these safety issues. Even after the University has re-opened, care will be needed when moving around campus.

Should it be determined during the course of tomorrow morning that a further delay in re-opening is required, announcements will be made via all-staff and all-student emails, and the UC website.
