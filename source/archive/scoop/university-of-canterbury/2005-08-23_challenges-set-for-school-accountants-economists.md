Challenges set to test secondary school accountants and economists

The University of Canterbury's College of Business and Economics has launched two new quizzes this month aimed at Year 13 accounting and economics students.

The Canterbury Accounting Challenge and the Canterbury Economics Challenge are designed to not only be a challenge for the students, with a prize pool of $8000 to encourage them to excel, but also to be used as an exam preparation resource for teachers.

This year's Canterbury Accounting and Economics challenges will take place in October and the invitation to take part has been sent to all secondary schools in the Christchurch region. The challenges will provide students with the opportunity to test their familiarity with key concepts before their final NCEA exams.

The test was written in conjunction with secondary teachers and College staff who are familiar with the curriculum. The format will be multi-choice, with questions increasing in difficulty as students progress through the questions. The questions towards the end of the test are at scholarship level, designed to challenge the exceptional students.

Professor Nigel Healey, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Business and Economics), said the new challenges were part of a series of new initiatives the College was introducing this year, including the recent commerce conference piloted with neighbouring high schools and a scholarship preparation programme.

“The College is committed, as part of its wider strategy of active engagement with the community, to supporting Christchurch secondary schools and promoting the vitality of commerce as a subject area at Years 11-13. With these initiatives and future ones, we hope that our College can become an increasingly valuable resource for all secondary schools in the Christchurch region.”
