University of Canterbury Sponsorship for Rutherford’s Den

A world-class multi-media visitor experience celebrating the life and work of one of New Zealand’s greatest scientists Ernest Lord Rutherford is to benefit from a significant sponsorship partnership with the University of Canterbury.

Rutherford is one of the University’s most illustrious graduates.  His original student laboratory at Canterbury College – now the Arts Centre – is the Den’s central exhibition space.

“We are absolutely delighted to welcome the University as naming rights sponsor for Rutherford’s Den, particularly in this the centenary year of Rutherford receiving the Nobel prize,” says Jenny May, Chair of Rutherford’s Den Trust Board. 

“The University’s three-year sponsorship will make a major contribution to ensuring the Den continues to educate and tell the story of Rutherford’s days at Canterbury College and how he went on to become one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century.”

One of the key objectives of the Den is to inspire the Rutherfords of the future through its school education programme. 

Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp says the University is proud of its connections with Rutherford.

“The pioneering spirit that enabled him to achieve what he did is certainly still alive and well in the Canterbury University of today. UC is in the top-tier of New Zealand universities and certainly well respected for its world class research and teaching.

“I know how inspirational Rutherford’s story is for aspiring scientists, and I am delighted that the University’s relationship with the Den has been formalised in this manner,” he says.

Professor Sharp and Ms May will celebrate the sponsorship partnership at 3pm today (Friday) at Rutherford’s Den in the Arts Centre’s Clock Tower building, on Worcester Boulevard.
