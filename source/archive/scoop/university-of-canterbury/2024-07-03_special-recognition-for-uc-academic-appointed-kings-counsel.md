“His contributions have not only shaped legal thought but have also guided the practice of law in New Zealand and beyond. We are incredibly proud to have such a distinguished individual among our faculty.”

Eighteen barristers sole (a barrister who practices independently, without being part of a law firm) received the title in the 2024 round with Professor Joseph’s appointment receiving special recognition for his distinguished career and significant contributions to public and constitutional law.
