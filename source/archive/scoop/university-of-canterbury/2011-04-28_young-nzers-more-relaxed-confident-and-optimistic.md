Global survey finds young NZers more relaxed, confident and optimistic

A global survey involving University of Canterbury political scientist Dr Bronwyn Hayward has found that young adult New Zealanders are more relaxed, confident and optimistic than their counterparts in other countries.

The United Nations Environment Programme World Survey of Young Adults Attitudes to Sustainable Lifestyles looked at issues of concern to 8000 young urban adults interviewed online and face-to-face in 20 countries. It is one of the world's largest qualitative surveys of young adults' lives, hopes, fears and lifestyle.

Dr Hayward, who was a lead author of the report, says the survey included 132 young New Zealand adults aged between 18 and 35.

"The New Zealand respondents stood out because they were comparatively relaxed, confident and optimistic about their future despite comparatively modest incomes and high national youth suicide rates.

"Unlike many young adults around the world, the New Zealanders did not express frustration at limits to their future opportunities. Their ambitions were modest with most wanting to live comfortably. But they were confident their ambitions could be achieved and expressed a strong sense of wellbeing around their outdoor lifestyles," says Dr Hayward.

National MP Nicky Wagner - who represented the Minister of Social Development and Employment and Youth Affairs, Hon Paula Bennett, and the Environment Minister Hon Dr Nick Smith at a launch of the findings - says it is pleasing that young people see the New Zealand way of life in such a positive way.

"Young New Zealanders clearly appreciate and value active green space and a more sustainable quality of life. This focus on outdoor lifestyle and activity corresponds very well with Christchurch's Garden City image. The research findings impact on the rebuilding of Christchurch. As a snapshot, they show there is more to consider than just the buildings. We need to acknowledge the wellbeing and lifestyle choices of our residents in the visions for our city."

The greatest fear of more than a third of respondents was having to live in inner city apartments and unable to enjoy an outdoor lifestyle.

"Being unable to make changes on issues that mattered to them was the second biggest fear of young New Zealanders interviewed for the survey. The fact that so many people in this sample fear being placed in a situation where they want to make changes but can't- means actually giving citizens a voice in decision making is not a luxury, it's fundamental to our wellbeing as a flourishing community where New Zealanders want to live.

"What is striking in comparison to the 19 other countries' survey results, especially Britain, is the modest ambition and relaxed confidence. It is built on a series of assumptions in particular that access to outdoor living, friends and access to education will continue and that people can make a difference to their lives about things that matter to them.

"This is important because it reminds us that these taken-for-granted conditions of the kiwi good life, can be undermined accidentally by seemingly unrelated national policy or city planning actions. Right now we are the envy of many governments because our community has this high life-satisfaction despite quite low incomes. But decisions that make our easy access to the outdoors more difficult or education policy changes that, for example, reduce funding for student places can have profound effects on wellbeing long-term."

Dr Hayward says the findings reveal important issues for politicians and communities, especially Christchurch where over half the New Zealand sample was drawn from.

"The study results highlight the importance of investing in education, health and public space - all of which emerged as important to citizen wellbeing."
