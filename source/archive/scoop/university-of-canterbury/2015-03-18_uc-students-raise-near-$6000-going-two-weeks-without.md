**UC students raise near $6000 going Two Weeks Without**

18 March 2015

University of Canterbury students have gone Two Weeks Without walking, seeing their reflections, cutlery, beds, hot water, meat, sleep-ins, makeup, moaning, double layers and sugar – raising a grand total of $5733 for Christchurch charities.

Two Weeks Without is a new social enterprise established by University of Canterbury students Bridget Williams and Rachael Gresson that helps individuals and businesses go Two Weeks Without something of their choice to raise money for a charity.

Williams and Gresson selected 110 students from the university’s Emerging Leaders Development Programme to test the business model of Two Weeks Without. The students formed 11 teams and decided what they would go without and which charity they would raise money for.

The charities that benefitted were White Elephant Trust which supports youth development, Husky Rescue which takes care of abandoned Huskies and Help for the Homeless which provides necessities for the homeless. The charities received $1240, $1559 and $2932 respectively.

Founder of Help for the Homeless Amy Burke says she was absolutely blown away with the amount raised for her charity.

“I was just expecting a few hundred dollars. It’s fantastic and very surprising”.

Prizes were awarded to the student teams with the most creative challenge – no reflections, the most difficult challenge – no hot water and the most donations raised – $1370 for Help for the Homeless.

Williams and Gresson say the event was a huge success, surpassing all expectations.
