The University of Canterbury’s Professor Juliet Gerrard has been made a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

UC Deputy Vice-Chancellor Ian Town said the University was delighted to congratulate Professor Gerrard on the recognition by her peers.

\`\`By any measure she is an outstanding scientist and leader in her field. Her recent work in establishing a joint research team with colleagues from Industrial Research Limited exemplifies the University’s commitment to collaborate with Crown Research Institutes,’’ Professor Town said today.

Professor Gerrard said she was thrilled to be honoured by the society. The Royal Society of NZ has 382 Fellows and 58 Honorary Fellows. Fellows are involved in providing expert advice, promoting best and innovative research practice and disseminating information on the sciences and humanities.
