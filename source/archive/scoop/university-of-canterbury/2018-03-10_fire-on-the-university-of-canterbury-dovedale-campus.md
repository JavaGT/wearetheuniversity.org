Fire on the University of Canterbury Dovedale campus
====================================================

**Saturday, 10 March 2018, 11:14 am**  
**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

This morning's fire on the University of Canterbury Dovedale campus

  
In the interests of accurate reporting of the fire on the University of Canterbury's Dovedale campus this morning, the University advises the following:

The buildings affected are not University buildings. They belong to the Unlimited Discovery School, which lost its buildings in the Canterbury Earthquake and has been operating at the site as a temporary location.

The University's Dovedale campus is home to the University's College of Education, Health and Human Development. It is incorrect to report it as the Christchurch College of Education, which became the University's College of Education in 2007.
