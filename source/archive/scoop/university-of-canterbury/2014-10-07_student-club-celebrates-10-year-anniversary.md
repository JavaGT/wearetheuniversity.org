**Student club celebrates 10 year anniversary**

A University of Canterbury (UC) student-run not-for-profit organisation will celebrate its tenth anniversary on Wednesday 8 October at its annual awards ceremony.

Entré is a student club which runs events that see young hopefuls put their business ideas to the test with the help of mentors and business connections.

Entré CEO Stew Whitehead says that the company has never been stronger and is going from strength to strength.

“This year we have had more than 1000 members sign-up and we have improved all our operations, including offering more frequent workshops and presentations,” he says.

“We are all passionate and enthusiastic students, who have a real interest in innovation and entrepreneurship, and where better to do that then here in Christchurch where the innovation hub is thriving?”

Stew says the most exciting part of entré is meeting and working with like-minded people who have a real passion for innovation.

“There is no other opportunity available to students like entré. If you are keen then absolutely go for it. We work with some of the most experienced business mentors in Christchurch and have some amazing prizes to help kick start and launch student innovations and start-ups.”

As well as celebrating the tenth anniversary, the annual awards ceremony will celebrate the success of all students who have entered the entré competitions throughout the year. This includes announcing the grand winner of the $85k Challenge.

The $85k Challenge is the biggest and most prestigious challenge that entré has to offer. Open to all UC and CPIT students, it offers entrants the chance to develop key business and presentation skills while refining their idea into a viable business over the course of the year.

The competition was first held in 2005 and, since then, thousands of students have been involved in workshops and competitions.
