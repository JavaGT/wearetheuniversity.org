Chemistry student wins the University of Canterbury’s three minute thesis event

August 20, 2014

Chemistry student Anna Farquhar who has researched the energy storage potential of thin sheeted carbon graphene, last night won the University of Canterbury’s fifth annual thesis in three presentation event.

Fifteen student finalists were each given three minutes to present their research topics.

Computer science and software engineering student Jin Hong was second for presenting his research on cybersecurity, while communication disorders student Sarah Davies was third for her talk on reducing chest infections in acute stroke patients.

Organiser of the event Professor Lucy Johnston says all the presentations were outstanding which made a difficult job for judges Sarah Platt (University of Canterbury Students’ Association president), Paul Fleming (Pro-Vice-Chancellor Science) and Oluwaoyin Kolawole (a visiting Canterbury Fellow with Maori and Indigenous Studies).
