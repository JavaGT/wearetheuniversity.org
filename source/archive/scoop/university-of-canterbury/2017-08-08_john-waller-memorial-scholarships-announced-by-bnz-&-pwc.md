**John Waller Memorial Scholarships announced by BNZ and PwC**

BNZ and PwC New Zealand are pleased to announce a new scholarship programme established at the University of Canterbury to honour former BNZ Board Chairman and respected PwC Managing Partner John Waller, ONZM, FCA.

For five years from 2018, BNZ and PwC will fund three competitive scholarships per year to school leavers choosing to study Commerce, Science or Law at the University of Canterbury.

The John Waller Memorial Scholarships provide $18,000 to each student, as well as summer internships at BNZ and PwC, and mentoring from BNZ and PwC staff.

“We are really pleased to honour John’s values and professional legacy through a scholarship programme which recognises the significant contribution John made to New Zealand business,” BNZ Chief Executive Anthony Healy says.

“John’s outstanding career was characterised by the exercise of a brilliant mind, achievement and influence and he was passionate about helping young people to succeed,” he says.

“John recalled his studies for a Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Canterbury as a stepping stone for his success and this scholarship programme is an appropriate memorial,” Mr Healy says.

PwC CEO Mark Averill says: “John always had time to help people – he always wanted to give something back. I can't think of a better way to honour his memory and legacy than through this scholarship programme.

“John was a highly recognised and well respected leader – both amongst his peers and across the business community.

“He was a hard worker who led from the front and combined an excellent commercial acumen with a pragmatic approach. John's positive outlook, his courage to tackle challenges head on and make the tough calls was truly inspirational.

“These are just some of the values and attributes we hope to encourage with these scholarships,” says Mr Averill.

University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr has expressed his gratitude for the generosity of those behind the new scholarship programme.

“We are delighted that the John Waller Memorial Scholarships will make it possible for so many outstanding Canterbury students to pursue their degrees in Commerce, Science or Law, while also getting a headstart with BNZ and PwC internships and mentoring,” Dr Carr says.

“It is our goal that UC students are prepared to make a difference in the world, with real-life experience, internships and placements built in to the majority of our bachelor degree programmes. Of those who completed their bachelor’s degrees in 2016, 64% engaged in employment, internship, practical work-related experience, or entrepreneurship as part of their studies at UC.

“As well as standing as a wonderful tribute to John Waller’s values, this far-sighted scholarship programme will add to this ethos, while passing on his legacy to future leaders,” he says.
