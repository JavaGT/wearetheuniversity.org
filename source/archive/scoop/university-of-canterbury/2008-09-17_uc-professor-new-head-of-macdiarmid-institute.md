UC professor new head of MacDiarmid Institute

Professor Richard Blaikie, of the University of Canterbury's Electrical and Computer Engineering department, has been appointed Director of the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology.

The MacDiarmid Institute is a collaborative venture incorporating four universities and two crown research institutes (CRIs), and involves more than 80 researchers and students.

Hosted by Victoria University, the Institute's major partner organisations are Canterbury University and Industrial Research. The MacDiarmid Institute is named after 2000 Nobel Chemistry Prize-winner, New Zealander Alan MacDiarmid. It is New Zealand's premier research organisation concerned with high quality research and research education in materials science and nanotechnology.

UC's Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Town says the University is delighted at Professor Blaikie's appointment.

\"Through his own research work Richard has very much brought the possibilities of nanotechnology to life. I am looking forward to seeing the Institute grow and develop through the scientific leadership he will bring to the role."

Victoria University’s Vice-Chancellor Professor Pat Walsh says: “Professor Blaikie’s knowledge and experience will ensure the MacDiarmid Institute continues to be New Zealand’s premier research organisation in the areas of material science and nanotechnology.”

As Director, Professor Blaikie will be jointly employed by UC and Victoria. He was previously the Institute's Deputy Director, a position which will now be taken by Dr Shaun Hendy from Industrial Research Limited and Victoria University of Wellington.

Professor Blaikie replaces Professor Paul Callaghan, who stepped down in July to allow new leadership to be developed within the Institute. Professor Callaghan, who has become well known through his contributions to Kim Hill's programme on Radio New Zealand National, will remain an active member of the Institute.
