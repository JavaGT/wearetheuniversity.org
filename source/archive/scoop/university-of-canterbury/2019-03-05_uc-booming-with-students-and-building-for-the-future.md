UC booming with students and building for the future
====================================================

**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

Newly released enrolment figures for 2019 show student numbers continue to be on the rise at the University of Canterbury | Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha, with plans to build on this success with the largest residential building project in the University’s history.

“We begin 2019 with vibrant student numbers, exciting new facilities for learning, internationally leading research and a healthy balance sheet as well,” UC Vice-Chancellor Professor Cheryl de la Rey says.

Enrolment numbers have been increasing steadily year-on-year since 2017 across domestic, international and postgraduate students. Enrolment numbers are up across all of UC's five colleges: Arts; Business and Law; Education, Health and Human Development; Engineering; and Science.

Increases in student numbers to UC parallels growth and development in a number of areas including funding, talent attraction to the University and city, and the opportunity to develop new programme offerings, she says.

“UC is on a trajectory to success across all the areas of achievement expected from a world-class institution.”

**Enrolment numbers**

• UC student enrolments are 7% ahead of the same time last year.  
• UC student headcount is sitting at 16,382 (as at 4 March 2019) and this number is expected to grow as the year progresses with more enrolling through 2019 (for Semester 2, Summer School, postgraduate courses, etc.).  
• Domestic students are up 6% compared to the same time last year  
• Full-Fee (international) students are up 11% compared to the same time last year  
• Māori students are up 9% compared to the same time last year  
• Pasifika students are up 5% compared to the same time last year

**Ground broken for building new 500-bed residential hall**

“New residential accommodation will create an opportunity for more of our future students to experience student life living away from home,” Professor De la Rey says.

“This is the largest new accommodation build to date for the University of Canterbury. Located on Homestead Lane, it’s designed to be home to 508 students and is just a short walk from the main campus.”

The new accommodation will include:  
• communal study and social spaces,  
• games and music rooms,  
• shared bathroom and en suite room options,  
• catered and self-catered dining options.

The new residential hall is due to be ready to house students from 2021.

In the last two years the University of Canterbury opened two new accommodation options to students – Kirkwood Avenue Hall and Hayashi. UC currently offers on-campus accommodation to more than 2000 students.
