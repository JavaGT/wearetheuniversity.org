Dr Rua Murray, a University of Canterbury (UC) senior mathematics and statistics lecturer, has been recognised as one of New Zealand’s top tertiary teachers.

Dr Murray has received one of 10 Ako Aotearoa national tertiary teaching excellence awards.

Dr Murray researches in pure and applied mathematics, with a focus on the behaviour of complex systems. Recent research with UC collaborators includes the way that invasive species may be affected by climate change, and possibilities for reduced energy use in transport. He has taught thousands of students from foundation to graduate level over the last 15 years. 

Acting Vice-Chancellor Professor Ian Town said Dr Murray was \`\`widely acknowledged at UC for his tremendous enthusiasm for his subject and his outstanding support of student success”.

The award includes $20,000 in prize money to be used for career development and to promote best practice in teaching.
