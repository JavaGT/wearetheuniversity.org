Theft of Chemicals from University of Canterbury

  
UC has reported a theft from its Chemistry department to the Police. A quantity of chemicals have been taken, including some able to be used to manufacture illegal drugs.  

UC takes security seriously, and regrets this incident has occurred. It is assisting the Police with their enquiries.

UC has taken immediate action to move certain chemicals and compounds to a more secure central store and has checked other departments on campus. It has also taken a range of additional security measures which it is unable to disclose. Those security measures are in place across the campus. It has advised staff to be aware of security issues, and their personal safety.

Any members of the public who find what may be chemicals or chemical containers should not touch them and call the Police, as should anyone with any information about the incident.
