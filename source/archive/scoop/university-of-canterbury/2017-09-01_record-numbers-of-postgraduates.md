**GradFest**

GradFest is an annual, week-long event of lectures and workshops forpostgraduate thesis writers. At GradFest, held from **30 October to 3 November** this year, students can learn about the latest research trends, develop new skills to enhance their study, and have the opportunity to network with other postgraduate students.

GradFest brings together different departments at UC such as the Postgraduate Office, Academic Skills Office, Library, E-Learning, Careers and Academic Services Group to share their expertise with postgraduate students on subjects such as _Understanding the thesis journey, Applying for ethical approval, Smart tools and technologies for research, The publication process, Thesis structure and planning,_ and _Writing a coherent thesis._ (Due to its popularity GradFest was also held in May this year.)

**UC PGSA – Just Write workshop**

In early September, the UC PGSA (Postgraduate Students’ Association) hosted the _Just Write_ workshop; a chance for postgraduate students to get together and ‘just write’. The free annual event focuses on removing the barriers that prevent students from writing and provides inspiration to help polish chapters and papers for submission. It’s a great opportunity to network with other postgraduate students, collaborate and try out new ideas. The event also includes seminars throughout the day to help students produce quality research outputs.

**Thesis-in-three competition**

The Thesis-in-three competition challenges postgraduate students to explain their research in three minutes, accompanied by one slide. The competition aims to teach effective communication techniques between academics and those outside their field of study. It also promotes collaboration and increases funding and employment opportunities. Sponsored by the Dean of Postgraduate Research each year, Thesis-in-three students first compete in College competitions, vying for a place in the UC-wide final. The UC final is held in August and competitors get the opportunity to compete at the international Three Minute Thesis (3MT) event in September.

The winners of 2017’s Thesis in Three UC final are:

• 1st: Philipp Sueltrop from UC Engineering ($5000 prize)

• 2nd: Jacq Jones from UC Arts ($2000 prize)

• 3rd: Jess McHale from UC Science ($1000 prize)

Philipp, who is from Germany and studying for his PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, will represent UC at the 2017 Asia-Pacific 3MT Finals, held at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, on Friday 29 September 2017. He will compete against representatives from 55 universities across New Zealand, Australia and Southeast Asia.
