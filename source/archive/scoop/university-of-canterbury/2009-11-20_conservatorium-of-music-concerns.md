University and Arts Centre to consider Conservatorium concerns

The University of Canterbury and the Arts Centre of Christchurch today sought to have a resource consent hearing for the proposed National Conservatorium of Music re-scheduled to allow more time for submitters to prepare and for design elements of the building to be consideredfurther.

The hearing had been scheduled to begin on 7 December. The Christchurch City Council has agreed to the request to re-schedule the hearing in February.

UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the University and the Arts Centre requested to have the hearing re-scheduled after becoming aware that some submitters were concerned they did not have enough time to prepare for the hearing.

“We also saw an opportunity for us to re-consider some of the design elements of the building.”

Dr Carr says the University wishes to provide the wider community with more time to understand the conservatorium proposaland wants to ensure that the resource consent process is fair and reasonable.

“We think it is only fair that we take the time to sit back, consider legitimate concerns and think about how we might be able to address them.We also believe that it is reasonable that all submitters are given the time they need to prepare adequately.

“The conservatorium proposal is an example of our desire for greater engagementto better connect with the city. However, pressing on with a resource consent hearing without thinking about how we might reconsider some of the design elements would be counter-productive in terms of our relationship with the Christchurch community.

“It is clear to us that further discussion might assist both understanding of design elements and possible changes before the matter is considered bytheresource consent commissioners.”

Dr Carr says the University is very appreciative of last week’s decision by the Christchurch City Council to back the Conservatorium proposal. It is also appreciative that the request to have the resource consent hearing re-scheduled has been approved.
