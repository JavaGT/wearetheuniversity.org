UC programme aims to help young Maori leaders  

Newly-launched UC programme aims to help young Maori leaders from Aranui High School succeed at university

The University of Canterbury has launched an after school homework support and Maori leadership programme for students of Aranui High School thanks to funding from the American New Zealand Association (ANZA).

Te Ru Tauira is a two hour after-school programme that is sponsored by ANZA as part of the American New Zealand Association University of Canterbury Outreach Project.

Following the February earthquake ANZA undertook a substantial fundraising drive to support the recovery effort. ANZA expressed interest in working with UC on short and longer term educational programmes that would help attract potential university students to Christchurch. The association agreed to provide funding to support outreach and liaison activities that prepare and encourage students from low-decile schools, Maori and Pacific students to study at the University of Canterbury.

Project leader Hemi Inia said Te Ru Tauira would provide 40 students with homework support to enhance achievement in their school work and provide practical pathways into tertiary education.

The programme will run every Tuesday in school terms three and four at the University. Students will spend the first hour on homework study with help on hand from UC tutors. The second hour will be spent touring the University’s facilities and attending guest lectures.

Speaking at the official launch of the programme, University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr told the Aranui students it was alright to feel scared about the challenges of university study reminding them that “you learn the most when you are challenged”.

He said Te Ru Tauira was about giving them choices.

“This programme will help you make a choice. We need you to feel that this is a place for you. You need to be able to imagine yourselves attending University and succeeding.”

Aranui High School Principal John Rohs thanked the University for choosing the school to pilot the programme.

“This programme is going to open their eyes to opportunities that they have only dreamt about. It will give them choices to help establish and affirm their identity as young Maori leaders and the pathway they have in front of them.”

Year 13 student Cheana Horua-Heather said she was looking forward to the tutorials and getting a helping hand with her studies, particularly in English and History. Cheana said she would like to come on to UC next year but at this stage did not know what she would study.
