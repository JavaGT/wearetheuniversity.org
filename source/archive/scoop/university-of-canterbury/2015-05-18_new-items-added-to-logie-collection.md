New items added to the University of Canterbury’s Logie Collection

May 18, 2015

Two new antiquities have been added to the University of Canterbury’s James Logie Memorial Collection.

The collection of more than 370 ancient artefacts serves as a teaching and research collection for students, academics and interested members of the public.

The new objects include a terracotta clay mask of a woman, which may be South Italian in origin and a cast bronze figurine of a satyr, which is a replica of an item from Pompeii, Italy. The artefacts were from the estate of the late Professor Henry Broadhead, who formerly taught classics at the University of Canterbury, and have been generously donated by his son-in-law William Alington.

The two new donations will make valuable additions to the Logie Collection's teaching resources for Greek and Roman art classes. They also offer a fascinating insight into the mind of a collector of antiquities and classical memorabilia.

About 260 Logie collection objects were damaged in the earthquakes but they have been restored and no objects were damaged beyond repair.

The collection regularly hosts classes for University of Canterbury students, as well as primary and secondary school classes from throughout Canterbury and New Zealand. Later this year the collection, the Department of Classics and the School of Music will relocate to the old Chemistry Building in the Arts Centre complex. The collection will be open to the public.
