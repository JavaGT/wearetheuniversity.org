University of Canterbury Statement On Party

### University of Canterbury Statement On Party

The University of Canterbury’s Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Town, says the University is disappointed by the actions of students who attended a party which got out of control at a property on Riccarton Road last night.

He says there had been a significant improvement in student behaviour in the first semester, and the University will be speaking with the four students who were arrested.

“The University does not condone this type of behaviour. We have already had our campus constable visit the flat today. We know the identity of the students who were arrested, and we know the identities of the students who live at the flat, and we will be referring them to our Procter - who is an academic staff member responsible for student discipline.”

Professor Town says it is too early to say what disciplinary action the University might take against the arrested students or the flat tenants.

He says the University has put a significant amount of work into improving its community relations in recent months.

“One of our initiatives is a landlord connections scheme, where we intend to build up a database of contact details for local landlords that will allow us to keep them informed of activities at their properties. It is a scheme we are initiating with the support of local residents and the Christchurch City Council.”

Professor Town says the University will be making contact with the landlord of the property where last night’s party was held.
