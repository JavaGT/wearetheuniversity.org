**World Bank to look at Christchurch’s recovery progress**

**September 17, 2013**

As part of a World Bank project, international experts on disaster risk reduction and recovery planning will link up with University of Canterbury (UC) experts this week to look at Christchurch’s recovery progress.

UC structural engineer Associate Professor Stefano Pampanin will host the visit of representatives from the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) from US and World Bank representatives in his capacity as President of the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering.

\`\`The World Bank is working on developing an international framework for post-disaster recovery and they hope to learn from Christchurch and share the information around the world,’’ Professor Pampanin says.

\`\`As part of this global project, EERI and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering, are undertaking a study of the Christchurch recovery, particularly focused on understanding decisions relating to Christchurch building back better than before.

\`\`This mission is being supported by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery of the World Bank as part of a larger recovery framework that will share lessons from many recovery experiences with governments around the world.

\`\`EERI and the New Zealand team will meet key players in the rebuild as well as researchers from different areas, from civil engineering to geology, commerce and social science and work collaboratively to prepare the mission report for the World Bank,’’ Professor Pampanin says.

UC’s Dr Sonia Giovinazzi is also part of the team and she will contribute to collecting, connecting and sharing the experience and research findings in the area of lifeline damage assessment, risk reduction and recovery strategies.

EERI and the World Bank representatives will meet with the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management, the Ministry of Building Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Wellington City Council representatives.

They will tour the Christchurch CBD with the assistance of the Christchurch Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) focusing on structures, buildings and the overall impact.

On Wednesday, they will visit the Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team (SCIRT) to see how they are progressing with the rebuild of infrastructure in the city and the eastern suburbs.

They will visit the Waimakariri District Council and meet with CERA chief executive Roger Sutton on Thursday and talk to community project groups on Friday.
