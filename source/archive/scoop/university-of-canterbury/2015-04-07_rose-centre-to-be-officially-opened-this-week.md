**Rose Centre for stroke recovery and research to be officially opened this week**

**April 7, 2015**

The University of Canterbury Rose Centre for Stroke Recovery and Research will be officially opened at Christchurch’s St George’s Hospital on Friday.

The centre is run by the University’s Associate Professor Maggie-Lee Huckabee who says the rate of pneumonia in stroke patients has more than halved as a result of a novel cough test investigated by the Rose Centre.

Her work, combined with the efforts of clinicians in the district health board, has improved patient outcomes and reduced health care costs by more than $1.4 million and has supported a collaborative culture of research support for frontline clinicians.

The Rose Centre is a clinically-based stroke research and rehabilitation facility and was made possible by a donation from the Rose family through the Canterbury Medical Research Foundation. It was set up in recognition of the stroke research programme run by Associate Professor Huckabee and her Swallowing Rehabilitation Research Laboratory. She is a world leader in cough-reflex and rehabilitation research of stroke patients.

The Rose Family Trust bequest of $450,000 has been supported by a donation of $250,000 from an anonymous benefactor to employ a clinical fellow in the centre and another $100,000 from the research foundation’s annual art and wine auction.

“We are focusing on neuropathology and neuro-rehabilitation of swallowing impairment or dysphagia, with a particular emphasis on development of bioengineering applications for rehabilitation. Ultimately we hope to include therapies, such as physical and occupational therapy.

“The centre is equipped with the latest biomedical and neural technologies for understanding and visualising swallowing processes. These technologies, when applied to rehabilitation, enable the capacity for change in swallowing function.

“Patients recovering from stroke and other neurological disorders have the opportunity to benefit from - and contribute to - the latest research on the diagnosis and treatment of swallowing disorders. Patients volunteer to participate in world-leading research which helps contribute to ongoing improved understanding of dysphagia and its treatment. Patients are receiving ongoing specialist clinical services.”

Associate Professor Huckabee has co-authored two textbooks on swallowing impairment following neurological impairment, 10 book chapters on topics related to rehabilitation and 51 peer-reviewed scientific articles in various dimensions of dysphagia.

Centre director Associate Professor Huckabee is one of five keynote speakers at an international stroke rehabilitation conference in Christchurch next month. The May 10 to 12 conference is being hosted by the Rose Centre.
