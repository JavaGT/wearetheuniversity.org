Why Auckland is among the Top 10 Most Liveable Cities

**Why Auckland is among the Top 10 Most Liveable Cities in the world**

**September 2, 2013**

A University of Canterbury (UC) tourism lecturer understands why Auckland has made it into the Top 10 List of Most Liveable Cities in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).

Auckland is the most international of New Zealand cities and the criteria favours Auckland on issues of international connectivity, public transportation and medical care, UC researcher Dr Girish Prayag says.

\`\`This does not mean that other cities offer a lesser quality of life. With the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes, it is not surprising that Christchurch does not figure on the list, while the ranking of Wellington on other lists may be compromised for next year.

\`\`Christchurch will improve on urban infrastructure as the on-going rebuild offers the opportunity to re-position the city as a great place to live and work.

\`\`Lonely Planet puts Christchurch at number six on its list of Top 10 Cities for 2013, describing the city as ‘rising from the rubble with a breath-taking mix of spirit, determination and flair’.

\`\`It says 2013 is the year to join the rebirth of our city and, on the numbers so far, it appears young people in New Zealand and overseas are looking seriously at Christchurch.

\`\`While these most liveable cities lists may not affect the average person, it certainly should influence mayors, city leaders and local councils in their quest to offer better quality of life to residents.

\`\`These lists may well influence future residents, immigrants and investors. This year New Zealand also ranked seventh out of 40 countries evaluated on the where-to-be-born next list, published by the EIU.

\`\`These rankings paint a positive picture of the country as whole on the international scene. Yet, maintaining our high ranking on these lists depend very much on initiatives and proactive policy developments such as urban infrastructure, healthcare, education, environmental policies and reducing crime rates,’’ Dr Prayag says.

The EIU list is not the only list that ranks cities worldwide on liveability. The Mercer’s Quality of Life survey and Monocle’s most liveable cities index are also popular lists.

On Mercer’s list last year, Auckland (third) and Wellington (13th ) were among the top 15 cities in the world. This year Auckland is the only city that made the top 25, ranked at number 10 on the Monocle’s list.
