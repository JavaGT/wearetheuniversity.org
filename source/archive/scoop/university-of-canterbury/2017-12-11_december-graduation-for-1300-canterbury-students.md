More than 3500 students graduate each year from the University of Canterbury. As a result, eight graduation ceremonies are needed to accommodate all those wishing to graduate in person, and their families, friends and supporters.

**About UC Graduation Ceremonies**

University graduation ceremonies are part of a tradition which stretches back to the 12th century when the first universities appeared in Europe. The University of Canterbury, established as Canterbury College in 1873, was based on the English Oxbridge model and its graduation ceremonies follow that style but also incorporate elements of Māori culture.  
The first Canterbury degrees were conferred in 1878 in the Canterbury Provincial Chambers with the ceremonies moving to the College Hall, now the Great Hall at the Arts Centre, after its completion in 1882. The Christchurch Town Hall became the venue in 1973 and a further change to three afternoon ceremonies was made in 1987. Four ceremonies became necessary in 1994 and in 1997 five ceremonies, four in autumn and one in summer, were held. The last ten years have seen a resurgence in the popularity of graduation with a steadily increasing proportion of students choosing to receive their degrees in person. As a result of the 2007 merger between the University and the Christchurch College of Education, the number of graduation ceremonies has increased to eight, including one held in Rotorua.  
As a result of earthquake damage in the city, the April 2011 Graduate Celebrations were held in a marquee on Ilam Fields. The Graduation Ceremonies have been held in the Horncastle Arena (formerly the CBS Canterbury Arena) since December 2011.
