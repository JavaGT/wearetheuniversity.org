University distances itself from petition

University distances itself from petition

The University of Canterbury has moved to distance itself from a staff petition supporting striking supermarket workers.

Human Resources Director, Paul O'Flaherty, says the University does not have an official view on the dispute.

\"We are comfortable with our staff expressing their personal views on this issue, but we are not prepared for that to be done in a manner which could be seen as official comment by Canterbury University."

As a result, the University has asked the Association of University Staff to remove the petition from its IT network.
