UC hosts Women in Finance panel discussion
==========================================

**UC hosts Women in Finance panel discussion**

Women make up only an estimated 10% to 15% of the New Zealand financial industry, with female representation at senior management levels estimated to be even lower. This is despite research that suggests gender diversity across job grades and functions delivers benefits to businesses, the economy and society.

To discuss and promote increased gender diversity in the New Zealand financial industry, the UC Business School Trading Room, in conjunction with CFA Society New Zealand and INFINZ (Institute of Finance Professionals New Zealand), is hosting a symposium, **Women in Finance**, on Thursday, 3 May, 3pm-5.30pm at the University of Canterbury.

“While the statistics are improving for women in finance, we are keen to see stronger representation in the sector at all levels,” says UC alumna Zoe Wallis, Kiwibank’s Head of Transactions and Payments.  
“CFA and INFINZ are looking at ways to encourage diversity in finance and view active engagement with students in the very early stages of their careers as critical.”

Dr Jędrzej Białkowski, UC Associate Professor of Finance and head of the UC Business School Trading Room, strongly supports moves to improve the industry’s gender equity.

“We aim to encourage and empower our female students to pursue a career in finance and provide them with some sage advice from women who have achieved success in the finance sector,” says Dr Białkowski, who helped organise the symposium.

The symposium seeks to identify barriers to women entering and progressing in the financial services industry and will examine the value to financial firms of having greater gender balance.
