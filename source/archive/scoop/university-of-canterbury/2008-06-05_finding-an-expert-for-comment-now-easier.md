Finding an expert for comment has just got a whole lot easier

The University of Canterbury has launched a new website showcasing the University’s research excellence.

The UC Research Profile provides a single web source for information about research undertaken at UC. It includes detailed information on the research interests and affiliations of UC researchers, the research projects they are working on, the research groups they are part of and the major pieces of equipment they use.

All this information is fully interlinked and provides users with a broad view of research at UC and access to greater detail about the particular research they are interested in.

Users will have the option to search by keyword, project or researcher name, or browse by subject area or department.

The UC Research Profile was an initiative of Research and Consultancy and was made possible with the technical support of Information and Communication Technology Services.

Maxine Bryant, the Research and Consultancy Project Manager responsible for the Profile, says development of the system has been significant, taking more than  
“This will be a great tool for a host of users and purposes, ranging from people looking for an expert on a particular topic, students looking for potential supervisors, or researchers looking for potential collaborators on research projects or investigating what equipment UC has available for research,” she said.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor and Project Sponsor Professor Ian Town says the Profile is “a great way to inform a wide audience about the exciting research UC is involved in and gives community groups and organisations an opportunity to become more engaged with the university”.

The Profile can be accessed at http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/UCResearchProfile or via links on the UC homepage.
