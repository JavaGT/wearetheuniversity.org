University of Canterbury begins demolition of two buildings
===========================================================

**University of Canterbury begins demolition of two buildings on campus**

The University of Canterbury advises that Image Construction will begin the demolition of the Mushroom and Siemon buildings on its Ilam campus on 25 October.

A small number of buildings at the University have been closed due to earthquake damage, including the Mushroom and Siemon buildings on either side of the Engineering and Physical Sciences (EPS) Library.

Site fencing will be extended during the demolition which will begin with a soft strip of both buildings from 25 October (due for completion by 18 November). No loud or noisy work will take place until exams are over.

Excavator work for the hard demolition will begin on 21 November. The demolition of the buildings is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

New lobbies will be constructed at the entrances of the Engineering core building and the EPS Library before the start of the 2012 academic year.

The demolition of the Mushroom and Siemon buildings is funded by a cash settlement from the University’s insurers. Demolition was recommended following a review of technical and financial information, access and use of buildings, and with regard to the Campus Master Plan.
