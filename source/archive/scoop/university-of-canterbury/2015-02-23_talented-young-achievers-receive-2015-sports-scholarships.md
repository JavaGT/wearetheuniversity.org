Talented young achievers receive 2015 Canterbury sports scholarships

February 22, 2015

Talented young national rugby players, basketballers, a hockey player, a netballer and an archer are among the University of Canterbury students to receive 2015 sports scholarships.

The sports scholarships were established last year with support from University of Canterbury alumni and the Christchurch sporting community via the University of Canterbury Foundation. They are awarded to applicants who have strong academic achievement and high levels of performance in sports.

All three rugby players - Caleb Aperahama, Faletui Samuelu and Matthew Morrison - are members of the Crusaders academy. Aperahama, who is studying for a Bachelor of Criminal Justice degree, was a member of the Chiefs under-18 team and Morrison, studying mechanical engineering, was a member of the Auckland under-19 team.

Philippa Connell and Tony Tolovae are talented young basketballers with Tolovae playing for the Canterbury Rams and Connell having played for the New Zealand Tall Ferns.

Hayley Saunders is a member of the Canterbury Tactix, a gold medal winner with the New Zealand Fastnet Ferns, and has played for the New Zealand under-21 team. Bridget Kiddle is a member of the New Zealand Future Black Sticks squad while archer Contessa Loh has qualified for the 2015 World University Games.

The students who have been appointed to the university’s athletic development programme this year include rower Tom Mackintosh (Lindisfarne college), athlete Amelia Morgan, athlete Dian Munoz (Riccarton High School), athlete Max Attwell (Wanganui Collegiate), athlete Amelia Morgan (Craighead Diocesan School) and hockey player Daniel Harris (Wellington College). The programme supports the premier University of Canterbury sports teams and student-athletes.

University of Canterbury students include All Black Kieran Read (sports coaching) and world barefoot water ski tricks champion Georgia Groen (engineering), who both manage to study for their degrees and achieve at the highest level, make excellent student role models.
