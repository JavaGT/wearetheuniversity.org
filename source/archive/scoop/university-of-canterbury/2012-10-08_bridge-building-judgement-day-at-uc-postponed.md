Bridge building judgement day at UC postponed

  
Due to poor weather conditions the iconic bridge-building day over Okeover stream for civil engineering students at UC has been postponed. It will now take place from 2 to 5pm on Wednesday 10 October 2012.

The bridge competition is about students having to design, construct and test a bridge which sustains two people but fail with three people on it.
