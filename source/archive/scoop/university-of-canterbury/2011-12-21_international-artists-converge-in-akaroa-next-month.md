**International artists converge in Akaroa next month for fifth annual festival**  
  
International artists will be joining New Zealand artists in Akaroa next month to take part in the fifth annual University of Canterbury International Akaroa Summer Festival.

The 10-day festival, which launches on 13 January, will feature 16 local and international artists hosting a summer school for budding New Zealand musicians, in addition to masterclasses and concerts.

UC School of Music’s Wolfgang Kraemer (Festival Director) and Edith Salzmann (Festival Artistic Director) said that the festival will provide a fantastic opportunity for emerging New Zealand musicians to learn from musicians of international standing and to make links with international artists that could lead to excellent career opportunities.

For the public there will be daily evening chamber music recitals in the Akaroa Area School Auditorium as well as student lunchtime concerts in the Trinity Church. Repertoire for the evening concerts include many favourites such as the Schumann and Brahms Piano Quintets, a two piano recital performed by Diedre Irons and Michael Endres, virtuoso Vivaldi concertos and “Celtico Barrocco” – Irish folk and baroque music.

The final concert on 22 January will feature the Akaroa Summer Festival Orchestra and Choir conducted by Ben Parry from the Royal Academy in London. Ben is an acclaimed conductor, composer, arranger, producer and singer. He has conducted the choirs for many major motion pictures including Harry Potter, Iron Man, and Kung Fu Panda. For the final concert of the festival he has chosen works by Benjamin Britten and Edward Elgar.

“The University of Canterbury International Akaroa Summer Festival is really unique because of the breadth of performances on offer and the opportunities for teaching, learning and career development that it provides for our emerging young talent here in New Zealand,” said Wolfgang Kraemer. “For the public it provides a rare opportunity to hear and see performers of outstanding calibre in a picturesque natural setting. What better way is there to enjoy summer?”
