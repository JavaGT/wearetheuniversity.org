**Ex-MP examines ‘The Politics of Education’ in new UC paper**

A new University of Canterbury summer-school paper, taught by a former New Zealand politician, will examine ‘The Politics of Education’.

The College of Education, Health & Human Development recognised the need to teach this course in a contentious time, says the former Member of Parliament, UC Adjunct Senior Fellow Dr Liz Gordon about the new paper she will be teaching.

“Which is why they approached me to lead it,” she says. “There are questions around who should learn, what should be taught, availability and accessibility. Education is a highly contested activity.”

Dr Gordon believes her paper will make a difference by enabling educators to critically examine the politics of education from a range of perspectives.

Students taking The Politics of Education paper at UC in early 2016 will look at current issues in the field, such as overcoming poverty and social disadvantage through education, the cost of tertiary studies, the role of teachers and school ‘league tables’.

The Politics of Education will also study the way educational policy is reformed and assessed – an especially relevant topic as the Government announced an update of the Education Act in early November.

Dr Gordon says she was approached by UC’s College of Education, Health & Human Development to teach the paper because of her background as both a politician and education policy analyst.

She is the managing director of Pukeko Research, a research company which aims to provide evidence-based potential solutions to social and economic problems and issues.

The Politics of Education will be taught in January and February 2016 through a series of seminars and online material. This postgraduate paper will suit teachers, parents, school leaders, master’s students or anyone with an interest in education who already has a degree.
