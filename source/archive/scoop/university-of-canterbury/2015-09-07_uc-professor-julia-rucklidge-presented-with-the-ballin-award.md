**UC Professor Julia Rucklidge presented with the Ballin Award**

Professor Julia Rucklidge from the University of Canterbury has been presented with the Ballin Award. This award recognises notably significant contributions to the development or enhancement of clinical psychology in Aotearoa New Zealand by a member of the New Zealand Psychological Society.

Rucklidge received this award primarily in recognition of the contribution her original research has made and is making to clinical psychology but also for her commitment to effective mentoring, supervision, and training of safe, ethically informed capable practitioners.

Rucklidge’s early research centred on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), its psychopathology, diagnosis, and treatment focusing particularly on aspects of the condition in females and adults. Alongside that body of work Rucklidge has contributed studies of the interplay between psychosocial functioning, psychopathology.

Rucklidge’s interest in identifying effective treatments has led her to explore the effect of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) in ADHD and mental health more generally. She has employed rigorous scientific methodology including randomised-control designs (RCTs). She is currently one of the most prolific researchers in the field of mental health and nutrition.

In making this award NZPsS President Dr Kerry Gibson noted that Rucklidge “possesses the attributes worthy of the award to a remarkable degree”.

Rucklidge is a clinical psychologist investigating the impact micronutrients can have on a range of illness, including mental health. Along with her team of PhD students, she has been conducting a number of trials using nutrients to treat mental illness.

Rucklidge teaches child psychology at the University of Canterbury and recently introduced the topic of Mental Health and Nutrition into the wider psychology programme. Her research interests arecentred on the role of nutrition in the expression and treatment of mental illness, from ADHD to depression to stress following natural disasters.
