**Security threat at University of Canterbury**

Following an anonymous security threat, the Police have asked the University of Canterbury to evacuate the James Hight building.

Students and staff currently in the building are being asked to leave and take all personal belongings with them. Staff who are based in the building should go home, as the building is likely to remain closed for the rest of the day. This includes all retail outlets in the building.

The Police have emphasised to us that they are taking a precautionary approach. No other areas on campus are affected. All teaching and other activities on campus will continue as normal.

ENDS
