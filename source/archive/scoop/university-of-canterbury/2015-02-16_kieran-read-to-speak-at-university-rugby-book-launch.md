Kieran Read to speak at University of Canterbury rugby book launch

February 16, 2015

All Black Kieran Read will help launch a sports book by a University of Canterbury sports expert later next week.

Professor Richard Light, the new Head of the School of Sport and Physical Education, has published a book, Advances in rugby coaching: An Holistic Approach. He has previously coached rugby in Japan. Read, a University of Canterbury sports coaching student, will be the guest speaker at the launch on campus on February 26.

Contemporary sport coaching studies have moved beyond simple biophysical approaches to more complex understandings of coaching as a set of social relationships and processes, Professor Light says.

“This is the first book to examine what that means in the context of one major international sport: rugby union. Drawing on cutting-edge empirical research in the five most powerful rugby-playing nations, as well as developments in pedagogical and social theory, the book argues for an holistic approach to coaching, coach development and player and team performance, helping to close the gap between coaching theory and applied practice.

“The book covers key contemporary topics in coach education such as long-term coach development, experience and culture in coaching practice, positive coaching for youth rugby, improving decision-making ability and collaborative action research in rugby coaching.”

Professor Light worked with elite-level rugby coaches and examined coaching practices in both the full and sevens versions of the game. The book is essential reading for all students of sport coaching with an interest in rugby, and for any coach, manager or administrator looking to develop better programmes in coach education.

All Blacks assistant coach Wayne Smith says the book invites coaches to think deeply and reflectively about their practice, and has much to offer them. Former Wallabies coach and current Japan coach Eddie Jones says the book is an excellent resource for all teachers and coaches.
