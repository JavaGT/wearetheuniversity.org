**UC retains position as a leading research university**

**April 11, 2013**

The University of Canterbury has retained its position as a leading research university, according to the latest Tertiary Education Commission Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) assessment.

It is ranked first or second in 10 subject areas.

Acting Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ian Town, said it is a significant increase compared to 2006 (when the last assessment round was completed) in which UC was ranked first or second in five subject areas.

“This is very pleasing. Overall UC staff have improved their research performance significantly since the last assessment.”

UC ranks top in New Zealand in:

• Marketing and tourism  
• Molecular, cellular and whole organism biology  
• Other health studies

UC has the top departments of Mechanical Engineering and Chemical and Process Engineering.

UC ranks second in:

• Accounting and finance  
• Agriculture and applied biological sciences  
• Communications and journalism  
• Computer science  
• Ecology, evolution and behaviour  
• Management, human resources, industrial relations and other businesses  
• Political science, international relations and public policy

The 2012 PBRF results show that the proportion of UC researchers awarded an A rating has increased. There has also been an increase in the proportion awarded a B rating.  
Professor Town said although the assessment period began prior to the earthquakes, the 2010 and 2011 years were included.

\`\`We have long recognised the resilience of our staff. This outcome is further and deserved recognition of the commitment our people have to their research and teaching and their loyalty to the University.

\`\`I commend our staff for their contribution and commitment as we work to recover from the impacts of the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes and transform the University for the future.”
