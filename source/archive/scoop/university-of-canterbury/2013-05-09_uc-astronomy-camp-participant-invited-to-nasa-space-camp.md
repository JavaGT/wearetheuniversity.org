**UC Astronomy Camp Participant Invited to NASA Space Camp**

**May 9, 2013**

A Burnside High School student has just been accepted as one of two New Zealand year 13 students to attend a week-long NASA International Space Camp this year. 

Tom Marsh, who recently took part in the Aurora Astronomy School run by the University of Canterbury (UC), will attend the camp in Hunstville, Alabama, in July.

He will be experiencing what it is like to train for a mission to space, zero gravity and other space travel related activities.

Marsh took part in UC’s Auroroa Astronomy School at Tekapo, visiting UC’s Mt John Observatory.

UC is the only New Zealand university with an optical telescope. The Auoroa camp looks at the universe, the stars, planet exploration and extra-terrestrial life.
