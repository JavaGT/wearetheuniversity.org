Criminal Justice book launch with expert panel discussion
=========================================================

**New Zealand Criminal Justice book launch with expert panel discussion**

A book launch of _Criminal Justice: A New Zealand Introduction_ edited by University of Canterbury criminologists Dr Jarrod Gilbert and Professor Greg Newbold, will include a panel discussion with six leading experts on the biggest challenges facing New Zealand's criminal justice system.

_Criminal Justice_ (362pp, paperback $59.99, AUP) is made up of contributions from academics and people who work in the field. It will give readers the essential information that they need to understand the New Zealand criminal justice system, its foundations, its agencies, and other key issues.

In the new textbook, leading scholars from criminology, history, journalism, law, psychology, sociology and other fields take students and general readers inside New Zealand’s criminal justice system.

This book tackles the big questions: How can crime be explained? Is crime rising or falling and if so, why? How do the police operate? How do the courts work? What is the meaning of a ‘life’ sentence? What is the link between crime and mental instability? Why are Māori over-represented in the criminal justice system? How do we deal with youth offenders? How do judicial miscarriages arise? Do the stories we read about crime in the media reflect reality? And how does justice operate in the criminal underworld?
