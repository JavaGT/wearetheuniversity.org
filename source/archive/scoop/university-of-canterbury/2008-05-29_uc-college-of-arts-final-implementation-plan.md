UC College of Arts Final Implementation Plan

UC College of Arts Final Implementation Plan

Today the University of Canterbury has released a Final Implementation Plan for the restructuring of its College of Arts.

The restructuring is the outcome of a long-term review to determine how the College can be academically excellent and financially sustainable. The University believes it will provide fresh ways to collaborate, begin new endeavours and interact with the wider community.

College of Arts Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ken Strongman, says: “While the number of staff affected by the changes is less than originally planned, 6.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) academic staff positions and 6.5 FTE general staff positions will still be lost, and this is regretted.”

Since releasing the Draft Implementation Plan it has become apparent that the reductions will be achieved through a mix of redundancies and alternative voluntary arrangements.

"The process has been, and continues to be, very difficult for general and academic staff in the College," he says.

"I am very appreciative of the way in which they have maintained their professionalism and commitment during this difficult time."

Professor Strongman says appropriate support services will be made available to staff directly affected by the changes.
