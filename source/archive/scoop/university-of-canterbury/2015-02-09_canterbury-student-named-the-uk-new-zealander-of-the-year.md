Former University of Canterbury student named the UK New Zealander of the year

February 9, 2015

A former University of Canterbury student, Katherine Corich, has been named the 2015 New Zealander of the Year in the United Kingdom.

The award recognises the outstanding contribution that a New Zealand or British national has made in promoting the interests of New Zealand or New Zealanders in the United Kingdom.

Corich received the award in recognition of her outstanding contribution to New Zealanders in the UK and in New Zealand, and for presenting a positive image of New Zealand in the United Kingdom having been nominated for her contributions to New Zealand business, community and fundraising causes.

The announcement was made at a gala event in London at the weekend. Corich is the guest speaker at the University of Canterbury alumni event in London on April 28.

University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says it is great to see so many excellent alumni such as Corich achieving and succeeding around the world.

Corich has been honoured with many industry awards, including winning two Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Awards, winner of Aveeno Next Business Woman of the Year in 2010, and winner of a Trade NZ Export Award

Her company Sysdoc is a founding supporter of CEISMIC, the University of Canterbury online database of earthquake photos and stories. Corich is also a member of the university’s International Board of Advisors.
