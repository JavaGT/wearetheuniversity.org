Christchurch cinema scene beginning to recover – UC expert

September 25, 2012

The lack of movie theatres in Christchurch may be driving audiences back to festivals, a University of Canterbury (UC) expert said today.

UC cinema studies co-ordinator Dr Mary Wiles said the New Zealand International Film Festival attracted unprecedented crowds this year, with many films being sold out in advance.

\`\`The World Cinema Showcase held at the Hollywood Cinema in Sumner also was hugely successful.

\`\`Classes in our UC cinema studies programme have not suffered from a decline in enrolments in the aftermath of the earthquakes. On the contrary, students are especially keen to see the diverse offerings of international and local New Zealand films on offer in our courses.

\`\`Next year in the first semester, we are particularly excited to offer a new special topic class at both second and third year levels: Film on the Faultline, which directly addresses our recent seismic experiences in Christchurch from the perspective of film history and theory.’’

Dr Alan Wright will be convening the course, which will focus on the cinematic response to the recent earthquakes in Chile, Japan, New Zealand, and Haiti.

Just five movie theatres are operating in Christchurch: Hoyts Northlands, Hoyts Riccarton, Reading Cinemas at the Palms, Hollywood Cinema in Sumner, and Alice in Videoland's new Egyptian Picture Theatre.

The Regent on Worcester was demolished in the aftermath of February 22. Metro Gold Cinema in Cathedral Square and The Academy Cinema in the Arts Centre are closed indefinitely. The Rialto has also closed indefinitely.

Rodney Cook, who ran the both the Metro Gold and the Academy cinemas, plans to open a three-screen cinema in Sydenham by Christmas.

Manager of Alice in Videoland, Nick Paris said that \`\`Christchurch is missing out on many art house films due to lack of screen space".

Dr Wiles said the collection of international art house DVDs at Alice in Videoland had impressed her, having moved from the US, as comparable to those available only in film meccas, such as Los Angeles, New York City, or Paris.

\`\`It is fantastic that Alice's is up and running once more. It is an amazing venue and great that it has expanded to offer exciting art house fare in its new cinematheque. I feel that it is only a matter of time before other possibilities begin to open up,’’ she said.
