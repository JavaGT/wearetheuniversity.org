University of Canterbury appoints new Vice-Chancellor

The University of Canterbury has appointed Dr Rod Carr as its next Vice-Chancellor. He will take up a five-year appointment in February.

Dr Carr is currently Managing Director of Christchurch-based Jade Software Corporation. Prior to joining Jade in 2003, he was Deputy Governor and Director of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. He has also held senior positions within the Bank of New Zealand and the National Australia Bank.

UC Chancellor Dr Robin Mann says he is delighted at the appointment.

“Dr Carr comes to the University with proven leadership skills and an impressive academic record.”

He has LLB (Hons) and BCom (Hons) degrees from the University of Otago, an MBA from Columbia University Graduate School of Business (New York), and MA and PhD degrees from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Dr Carr is a longtime supporter of the University. He currently chairs the advisory board of NZi3 - the national ICT Innovation Institute based at UC. He is also a director of the Geospatial Research Centre and a member of the College of Business and Economics Advisory Board.

Dr Mann says Dr Carr has impressed the University Council with his understanding of the broad issues facing UC and the wider tertiary sector.

“We believe his experience dealing with central government will serve us and the sector well.”

Dr Carr replaces Professor Roy Sharp who left the University after being appointed Chief Executive of the Tertiary Education Commission.
