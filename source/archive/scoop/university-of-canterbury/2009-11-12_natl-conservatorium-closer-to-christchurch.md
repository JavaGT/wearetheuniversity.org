University of Canterbury Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr is welcoming the Christchurch City Council’s decision to back the establishment of a National Conservatorium of Music at the Christchurch Arts Centre.

  
At a meeting today the City Council agreed to lease from the Arts Centre Trust Board an area of land on Hereford Street currently used for car parking, construct the conservatorium building and enter into a long-term rental agreement with the University.

  
The building, designed by Sir Miles Warren and the architectural firm Warren & Mahoney, will now be considered for resource consent.

  
Dr Carr says the proposed conservatorium development represents a significant opportunity for the city’s economic and cultural development that could be realised without any cost to Christchurch ratepayers.

  
“I am delighted that the City Council shares our enthusiasm for bringing music back to the city. We now have a real opportunity to expose our talented musicians to the people of Christchurch and the thousands of people who visit the area each year.”

  
ENDS
