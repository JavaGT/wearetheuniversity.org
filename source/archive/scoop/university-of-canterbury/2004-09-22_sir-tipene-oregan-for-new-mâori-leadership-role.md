UC selects Sir Tipene O’Regan for new Mâori leadership role

Eminent kaumâtua, academic and business leader, Sir Tipene O’Regan, is to become the first-ever Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mâori) at the University of Canterbury.

Announcing the appointment, Vice-Chancellor Professor Roy Sharp says Sir Tipene’s mana and skills will help ensure that the University realises its aspirations for strong strategic Mâori leadership.

“The job of the Assistant Vice-Chancellor (Mâori) is to promote recruitment, retention and advancement of Mâori students and staff, lead collegial support for Mâori academics and management and ensure the goals of the University align with the aspirations of Mâori.

“I have no doubt whatsoever that Sir Tipene will help the University excel in these areas, and I am delighted that he is taking up this newly-created role.”

Sir Tipene will advise senior management at the University on issues of interest to Mâori, liaise with the Mâori community outside the University and represent UC on the New Zealand Vice Chancellors’ Standing Committee on Mâori (Te Kâhui Amokura).

He will also contribute to teaching and research activities.

Sir Tipene, who chaired the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission from 1989 until 2000, is a professional company director. He was the inaugural chairman of Ngâi Tahu Holdings Corporation, holding the position for nine years until 2000. Between 1993 and 2002 he was chairman of the Sealord Group. Today, he sits on the boards of a number of companies in the financial, tourism, agricultural and natural resource sectors.

The 65-year-old is a Ngâi Tahu kaumâtua. He led Ngâi Tahu’s Waitangi Tribunal land and sea fisheries claims. He also played a pivotal role in the Treaty fisheries settlements of 1989 and 1992.

Sir Tipene has had a long association with Canterbury University, teaching post-graduate history since 1989 as a visiting lecturer. In 1992 he received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree and in 1998 delivered its prestigious Macmillan Brown Memorial Lecture.

He has lectured extensively elsewhere in New Zealand and around the world, and has held a number of academic fellowships. Earlier this year he received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Lincoln University. Sir Tipene will begin his new part-time role at Canterbury University in February 2005.
