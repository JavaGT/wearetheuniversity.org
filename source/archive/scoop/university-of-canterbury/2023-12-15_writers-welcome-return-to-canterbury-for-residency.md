Writers Welcome Return To Canterbury For Residency
==================================================

**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

Acclaimed author Nic Low (Ngāi Tahu) returns to the University of Canterbury to take up one of two Ursula Bethell Writers in Residence placements.

The 2024 residency will be a step back into familiar territory for Low, who was an undergraduate in the English Department at Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha | University of Canterbury (UC) 20 years ago.

He says it will be a privilege to return to the department early next year and start writing his fourth book. “I took some good steps towards becoming a writer when I was at UC. I learned to love the craft of words, and while studying post-colonial writing I started to understand how the exercise of power is tied up with the stories we tell.

“I'll be working on a novel about a group of Māori soldiers who, heading home through London after World War 1, decide to rob the British Museum. The idea is to write a literary heist novel that explores how we think about taonga as living ancestors, and the legacy of colonial museums. I guess I’m interested in who gets to keep what they stole, and why,” Low says.

Ōtautahi’s reputation for live comedy and theatre was a key attraction for award-winning author Pip Adam, who will take up the Ursula Bethell residency in the second half of the year.

Born and raised in Christchurch, Adam now lives in Wellington but is excited to be returning to Christchurch for her tenure.

“I have loved coming to the Word Christchurch Festival the last few years and getting a glimpse of the thriving writing and arts communities there. I've been looking a lot at humour and theatre recently, so one thing that particularly attracted me to Ōtautahi was the live comedy and theatre happening in the city, which looks amazing,” she says.

“I think being a bit 'lost' in a new city and having to relearn things that I take for granted is always good for my writing. It makes my brain work in different ways which helps me think differently about my work.”

During her residency, Adam will work on a new novel that explores the ways humour is weaponised.

“It's kind of fuelled by all the times I've been told I need to 'lighten up' or that it's 'just a joke'. I have written a bit toward the novel but I'm really looking forward to challenging what I've written and being open to the possibility of starting over.”
