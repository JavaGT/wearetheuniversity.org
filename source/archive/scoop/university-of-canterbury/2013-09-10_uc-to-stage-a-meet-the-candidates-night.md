UC to stage a meet the candidates’ night with elections critical to Christchurch’s future

September 10, 2013

The University of Canterbury (UC) will stage a speed-voting meet the candidates event for all Christchurch City council election candidates in the run up to next month’s local body elections.

The September 25 event, which is open to the public, is being organised by UC’s School of Political and Social Sciences and will be held in UC’s C2 lecture theatre.

Organiser Dr Bronwyn Hayward says the elections are critical for the city’s future.

\`\`Never before in our history have we faced so many issues and Christchurch is at a crossroads. The rebuild of the city is a major event in New Zealand’s history,’’ Dr Hayward says.

Three years on from the earthquakes, Christchurch will recover and become a more multicultural, open, caring and innovative city. Robust elections next month could really help.

\`\`We can reclaim a more active, more compassionate and more critical perspective on democracy and resilience. Drawing on our community’s experiences, I argue that the future for Christchurch could be more inclusive, more creative and more socially just.

\`\`It is incumbent on us to consider how can we maintain and sustain democracy in a dynamic and changing world,’’ Dr Hayward says.
