Public meeting to discuss Music Conservatorium proposal

The University of Canterbury's proposal to establish a National Conservatorium of Music at the Arts Centre is to be discussed at a public meeting organised by the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce this Thursday (9 July).

The meeting, which will be chaired by CECC Chief Executive Peter Townsend, will include a presentation from UC Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr.

The Chamber has organised the meeting to allow members of the public to learn more about the University's proposal that the Christchurch City Council build the conservatorium building and enter into a long-term rental agreement with UC. The University says building and interest costs would be covered by the University through its long-term rental agreement with the CCC.

Dr Carr says he is looking forward to the opportunity to discuss the proposal at the meeting, which will also be attended by Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker.

Mr Townsend asks that members of the public who wish to attend the meeting contact the Chamber and register their interest to give his staff an indication of likely numbers. The number to call is 366 5096

Date: Thursday 9 July  
Time: 4:30pm - 6:30pm  
Venue: Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce, 57 Kilmore Street, Christchurch
