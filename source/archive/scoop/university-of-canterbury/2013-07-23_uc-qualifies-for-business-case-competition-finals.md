**UC qualifies for international business case competition finals**

**July 23, 2013**

A team from the University of Canterbury (UC) has qualified for the final of an international business case competition after finishing first equal in New Zealand.

The UC team of Michelle Panzer, Thomas Pearse, Marliese Liyange and Hugh Mack will compete in the Student Development Society’s International Business Case Competition in Queenstown in August. The UC team has been coached by management professor Bob Hamilton.

The business case competition, first held in 2008, involves a presentation on growth strategy for a company or organisation.

The company used for the latest competition was Pinnacle Rigging, a company which specialises in telecommunications and electricity tower installation.

\`\`This is an incredible opportunity to put into practice a lot of what we learn in our commerce degrees,’’ fifth-year student Michelle Panzer says.

\`\`Being of a range of backgrounds we have each been able to contribute in a special way, which was one of our key assets in the competition.

\`\`Working with real New Zealand companies, some succeeding, some struggling, and providing them with advice and future direction is humbling and incredibly exciting.

\`\`The confidence we have each gained, not only through public speaking, but through conveying a strategy that we are all passionate about, is a benefit we will each take into our careers.

\`\`Another great aspect of the competition is meeting fellow business students who are similarly representing their university and competing for the national title,’’ Panzer says.

Another UC business team is in the national finals of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) Global Challenge which will be held in Auckland on Thursday. The winning team will head to South Africa for the world finals later this year.
