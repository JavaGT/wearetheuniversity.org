**Important postgraduate waterways conference at UC next month**

**October 7, 2013**

Dr Melissa Robson, a senior scientist at AgResearch and Environment Canterbury, is the keynote speaker at a waterways conference on the University of Canterbury (UC) campus next month.

The conference is being run by the Waterways Centre for Freshwater Management, jointly-run by UC and Lincoln University.

Dr Robson is leading the technical work relating to environmental limits in several highly conflicted catchments in Canterbury. She will highlight water issues facing Canterbury and discuss challenges.

The November 12 conference will give postgraduate students the opportunity to outline their research. The conference will highlight research taking place at both universities and look at issues such as urban streams,  whitebait and other native fish,  riparian planting, domestic chemical and microplastic  pollution, climate change effects, new water management ideas and roles for the community.

Waterways Centre director Professor Jenny Webster-Brown says the event is an annual celebration of students’ research.

\`\`The conference is open to the public and people with an interest in how we can better manage New Zealand’s water resources, whether they are from industry, regulatory organisations, other research organisations, environmental interest groups or the community.   

\`\`Our postgraduate students will communicate their research findings on key aspects of water management. This includes how we can better control the effects of rural and urban diffuse pollution, how vulnerable our aquatic biota are to change environmentally such as invasive species and climate change and how changes in environmental policies and legislation could affect future water quality and quantity.

\`\`These are all recognised as important knowledge gaps, standing in the way of effective improvement of New Zealand’s freshwater environments. Diffuse pollution of our waterways is now the single most important factor in the ongoing decline of water quality in this country.”
