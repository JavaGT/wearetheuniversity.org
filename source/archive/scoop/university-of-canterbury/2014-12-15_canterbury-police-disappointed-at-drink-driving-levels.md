Canterbury Police disappointed at drink driving levels

**"Canterbury Police disappointed at drink driving levels"**

Canterbury Police were disappointed at the number of people who failed the compulsory breath test over the weekend, two weeks after the new lower alcohol limits were introduced.

Operation Capricorn, which runs through December and January in Canterbury District, is a prevention operation aimed at reducing serious public place assaults and preventing road trauma to ensure the safe and efficient movement of traffic on Canterbury roads.

Up to 80 additional Police officers were deployed across Christchurch city and surrounding areas in the District on Friday (12 December 2014) and Saturday (13 December 2014) night as part of planned prevention activity with an alcohol focus. This will be repeated again this coming Friday (19 December 2014) as the festive season moves into full swing in the District.

Canterbury Police’s Road Policing Manager, Inspector Al Stewart said “It was disappointing to see so many people fail the new lower alcohol limit of 250mcg of alcohol per litre of breath. Two teams working near Rangiora and in Christchurch City and the surrounding suburbs on Friday conducted 4358 Compulsory Breath Tests (CBTs). Nine of those tested gave an Evidential Breath Test (EBA) of over 400mcg per litre of breath and 11 an EBA result between 250-400mcg per litre of breath. Nine failed the EBA for other reasons. On Saturday 3482 CBTs produced six EBAs over 400mcg and nine between 250-400mcg.”

“Overall this means that 41 out of 7840 people tested, or one in every 191, in the north of the District (including the city) failed the EBA and while that might sound a good result the actions of some that failed the test left us speechless. One person who blew over the 400mcg limit had an open box of bourbon and cola on the passenger seat and was driving without a license after failing to reapply after he was disqualified seven months ago for exceeding the limit. The same person was stopped again this morning for driving while suspended and his car has now been impounded for 28 days as a result.“

Inspector Stewart says “We were somewhat encouraged with the figures from checkpoints in the south of the District in Timaru where initial reports are of no-one caught breaking the lower alcohol limit. However three drivers were apprehended for drink driving after vehicle stops by patrol cars after midnight.”

“We encourage anyone who is going to an office party or socialising with friends to plan ahead how they are going to get home. Nominate a sober driver, share a taxi, use public transport , call a sober friend or family member for a lift home or even consider staying at a friend’s house or in a hotel/motel. Look out for your family and friends and stop them driving drunk.”

“In Canterbury we take an ‘anytime anywhere’ policy on breath testing and every driver stopped in the District, no matter what time of day, will be breath-tested. It’s simple, if you’re going to drink don’t drive.” explained Inspector Stewart.

Alcohol is also known to be a major contributor to crimes such as disorder, violence and sexual assaults. In New Zealand around a third of all recorded offences are committed after the offender has consumed alcohol.

Inspector Derek Erasmus, who led last week’s alcohol activity, says “The patrols in the entertainment areas were well received by patrons. Reported serious assaults are down 33% for the month to date compared to the three year average of the same period. This is very encouraging and despite the disappointing drink driving numbers in the north of our District and in the City overall Cantabrians appear to be modifying their drinking behaviour in a good way.”

“This Friday will mark the last day of work for many of the tradies in the City, so again we urge employers to think safety when they plan office celebrations either at work or in licensed premises. Think about hiring a minibus to take your employees home or rewarding sober drivers with a voucher in lieu of a beer tab.”

“We will have additional officers working again this week as part of the alcohol focus and while we predict we will be busier than last week we hope the number of people caught over the limit will be much less” said Inspector Erasmus

Canterbury Police urge everyone to reflect on their drinking behaviour and the potentially tragic consequences over indulgence may cause. As part of your social event include eating food and drinking water as, apart from moderating your consumption of alcohol, these are the two most effective ways of controlling the effects of alcohol.

Make this festive season one to remember for the right reasons – stay safe and please don’t become one of our statistics.

Some simple tips from Canterbury Police for safe festive celebrations:

• Plan your night out ahead of time.

Have a plan for how you're going to get home, before you go out.  
• Arrange safe transport to and from your location, whether it's a sober driver, taxi, bus or dial-a-driver.  
• Go out as a group and stay together.

Look out for your mates and make sure they stay safe.  
• Don’t drink to excess – drink water and eat food at regular intervals.  
• Don't drink and drive. Checkpoints will be operating anywhere, any time.
