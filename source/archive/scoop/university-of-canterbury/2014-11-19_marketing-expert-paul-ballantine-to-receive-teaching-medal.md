**Marketing expert Paul Ballantine to receive Canterbury Teaching Medal**

**November 19, 2014**

Marketing expert Associate Professor Paul Ballantine will this week receive the University of Canterbury’s Teaching Medal in recognition of his outstanding achievements and his contribution to the university as a lecturer, supervisor and head of department.

Associate Professor Ballantine will receive the medal at the Chancellor’s dinner and University council’s awards on campus on Friday night.

Professor Michael Hall, a leading international sustainability and tourism researcher, will receive the Research Medal and leading New Zealand communications disorders researcher Maggie-Lee Huckabee will receive the Innovation Medal.

Ballantine’s career has been stellar on all fronts in teaching, research and service. Last year, he was re-appointed unopposed as head of the management, marketing and entrepreneurship department for a second five year term.

Professor Sonia Mazey, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Business and Law) says that apart from his significant research and service commitments, Ballantine remains passionate about undergraduate teaching and invests considerable time and effort into ensuring his 200 and 300 level courses are innovative, research informed, engaging and relevant.

\`\`The consistently high teaching and course survey evaluations obtained by Paul, and the fact that he has been a recipient of earlier college and university level teaching awards bear testimony to his outstanding competence and dedication as a teacher. Paul's student-centred approach to teaching with a strong emphasis on ‘real world’ problem-based learning aligns strongly with the key pillars of learning associated with the UC graduate profile, especially employability and community engagement.

\`\`Paul has progressively refocused the department's research and teaching around three core areas: management, marketing and entrepreneurship. Thanks to Paul’s work, the university has a strong teaching and research profile in marketing, including a distinctive, specialist offering in the area of retail marketing. Paul is one of only two internationally recognised academics in this area in New Zealand,’’ Professor Mazey says.
