Successful first year for University of Canterbury Foundation

The University of Canterbury Foundation has received and been pledged in total $3.5 million in its first full year of operation.

Chairman Dr Susan Wakefield said the year had been very satisfying and successful.

The Foundation received $1.2 million in donations, and secured bequest pledges for a further $1.3 million with an additional $1 million in promised donations for particular projects.

“We have made good progress with raising funds and raising awareness of the Foundation in the community. The other pleasing thing is that we have become an established part of the University scene,” said Dr Wakefield.

“We are helping the University interface with the outside community and we are providing a new aspect of the University for Christchurch and Canterbury.”

Officially launched in September last year, the Foundation is a registered charitable trust, operating independently but retaining a close link to the University. Its primary aim is to provide opportunities for support for, and raise private funds to generate extra resources for education at the University, through donations, bequests, sponsorships and partnerships.

Dr Wakefield said the Foundation had worked on a number of projects during the year, disbursing $175,000. Projects include the establishment of the Canterbury Child Development Research House (which will be officially launched on 9 October), the David Novitz Prize for Philosophy honours students and the Aurora Scholarship in Astronomy.

In June the Foundation established the Gerald Orchard Memorial Fund in memory of the late law professor Gerald Orchard and donations are already approaching $10,000. The money will be used to fund prizes to law students and to further the study of Criminal Law and Evidence at the University.

  
“One of the good things about the Gerald Orchard Fund is that we were able, through a close friend, to discuss it with Professor Orchard so we know what his wishes were,” said Dr Wakefield.

This week the Foundation launches an appeal to raise funds for a fortepiano for the School of Music. Already $20,000 has been donated and a further $40,000 is being sought.

Other projects on the horizon include the enhancement of the Cass Field Station which will require raising $2 million.

“All these projects demonstrate the variety of areas we are working in,” said Dr Wakefield. “We are also actively working on a number of additional projects which will be announced in the coming months.”

The Foundation’s Development Manager, Shelagh Murray, said the Chairman and Board of Trustees had worked extremely hard on behalf of the Foundation. “The success we have had in the first year can be attributed to their enthusiasm and goodwill,” said Ms Murray.

“When the new structure of the University is implemented next year there will be even more opportunities for the Foundation to work in with the University. We are looking forward to another exciting and productive year. ”
