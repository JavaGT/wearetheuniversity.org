Outstanding Canterbury Engineers Honoured

Canterbury University’s Dean of Engineering and Forestry, Associate Professor Alexander Sutherland, has been recognised as being at the top of his profession.

The Institute of Professional Engineers (IPENZ), which represents all engineering disciplines, has made him one of its distinguished fellows for what it describes as an outstanding career.

IPENZ deputy chief executive, John Gardiner, says no more than half a dozen people are made distinguished fellows each year, their work having to be over and above the norm.

“It’s not just for doing a good job. Alex has made a major contribution to New Zealand.

“The strength, quality and stability of the School of Engineering at Canterbury is largely attributable to him,” Mr Gardiner says.

Professor Sutherland was Dean of Engineering from 1987. This year he was made the Dean of Engineering and Forestry after a restructuring of academic departments.

Two other Canterbury University staff and an adjunct professor have also been honoured.

John Mander, a professor of structural engineering, and John Lumsden, projects director at the university’s Centre for Advanced Engineering, have been made fellows of the institute.

IPENZ chief executive, Andrew Cleland, says receiving a fellowship carries substantial prestige.

“It is not a reward for long service or for advancement in seniority with one’s employer, rather it is recognition by IPENZ of the contribution of outstanding individuals.”

Des Bull, who is the Holcim Adjunct Professor of Concrete Design at Canterbury, has won an IPENZ Professional Commitment Award for his ongoing contribution to the engineering profession.

As well as acknowledging the work of academic staff, IPENZ recognises the achievements of engineering students.

Canterbury University’s John Stowers was a finalist in this year’s Student Design Award, for his “Cricket Scorer” project.

The electronic device simplifies the process of scoring a cricket game and provides statistical and analytical information which can be used during and after a cricket match.

ENDS.
