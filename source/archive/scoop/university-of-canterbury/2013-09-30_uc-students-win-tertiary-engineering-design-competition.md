**UC mechanical engineering students win tertiary engineering design competition**

**September 30, 2013**

A University of Canterbury (UC) team of mechanical engineering students have won the annual Australasian tertiary engineering design competition in Sydney.

The team of four undergraduate engineers -  Matthew Purdy (captain), James Francis, Emma Sirett and Guus Jans - received more than $3000 for winning the final of the Warman competition.

A total of 16 teams took part including the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology.

The UC team was so impressive and convincing that it was not required to take part in the run-off final.

Senior lecturer Dr Don Clucas says the UC team won a trophy that means they may require extra baggage in returning to New Zealand. 

\`\`There was an exhaustive process of local competitions to find the best UC mechanical engineering team to send.  This is a spectacular achievement and should be recognised at least as well as any international sporting achievement,’’  Dr Clucas says.

For the engineering design competition the students had to design, build and compete with a device to achieve certain tasks.
