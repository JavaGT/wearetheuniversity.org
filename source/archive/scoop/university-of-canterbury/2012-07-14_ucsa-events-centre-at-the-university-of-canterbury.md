UCSA Events centre at the University of Canterbury
==================================================

**Press Release: [University of Canterbury](https://info.scoop.co.nz/University_of_Canterbury)**

The UCSA Events centre at the University of Canterbury will remain closed over the weekend while investigations into a flooring collapse continue.

No one was injured when an area of floor gave way during a concert on Friday night.

Acting Director of Communications & External Relations, John MacDonald, says the University will consult structural engineers to determine the cause of the incident, which led to the venue being evacuated.

\"We are very thankful that no one was injured. The safety of our students is paramount, and we will need some time to determine what has happened and what we are going to do about it."

It is understood that about 900 people were in the area of the events centre at the time - either inside the building or on the deck outside.

"The building has capacity for up to 1400 people, so it would appear that overcrowding was not an issue. We are very keen to find out what has happened."
