**2010 New Zealand Wine Tourism Survey set for release this July**

Christchurch, New Zealand - 5/7/2010 - The 2010 National Wine Tourism Survey is due to be launched this July. The survey will be sent to all wineries across New Zealand, and is being conducted by the Department of Management at the University of Canterbury as part of a Masters thesis by Tim Baird, under the supervision of Professor C. Michael Hall.

The survey is a follow up to the two previous national wine tourism surveys conducted in 1997 and 2003.This is in order to benchmark changes which have taken place in the industry with respect to wine tourism over the past decade.In particular the current survey will examine winery attitudes towards innovation, the environment, biosecurity and sustainability. Attributes which are important for attracting wine tourists to New Zealand wineries and the current level of knowledge regarding New Zealand wine that these visitors possess will also be examined in the survey.

The 2010 National Wine Tourism Survey will be released via an online link, details of which will be emailed to each individual winery.Those wineries that do not have an online presence will receive their surveys via a hard copy print version in the coming weeks.

Results from previous research have been communicated back to industry via trade journals; presentations at the first and second New Zealand wine tourism conferences; and, in some cases, reports sent directly to wineries.
