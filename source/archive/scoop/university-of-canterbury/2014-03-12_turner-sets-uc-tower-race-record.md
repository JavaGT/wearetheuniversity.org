**Turner sets UC Tower Race record**

**March 12, 2014**

University of Canterbury (UC) student Patrick Turner won UC’s annual Tower Race in record time today.

Turner, the first person to register for the race, the first to sign in today and was in the first wave and was first across the line in record time of 1 minute 29.5 seconds.

The previous record up the 264 steps, 11 floors and around half the James Hight Library building was set by Matt Harris in 2008 with a time of 1 minute 34 seconds.

UC research and innovation staff member Kathryn McLardy was the first woman home in 2min 5.7sec about 14 seconds off the women’s record set by Alicia Evans in 2010.

World ranked New Zealand 800m runner Angie Smit was on the starter’s hooter for the annual race.

Smit, who is a UC student, will compete in the international Sydney Track Classic on Saturday against the world champion Eunice Sum of Kenya.

The inaugural Tower Race was held nine years ago and today’s race was the first since the February 22, 2011 earthquake.
