**Student Volunteer Army swinging into action shovelling – again**

**March 6, 2014**

The University of Canterbury Student Volunteer Army (SVA) has mobilised into action, shovelling mud from this week’s torrential flooding.

SVA president Bridget Williams says they received a call for help today from the Heathcote Valley School.

\`\`They called on us to help clear the streets and paths around the school in the Heathcote Valley so children could get to and from school.

\`\`We’ve been out there today, in one of the hardest-hit parts of Christchurch, just as we did after the earthquakes three years ago. We’ve also had the school students helping us and we have been mentoring them too.

\`\`We’re calling on anyone in Christchurch to help us tomorrow and over the weekend. There’s a lot of mud, rubbish and blocked drains from the storm that needs to be tidied up.

\`\`It’s a big job but we’re keen to help the community and we’re also asking the Christchurch Polytechnic SVA to help us too.

If anyone is interested they can meet us at the University of Canterbury Students’ Association carpark at 9am tomorrow,’’ Williams says.
