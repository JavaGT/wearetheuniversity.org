More Canterbury University students at the bottom of the world

As many as 100 students from the University of Canterbury will spend 10 days in Antarctica, after the signing of a formal agreement with Antarctica New Zealand.

The organisation has made a five-year commitment to the on-ice component of the university’s Graduate Certificate in Antarctic Studies.

Antarctica New Zealand will fly 20 students to the ice each year , and provide them with food, clothing and field work equipment.

The Director of Canterbury University’s Gateway Antarctica programme, Professor Bryan Storey, is delighted.

“This is the first time that we have had a five-year commitment from Antarctica New Zealand which is great news for the course. The on-ice experience makes this trip unique in the world and provides a very valuable training experience for future Antarcticans.”

The chief executive of Antarctica New Zealand, Lou Sanson, says the agreement builds on the relationship his organisation already has with Canterbury University.

“We value our association with Gateway Antarctica’s staff and students and look forward to the relationship going from strength to strength.”

88 students have completed the Antarctic Studies course since it began in 1998.

A recent survey of graduates found more than half of them are currently involved in Antarctic-related work.

“Although I knew the course was fulfilling its objectives, it is great to see this impression backed up by the results of the five year survey,” Professor Storey says.

“We are looking forward to the continued success of the course in future years”.
