**Cutting edge University of Canterbury research at Tasman Glacier**

University of Canterbury geography researchers are at the forefront of using new technology to understand scientific problems at New Zealand’s largest glacier.

They are using a new high-tech remote controlled jet boat to learn more about the processes controlling iceberg calving (breaking off of chunks of ice) and retreat at Tasman Glacier in Aoraki Mt Cook National Park.

Glaciologist Dr Heather Purdie is working with departmental technician Paul Bealing, local guiding company Glacier Explorers and colleagues from the Otago School of Surveying.

“Understanding the configuration of the glacier terminus is important for helping us understand the retreat processes and is of great interest to the local guiding company. At times a ramp of ice can extend out from the terminus below the waterline, which can lead to ice berg calving.

“The remote controlled boat was designed and built in Oxford by Adam Wilton of JetTec Development. The boat has an electric motor and aluminium hull and a top speed of 50 kilometres per hour (kph), although surveys are conducted at a more sedate eight kph,’’ Dr Purdie says.

“We are working closely with local guiding company Glacier Explorers. The jet boat has already been used to survey water depth at the terminal face of the glacier, which is too dangerous to approach in a regular boat.

“The boat is equipped with a deep-water echo-sounder and a high precision global position system. A wireless modem transmits information about location and water depth back to the researchers who can stay on the Glacier Explorers’ boat a safe distance from the face of the glacier.

“Paul uses a first person viewer camera system to control the boat. Depth data gathered by the unmanned jet boat is calibrated against a dual-frequency echo-sounder, supplied and operated by Otago researcher Emily Tidey.

“This summer our team wants to expand the instrumentation on the boat to include sensors that will measure water temperature and water currents.

“Much of what we know about calving glaciers has been developed in marine environments, there is still much to learn about the processes that drive and shape the glaciers that terminate in freshwater environments. The Tasman Lake is more than 200 metres deep.

“I am very interested in what is happening under the water, and this data from the boat will help us calculate ice melt under the water and learn more about how glacial hydrology influences calving retreat. I am expecting to secure a postgraduate student who is keen to work on this exciting project later this year.

“Glacier Explorers are reporting an increase in visitors wanting to come and experience the glacier. Glacier tourism is a multimillion dollar industry in New Zealand. Calving icebergs create a lot of interest so the more we can lean about these processes the better informed the visitors will be,” Dr Purdie says.
