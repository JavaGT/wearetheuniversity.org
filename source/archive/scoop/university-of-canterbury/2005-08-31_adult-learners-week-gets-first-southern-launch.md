Adult Learners’ Week gets first southern launch

  
This year, Christchurch is the launch pad for Adult Learners’ Week 2005 He Tangata Mātauranga celebrations.

It is the first time the national celebration has left Wellington since it was established in New Zealand in 1998 with the goal of raising the profile of adult learning. The national launch of the week, which runs from 5 to 11 September, will be held at the Maori Learning Centre at Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT).

Adult Learners’ Week is a time to focus on and celebrate the efforts, achievements and contribution of adult learners, educators and providers. The theme of the week is “Learning Never Stops — E kore e mutu te ako".

The University of Canterbury will have a programme of activities to celebrate the week, with the highlight being a discussion forum on the topic of adult student issues. The forum on Friday, 9 September, from 1 to 2.30pm in S4 lecture theatre will be open to all students and staff, as well as the local community.

Guest participants on the panel will include MP Lianne Dalziel and Dr Sue Bagshaw. Lianne Dalziel has played an active role in supporting the development of adult student support and services at UC for some years now. Dr Sue Bagshaw is a senior doctor at 198 The Youth Health Trust in Christchurch’s city centre, a former member of the University Council, and a passionate supporter of the “life-long learner”. Prior to the forum there will be an Open Home morning tea at The Family House on Forestry Road from 10am to noon.

The event is aimed particularly at UC staff, to give them the opportunity to have a look around the adult student drop-in centre and meet the members of the Student Services team.

Throughout Adult Learners’ Week there will be an interactive display in the Central Library that will highlight the various forms of adult student involvement on campus, feature profiles of adult students in credit and non-credit programmes, and publicise the services and facilities available to adult students. Staff, students and visitors to campus are also encouraged to find out more about the huge array of short courses offered by the University’s Community Education programme through UC Opportunity.
