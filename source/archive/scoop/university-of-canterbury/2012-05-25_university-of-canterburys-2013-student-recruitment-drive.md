University of Canterbury's 2013 student recruitment drive

**UC launches 2013 student recruitment drive**

This weekend the University of Canterbury will officially launch a bold new marketing campaign as part of its 2013 student recruitment drive, which will include national television advertising and a new red and black visual identity.

Sixty-second and 15-second versions of the television commercial will be broadcast on a range of channels, promoting UC’s academic diversity and its contribution to society. The campaign will also include online and billboard advertising.

Vice-Chancellor Dr Rod Carr says the campaign will be based around provocative “what if” questions. It will be national as, typically, about half UC’s students have come from outside Christchurch.

“We will be incorporating the theme of the campaign into a new free, weekly public lecture series that will be held on campus from next month – to be known as the “What If Wednesday” lectures.”

Another development in the University’s recruitment programme for 2013 is a decision to repeat the entrance scholarships offer to Year 12 and Year 13 secondary school students based on level 2 and level 3 NCEA results or the equivalent.

“Our analysis has shown that the cost to the University of these new scholarships has been just over $1.5 million. Our projections, based on a survey of students who came to UC in 2012 for the first time, show that revenue from tuition fees and Student Achievement Component funding from government for students who choose UC because of the scholarships will, during the course of their studies at UC, draw revenue to UC of at least $4.5 million – a very good return on our investment, especially as these are students more likely to succeed at university,” Dr Carr says.

“I would like to acknowledge the significant amount of work that is being done across the University to help our recovery from the 2010 and 2011 earthquakes. This is a significant period in UC’s history, and it is our job to ensure that we do everything we can to ensure it is not forever limited by its current circumstances.”
