**UC academic hitting the right notes internationally**

A University of Canterbury (UC) composer and music teacher has hit the right notes by being elected to the Executive Committee of the International Society of Contemporary Music (ISCM).

Head of the School of Music, Associate Professor Glenda Keam, is the first New Zealander to be appointed to the Executive Committee ISCM and is the only non-European member of the committee.

The 92-year-old organisation supports the development of music internationally, and encourages networking of composer organisations and sharing of music between cultures and nations.

Professor Keam says she is very pleased and honoured by her appointment.

“It feels important to continue to represent this part of the world, and bring a greater understanding of New Zealand culture and its situation to ISCM as an organisation and to the individuals that constitute the ISCM.”

During her two-year term, Professor Keam hopes to represent the voice of Aotearoa and the Pacific region.

“The organisation has its roots in continental Europe and, as such, it is musically and historically rich, but there are often situations where a perspective from the other side of the globe is useful. We do things differently here, and it’s good to offer that perspective,” she says.

“The increased opportunities to build connections and gain greater understanding of what is happening musically in other countries means that I can help instigate and support creative links with other universities and creative organisations.”

Professor Keam is spearheading plans to bring the ISCM World New Music Days in 2020 to Auckland and Christchurch.

“I am very excited about this possibility - our city will be significantly transformed and it has a remarkable story to tell.”

Professor Keam has also been President of the Composers Association of NZ (CANZ) for the past seven years, CANZ is the national member of ISCM.
